2891,"The Sheraton Chicago is very beautiful with lakefront views and right on the river.  With their recent reconstruction, the insides are stunning and very nicely done. I've attended a conference here and customer service is just fabulous and the food catered in for lunch was pretty good for conference food.  Shula's Steakhouse is also right there which provides for another great food option.  It's super convenient and close by a lot of entertainment, including Navy Pier, AMC River East & Lucky Strike Lanes (bowling) and of course, the Magnificent Mile for your shopping and dining pleasure. Also, this is one of our final two options for holding our wedding reception - Elisa has been a real treat to work with.  Even though we didn't decide to go here for our wedding, Elisa was really fabulous and easy to work with.",N
2087,"I attended a banquet dinner here and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  Easily, one of the better banquet meals I've had in a while.  I tend to steer clear of chicken in fear of having to consume dry tasteless chicken but it was seasoned well and juicy.  The vegetables were fantastic as was the chocolate cheesecake with raspberries.  I would highly recommend hosting an event here.  From what I heard from the host, they were easy to work with and were extremely accommodating.",N
681,"I generally like Marriott properties and this location is no different. When working in Chicago this location is perfectly situated for me.  I have visited the CMMM a few times and hvae usually been pleased, however, my last visit left me a bit disappointed. The a/c in the room was not working and it was unbearably hot. Despite giving maintenance an entire day to sort things out we arrived back to a stifling room on our second night. We managed to get a decent temperature by opening the windows but then had to deal with street sounds all night. I'll give them another chance but if they drop the ball again it will be our last visit.",N
4090,"Earns my enduring praise for reserving their entire hotel for the guys of International Mr. Leather on Memorial Day weekend. And I always love the Big Bar, but please get some stronger air conditioning!",N
3650,"High Tea at The Drake - what a great way to spend a chilly Chicago afternoon.  I haven't been to tea at The Drake in 10 years and not much has changed--the service is still warm and attentive, the tea sandwiches are still yum-yummy and the pastries are still delish.  Now that I'm all growed up, though, I think I would actually rather have another round of sandwiches than any pastries at all--they stole the show for me, especially the little guy with asparagus.  I must remember to include asparagus in more of my sandwich creations!   I think I would take off half a star for the whipped cream with the scones--from a can, Drake?  Really?  I expect more from you.  Even I make my own homemade whipped cream and it doesn't take much.  But alas, the little asparagus sandwich silences any complaints and the soothing harp lilting in the background makes any conversation or group of rapscallions seem more civilized.  Even though I'm pretty sure I was the only rapscallion there. ;) Wear your pearls or wear neat jeans (or both), practice pinkies up and enjoy a pampered afternoon of quiet service and tasty treats.  I will be back--hopefully before another 10 years roll around.",N
3282,This is a long over-due review. My musician friend and I both stayed here... we were treated so well! And we loved the guitar that was propped up on our bed! I loved it here!,N
5178,"Never did I expect to have such an exceptional experience at the Hotel Allegro.  I found the hotel online and booked it because it had the most reasonable rate at the time.I arrived at the hotel before 9:00 AM due to my early morning flight from CT.  I asked the front desk staff about early check in.  Within two hours, I received a call informing me they had a room prepared.  This friendly, professional customer service continued throughout my entire four-day stay - from front desk staff, concierge, restaurant, and housekeeping.  Clearly, there is a commitment to exceed hotel guests' expectations.  One of the front desk staff, Gianna, was exceptional in her responsiveness, knowledge of Chicago, and willingness to assist me with my check-out requests.  Tim was also very helpful with travel arrangements to the airport.  The hotel provides coffee, including iced coffee, in the morning and then offers beer and wine each afternoon at 5:00 PM.  Besides enjoying the beverages, it's so nice to see the lobby full of hotel guests and have an opportunity to talk to other people about the city.  This was probably one of the most enjoyable hotel stays I've ever had, all because the employees were clearly committed to making it that way for all guests.While the actual stay was positive enough, upon completing the hotel's online survey (after I got home) I received a personal email from the general manager, Ryan Kunzer, who thanked me for my survey comments and offered to assist with my future reservations.  I will gladly return to this hotel the next time I am in Chicago, all because people made an effort to let me know they cared about my stay.",Y
1328,"I spent 2 luxurious nights here and I feel a bit odd giving a place like it less than 5 stars. But I have no choice when comparing my experience relative to my high expectations. To begin with, this particular Ritz can't seem to decide whether it's Pottery Barn or Roarin' 20s. Every time I walked from the 1920s bedroom area to the ultramodern bathroom it was like being sucked through a magical time warp. And yet, it took me literally 10 very annoying minutes to figure out how the ""ultramodern"" bathroom's shower worked because the valve's settings were all screwed up. And as for the 1920s aspect of the decor... it's just not my thing. I wouldn't downgrade the hotel by one star just because of that, but I'm just not a fan of the World War I era feel when I have the privilege of spending a few nights in the heart of downtown Chicago (which has quickly become one of my favorite cities in America, by the way). No other complaints whatsoever. The rooms are spacious. The views from my windows were awesome as they included both downtown and part of the lake. The service is top notch. The hotel is so fully-staffed that you can't walk 10 feet without finding someone to help you, which is nice because the hotel is so massive. I ate a few meals over 2 days inside the hotel and they were good (not excellent, but good). The location is of course perfect, if you want to be in the heart of downtown. The closest train stop, which I was adventurous enough to use to arrive from O'Hare, is barely 3 blocks away.",N
4395,Everything but the room was great. I didn't like the room because it was very small. I guess it's because this hotel is old so the rooms have not been refreshed in quite sometime. But lobby and the services the hotel provides are great. ----------------- EDIT: Looks like they did some renovations.. rooms are awesome now.. Definitely a good place.. i upgrade my starts on this,N
2041,"We recently stayed here for my sister's wedding.  The actual wedding reception was nice enough, as was our room.  However, I have never experienced more abominable customer service in my natural life than what we received here. We reserved over the phone because my sister had a block of rooms reserved at a slightly reduced rate for the wedding guests.  I received an email a couple days before, confirming my reservation.  I was in the bridal party, so I was tied up after the ceremony, and left it to my fiancé to check us in.  As we were out taking photos, he called me in a slight panic telling me that the hotel did not have our reservation.  I said they had just sent me an email and to check again. When we arrived back at the hotel, I got in line to see what the issue was and to try to check in.  The woman looked it up again and said she didn't have it.  When I told her about the confirmation email, she said ""We don't do that"" (not true).  She said I would just have to get into my email and get my confirmation number. She then told me that she had a line of people behind me she needed to help, and basically ordered me to leave the front desk area, implying she needed to help her ""real"" customers!! Because of the hotel's crappy internet I could not get online.  My sister, the bride, who had a million other things to worry about, had to track down the hotel wedding planner, who took me into her office to get on my email.  In looking at the reservation, I saw that they had misspelled my last name.  Now, mind you, they had pulled up our reservation block at the desk and were apparently too inept or lazy to glance through the list and find my name- even though it was misspelled, it was only by ONE LETTER!!  There were only about 20 of us in the block, and they didn't even bother to go through the names one at a time to see if I was there. At this point we asked for the manager. We were missing the reception, and were getting pretty upset. He apologized (kind of) and told us he would have a porter bring my fiancé's bags to our room so that we could go and enjoy the reception. Upon returning to our room late that night, we discovered that none of the bags had been brought up as promised!!!  This included valuable items such as a laptop and camera.  We called the front desk and were told that WE would have to come down and get them.   The final straw was that when I had gone down in the morning for brunch (at $20, a total and complete ripoff, but that's where the wedding party was meeting so I had no choice), I asked at the desk if we could have a slightly later checkout time (1:00 instead of noon) because we were still recovering from the night before.  They said sure, no problem, but then at noon ON THE DOT they were banging on our door. I can't even fathom how the service might have been worse.  The only slightly redeeming thing was the wedding planner helping me out- if it hadn't been for her, I don't know how we would have worked anything out.",N
3275,"So... put John Lenon and Yoko on the wall in the bathroom and charge $300/night? I've stayed there probably 4 times now, and the rooms are not all born equals. This time my room was freezing and couldn't turn the heater above 70... I got so cold that I was felt sickish the whole day. Don't expect extra cozy rooms, there are ""stylish"", read super cold design. No extra either... WiFi is $15/day, no bathrobe, nothing extra... just sparse and ""stylish"". If my meetings weren't tight across the street I would choose another place to stay.",N
5751,AWESOME modern feel..  in house restaurant is nice.  bit pricey but expected down town.  did the room and park deal which saved a few bucks at best.  had a corner room that was super small but very stylish so it felt ok.,N
2924,Great location in the middle of many restaurants and shops. The room had a great view of the river. Staff were friendly and helpful too. I deducted a few stars because wifi was $24.95!! The front desk said you could get free wifi in the lobby area but I I was unable to connect to it. For such a large hotel I was surprised that they didn't offer free wifi in the rooms.,N
3946,Three stars for nostalgia's sake because my mother was a former employee of this hotel during the early to mid-1970's. Minus half a star because the story goes that some of the guest's rooms are apparently haunted by ghosts. I don't believe in ghosts but the constant sound of wind blowing past the door plus intermittent faint cries sends shivers down my spine.,N
688,"I have been staying at Marriotts for several years, they have one of the best rewards programs (IMO), so many options to choose from to redeem your points - which is why I stick with them.   Luckily the Courtyard was the hotel selection of choice for this conference, it's a great location - only a couple of blocks way from Michigan Ave, nested on the corner.   The rooms are great, have everything you need, wireless and ethernet connections are free and worked very well.  The decor is up to date, the beds are comfy, and the rooms have plenty of space.   The customer service at the front desk was always helpful and courteous.  The bell hop knew his way around town, he was very reliable in telling me where to go and the best way to get there, and what to watch out for.   Drawbacks:   - the pool is small.  It's square, so no Don Draper laps for you - - sorry! - the Biz Center is in the basement, 3 computers there, but one wasn't working - couldn't get online.  At least the printer worked! - the elevators were slooooow.  I was on the 14th floor, but I think one elevator was out (they have 3) and you have to wait forEVA! But overall it was a great experience, I would definitely stay here again.  The Front Door guy is really cool and helpful.",N
4617,"This hotel had helpful staff that were pleasant and welcoming.  The lobby and rooms were contemporary and trendy.  The rooms were small, but had a nice layout for the space.  I loved the brand of amenities in the shower & was hoping to snag some before leaving. The parking is across the street, but I would still recommend doing it yourself, even though they have valet. I would come back here again if in the area.",N
2963,"I had a nice stay here. They greet you with candy while you wait in line to register. Awesome. The room and bathroom are nice, and they gave me a nice view, can't complain about that. I ordered some chocolate cake thing for room service and it was aweeesomeee.  After a long night out, my friends and I came back to the hotel and went into the lounge room. They have a massage chair, loved it, internet, tv, food, and a nice view of the city. I just can't think of something bad about it. It was a very nice stay at the Sheraton.",N
5259,"This place deserves a five star rating for being the best place in the city for you average working man with a family. First off, it has FREE parking right outside the door in their own lot!!, and this is a $50 savings per night. Super friendly and helpful staff. Great pizza right here in the hotel. Try the Marina if you love seafood. Great location. This is now my second stay here and I will not even think about staying anywhere else. Best Western River North is a Great Family Hotel. Sure, you will find fancier places, but it is good, clean, and downright a good place!! McDonalds is across the street. Starbucks-2 blocks down as well as a Jewel Osco Store for food, snacks, pop, etc.",Y
5131,What a gorgeous hotel!  I had a friend in this weekend and they stayed here and it was great!  The lobby is really pretty and the people there are so nice.  This is definitely a place I'll tell out of towners to stay at!,Y
4665,"http://Hotels.com was $134/night.  I called the hotel and asked them what a rate would be and I averaged $108/night.  It always pays to call the hotel directly. The room was small but I really didn't care.  I'm hear for business and a hotel is generally a place to relax and sleep after meetings.  I'm not moving in!  It was very clean, the vibe was young, hip and the front desk service, cleaning staff and guys out front were STELLAR. The young lady who I checked in with, Noemi(spelling?) was very cordial and VERY HOT! I'll be back in Chicago several times over the next 6 months and I plan to stay at Hotel Felix again.  Oh yeah!  FREE WIFI!  That was awesome.  What a great touch.  So many hotels charge from $10 - 30/day which i ridiculous!!  Free wifi is awesome!",N
2245,"Overall, this is a good hotel with an awesome, transit-convenient location.  My 3-day bus pass got plenty of use because of all the buses that stop near this hotel.  We got a great deal on Hotwire for a 3 night stay, which is definitely the way to go.  The major issue was the stupid fan/venting system that would not turn off!  They had a digital thermostat in the room to control the temperature, but even if you turned it ""off"" the vent just keeping running. LOUDLY. As in, 2 of the 3 nights were miserable because there was no sleeping to be had.  Yes, we should have asked the front desk, but the first night I had no idea it wouldn't turn off, the second night I was so exhausted that I just passed out, and the third night we asked the room service guy who said he could call engineering after unsuccessfully trying to turn that damn fan off.  Sigh.  But the room was clean, the bathroom was nice, and everyone we dealt with were super helpful.  One weird thing: They have a little basket of snacks atop the minibar for sale, and mixed in with that, is an ""Intimacy Kit."" I don't know why, but I was a little creeped out by condoms/lube sitting in between snickers and doritos.",N
1410,"The best 12th Night party in 105 Years (Jan 29th)... Thanks Knickerbocker! Our group had a beautiful suite with a bathroom that was almost as big as the living room. The party was wonderful, the staff fun and friendly as 300 costumed, crazy-people took over their hotel. The bars were serving hurricanes which helped to fill the lighted-up-disco-dance-floor. We had a great time. Hopefully, they'll let us come back next year.",N
5313,"I really had the worst experience of my life at this hotel. Before booking, I checked the ratings on Yelp and they were very good. BUT DO NOT BELIEVE YELP!! I went there with 4 friends and we had booked 2 rooms with 2 queen beds or 1 king bed. But they gave us just 1 queen bed in both the rooms. We asked the front desk employee (Barbara) to give us a room that we asked for or compensate. But she was very rude and said she does not have anything for the entire weekend and we have to accomodate in whatever room we are getting. Then we asked for the manager (Shannon) who was not available at the time. We asked them to have her call us back but she didnt for 2 days. Then again I went at the time Shannon was present. She was ruder than Barabara. She told me told me that she does not want to talk to us and asked us to go back to our room. Jeremy, Shannon's manager also didn't call us after leaving several messages. We were here for 3 nights and for all the 3 nights we ended up staying in the 1 queen bed rooms. Everybody was really rude. To top it, the hotel is really dated with dated and stinky rooms. I WOULD NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL!",Y
848,"This place and http://hotels.com totally screwed me. Booked and paid for room Oct. 12 and received confirmation. Got e-mail 6 p.m. on Nov. 15, the date I had booked, saying there was a problem. http://Hotels.com said Silversmith had overbooked. Both Silversmith and http://hotels.com said they would help find another room. Never heard back from Silversmith; http://hotels.com said closest is 30 miles. I have a meeting 2 blocks from Silversmith at 8:30 a.m. tomorrow. No car, unfamiliar with transit system. Will never ever do business with either again. Anyone who does risks same treatment.",N
4512,"There's no Chicago luxe like late 19th century Chicago luxe. Because of it's uniqueness, beauty, and proximity to the Shedd Aquarium, we selected the Palmer House for our wedding weekend room block. I had been to the Palmer House for fabulous and fun events before, but never before stayed there. The special events staff is very easy to work with and quick to reply to emails. It seemed like our event kept changing hands, but that everyone seemed to know what was going on. We kept adding guests after our rate had supposedly ended, and they did it without fuss. One of those rooms was a room for me for Friday night, a reservation which I made myself with the special events manager. First impressions arriving were pretty good. If you are not valeting a car (which is really expensive) that needs to stand for about 10 minutes while you unload, I would highly recommend entering on the Monroe and NOT the Wabash side. The L passing overhead on Wabash is deafening. The porters brought out two carts to carry our suitcases and 6 dresses (for my mom, sister, and I for the rehearsal and the wedding). They told us to check in and get comfortable and they would bring it right up. They did, which was great service. Now when my sister and I got to the room, I was shocked to see how tiny it was.This was one of the older, not rehabbed rooms.  I mean, I know it's an old hotel, but still! I was calling as the bride for a 60-room wedding block and that was the best they had? I ended up hanging my dress from the air conditioning vent because the closet wasn't big enough for it, and we had to move it over like a curtain to exit the room. In terms of sleeping, I thought that the mattress in the room was too soft. You may think I was being a princess on the room size, but I definitely was not. The next morning, my sister/maid of honor forced me to ""sleep in"" (awoke at 5:30am -- sleep fail), and then she ordered us room service. When the server arrived, he said, ""Good morning -- wow, this is a small room!"" THAT's how you know it's a small room -- when the man who has probably seen half the hotel and who is probably coached on making you feel like a welcomed guest comments on it! Anyway, the deluxe oatmeal my sister got us was very good.   That afternoon, we checked into a suite. Wooooooooohooooo! Talk about an upgrade! For about twice the price, we got five times the space: two bathrooms, a master bedroom, a dining room, a full desk, a living room/TV space, and a half kitchen. It was completely redone, as was the entire 10th floor. It was the perfect space to cyclone through before your big day -- shoes all over the floor, flower boxes, bobby pins flying everywhere. That suite could handle it. I slept like a rock in there. The regular rooms being cleaned that I peeked into while going down the hallways also looked very nice. If you have the cash or are willing to splurge for a special occasion, I say do it! The rich, ornate lobby and city streets that surround the Palmer House are gorgeous and perfect for touring, entertainment, and for photography. The lobby bar serves some very good drinks, including a seriously decked-out Bloody Mary. One thing about the lobby bar though -- the bartenders were pretty creepy to me. Another friend described them as total jerks. We had reserved a separate suite for the wedding after-party, and that purpose was expressly communicated to the Palmer House. The hotel failed to move one very ornery guest next door to the suite who was complaining at 4pm about noise coming from the suite when 6 friends were watching a football game. So we knew there was going to be trouble later. Sure enough, at 1:00am when our guests come back, there's a knock on the door. 3 hotel staff tell us we have to stop. My husband flatly and loudly tells them that that's not a solution we'll accept because they knew the purpose of the room and they knew this guest who was complaining was a problem earlier. I also reminded them about the business we're driving to the hotel. Eventually, one of the staff persons gets the brilliant idea to take us down to one of the party/conference rooms on the lower level of the hotel.  Way to problem solve! We pick up all the champagne and music and follow him, and the party merrily continued on until 5:30am (sans me and Alex). The next morning, we had a nice farewell breakfast at the hotel. I would avoid anything on biscuits -- they were too buttery or something. The texture was off. We continued to lounge around in the hotel lobby with friends and family for about 2 hours after we checked out without hassle. Friends of ours who were staying in Chicago for several days but had checked out of the Palmer House that morning were able to leave their bags with the front desk for at least 24 hours.",N
2914,"The Sheraton is a great value for a nice hotel in downtown Chicago! The rooms here are comfortable and nice (especially for the price in downtown Chicago!). They are in need of an upgrade, though when this happens the price will go up considerably. The Sheraton has a great view of the Lake, the river, and the city. It's a wonderful location. You are in between the south and north Michigan Avenue, which means that you'll be a comfortable walking distance from suh attractions as the Art Institute and Millenium Park on the south end of Michigan... and the Magnificent Mile and the Watertower on the north end of Michigan. I do not recommend the food here. We had brunch one morning and the price was outrageous and the food below par. There are so many great restaurants in the area... just don't eat here!",N
2731,I haven't stayed at the James Hotel but I've been there for a few events and it is a wonderful hotel.  It's extremely stylish and has a very modern feel to it.  The staff is very helpful and they are very accomodating- especially for private parties/events.  I have heard that the guest rooms are very nice too and if you have the chance to stay here you definitely should!,N
4814,"The Wit is a high priced JOKE!!!  The only thing that partly redeemed my total opinion were the HOPS!!  No microwaves???? Really???  The cheapest hotels have them, why not the WIT??  I attended a Wedding and stayed at the Wit, I should have stayed somewhere else!  I was SOOO, not impressed, and will never stay there again, even if it's free!  More like Dim Wits!!!",Y
22,"Stayed here over the Jan 15th weekend.  The location is perfect! Close to Michigan Avenue, train and of course Giordano's. Inviting entrance to the hotel with a canopy with heat lamps when you walk up. The elevator is small and a little rickety but it does the job. I would bring your own towels as the hotel ones are a bit scratchy. Didn't encounter the hotel staff much, just at check in/out -they were polite.  I would stay again when in town.",N
216,"What a cute place! I was completely caught off guard by this classy, boutique hotel nestled in the Chicago Gold Coast. And speaking of coasts, this place had an uncanny resemblance to Alexander's Guesthouse on Key West. Hotel Indigo was VERY beachy, but also quite classy. Backwards script discussed ""phi"" along the walls (luckily, I can read backwards), which I thought looked cool but was weird (why was it backwards?). We approached the counter and the two men stayed near the back and glanced at us with a silent question in their facial expressions. ""Can we check in?"" That's when they jumped to attention. Weird that they didn't make the first move. The entry area to our room was the best. There was a small foyer area with a long table and mirror. To the right was our bathroom and the bedroom was to the left. The floors were ""wooden,"" and the walls were a pretty periwinkle with green accents. One wall had enlarged pictures of mussles. The view from our window was to a fire-escape with a brick wall beyond (not the beach I expected). Other things to note: - Aveda soaps/lotions/shampoo - comfortable bed - tube tv - unpopulated bar - breakfast place also seemed unpopular (there's a great breakfast place just two doors north of the hotel) - free wifi - we could hear other guests down the hall, but not loud enough to be bothersome",N
1960,"The W hotel is located right in the middle of the Chicago city.  It is near all the famous locations.  Its walking distance to Navy Pier, the Water Tower shopping mall, and the Buckingham Fountain.  The W hotelhas to be the best hotel in Chicago.  Just from the exterior you can see how amazing it is.  The hotel shines at night in blue lights.",N
5557,"We had a great stay at La Quinta Inn! We got our room for $120/night on Priceline (for 2 double beds) and were impressed with the modern and stylish look of the decor. The bathroom was great- amazing glass shower with plenty of room for two people. We had a flat screen TV, free Wi-Fi, desk, and a great view of Chicago skyscrapers. The beds and linens were extremely comfortable! The room was quiet- we never heard our neighbors. We appreciated that the front desk staff asked us to show our room keys before entering the elevator ever time we got back to the hotel. I imagine this keeps out the ""riff-raff"". The complimentary breakfast was sooo good- waffles, bacon, sausage, eggs, bagels, cereal, etc. All of the staff we came into contact with were polite and friendly, especially the breakfast room staff. It was a very comfortable stay in a stylish place.",N
1576,"Even though I live in Chicago, I thought a night away from the house on Valentine's would be romantic.  I chose the Hotel 71 for the proximity to the restaurant we were having dinner at, the price and the view of the Chicago River.   The rate of the room was very competitive for the area ($169/night) and the view of the river was great, but I was very underwhelmed with the room overall.   Its my understanding that they are in the middle of renovations and our room had not yet been upgraded and it was VERY obvious.  The porcelain in the tub was peeling, the closet door was off the hinges, and there was a gaping whole in the entertainment center where we expected the minibar to be.   The overall decor of the room is also the antithesis of romantic.  The comforter and curtains are an ugly brown gingham and they clashed terribly with the leopard-print sofa, which would have been awful all on its own. Service was also lacking.  The bar was small and indescript.  There was no ice bucket in the room and we had to call down for one.  And though the hotel seemed far from full, we were given a room RIGHT NEXT to the elevator. This hotel would be sufficient for a business traveler on a budget, as its near The Loop and the Magnificent Mile. But it is NOT a good selection for a romantic getaway.",N
3419,"Came to visit Chicago for the first time for pleasure (actually celebrating Nana's 90th birthday) and the last night in Chicago-  I got to stay at The Allerton Hotel. The family heard that I love to shop which made this hotel perfect because its near everything which is great! It's on Magnificent Mile. Upon entering into the hotel, I was greeted with friendly customer service and the decor in the hotel was really nice. When I checked in, went to my room... I was stun on how spacious my room was. I thought it might be small but it was pretty nice size. This hotel might be my favorite place to stay when I visit Chicago. Love everything about this place. Two thumbs up!!!",N
303,"Being a bridesmaid is a rough life.  Drinking, party games, pretty dresses... I know, I know... you should all cry for me.  There are some hard parts, including staying in a hotel in your own city which boggles the mind a bit, but with a lot of out of town ladies, you roll with the punches and have a blast.   The lobby was small and odd, and for some reason the glass case full of examples of minibar goods cracked me up, but the stay was really a pretty good one.  Our room was big enough for five overnight ladies and a few other pre-dinner party game participants and all the gifts and luggage, and other junk that comes along with a mostly out of town bridal party.   There were many nice touches from the bellman's offer of wine glasses when he noticed we had champagne with us, to the heated bathroom floor, to the extra mini-fridge, not just a minibar full of overpriced crap.  The other great thing was the free continental breakfast which was perfect as we had a long day ahead of us, and many hours before the rehearsal luncheon.   We chose this place for its proximity to our other bachelorette destination and the comparably reasonable prices.  I'd recommend it to people trying to avoid the hubbub and high prices of downtown.",N
4662,"I will start out by saying what I liked about this hotel. The room was cheap, location pretty good and the staff is very friendly. The staff was almost too friendly. Also, if you end up drinking the water in the room, it's only $2.50 and has an eco-friendly bottle. The most annoying thing I found in my room was the bed. It's lifted on this big and bulky wood thing so you can have drawers underneath. The corner of this bed frame closest to the window is a nightmare. I can't tell you how many times I banged my knee into that thing. I spent many a time biting my tongue after one of those impacts. The sinks are ridic. It's like someone decided they wanted a hotel built very quickly and went to find some chic wholesale sinks and got a deal on these crappy ones. FYI, you will touch the sink basin while washing your hands. You have better options if you want a boutique hotel in Chicago. I'd try the Talbot or the Dana...",N
4119,"I have stayed here multiple times thanks to Hotwire.  It is traditionally a conference center, but this is a great budget stay for people wanting to be on Michigan Ave.  Great views of the river, the longest bar in America, and great location make this a good stay.  There are two separate wings so remember which one you are staying in. Overall a great experience, but can be overwhelming for some due to its size.",N

2158,"Classy hotel. Standard room w/ 2 double beds. City view. 25th floor. Shopping to the left and right and everywhere in between. Just step outside! What made me fall in love? The historic POOL. I made it a point to buy a bikini before I arrived. It was mighty chilly outside and this Cali girl seriously hates being cold, but the indoor pool was marvelous!! Can't wait to come back!",N
5423,"What a wonderful place!! I plan on going back when ever possiable. All the room are really nice and spacious, you are denfinatly not going to a Holiday Inn. The front desk staff were so friendly and accomidating. Every time we asked for somthing they had the answer and a map to go along with it.  Great place, I highly recomend it!",Y
1267,"Slowest. Brunch. Ever. When Yolk up the street had a 45-minute wait for Sunday brunch, I opted to come here with my parents, who were in town for the weekend. When we were first seated, alarm bells should have gone off when we had to repeatedly flag down the wait staff for coffee. Matters did not improve by the time we ordered. It took almost an hour for our dishes--not complex to begin with, think oatmeal, scrambled eggs, and fruit-- to reach the table. Although the prices are reasonable and the place was not crowded, do not let these facts lull you into thinking that the service will be fast.",N
5716,"This was an interesting hotel.  Had some definite pluses and had some question marks that made me keep it from giving it 4 stars. Stayed there for four nights.  Definite plus was the availability of free laundry on the 10th floor.  Would have been better if one of the dryers wasn't broken because that meant two washers trying to dry in one drier.  Luckily only one other person was doing laundry so it was something that could be accomplished. The water bottles and water was a nice touch.  I preferred getting a large water bottle and filling that one.   I didn't try the work out room so I can't say anything about it. Location is fantastic.  Easy to get to the loop and therefore access to all the trains. If anything is an issue expect the front desk to deal with it quickly.  Now that is the issue.  One would not expect things to go wrong all that often, but they do but on the plus side they are dealt with quickly. But it's the little things. No hair drier -- one supplied.  Room said to have a 'kitchenette' -- well one person's kitchenette is another person's fridge and microwave - no plates or utensils or.....  Bathroom supplies not replenished, but if you ask they are there.  Then the A/C broke.  Tried to explain that it wasn't the thermostat but was the compressor but we had to go through the steps of replacing the batteries in the thermostat and allowing it to fail to fix the problem.  Kind of like calling India when your computer has a failure code.  Follow the script.  But there was a new room supplied, not exactly the same but close.  And they said they would move us from one room to the other but that wasn't done but I didn't care because then I knew it was done correctly. Overall, if you can get a great price then try the place but I rate it comparable to the SpringHill Suites (River North) or the Holiday Inn (Merchandise Mart).  If you can get Residence Inn (either downtown) then I would select those. As I said, if something is wrong expect it to be resolved quickly but there are so many things that were off I cannot give it four stars.",N
4740,Chicago was  magnificent city could have been more enjoyable if i had not stayed at the hotel felix for a couple nightts .. rooms where the size of a tv box and got charged through the roof for them me and my gf stopped by the dana hotel and spa and asked what there rates were and it was 75$ cheaper  sooo  since we only booked there for a couple days we stayed got nasty room service from the elate restaurant stayed up all night because of the paper thin walls and loud elevator and then went on over to the dana and made up for it,Y
1142,"Love this place! Spent my birthday weekend with my friends here. They gave us a really nice room on the 31st floor with a really rad view. The rooms were very nice and comfortable. The staff was outstanding. They gave us an empty mini fridge to store our drinks and food in for the weekend. The valet even told us a cheaper garage to park at for the weekend that was very close to the hotel. The bathroom was perfect for 4 girls to share it. Lots of mirrors, separate shower and bath and lots of lighting. Very close to Millennium Park which was great for the St. Patrick's Day parade. Great hotel!",N
1225,"Stayed here for a conference being held at McCormick Place recently. The people were wonderful, the room was lovely, great view of Lake Michigan, and very convenient for the convention center. Check in was easy, but on the third day I checked my credit card and realized they made a mistake. They were charging me per night even though I had prepaid. I was worried it would be a hassle, but a quick trip to the front desk and they took care of it right away. There is a restaurant on the main level, an Italian carry-out type place and little ""coffee shop"" called the Daily Grind. The ""lounge"" advertised is not really all that. It is simply a more bar type extension of the restaurant. I did like that there were seating areas, with mini coffee tables all around the area of the restaurant and coffee shop on the main level. Also, free wi-fi not only in the rooms but throughout the hotel and the convention center. Made things much easier. Gym was awesome with another great lake Michigan view. Overall nice experience.",N
3173,The W hotel is one of my favorites. I stayed there recently and the WOW service there did an amazing job for me. The rooms are modern yet comfortable. They have amazing views of the lake. The only thing that sucked is the pool was being remodeled. The Whiskey Sky is great for pre partying drinks. Definitely recommend it.,N
2667,"You gotta love this boutique hotel.  I do!  And even though I live close enough to drive home- I've had the chance to stay here a few times and each time is better than the last. The service is impeccable.  From checking in, to check out- everything is about you, the customer and I love that!   The last time I was there, they were out of standard rooms (so sad) and had to upgrade me to what they call a ""loft"" room.  Truly lovely- with a separate sitting area with plasma tv, bar area and a bed that I couldn't seem to leave!  Anyone know what is the maximum number of pillows that can be on a bed? As for having everything I wanted?  Let's see . . .the rooms are stocked with Kiehl's products (nice), the J Bar is cool and contemporary and a great place to people watch, room service comes on time and the food is hot, and the bellmen must be trained to notice if you have everything you want and if you don't- they run and get it.  Pretty nice. Ahh . . . .I'm thinking of moving in.  Now if only I could find someone to pay for it!",N
5451,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for our night out in the city to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary a few weeks ago and had a great experience!! Check-in at the hotel was easy and smooth.  When we got up to our room we were SHOCKED to discover we had been upgraded to a penthouse from a regular king room (lucky break for a couple celebrating their anniversary!) The room was bright, clean, and well furnished.  It is clear that the hotel will be in need of renovations within the next few years but it was still a lovely room and for the price, it was more than was expected. Our only complaint would be that our neighbords were playing their music VERY loudly in the middle of the night and we could hear it almost clear as day.  However, we called the front desk and security had handled the situation within 10 minutes. Overall, good experience and would stay here again.",N
5322,MAN do I hate this hotel. This place told my friend that he didn't have a reservation even though he was HOLDING THE CONFIRMATION. Amazing. Absolutely amazing. Don't stay here. They can't tell their @$$ from their elbows.,Y
5198,"When I first stayed here 2 years ago, I would have given Hotel 71 a solid 4 stars, but now they get 2.5.  It has all the signs of a property they have stopped investing in.  I was under the impression 2 years ago that all the rooms would be renovated. I guess that is not the case. I switched out of the first room, because it was one of the old ones and during my last half-dozen visits, I stayed in the newer ones. The rooms are still nice and spacious, but they are not up keeping them.  There are dings in the furniture. outdated sound system. There was only one bar of soap in the bathroom, and the cool ""rain forest"" shower head was corroded and the awesome big shower reeked of mildew and bleach. Worst of all, when I came back to the room today the door was wide open. I guess housekeeping forgot to shut it. This has been my go to hotel for Chicago travel, but I am going to look elsewhere next time.",Y
166,"Mom stayed here on one of her visits and she LOVED it.  View of the Hancock.  She found the location exceptionally convenient.  We had a car and driver at our disposal - scheduled times.  Everyone was authentically friendly, but ultimately service-oriented and elegantly mannered.  I brought flowers for her and the maid went out of her way to find a bottle/vase for us which worked out perfectly.  I sometimes wonder if real service still exists in this modern and too egalitarian society (meaning disrespectful and/or just poor or absent etiquette) and then I think of the Whitehall.  Hats off.  I suggest setting up your parents here if they like a smaller-scale more personable hotel, someone who remembers what real service is, or anyone you wish to especially impress in subtle and quiet ways without having to choose the modern and massive usual suspects.",N
2796,"This review comes to you, live, directly from my smelly, uncomfortable, and loud as hell, suite. I don't know where to start. The usual culprit of rude and obnoxious staff? The barging in of some staff members this morning while I was in the shower, to ""update my TV,"" despite the privacy lock being on. (The prelude to this incident was yesterday, when the maid continually knocked on my door while the do not disturb hanger was on the knob, and again the privacy lock was on, to interrupt a much needed nap, to ask me if I wanted a bag of ice). How about the extremely loud atmosphere, which includes the loud waterfall in the lobby? The fact that you can't walk to the elevator without a bloody housekeeping cart in the way? My room had a lovely view of the parking garage, which isn't horrible, since it IS Chicago and is surrounded by structures, but I was told the hotel was fully booked, and no other room was open by the extremely helpful and competent clerk. Come to find out that the hotel was almost completely open and the night manager didn't know why the clerk earlier had told me they were booked. This hotel has just been an awful experience from the get go. I have stayed at Embassy Suites Lakefront once or twice, and it was okay, but this one is not impressive at all. I would avoid this one. Stay at a Marriott hotel instead! This is pretty much just a glorified Motel 6.",N
41,"For the love of God, whatever you do, DO NOT take room 307.  Suffice it to say that I would rather set my hair on fire than spend two minutes in that room.  Shudder!  After asking for another room, was pleased with what I got.  The decor is a bit ""Quacker Factory-ish"" ala dried floral wreath, plaid pillow shams, etc. but overall, the room was clean, the bed comfy and the housekeeper..the nicest person I have ever met in a hotel!!  The hotel is a bit older but you cannot beat the location.  Enjoy the room for what it is, a place to sleep whilst in Chicago.  Enjoy!",N
3077,"My hubby and I came to the windy city last year for a long weekend - to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary.  We had heard a lot of good stuff about the W Lakeshore, so thought we'd give it a go! Overall, we were very satisfied with our stay.  The staff was friendly and welcoming.  Our room was modern and clean.  The bed was so comfy.  We had an amazing waterfront view overlooking the Navy Pier, which was lovely!  For all the amenities, this place is very reasonable.  It's also conveniently located within walking distance of many of Chicago's main attractions. We didn't take advantage of going to any of the bars / lounges within the W as we had a lot of other plans for the weekend already, but we did eat breakfast twice at the Wave restaurant downstairs.  The food and service were both excellent! The reason I'm giving this place only 4 stars and not 5 is that the bar seems to attract a rather noisy, trashy ""Vegas-y"" element at night, which I could have done without. We did take advantage of the spa services at the Bliss Spa located in the hotel, which was heavenly! Thank you W Lakeshore - I'll definitely be back!",N
1829,"First, I have to admit I love the vibe at W hotels. The changing lighting in the elevators and the house music (this is Chicago, after all!) in the lobby suits me just fine. Last time I stayed, I discovered I forgot my computer mouse. I popped down to the front desk (hidden in the back left of the lobby) and asked where the nearest store was so I could buy a new one. The clerk said, ""Hey, we'll just get you one and bring it to your room!"" Just like that! And, they did, in 5 minutes! I of course returned it when I checked out. It's the small things that really make service stand out for me. I've had room service here and the service and quality were on par with W's all over. I recommend staying here if you need to be downtown, and you ""need"" a place above the average, generic chain. I ""need"" to stay at the W, every time I visit Chicago...",N
3460,"Couldn't be happier! My husband and I were married on 09-10-11 and we had our reception at the Allerton Hotel on the 23rd floor in the Tip Top Tap room. What a Beautiful space with stunning views, delicious food, and Exceptional service! Would do it all again, at the Allerton, and wouldn't change a thing! The hotel is filled with charm and possess a true Chicago vibe. As soon as you arrive you are greeted by an attentive valet staff and helpful doormen. The front desk staff was a little slow, but cheerful nonetheless. The lobby bar is filled with plush seating and Delicious drinks...all of this before you're in the unique hotel rooms. The suites we were given, as well as our parents, were absolutely amazing! And Huge..a gigantic bathroom (large enough to have three bridesmaids admiring themselves in the mirror at the same time), a king size bed in a bedroom also containing a couch, flat screen, and lounge chair..attached to the bedroom was the entertaining space with another couch, two chairs, mini bar, tv, and desk. Not to mention the complimentary champagne and fresh fruit sent to the room:) The evening of our  reception was indescribable! The reception space was so elegantly set-up with a dance floor large enough to accommodate all of our 125 guests with ease. The bartenders were ""on their game"", the service staff was exceptional and the head server, bar manager, and catering manager are phenomenal..consistently checking on us and offering to retrieve anything we may need. Booking our wedding at such a historical landmark was what drew us to the Allerton but working with their magnificent staff is what provided us with that ""Wow"" factor. All of our friends and family are still raving to us about the Allerton and so we wanted to pass the beauty of our experience on to other people considering the Allerton for their event. We believe there is no competition and no better choice. We give the Allerton five stars for decor, location, food, drink, service, and overall experience. The Allerton= Pure Satisfaction.",N
1009,"This is a very nice hotel in a central location for a decent price! I just returned from my thanskgiving holiday in Chicago and was very happy there. Staff are friendly, the rooms are clean and the free extras are great: free breakfast, free internet, free cocktails and antipasti in the lounge on the sixth floor, and every room has a collection of jazz and soul music that you can play over the dvd player. It is a five minute walk to the Magnificent Mile and a very nice 15 Minute walk to Millenium Park. I loved Chicago, and this hotel was part of my experience - a real deal for what it has to offer.",N
2548,"I was there for the Black/White party that someone else's review mentioned, if not for that I doubt I would have even thought there might be anything over here.  We paid a $10 cover for an hour of free Absolut drinks, but much to our surprise after the special was over... $11 for a vodka soda?  We didn't stay long. Very cool decor, especially the freezer doors and nude photography on the walls, but this place sure think's they're big shit. Come on.  It's not like there's a shortage of ""upscale"" nightspots in Chicago. If this place wasn't a pain in the ass to get to (Hello, this is a Transit-oriented city!) and/or was in a neighborhood that didn't always smell like rotting meat/produce, you might be able to pull it off.  As is, you're only getting 2 stars because of the decor.",N
4442,"It has its strengths and weaknesses. -The lobby/lounge is stunning! Brightly lit, classic luxury decor. As you wait in line to check in they even give you free little brownie bites that will melt in your mouth! - Attentive staff, ask and ye shall receive thy hotels offerings - decent room service, eggs any style with toast n' coffee - a snazzy Starbucks near the central lounge - private elevators for executive level guests - good concierge - central location in downtown The Not-so-Great's; - you can seriously get lost in this hotel! Honestly if there were a giant fire your screwed! - $18 dollar-a-day internet - Its an older hotel, lets call it ''old class charm'' - teeny bathrooms with zero counter space. In all, I loved simply wandering about the hotel, guests shuffling in and out, classy lounge, it never gets boring! It also is in a pretty sweet spot of Chicago so stepping right out into the city was fantastic. I think if we stayed here again, it would be be in a larger room but overall a definite memorable stay!",N
2582,"So my friends and I have been going to Victor for years was nice at first but recently has taken a bit of a downturn. Tried to go there for a friends birthday party last Saturday and they turned one of our friends down because he had neck tattoos, supposedly saying it wasn't ""that type of crowd"" aka no people of color tonight. This place was already on a downward spiral but definitely won't be going back & wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.",N
4210,"I attended a conference in Chicago last year and the Hyatt was one of the conference hotels. Because of the Hyatt name, there was no decision to make; of course, I would stay at the Hyatt. When we arrived, check in was easy and the staff offered us the opportunity to upgrade our room to a Deluxe room. At only $15.00 more night, I thought the amenities definitely sounded worth it. When I initially entered my room, I was impressed by the design and concept. It had an Oriental feel to it and reminded me of some of the boutique type hotels I have stayed in the past. I noticed on the surface that the room was rather dirty. When I sat down at the desk, the leather placemat was very sticky. On the bathroom vanity, there were numerous soap type stains. I was able to easy rub them off with a damp washcloth. The walls were dirty, both in the bathroom and bedroom. Both the carpet and the bedspread on my bed had cigarette burns on them. This was rather surprising since I was in a non-smoking room. The carpet was more understandable, but I was surprised that a bedspread with two burns on it would be used. I also noticed that the ""plush bathrobes"" promised by the check-in staff was not in the room. I called to have a robe delivered and when I put it on the next morning, it had a big rip in the front of it. I had dinner out, came back to the room and put on my pajamas. I was a bit disappointed that we did not get the ""turn down service"" we were promised. It something I enjoy while traveling and makes me feel a bit pampered. I pulled back the bedspread and noticed much debris on the sheet. Initially, I tried to brush the sheet off, but on further inspection, I noticed there were at least five hairs on the sheets. It was really disgusting. I did contact housekeeping and the sheets were changed by a very nice woman named Sarah. She did have much difficulty finding sheets that were not torn. After 20 minutes, I told her I didn't care if they were torn; I just wanted them to be clean. She did replace the burnt bedspread and apologized that it was used. I also did not receive the daily newspaper. I did call and re-request the turndown service the next night; I received it on night #2, but not #3. I suppose overall I was very disappointed by the room that I received. I did call to complain several times (robe, turn down service, dirty sheets) but no one seemed too concerned about me. I don't know if I should have pursued it more while I was there, I felt like I was being too picky, but when I got home, my husband thought the room sounded terrible.",N
3063,"Even though I live in Chicago, I stayed at the W Lakeshore just to get away from it all. The decor is modern, sleek and inviting. When I arrived for check-in, there was a mob in the lobby.  I had made my reservations weeks in advance and was given a check in time of 3pm, yet my room was not ready until nearly 5:30!  It seemed that a lot of people had the same dilemma as we all crammed together sipping complimentary tea and champagne that the staffers provided to keep us calm. In the meantime, I had a massage at the Bliss Spa on the upper floor, which was very nice. When I finally got to the room, it was nice and warm and had new-age chill-out music playing. Did I mention that this new-age chill-out music plays everywhere , 24/7 at the W? It can become more grating than calming. The room had a great view, the beds were comfy and the bathroom was cool and well stocked with Bliss spa products. Had I been staying with multiple people the shuttered window to the bathroom might not have given enough privacy. I didn't have room service because it was pretty pricey, but I guess that's the point! Overall, W is a nice, hip place to stay. One star off for the check-in flub.",N
2322,"This place was ranking high on my favorite full-service Marriott's until the last evening....get this, they don't turn the heat on until it's in the 40s outside.  Chicago, rainy, cold, windy, whatever...and 53 degrees at 5PM and I get told they won't be turning the heat on for the evening, and that they suggest to turn off all ""heat"" buttons on our in room fan because that will just blow cold air.  Would you ever think to ask if a hotel had heat?? I wouldn't, and have certainly stayed in some less than desirable places.   Yes, this is a good location, and yes the free bar/lobby/2nd floor wi-fi is great, and the bar area is fantastic (lined with granite and marble, also chilly when the temperature drops) but when it's cold, nothing else matters. Comment from the manager- ""Call me and I'll bring you some hot tea and blankets when you're ready to go sleep.  A discount on the room won't make it any warmer."" Apparently, the heat was eventually turned on, but this is an old location, so we never noticed the difference.  Seems as though Chicago buildings need a minor revamp (and I bet they had heat at the Ritz).",N
2300,"What a great hotel, located centrally in downtown Chicago, close to any place you'd want to be, all within walking distance, or a really short cabride away. This particular hotel has a lobby that is always packed with people, with a bar and seating areas in the wide open of the lobby with the registration desk tucked away.  The bellboys and concierge folks are friendly - and the the rooms are nice. Their suites were an interesting concept.   A 2 bedroom suite was actually one huge room with bar and a dining area/living area, and a single hotel room attached, sort of like a guestroom.   The views from the 43rd floor was breathtaking  - all of Chicago RIGHT THERE... WAY DOWN BELOW.  Given my fear of heights, this was not the best set up for me, with floor to ceiling windows, but it was indeed beautiful. A little inconvenient was the way their elevators work.  With 6 elevators, you'd think there would be more elevators working the 45 floors, but it always seemed to be my elevator stopping at every floor to pick more people up on the way down.  Strange.... The bathrooms are a bit small for the size of the rooms, and while they had granite countertops, that was the only noteworthy thing.  Toiletries are supplied, and there is a blowdryer if you want.  But no bathrobes or other special items you'd find at what I would consider a 5-star hotel. The bed at Hyatt McCormick was more cushy - but that said - with my back problems, the beds at  this Marriott gave me a better night's sleep and I felt great the next morning, whereas at the Hyatt's bed, I always woke up in pain.  I'm not sure why.... but the Marriott bed was SUPERB for me.  Go figure. The entire hotel is non-smoking, so that should be kept in mind if you smoke.......... Room Service is efficient and fast.  The coffee was actually quite good, served in a thermos, with two glasses of water accompanying it, and arriving within 30 minutes of ordering.  GOOD. In any case, the location can't be beat.   The hotel in itself and the rooms are nice, and the views are fantastic. If staying in Chicago, and you're wanting to be close to the nightlife, restaurants, etc - - this would be an ideal choice.   Incidentally, it is right across the street from Joe's Prime Steakhouse, which I yelped earlier. http://www.yelp.com/biz/...",N
4957,"We love Avenue Hotel Chicago!My daughter and I went on girl's weekend shopping trip and stayed at Avenue Hotel Chicago.  We truly loved the hotel! Everyone was friendly and helpful.  The location was close to fabulous shopping (American Girl Place, Disney Store, Chanel, Boss, Brooks Brothers...to name a few) and great restaurants.  We decided to get a kid-friendly room and we were so pleased with it.  The room was bright and comfy and we had a ball with the Wii!  We are planning on returning closer to the holidays and will definitely stay at Avenue Hotel Chicago again.",Y
2040,"Don't be dissuaded by the 'Holiday Inn' label - this is an upscale hotel (or upscale enough for most travelers' needs) with a mid-range price tag, with clean, comfortable, well-appointed rooms and free WiFi in a great location in Chicago's River North neighborhood. I help host an event (the Chicago(ish) Tweetup) twice a year and the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza is our go-to hotel for a variety of reasons: The sales staff is wonderful and always happy and quick to accommodate us, and they even work to find rooms at the group rate for last-minute travelers. The staff at the front desk and concierge are also friendly and willing to assist guests with their needs; I've yet to encounter a rude staff member in my five visits to this location. The rates are reasonable, and their block/AAA/Priority Club rates are often even better (call often to check on AAA rates, as they change from week to week, often going lower the closer to your arrival date). The location is fantastic, with views of the Chicago River and the city's lovely, gritty architecture, whether buildings or bridges. Thanks to the Brown Line Merchandise Mart El stop, it's possible to reach the hotel via public transportation from either major Chicago airport and avoid car rental and parking fees altogether, though check the hours for the Brown Line, as it does not run all night. The Cityscape Lounge is pricey and the service is on the slower side, but it's ideal for a cocktail hour kickoff and the bar food is pretty good. (The view from the lounge is incredible.) The lobby is comfortable and perfect for a larger gathering to congregate, with comfy couches/tuffets and outlets for charging smartphones/tablets. I realize there are higher-end and more affordable places to stay in a city of this size, but the price, service, cleanliness, and sweet location make this hotel the best-kept secret in Chicago.",N
4215,"What more great things can I say about the City of Chicago?  If you are looking for a scenic (right off of the Chicago River/Lake Michigan - - request the West Tower!) hotel with prime customer service, look no further.  From the top to bottom, the staff demonstrates their goal to satisfy.  If you have the means, I highly suggest the executive suites and access to the top floor lounge.  Hyatt Regency is perfect for convention stays, tourist, business trips, or just a weekend get-a-way a half block off of the Magnificent Mile.",N
3316,"Not worth the price. We almost stayed at a hotel for $110 a night, but instead choose the Hard Rock for $180 (a special). We were located on the ""newly renovated"" Beatles floor. The carpets in the hallways looked like they needed to be replaced. Upon entering our room we found some cool Beatles artwork along with a 3x4 foot Marilyn Manson portrait. I think they were halfway done re theming the room. At checkout they tried to charge us $11 for using the mini-bar which we didn't even open. They removed the charge right away but I wonder if they try to get unsuspecting people with that charge. Nothing special here. If you want to pay a bunch extra for some light theming then this is the place for you.",N
1078,"We stayed at Fairmont for 10 days due to a conference that was being held within the hotel. We checked in around 8pm the first night after a long delay of flight, but instead of checking in the room that we booked 6 months ago, we had to wait in the lobby for 30 mins for the room to be cleaned. The room was small and out-dated. We also had a small coffee table that's totally broken. The bathroom did not have the usual toiletries that you see at other 4-5 star hotels, q-tips/cotton balls etc, and the shower area had a strong moldy smell. The only good thing about it was that they had Miller Harris toiletries (which was not that great either.) No in-room coffee and no starbucks in the hotel. I had to walk to N Michigan Ave. for a cup of latte every morning. The location is great ONLY if you have a meeting right in the hotel, otherwise the area is very 9-5 and deserted after business hours. It's a long walk to any other tourist attractions or decent restaurants. I'd have chosen InterContinental if I've known the area better.",N
785,"The main reason to stay here is the location. It's right on Michigan Avenue, next to Hancock and Water Tower. Ultimate location to start any Chicago adventure. The hotel is newly remodeled, quite nicely I must add as I remember the old version (Hellloooo, pastels!) Hotel lobby is uber modern and clean, but unfortunately the meeting rooms don't necessarily match that feel. Rooms have also been updated, and I'm sure there is a premium for a lake or Michigan Avenue view. Probably not for the wall view I got! Beds super cushy comfy with tons of pillows, key. Reception was more than cool with my request to extend checkout until 2:00 p.m. and no housekeeping knocking on my door (a pet peeve). Went to a large event here and the catering and event department did a great job. As far as I could tell, quite smooth considering they were serving 75 sloshed Irish firefighters and their rambunctious dates.",N
1462,"The Omni Chicago is a great place to stay on business trips. It's centrally located to everything important-- Navy Pier, John Hancock, Millennium Park, etc. The lobby of the hotel is actually on the 3rd floor which is somewhat weird, you also have to take the elevator from the 1st floor and transfer on the 3rd to get to your room (for security i suppose). I would suggest upgrading to a room with a ""City View"" as the standard rooms all face surrounding buildings and you'll feel like you're in a prison block. The suites also have a couple large TVs (over 40 inches maybe?). Since I'm an unapologetic snob at times, I greatly appreciated the old fashion turn down service (for those of us who are too lazy to pull back our own bed covers and lay out our own robe before bed). The only con would be the Valet Parking which is about $50/day, but that's more of a Chicago problem and not necessarily that of the Omni.",N
2208,"This review is not for the hotel but for the event space. Their main ballroom is just beautiful!! It is magical. When we were outside, having cocktails, I wasn't all that impressed. Then when our party was allowed to proceed into the ballroom, phwooaar! It was love at first sight. The dance floor is big, the columns impressive, with two sweeping stairwells that curve oh-so-sweetly. I think they have a small platform too, perhaps for a band, or just some drunken exhibitionists who want to do the electric slide for everyone to see? It is a really beautiful space for an event - I highly recommend it for a big party. __________________________________________________­_ UPDATE 6/9/08 : my girl friends and I went to the wine bar in this hotel last night  because it was close / convenient. I did not find the seating arrangement  ideal, as we were jammed in between two parties (a drunk, touristy group, and an awkward first date). I'm all about a ""howdy"" meet-your-neighbor communal table, except...not in a wine bar. Wine bar is for intimacy and intrigue! How can you get that when you hear every whisper, or non-whisper, to your left and right. However, I will forgive them somewhat because they had great chocolate (pepper! jalapeno! raspberry!) and decent cheese selection (Blue Haze, yum) and I had a really rather sublime Oregon pinot noir that came in just the most delicate bowl of a glass. Ahhh, bliss. Then we kind of wandered into the pool and fitness center to check out their pool. Wow, it's awesome. Very Egyptian meets Spanish tile. Very Indiana Jones meets King Arthur's Court.",N
4674,"Finally!!  A hotel that lives up to its reviews!  Cheap motels, budget hotels, sketchy inns you name it I've stayed in them even.  So when I stayed here with two friends on a recent trip to Chicago, I was blown away by everything this hotel offered.  It was close to a lot of the major attractions, perfectly located on a quiet street not far from public transit stops and just a few blocks from the bars and clubs.   And the room was by no means a let down.  Our reservation was originally for a single queen after a little Travelocity snafu. (When booking through a third party you will sometimes be given the next available room if the one you want is unavailable.  We booked a double but got stuck with a single.)  Desperate and unwilling to share a bed with the two of them, I asked the man at the front desk if they had any other doubles available.  Fortunately for me they had one available and he was nice enough to give it to us.  It wasn't the biggest room, but the bathroom was decently sized and the beds were amazingly comfortable--so comfortable that the three of us slept through our alarms every morning.  The bathroom was one of the best parts of the room, second only to the beds.  It had one of those awesome shower heads that makes it feel like it's raining and there was never a towel shortage.  And of course, it came fully stocked with bathroom essentials--soap, shampoo and conditioner that delightfully smelled like the lobby, and q-tips & cotton balls.   As if things couldn't get any better, the staff was amazing.  Chuck the doorman was super friendly and knew everything there was to know about the city from which bars and restaurants to hit, to the most efficient route to get from one point to the next complete with directions so detailed that they included which set of stairs to take.  Even the late night staff was so helpful as to help my friend carry me back to the room after having a little to much fun our last night in town.",N
4834,"Simply a great place to have a party. Great service, great facilities. Will be here pretty soon.",Y
3116,"OK.... 29th floor, awesome view of Lake Michigan, Bliss Spa treatments and an awesome breakfast at Wave... this was purely a wonderful and pleasurable weekend get-a-way for us.  Service was spectacular, bathrooms were very cool and modern and the room itself was spacious and warm!  This is the only hotel in Chicago that sits right off Lake Michigan with an amazing view!  Not bad for the W in Chicago!",N
4439,"During of Stay: 4 days, 3 nights (Thurs 2/11 - Sun 2/14, 2010) Room Type: One King Bed I took my sweetheart here for an extended Valentine's Day weekend earlier this year and must say, this hotel is fantastic. The interior is aesthetically gorgeous, our upper-floor corner room modern (with the exception of the TV from the 90's), the location is excellent (just a few blocks from Millennium Park), the service is fantastic (from doormen, concierge, to maids and room service), and the Lockwood Restaurant inside is fantastic (we were given a complimentary 20% off coupon upon check-in to try ""the most romantic restaurant in Chicago""). The girlfriend enjoyed the stay as well. Only downsides: - The business center is small, computers outdated, and charges for internet and printing. - The pool is small and the stench of chlorine was overwhelming. Even so, I am giving this four-star hotel five-stars. Would definitely return again.",N
5268,I booked several rooms at the Fairmont Chicago for some of my close friends to stay at for a girls night. We all loved our stay here. The beds are soooo comfortable. The showers are absolutely amazing. Everything was so clean. The staff was very kind and accommodating. We also ate dinner at the Aria restaurant in the hotel and it was DELICIOUS! The Wine Room was also an added bonus and such a perfect thing to add to our weekend! Would definitely stay here again!,Y
4043,"Loved the Hyatt. Pros - BIG rooms. Queen sized beds. Beautiful, spacious lobby with high ceilings. Great price point if you get it online (we got our reservation off of hotwire). Really nice staff. Amazing number of electricity plugs. We had four girls in a room and not once did we have to hunt for an outlet. Cons - NO free Wifi anywhere, including the lobby. The TV quality was pretty bad, but who goes to Chicago to watch TV?? Some notes about their gym: Great up-to-date equipment. They offer cold towels, but no sanitary towels to wipe down the eqipment which was odd. A bit cramped, but I think that was to be expected given the area.",N
1173,"This is definitely not a 5-star hotel, more like a 2.5 to 3 star, but don't let that keep you from choosing this hotel. This is our first choice hotel every time we visit Chicago. This hotel ALWAYS has great rates and FREE parking and it's in PRIME location, a few block walk to the Magnificant Mile and next to dozens of great dining and nightlife! It doesn't get much better than that. My husband and I don't spend a lot of time at the hotel when we go to Chicago for the weekend, so I don't need luxury. But for the price, this hotel is better than expected!! The staff is super friendly!  The hotel is clean.  The beds are decent. BIG THANKS TO THE HOUSEKEEPING MANAGER KRISTY!!!!!!!!!! Our last stay was this past weekend and I left my favorite (expensive) pillow there. She called me within 2 hours of us checking out to tell me. They set it aside and a friend picked it up for me. I have never had a hotel ""find"" anything I've ever left there and I was so impressed with the honestly and prompt attention this hotel gave to my lost item. The rooms are a bit noisy, but it's Chicago....what do you expect. If you turn the fan on on the window unit, it drowns out all the traffic noise and any noise from the hallway. They have a GREAT swimming pool also! I have nothing bad to say about this hotel. For the price, I cannot complain about ANYTHING!!!",N
4221,"If you can get a room here for a deal, make it happen.  Its value is in it's location near the loop and Magnificent Mile. With over 2k rooms there is a large mall or airport feel to the place.  It's convenient and clean.  Especially for business and tourist attractions. I would suggest traveling out of the loop if your looking for a nice evening of Chicago food and bars.  Everything closes early near the hotel and you pay a premium in this business/tourist part of town. There's no free wireless, but they do have neat little computers set up to print your boarding pass before heading out.",N
5590,"This is a very nice Westin in an excellent location downtown.  From the outside it screams 1980's, but it's clear the owners have poured a decent amount of money into it since.  We were upgraded to a suite, which had an awesome view over the Chicago River.  The suite was very large and well furnished, even with its own iMac.  A few annoyances: the aforementioned iMac kept crashing.  Oh well.  The club lounge was small and had a very limited breakfast offering.  I had intended to hit the Westin Workout, but never made it.  Decent room service, but no frills. Overall, a very nice property - I'd return.",N
786,"Quick Review, more too come. We had our wedding reception here on November 21, 2009.  We had the absolutely best experience with Phyllis Washington, the Hotel Catering Manager.  Phyllis is a consummate professional and should have her own wedding show on TV.",N
2803,"We were stranded in Chicago after Fargo was hit by a blizzard (taking a train across the northern US in the winter...yeah, well, that's a review on me) and were placed in this hotel. It's been great. The Internet is indeed $10 per night, but that's becoming pretty standard at most hotels these days. Get a smart phone and connect through your carrier. Shush up about that. The room is big and beautiful. The lobby is great. The pool is very small BUT you can swim laps in it (if there are no kids). The gym is small: 2 elipticals, 3 treadmills, free weights, 1 multi-purposed machine and heavy balls. The staff was amazingly kind. Not sure about the location, but you know -- that's why they have a concierge. Just ask. (And be polite.)",N
1599,"We stayed here for a few days during a recent staycation. The room we had was fantastic. There was a river view with an actual ""river view"" ( Marina City and Trump Tower were my neighbors, sort of speak). There was a spacious bathroom, a very comfortable King size bed and a small couch. There was a huge executive style desk in there as well with wifi.Very well maintained, and the staff was efficient and courteous. The cleaning staff always asked if we needed anything before leaving for the day. Location is perfect  for checking out museums ( CTA # 10 and #146 right across the street) and the Mag Mile. A Corner Bakery is just steps from the hotel and a great option to go for breakfast al fresco during the summer. I will definitely return.",N
2282,"I stayed at the Chicago Marriott Downtown on the Mag Mile during a recent business trip to the Chicago area.  The lobby area of the hotel is very nice and a wonderful mix of modern and classy.  The bar is pretty nice and for a hotel restaurant, the restaurant within the hotel was pretty good.  Plus, there is a Starbucks in the lobby. Additionally, the location almost cannot be beat.  It's on Michigan Avenue in the heart of almost everything.  You have a great view of the city, you can walk just about everywhere, and it is possible to have a lake view as well. The rooms are an average size, but the bathrooms are tiny.  And by tiny, I mean European tiny.  Look I'm a guy and I don't really need a lot from a bathroom, but when I can barely stand in the bathroom and close the door... then the bathroom is way too small.  Plus, the shower was super weak in water pressure output. The sheets and bed were comfortable and a nice size.  i'm only 5'9"", so I don't need a king bed... and probably couldn't tell you whether I was in a king bed or queen.  They're both more than enough bed for me. Overall, I had a nice stay.",N
3666,"Wonderful common areas and exterior facades make the Drake a historic and popular stopping point along the Magnificent Mile. The rooms and conference venues are acceptable, if not exceptional, but the real stars here are the Palm Court and the bars and restaurants. It's a nice base of operations for exploring downtown Chicago.",N
5429,"DO NOT STAY HERE.THEY'RE WERE BEDBUGS IN MY ROOM!Yes they did change my room once I complained.But I found them in my new room.  It's very scary, and you can't sleep because of the fear of bedbugs.  It's now 6:00 am and I haven't had any sleep.help!",Y
979,"The amalfi hotel is great.  I've only stayed there on business so I don't usually hang out in the room all day. I do alot of traveling and have to admit, the rooms are small though so try to get a corner room, they're bigger.   The amenities in the rooms are great, love the robe and slippers!  They have THE BEST continental breakfast on every floor each morning. They also have an awesome happy hour every day with FREE top shelf alcohol along with some antipasto.  The staff who works the happy hour is great!   I literally choose to stay in this hotel when i'm in chicago just for the breakfast and happy hour, love it!   Although, Amalfi if you're reading this, what happened to the vendor you used to get the flakey, buttery chocolate croissants from??! The new ones taste like a roll or bread?  Love that you added other new stuff to the breakfast mix, but bring that old croissant back!!!! I see people complain about the food, that they don't have room service, yes I agree that it sucks to have Harry Cary's as the only option. But they make up for it with the free breakfast and happy hour,,,,,so that is totally fair.  Plus there are some really great places in Rivernorth to dine at so there are many options.....I would suggest Rockit or Havana.   THe only thing i can't give rave reviews about is the people at the front desk, never had anyone really give me great service and at times they have even ignored me while on the phone. Everyone else at the hotel makes up for them though, even the door dudes are nice. So I used to come here for years and loved looking at the photos of the amalfi coast and said ""i'd love to go to the real amalfi one day""!  I got to do that this year! Stay here when you can get a good rate and if you like boutique hotels.",N
1237,"Service is impeccable!  :-)  Here for the NRA convention - glad we pick this hotel.  Very convenient to McCormick Convention Center!  Staying for 3 more nights so maybe this is a ""premature"" review.  However, if I don't rate it now, I'll forget!  LOL.  Love the ""energy"" of the staff here!  Locked myself out of my bathroom though (ooops) -- apparently the way the handle of the lock hits the wall when you open it automatically ""locks"" you out, but the handy person came immediately and fixed the problem instantly.  This is a ""common"" problem, he said.  He even thank me for choosing Hyatt and ""keeping him employed"".  What a gem!  :-)",N
2056,"Very nice room, stayed here for a wedding I was in.  The staff did a great job putting on the wedding itself, and our room, while nothing remarkable, was clean and had enough space. The only real issue we had was with the parking.  Maybe we were just spaced out that day, but it took us about three passes before we figured out the right place to turn in to park.  The entrance seemed easy to miss. Then, to add to the annoyance, while we were going up the driveway the employee at the front entrance waved our car over to stop.  Then he told us that we couldn't park there, and that we should keep driving...in the direction we had been driving before he had waved us over to stop.  It was a remarkably confusing experience.",N
80,"I was born and raised in Oak Park, and my dad still lives there, so I had actually never been inside the Carleton until I booked a block of rooms there for out-of-town guests that attended my wedding in June of 2011. The Carleton is pretty sweet! It is old-fashioned without being run down. Our guests enjoyed staying there.  It's in a nice part of Oak Park, with lots of restaurants and shopping nearby (as well as the Harlem Green Line and Metra stops- easy access to Chicago). I liked the variety of rooms (and prices) that were available for our guests to book.  My husband and I booked the hot tub suite for two nights before and after our wedding.  The hot tub was really nice and the room was perfect for all of the hair and makeup needs of my bridal party. The front desk staff was so nice and accommodating of us and all of our guests.  Everyone recognized me as ""the bride"" and was especially considerate of my needs throughout the weekend.  Their customer service made me feel special and very taken care of. We definitely brought the party back to Poor Phil's on Saturday following the wedding, and all of our guests had a blast.  Thank you to the Carleton for putting up with us. We had a great experience there during our wedding weekend, and I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Oak Park!",N
3973,"I wholeheartedly agree, The hotel has become a sad case, Ever since the strike. Cold bathrooms, cold bar, You could LITERALLY feel a draft from the cold air. Went in March. 2005. It's certainly a classic, But NEEDS to be taken over by a different outfit. The ambience is pretty cold too. One of the things I actually liked about the place is it's large classic neon sign, That's practically about it..........And it being an old chestnut............",N
2393,"Looks like they renovated / updated their rooms.  Overall it was definitely an update for the better.  I stayed here before in a much larger room, but our experience this time was a lot better considering many of the items in our room back then including the furniture, the TV (a tube tv) were outdated. Rooms now features a fairly good sized flat screen tv, computer that has your name on the title screen, which was a nice touch.   I like a more modern approach of using that computer (sort of like a kiosk) to look for nearby attractions, see room service options, look for restaurants and numerous other things.  It gives you more info about what's around and what to do around the area. The downside is that in order to use the web browser, they charge a ridiculous amount.  In this day and age, when we are hooked on technology, I sort of see this as nickle and diming.  Really annoying. Anyway, I got the parking and room package at a decent price so it was nice to go in and out of parking without hassle.   Overall, I'm satisfied with our stay.  Got some good rest and I actually booked to get away from the burbs and spend some time in the city with my wife on our anniversary.  This place served it's purpose and everything was solid.",N
1662,"Hello Chicago! On my 1st ever visit to Chicago I stayed 3 days/ 2 nights with the girlfriend at Hotel Allegro. She was there for work so I tagged along since I'd never been to Chicago. Hotel Allegro has a prime location in the Loop & was only a short walk after getting off the CTA Blue Line. The lobby & common areas of Hotel Allegro are grandly & sharply dressed. The girlfriend & I arrived early morning so our room wasn't ready yet. Front desk service was thoughtful as they offered to stow our luggage & call us as soon as our room was ready. Free coffee, tea, etc is available in the lobby in the morning. We grabbed coffees & set out for some breakfast & exploration while our room was prepped. The call came while we were still eating breakfast. That was fast. Back at the hotel, service continued to be thoughtful as staff confirmed that the girlfriend was on an extended business stay & made sure she had a quiet room high enough from the street, on the corner & away from the elevator. The room itself was clean, smartly decorated & felt like it had been recently renovated, but smelled faintly of paint. Being a Queen Deluxe room, it was on the small side. While it had all the basic amenities, there was no coffee maker or microwave in the room. Free Wi-Fi is available in the room if you're signed up with Kimpton's Loyalty Program. No problem. I see this as a better option than paying $10 - $20 for 24 hours of internet access. So I signed up, got free Wi-Fi & Kimpton has since been nice enough to not assault my email inbox with loads of junk. For my 1st time in Chicago, Hotel Allegro was a great place to stay. It's a hotel that's been deftly redone, is centrally located, pays particular attention to service & has nice but smallish rooms. Any future trip to Chicago may also include a stay at Hotel Allegro.",N
2809,"This location is, as the 2-Star rating says, Meh, I've experienced better. It's just like any other Embassy Suites, beautiful atrium, free cocktail hr, free hot continental breakfast, staff was nice, concierge was awesome and helpful-- all things great right? Well... The hotel slipped a letter under our door informing us of the $millions that they spent renovating the hotel and rooms... From the condition of our hotel, we could NOT tell. There were chips in the wall of the tub and there were spots of mildew, the room had a peculiar odor, the lighting in the bedroom was horrible and the A/C was loud and annoying. To top it off, we had some issues with billing. When you checkout, any hotel on this planet is supposed to provide you with a receipt with any possible charges that you are responsible for, KEYWORDs: Supposed To!!! But the gentleman at the front desk said that since my Mom was using her HHonors points ""Everything will be taken care of"", well, long story short, it wasn't and there were some ridiculous charges that they were throwing at us and all these issues could have been taken care of before we left but we had to deal with this issue weeks after we checked out, damn tards. Other than my 2nd and 3rd paragraphs, I have to say that the hotel is in an OK location. If you're coming to Chicago for the first time, I'd suggest something closer to Navy Pier or on the Loop because this was pretty far from all the tourist attractions. Other than Portillos, McDonalds and Walgreens, you pretty much have to take a cab or walk for miles to get to where you want to get to. Thankfully the concierge was AWESOME. Phillip was so nice and sweet and is the only saving grace for this 2-Star instead of 1-Star rating. He mentioned a tour, one of those Hop-On, Hop-Off tours that was WAY better than paying a cab fee. It was about $27 a person and it took you to all the tourist attractions. Love him! Return stay is not in our future, we will look to the other locations... But can we take Phillip with us?",N
5515,"I think this is a really quaint little hotel. Its the perfect place to stay. Its near the city, near to Wrigley, and in an area filled with lots of great restaurants and little shops.",N
1723,"Thank you for giving me the worst room on the planet. The website for this hotel was so gorgeous that my friends came expecting to be awed...instead what I got was probably the worst room in the entire hotel. It was the size of my college dorm room, the bathroom can be more or less described as an 'efficiency' and my view (way up high on the 10th floor)...brace yourself...was of a parking lot across the street. What made it worse was that it was 2 steps from the elevator so all I heard during the night were the dings of people going up and down. Which brings me up to my next point...I had 2 friends over to watch tv for a few hours before going out and management called my room 4 times to complain about the 'noise level'.  At one point they said 'we are going to have to ask you to leave if this keeps up' ...not a great thing to say to a guest? especially when that guest has to listen to the elevator all night. In summary, this hotel should not be considered a 4 star. I've stayed at holiday inns that were much more quiet, considerate and BIGGER. Maybe they just like to yank my chain because I bought it off of priceline but at this price point, I would've been better off putting up an extra 50 to be pampered, not insulted.",N
3640,"Wow. It's amazing how far a ""name"" will get you. Didn't think it was possible for a hotel to get away with such terrible service in a highly competitive market as the Chicago hotel market. These people really could give a rat's ass about their customers. From wait staff, to security, hands down worst service I have ever experienced, and I have stayed in hotels all over the world. Trust me when I say, the Holiday Inn Express a few blocks away destroys them in service and accomodations. In terms of the actual hotel. Extremely dated and cheap looking. Probably considered classy during the Nixon administration. Thin walls. Crappy furniture. Funny smelling carpet.  Laughable elevator bank  with an Atari game-looking elevator indicator screen (no offense to Atari). Clientele - old (ancient) money and white trash. weird combo for sure. Stay away. If you are going to spend that much money, do yourself a favor and stay at a hotel where they give a damn.",N
5498,"I rented two rooms at this hotel last April when I had some girlfriends in town and we wanted a fun night out in the city. The location is the most attractive feature of this hotel. I agree with all the other reviewers who said the bathrooms need to be remodeled. The beds are not comfortable either and I agree the hotel should purchase new ones. The worst part was, even though I paid their ridiculously high rate for two rooms we could not get into our rooms until 3 hours after check-in! A huge pain when traveling with a group of women who want to get dressed for a night out. The hotel gave late check out to a hockey team in town to play the Black hawks so all their other guests checking in had to suffer. The lobby was filled with pissed off guests who felt that since they were not professional athletes their reservations were not important. I would not stay here again.",N
2225,"This is a perfect place to stay in Chicago. You will definitely feel like a celebrity because of the grand decor and service at this hotel. Its beautifully designed and decorated, making a trip to Chicago even more fun. And while you sleep like a celebrity, you can shop and eat like one too along the Mag Mile.",N
1443,"Join their select guest program, the benefits are real and significant unlike a lot of other places. Search and work for good rates.  Omni's prices are always going up and down.  I get the best luck when I call the hotel directly.  The website and toll free number are unyielding.  Great hotel, clean rooms, excellent location, great staff -very friendly, free room service coffee every morning for select guests.  Restaurant and bar are way over priced and I don't like the starbucks coffee they serve every day but I can overlook this.  I love starbucks and their specialty drinks but their ordinary coffee has always tasted a bit skunky to me.  Also the sliding doors for the bathrooms can't be locked.  If I weren't staying alone or shared a room on a business trip this would be awful. Thanks to Chicago's crappy zoning regulations, one thing that's really a shame and will change Omni forever is the Ritz-Carlton.  Ritz-Carlton is building a massive hotel just to the South of Omni.  I mean there may be 6 inches if that between these hotels and the Ritz extends just a about 4 feet closer to Michigan completely ruining the South view and corner room views Omni had on Michigan.  What were once top rate, top price rooms, are now the worst rooms in the hotel.  What a bummer.  Omni can't be happy. Still a great hotel that can be had a fair prices.  Thanks to the Ritz maybe even better prices.",N
287,"Ok so i only yelp about restaurants, but i see other people yelp about hotels, so i had such a pleasant experience at this hotel i had to review it.  We booked a flight and hotel deal with this hotel,and we seriously paid like less than a hundred bucks a night for a week. This place come with a 17th floor balcony, a gym, everything u can wish for.  also our room came with a kitchen, and they even wash your dishes for you.  I cannot wait to go back.",N
5623,"I had a business trip here this week and it was a nice hotel to stay at, and I would say what you expect from Westin - heavenly beds, big rooms, good amenities.  This location even has massages in-room that you can take advantage of.  I really liked the fitness center.  It had TVs on all the equipment and a good variety of equipment.  There is someone working there too to help you with machines and exercises.  I also love that I didn't get charged to use the fitness center (it was supposed to be $10/day).   The location is great, right next to the river, walking distance to a lot including Michigan Avenue shops.  It's right across the street from the House of Blues.   I would stay here again.  I would say this isn't the nicest of the Westin hotels (Westin Philadelphia for example was much nicer IMO) but it's a good place to stay in CHI-Town!",N
4872,"Stayed here 10/15/11 because its fairly close to the united center.  Booked our room back in August with a 72-hour special, still paid $156 for 2 people for 1 night.  Figured that's just the city for you.  We were totally excited because the website makes the place look amazing.  However, the website is TOTALLY misleading.Parking is in addition to your room.  The valet was adequate, its $33 to valet your car or $28 to park it yourself around the corner.  The lobby is okay, looks tired and old (not in a good way).  Could use a remodel. We stayed in the Buckingham Wing, which I guess is where all the smoking rooms are.  There was a stale smoke smell in the hallways and the room. The tiny elevator reeked of some kind of cleaning agent, which was okay I guess.  The room was very basic, which is fine because we were only staying one night.  Their website boosts beautiful views, but our room was across from Colombia college, and a fire escape.  You can hear everything going on in the hallway and the street below. Got hungry late at night (around midnight) so we found a pizza place nearby called Pauly's (or something like that).  The area is okay, not great.  I slept on top of the sheets and without a pillow, I was terrified of bed bugs. We couldn't wait to leave in the morning, if that tells you anything about the place.",Y
1109,"I was here for a wedding this past weekend, and it was one of the most beautiful weddings I've ever been to!  Part of this was because of the wedding planner of course (and the adorable couple), but this hotel really added to the experience.  The lobby is beautiful and the rooms were spacious.  The shower had upscale stone tile and a rain shower head.  The beds were very comfortable as well.  The valet people were so helpful with getting cabs and loading cars.  Another person in group called down for more space to put food, and a refrigerator was apparently brought up in minutes!  However, the drawer under the tv was sooo cheap and difficult to close!  This wasn't a big deal, but it didn't match the rest of the room.   The reception room was great, with a large dance floor big enough for a wedding of over 300!  The brunch the next morning was in a quaint and very pretty room.   We hung out in the Presidential Suite the day after the wedding (where the wedding couple was staying), and it was incredible (beautiful views, too).  The air conditioning was broken when we first went up there, but there were maintenance people in there fixing it right away.   This hotel is in a great location.  It was truly upscale and beautiful, and I highly suggest it.",N
3464,"I love the Allerton Hotel!  I give it 5 stars not based on luxury hotel standards, but based on the money I spent per night and damn right, it gets five shiny stars. I booked a five night stay via http://expedia.com and got a King Room for a $110 a night...total! That to me seemed extremely reasonable.  The location is more than superb, located between the Apple Store and Brooks Bros. on Michigan Ave.  It's an old boutique hotel that has been updated, modernized yet kept the true charm and details from decades past.   It has character.  The elevators were extremely fast.  Small yes, but fast.  If you want big and lightening speed, I suggest you vacation in Vegas in a new shiny hotel, not an old, boutique hotel in Chicago!  The room was extremely clean as was the lobby and hallways.  Our room was really a good size.  We stayed in  King room, not a King suite, and all seemed perfect.  I had read that rooms were tiny so I was sure not to book a petite standard room.  The bed was comfortable and the room was extremely quite.  The only downside was the lack of counter space in the bathroom, but I figure if two gay men can make it work for five nights, anyone should be able to! I can't speak of the services that the hotel offers as we never used the restaurant, bar or room service.  But the check-in experience, asking of directions, getting a cab were all successes.   For a good looking, perfectly located, reasonably priced hotel......check out the Allerton Hotel........loved it.",N

Loved: *the modern fun decor *the price *the layout of the lobby creates lots of cool seating areas *aveda bath goodies *a nice selection of complimentary items(incase you forget your fashion tape) *comfy bed *helpful staff *only about a half mile walk from the train station But seriously what is up with the crazy slow elevators?,N

1339,"Good: - Nice room with an good (but heavily blocked) view of the lakefront. - Chocolate-covered strawberries waiting for me in the room. - Shower was nice in that it was easy to use and didn't leak. - Comforter/blanket was just right on the warmth scale - The furniture was generally very comfortable and upscale. - Nice and plentiful pillows with soft fabric. - Clean-up staff did a great job. - Staff did a great job pointing me where to go. Bad: - Those strawberries I mentioned came with a card from a husband written to his wife.  I'm a guy, and not this husbands wife!  It was a mistake made by the hotel staff and completely unacceptable. - The elevators... there needs to be WAY more of them.  I swear I waited over 10 min. twice for an elevator.  Also, you have to go through two elevators just to get to the hotel floor you're staying on.  That's really annoying, especially since they take forever to arrive and aren't very quick to ascend/descend the floors.  Plus the elevators looked old and shabby with tacky gold stuff everywhere. - The bed was so soft, I literally awoke sunk over an inch into the matress.  I think the matress was covered with that foam stuff.  Whatever it was, it was way too soft! - The hotel staff evidently went into my room at least once a day for no real reason.  The room would have the same mess I left, but the TV would be turned and left on, playing classical music.  I don't want to walk into my room to see an energy-sucking TV playing classical music with a black screen noting only the channel number via crappy TV speakers.  That was absolutely ridiculous.  If they want to freak me out by turning music on when I didn't leave it on, they can go ahead and use the little clock stereo they include in the room!!! - Parking was ridiculously expensive and I had to use valet to park.  I don't like it when people drive my car.  It's not your regular car and it's a stick shift.  No reason for me to have to have someone else park my car... no reason at all. - Here's the kicker... a week later I needed a copy of my receipt because I lost the original.  I called and was directed to accounting.  I was asked to hold.  Then I was told I had to fax in a written request.  Excuse me?  (1) This is 2010... get an online site where I can just download a PDF of my receipt like you can do with even Motel 6 and (2) No other hotel I've ever encountered requires a written request! I stayed for a company conference.  I would never stay here personally.",N
1654,"This is a really cute hotel! I haven't actually stayed at the Allegro, but my work held its Christmas party here. It was on a Friday in December, and our group of about 40 people were in part of the ""Living Room"" and ""Cameo"" room on the second floor. It was a really nice, cozy, lounge-like atmosphere. There was a large fireplace and uniquely shaped leather couches. I would describe the decor as ""retro chic."" There were a lot of bold prints mixed with dark woods and interesting art. Very hip and cool! There was also an area for the open bar, and hotel staff circulated with hors d'ourves. The food was tasty. We had chicken teriyaki, beef wellington and different types of pizza. It was good! Our bosses actually decided to extend the open bar another half hour because everyone was having such a good time. Another positive about the Allegro is its location. It is just around the corner from our office building, and it is right in the heart of the Loop. The Cadillac Palace Theater is right next door, and you're within walking distance from the river, the lake and all the Loop has to offer. I would recommend the Hotel Allegro for work parties or other gatherings. It's a very cool place and interesting venue!",N
1117,"ooooh is this place classy.  i got a last-minute deal for new years night and i am thrilled that i took the plunge and stayed at the fairmont.  the room was enormous, the rain shower was decadent, and the in-room technology was mind-blowing.  oh yeah, and the price was incredible.  this would be the perfect hotel to stay at for Lolla or for the Taste of Chicago. i docked a star for my only two grips: the bed was too hard for my taste and the lobby needs way more comfortable places to lounge.  their weird mid-lobby bar is awkward and the seating is just a bunch of bar stools and a few small chairs.",N
1919,"I spent three months traveling on business and staying at this hotel.  They treated me like family and the service was absolutely amazing.  It was right aruound the corner from my office but had several different options of hotels to stay at.  This was as good as it gets! Throughout my stay, I intereacted was two concierge attendents who on a regular basis did everything to make my stay comfortable - Vanessa L and Laurelin did everything from finding me restaurants, delivery, to even interviewing personal trainers to train me in the hotel gym.  That was only the begininning, they called and followed up with me on a regular basis on how they could help make my extended stay comfortable.  Even a bottle of wine sent to my room, when I had a bad day.  They offered me runs to the store when I was sick or had any other needs.  It doens't get better than this. Jeff, Tree and Israel were amazing with taking care of my luggage and other needs.  I regularly left my luggage at the hotel when I would leave town on the weekends.  To come back and have it back in my room, thanks to this team.   Deborah, was very helpful and kept my room clean on a regular basis.  Justin, the hotel manager, set me up wit a suite for a weekend stay when friends were visiting, including a parlor room. This was an amazing experience and while I may be going back for business travel for work, this is the only hotel I will stay at in Chicago.  Not to mention, it's super swanky and everything seems brand spanking new...",N
228,"I'd absolutely stay here again! The rooms are small but the fun, bright decor makes that ok. The service was wonderful - I called down for toothpaste and within 10 min I had toth paste, a tooth brush, and an assortment of other goods. The room was clean when we got there and housekeeping kept it tidy when we asked for it and stayed out when we asked for that too. I can't say much for the food but the menu had all the standard stuff. The location is really great. Instead of feeling like you're in the middle of a city, you get a sense for what it might be like to live there - the surrounding streets turn into a farmer's market on the weekend. You're in walking distance to the red line and a short stroll to the Miracle Mile, Gold Coast, etc. Oh, and they give you free internet. woohoo!",N
5702,"In Chicago for a wedding...we needed a hotel that was in a good location and priced right. We ended up getting a nice deal through Hotwire at the Chicago River Hotel. Pros - *Convenient location to everything. *Nice cafe/restaurant right next door. *The staff was very friendly and prompt with service requests. *Bonus with free wifi and self-serve water bottles in the hallway. *Comfy bed and pillows. I would have preferred a king bed, but all they could offer was a queen. Still comfortable though. Cons - *The shower was very tiny. We referred to it as ""European"" all weekend. There was also no tub, which wasn't a big deal to us...just though it was worth a mention. Water pressure also wasn't that great. *Our view...which was at an alley on one side and a dumpster on the other. That wouldn't be too bad, BUT on Friday morning at 7a...construction workers were jack hammering on this side of the hotel. It didn't happen on Saturday or Sunday (since typically people work Monday0Friday), but man, of man...it was loud. *The only TV in the room was next to the desk on the opposite side of the room where the bed was and it was approximately 24 inches. With that being said...we didn't watch any TV in bed while we were there.   Overall...tis was a nice hotel in the heart of Chicago.",N
4396,"I really want to like this hotel, and in the past have stayed frequently.  The truth is that the rooms are small, and old, beds soft.  The customer service here is horrible, especially the front desk.  This is more of a hotel where conventions stay rather than a business or vacation hotel with personal attention. Called for room service last night - held for 15 minutes then hung up.  Called the front desk to change my reservation (to leave early) and was also put on hold for 20 minutes, hung up on this too. I am done!  Can't stand the lack of service or caring from the staff.",N
5849,"staff was rude, revolving door was really hard to push, and perhaps best of all... BED BUGS!!!!!!!!!",Y
4085,"The hotel room was big and comfortable.  The beds were incredibly comfortable.  I always fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow.  Great view of lake Michigan.  The service was wonderful and the concierge people were very knowledgeable and friendly.   Also, it was nice knowing that there was always a line of cabs waiting right out front in case you needed to go somewhere in a hurry.   Only downside is there's no free wifi.",N
3843,"My fiance and I decided to have a little faux-getaway on Sunday night. Although we live only a few blocks from the Dana, we thought it would be a fun way to close out the summer to book a hotel, do the whole spa thing, shop Michigan avenue like tourists, and enjoy some of the things in Chicago that we take for granted since we live here. We had high hopes for our stay and were excited to get a move on, Sunday morning. Upon booking, we were told that check-in is 3PM (normal) but that we should have no problem having our room by 12-1. We got to the hotel about 1230 and were told they sold out the night before and we'd have to wait until 3 for our room. Not their fault, totally understood, so we left our bags with the bellman and went shopping. My fiance had booked a massage earlier in the week for 2PM and at about 1PM she called to see if she could get a last minute manicure after her spa treatment. The manicurists were booked (understandable) but she was also told they had no record of her massage!?!?! - this had been confirmed by phone a day earlier. The massage was one of the things she was most looking forward to, so after a brief phone argument, we marched back to the hotel to get it straightened out. Luckily they ""found her reservation"" and she was off to her massage. I went back out to do some shopping and met up with her at 3PM to check in. We were told the room STILL wasnt ready, but somehow they managed to find us one that fit our reservation. The room was what we expected, small, but modern and cool. The IPOD system was excellent and the bed was super comfy. We requested a room with a balcony as opposed to their floor to ceiling windows - either way the hotel is very open with regards to people in neighboring buildings being able to see in and we received welcoming waves from people across the way. Luckily the blackout blinds do the trick in securing some privacy. I'm thinking that the upcoming portion of my review on Ajasteak should go under the restaurant, so if you happen to read something on that page that seems oddly familiar, you'll know why. Going into the restaurant, I had moderate expectations given that its fairly new and some of the reviews seemed ""eh"". We had an 8PM reservation and were clearly on time since we were just an elevator away. When we arrived, we were told they werent ready for us yet and to enjoy a cocktail at the bar - should be 15-20 minutes. I looked into what I assumed was the restaurant and there were only two tables out of probably 15 occupied and a few parties eating outside. I assumed there was another section of the restaurant that couldnt be seen from the bar area, but when we were seated in what turned out to be the empty restaurant I was BAFFLED. I ran to the bathroom when we were seated (have to take elevator/stairs to 2nd floor bathroom, none on restaurant level) - but the manager came to the table and apologized to my fiance for the wait - apparently they were extremely short staffed, backed up in the kitchen, and had a private party ""upstairs"". New restaurant kinks or shitty service??? The menu was on par with what I expected. We started with edamame (decent, but kind of flavorless) and the Kobe beef yakatori. I'm SO GLAD I opted for the Kobe beef appetizer as opposed to the $18 per oz entree as it was REALLY sub-par. It was served with mini-skewer/toothpicks to eat it with and kind of came across as something that would be served as passed appetizers at a cocktail party. Unimpressive. My fiance ordered the sea bass which she generally loves.Sea bass isnt normally a ""fishy"" fish and it is usually hearty/fluffy. However, her piece was pounded so thin, it was almost laughable and it was drenched in the terriyaki sauce (which although tasty) seemed an intentional overpowering of the sub-par fish. I opted for the lamb chops and upon ordering told the server that although I enjoy my steaks medium rare, I prefer lamb cooked a bit more and he acknowledged my request - OF COURSE, the lamb came out pretty much rare and both chops had a big visible piece of fat through the middle. This was a $40 dish that was worth 1/2 that, if that. I ate it because at that point I was starving. We also shared the ""truffle"" mashed potatoes which didnt have a hint of truffle flavor and tasted more like the buttered flavor out of the bag instant mashed potatoes found at the local Jewel for $0.89. Dismal. Clearly, we didnt stick around for dessert. Fortunately, my fiance and I know how to have fun even when faced with some shitty circumstances, so although on paper the overall experience of the Dana seems terrible, we made the best of it. When we left, our first thought was, ""We're so F'in happy the Dana wasnt opened last year when we booked our wedding at the James hotel"". On the surface the Dana seems to have every thing we like - spa, cool, modern decor, location, trendy restaurant, etc - but they definitely missed the mark with us.",N
771,Very average rooms and the gym smells bad and looks like it hasn't been cleaned in a week...,N
510,"This modern Embassy Suites features very fast glass elevators, so just riding up to your room is cool. Look down upon the atrium space to the main floor below. The rooms are all mini-suites, and the buffet breakfast is a big spread. The hotel is connected to a large movie theater complex and is not too far from many of Chicago's attractions, though it not really next to any of them.",N
3195,Ok so obviously this place is expensive but we wanted to do something special for our wedding night so we looked for deals and went with the W. Our honeymoon isn't until December so this looked fun. We booked with them and paid ahead of time; we had to do this because of the special we got for two nights. It was a great room overlooking the lake. The food sucked but whatever. A week later I noticed that I had been double charged. So I was now out $1200!!!! yup and I'm a teacher so you know I ain't got no money. The amount we paid ahead was $500 for two nights. Then suddenly we were charged another $700. Eventually it was all taken care of after many phone calls and much frustration. The only reason I'm giving at A-OK is because they offered that we stay there again for free to let us have a better experience. The second time we had the same type of room (only one night) and it was great. No room service this time since we had experience the bad food already!,N
1862,"I absolutely love the W City Center. W hotels are known for being uberhip, and this one is no exception: you pretty much feel like you are in a seductive music video as soon as you walk in, thanks to the modern lobby all tricked out in dark tones and low-lit to give the place a perpetual dusky feel. Yes, the rooms are fairly small, but there's a lot of sexy in those little packages. The beds are top-class, with the most perfect bed linens I've yet to experience in a hotel--featherbeds, pillow-top mattresses, down comforters, feather pillows...heaven. The amenities are lovely, as well: in the bathroom, you get a travel kit of Bliss products instead of chain-branded things. Did I mention the floor-to-ceiling mirrors? I'd choose the W to have an affair. Not that I've had one, of course. I'm just saying. The staff during my visit was all helpful and friendly, from check-in to cocktails at the Whiskey bar, and I never felt a thing was lacking. Oh, and free Granny Smith apples are tucked in bowls everywhere, which I love, because those are my favorite.   The whole place is fucking delicious.",N
3440,"We visited the Allerton while searching for our wedding venue.  The penthouse floor was really nice, but something that they go out of their way to keep from you until you visit is that the beautiful reception (could also be ceremony) area has a pretty low ceiling in the center of the room.  It's pretty on either end, but it isn't large enough to dip down that much in the center without it being pretty noticeable.  The whole floor is yours, though, and there was something about that floor that would have made it feel like you had the whole building to yourself. They were doing some renovation downtstairs when we visited, so the entrance and elevators were a bit awkward.  Valet lot is across the street and took forever. Overall, it seemed to have its charm.  It was different than most of typical upscale hotels and wasn't insanely priced for rental (compared to other options downtown, at least).",N
5302,Right in the middle of everything.  Fancy service to all their guests.  My husband and I recently stayed here for a night out of town from Indianapolis and we would definetly stay again.  Everything was up to standard and beautiful decor.  It's worth the price for a comfortable stay.,Y
355,"It's a Travelodge, so I didn't really expect anything better than what I got. The price was reasonable, and the location is hard to beat. It's a quick walk to the Metra and El stations, and it is across the street from Grant Park. There is also free wireless internet, and two restaurants attached. The biggest issue I had was with the hotel staff. They were very rude when me and my friends needed separate receipts, and would sit on the phone talking to friends instead of helping people who were waiting. The room itself was ok- not too bad, but nothing special. The temperature was very hard to keep comfortable, and there was a big gap between the floor and the bottom of the door.",N
5192,"It all started when the Bellman lost control of the luggage cart and it hit and left a dent in our rental car.  Long story short, I had to contact my insurance company and the hotel would not admit liability, They told me I had to get a police report to document the accident for the hotel insurance.  If it hadn't been for Mike E. the assistant manager at the Front Desk who called the police and asked them to repond to a non-emergency at the hotel I would have had to give up precious vacation time and go to the police station.  It ended up the police came at 11 pm and Mike was there to offer support.  The Director of Security ,who is in charge of handling these kinds of incidents, has had limited contact with me and his follow-through has been an email 6 weeks after the incident.To top it all off when checking-out of the hotel, they only charged me for 2 days of parking vs. the actual 4 days I parked.  I was honest and paid the bill in full.Do you think that Hotel 71 offered any ""good will"" compensation for my time and trouble for the what they say was a ""training issue"" on the part of their employee the Bellman?  Nada, nothing Regarding our room, while it is great there are two sinks and the room is spacious, we had to call two times that the bathtub drain was not working and it was never fixed properly during our 4 day stay.",Y
1000,"I've stayed at The Amalfi many times since it first opened. The main reason is that it is centrally located right in the heart of downtown; 3 blocks from The Merchandise Mart where I usually work and only slightly further from all the fabulous shopping on Michigan Avenue. Conveniently located right across the street from Harry Carreys and right next door to Keefers...both great choices for food and drink. My only problem is that the hotel is in desperate need of an upgrade...it literally hasn't changed since I first stayed here 5 days ago. Still, the best value for any hotel in this location!",N
4570,I haven't stayed the night here but I was inside briefly and it's so nice! The decoartions and the way the hotel presents itself is very classy. The front desk people were super friendly and helfpul. I think if I did end up staying here I would be very satisfied.,N
5319,"Please do not stay here. I was born and raised in Chicago and often peered at this hotel from the outside and thought... ""Hey, that place looks nice, I'd like to stay there one day."" I spend a lot of time in downtown chi and rarely feel like driving home after a fun night. I remember, one night in July, I walked into this Westin with my girlfriend Lydia to inquire about the room rates for the night. We were spoken to (very rudely) by a humongous and very unattractractive manager, (I feel bad talking about him because he didn't make himself and everyone has flaws, I'm not a hyocrite) but I feel that he was taking his unhappiness with his appearance out on us. He told Lydia and I that there were no vancancies at the hotel, but a white couple walked in behind us and he ""magically"" found accomodations for them. They stated that they had not made pre-reservations and were walk-ins just like us. I wish I had gotten their info. I wrote this experience off as being a ""glitch in the system"". I returned to this hotel with my clubbing and dining buddy Lydia again after having a ""girl's night out at Ruth's Chris"" where I picked up a $350 tab. We were unable to finish our meal and had 95% of it wrapped up for enjoyment later at the hotel. This didnt happen. Due to stress, I had a panic attack and Lydia drove me to the nearby Northwestern Memorial Hospital. I stayed there for about 7hrs. When I returned, Lydia called me and said that our dinner had been either thrown away or eaten by the hospitality staff.            Talk about a waste of money. Lydia complained to Sean, the manager on duty, and she and was given a meager $25.00 credit to be used at the bar downstairs in the lobby. The food at the Grill was nice. However, the very next day Chicago Police was called on me because the $5,000+ charge that had been authorized on my account for an approximate 2 week stay had exceeded by daily charge limit which is only $5,000 per day. I was told by the same manager, Sean and head of security, Ray Parede,s that my credit card was stolen and that ""those people"" and ""n words"" do this allk the time at this hotel. They said I had placed 2 different addresses on file. Did they ever think I have 2 residences???????? DUH, or are black people not allowed to OWN multiple properties? Are we not allowed to blow 5K on a 2 week hotel stay. The police showed up, verified my identity, and basically stayed in my room for 2hrs until I could call the bank and authorize the card for more money. In the interim, I missed a very important business meeting and a relaxing 4hr spa treatment. OMG, hope I don't have another panic attack. And to think Westin claims this hotel offers a retreat feeling. I feel worse than I felt at the hospital. A $440/night waste. But I feel like a young MLK doing a PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION to take a stand against the unjust treatment of ANYONE, regardless af gender, sexual orientatation, race, culture, religion, etc. Feedback is welcome.",Y
5173,"We came her for after dinner drinks last week and thought the lobby was very trendy.  The waitress was very attractive but hard to find for refills.  It's too bad that they didn't have better seating options, the couches are bit awkward for large groups.  Worth coming back to drink...",Y

The room I slept in was on the 11th floor and facing the direction of the train tracks which bothered my friend, but I liked it since I looove noise while I'm trying to sleep.

5077,"This ""club"" SUCKS! We went there on a Saturday for my cousin's 40th birthday party. First, it has nothing to do with a hotel! It's a crappy-looking club in a lousy location where they make you pay $20 for valet before making you wait in line to enter. As you're entering, they frisk the guys and check the girls' purses. You are then FORCED to pay $4 to check your coat. If you are with other people, you cannot check your coats together. You MUST PAY separately! The cover that night was $20 for women and $30 for men..really? Someone said that someone from Basketball Wives L.A. was supposed to be there and this was the reason for the extra security. Who cares? I'm not impressed with celebrities and I care even less for pseudo celebrities!The club is small, dark and the music is EXTREMELY LOUD. On Saturday, the DJ played an uninspired playlist of ""crap rap"" music. The crowd was aggressive and ""low end!"" We had a room in the back where we could barely see one another and conversations were limited since you had to scream just to be minimally heard. Again, this place SUCKS! One star is too much of a compliment for this hell hole. I WILL NEVER RETURN THERE!",Y

5333,"My name is Mary Claire. My husband, Joe, and I recently got married at your hotel. I have never written a note like this because I've never been so impressed with the quality of service provided at a hotel before. I just wanted to write you a note to say how truly impressed we were with your colleague, Brooke Bosak. Even though the event is over, I just can't stop thinking about how hard she worked, her kindness, her sincerity, her professionalism, her attention to detail, her enthusiasm...the list goes on!  Throughout the entire planning process (and the wedding week-end) I never really had to ask her for help with anything nor did I worry about anything because she always anticpated my needs before they were a thought in my head. We recently re-located to Madison, WI so planning from a distance was a challenge. She was always accommodating and flexible to our schedule and made sure we were well taken care of when we got to town the week-end of the wedding. I could tell that she was genuinely enthusiastic about our wedding throughout the entire planning process, our entire wedding week-end and even post-wedding! Our vendors were excited to work with her and they raved about how great she was so great to work with. Our guests also raved about the elegance that was orchestrated by her and your staff. You can tell she is really good at what she does and we really thought you should know how awesome we thought she was too!I also wanted to tell you that Beth Jostes was also amazing the night of our wedding. She took good care of us into the wee hours of the night. I know our group must have been a handful and she was extremely attentive, down to earth, very helpful, patient and fun to work with. Finally, every one of your staff we encountered was extremely welcoming and kind. I regret that I do not remember their names but it was your desk staff and bellman that were the most memorable. They remembered us by name each day, made us laugh, offered sweet marriage advice and were always smiling. They treated us like family.This was by far my most memorable hotel experience of my life. The Doubletree is truly unique in the quality of guest service you provide. Thanks to this experience my husband and I don't want to stay anywhere else besides the Doubletree.  Thank you for your time and hope you have a wonderful holiday!Sincerely,Mary Claire",Y

3318,"Due to unprofessionalism with condo renters, the last minute I decided to throw my friend's bachelorette party in the city on a Friday night.  I called around trying to find quotes on suites and every hotel was either way too expensive or booked.  The lady at the reservations, she was very helpful and polite.  We ended up booking a suite for one night. The day of the party, things weren't going as planned.  We were stressed and annoyed.  I figured, just go to the hotel and check in, set up quickly, and just relax til 7pm.  We get there at about 3:30pm and the suite isn't ready.  They apologized and asked if we would like complimentary drinks at the bar as we wait.  Tempting, but instead, I asked for free late check out the next morning.  Right away she agreed to a 2pm check out.  We needed a fridge to store our drinks in for the night, and they said it would be a $10 fee, but they were kind enough to give that to us at no charge.  We finally get up to the room and set our things and start prepping for the night.  The room was fabulous!  Perfect to hold a party, the bed and sofa was really comfortable, it was clean, nice view, and the shower was amazing!  Then there's a knock at the door, and to our surprise, the hotel decided to give us complimentary bottle of champaign and strawberries for the celebration!   Despite all the stress we went through that day, the Hard Rock Hotel did their best to maintain a kind and respectful customer service.  The girls up front at the desk were polite, friendly and wanted to make sure our stay was memorable and pleasant.  The bell hoppers were generous and helpful with the tons of luggage we had going up and down.  I completely recommend this place to stay.  It's hard to find good customer service these days, but the people at Hard Rock sure knew how to accommodate to our needs!  Thank you, Hard Rock Hotel and all the guest service members!",N

Staff was friendly and accommodating, room was just fine and overlooked a lovely brick wall (eh, not a deal breaker for me) ... but the interweb connection at this place was incredibly slow.  It was as though I was nine again and impatiently waiting for dial up connection so I could do important things like visit the Ty website and look at Beanie Baby paraphernalia.  Right.  But there was the most amazing vintage typewriter in the lobby, I wished it was as easy to take as little bottles of hotel shampoo.",N
4850,"I enjoy staying at this property. Its a fun hotel. They have a great club that was removed and placed back in the lobby. It is always lots of fun to stay here, and we enjoy going here when we are visiting Chicago.",Y
2062,"I always win this hotel when bidding online on Hotwire. It's a pleasent walk to Michiganavenue but I don't mind it. Parking is like 35 overnight. I have stayed here with my family and we liked the place. If you're lucky, you can get the BEST view of the city. It's usually my favorite part. I got my hair done at a salon at Merchandise Mart (which is a walk through the hotel building) so that was pretty cool. Then in the morning, you can walk through the building to get breakfast at Dunkin Donuts. But as far as the hotel, I liked my stay. It was comfortable. The bathroom is small, but the beds are nice. TV worked fine. What else can you ask for?",N
1555,"Nice decor, but looks so much better on the website. We were placed on the 16th floor directly RIGHT next to the elevator. The next morning we were woken up by drills, hammers, etc. They were doing maintenance on the elevator. I asked for a different room, therefore we were downgraded to the 15th floor. Should be the other way around right? We couldn't even move into that room until 9pm the second night. This place is a GREAT location, Nice views, but the rooms were just okay as well as the service. Also waited 45 minutes at Hoytt's for 2 beers, we even sat at the bar!. Of course making us late for our flight. We had to run though the airport to catch it... I wouldn't stay there on our next visit to Chicago..... wouldn't recommend it either",N
1327,Just celebrated my sisters wedding here and spent a few days with my husband on the 18th floor. The wedding and reception was lovely. But our room was tiny and had v ery little warm water so taking showers was uncormfortable. I've stayed 5 times but the quality has really gone downhill. I reccomend the westin instead.,N
5701,"The Chicago River Hotel is an excellent boutique hotel.  The location is outstanding, it's across the Chicago river and about a half block off of all the shopping that is the Magnificent Mile. The hotel is also within walking distance to a plethora of great restaurants, and Millennium Park.  If you're taking the ""L"" from O'Hare, the walk from the Clark/Lake station is about 10 minutes while pulling a suitcase in the summer (no clue what it's like in the winter!). The room was clean, well appointed, and nicely maintained, although the TV was pretty small.  A really nice touch is that each floor has a gratis self-serve water bottle filling station; the water is chilled and filtered, they provide the bottles, all you have to do is fill 'er up! We booked their smallest room which was more than adequate for our needs since we were always out, and saved us more than enough money to pay for an awesome dinner and drinks.  While the hotel may not have as many amenities as other larger properties, it's still a winner based on cleanliness, location, price, and free Wi-Fi.  I would not hesitate to stay here again.",N
4051,"While the renovation at this place looks great (you can see they poured all their money into the lobby/restaurant area), there were more than a few issues with the room. First off, the view, was excellent, from the 32nd floor, peering thru the Chicago skyline and looking down at the Chicago River. The beds were also comfortable but that's where the good stuff ends. First, parking. The only on-site parking is via valet ($35 each time you park) or $50 all night valet. You can park at a nearby parking garage for around $25-$30, but for a major chain in a major city, I expected some on-site parking that didn't involve ridiculous parking fees. Next, the amenities. The reception on the TV is terrible. Some of the channels barely came in. The water pressure on the shower was weak (weaker than the usual hotel water pressure). The air conditioner/fan would still circulate air into the room even though the panel had the thing turned off. After two nights, this resulted in a very dry/sore throat. Finally, the concierge. Hit or miss with these folks. A couple of them were friendly, polite and knew what they were talking about. Then  there were those who just didn't belong behind that desk. From the guy who gave us the wrong directions back to Midway (if we followed his directions we would have ended up in Indiana) and the lady who told us parking across the street was ony $23/night (it was actually $30) and the guy who sarcastically joked that the fitness area didn't have ""cool stuff"" like a jacuzzi or sauna to a whole list of other tidbits that I've since pushed out of my mind, the conceirge service at this hotel is questionable. Also, I'm not sure if they're still there, but there's a bunch of strikers/picketters outside the hotel and from a brief conversation with fellow guests who were staying on the 16th floor, they could hear them banging their pots and blowing their horns at night. No problem up on the 32nd.",N
3611,"The lobby is very nice and ornate.  It's ""historic"" I suppose, and it should be respected for being a landmark, but it's too old and tired for me. The room was a little bigger than a shoe box, and the bathroom didn't have enough room to change into the robes hanging on the door.  The view was nothing more than the windows and concrete of more buildings.  I'm sure if you get something overlooking the lake, it's better, but the TV was tiny, the bed was hard and a wee bit sagging, and the staff, pretty snooty. Again, the lobby and stairs are really nice.  Too bad the rooms aren't more like that.",N
288,"I am in Chicago for an interview and decided to stay at the Seneca because you can not beat the price. I am staying here for 89 bucks a night for 4 days and it is well worth it. My room is huge. It has a living room, kitchen and two closets. Now from what I have seen this is not a normal room. And I asked at the front desk if there is anything special with my room and there isn't anything. I just got lucky. If your coming to Chicago and you want to be close to Michigan Ave but you do not want to spend a lot, then you should check out the Seneca.",N
5246,"I stayed here during the 4th of July weekend, the hotel was very busy but the staff was very polite and helpful.  The beds and pillows were very comfortable.  If you are going to stay here I suggest a room with a city view, looking at downtown Chicago was amazing.  This will be my hotel of choice every time I visit Chicago.",Y
1174,I couldn't say it any better than Erin C.  What I would add is the Wi-Fi is intermittent; whether it is the hotel's fault or the enironment I could'nt say.  The attached restaurant serves as their bar and is nice and has good deep dish.  Drinks and beer are very reasonable.  We will stay here next time for both free parking and location.,N
5777,"In the grand scheme of things this hotel was soooo not worth the 189  dollars  + 28 for parking, internet fees of 10 dollars per day for a grand total of 231 per night not including taxes.  The only reason they get away with ripping people is because of it's proximity to the school and people will pay or else. I've stayed at much nicer marriotts with better amenities with a reasonable price. I was there to attend a wedding. The valet staff was reasonably nice.  But the desk staff was rude and unhelpful when they booked the bride & groom in adjoining rooms instead of on separate floors as requested.  After they tried to put her out, I ended up giving her my room to appease everyone.  The sad part was that they tried to chastise her and tell her if she had asked one of us earlier she wouldn't have had to cause such drama.",N
527,"Reasons why I chose the Hampton Inn Downtown in the middle of it all!  Walking distance (its good for the mind, body, and soul)! - 1 minute to Ruth's Steak House - 2 minutes to Rockit - 2 minutes to one of my favorite sports bar:  Mother Hubbards - 5 minute walking distance to Magnificent Mile - 5 minutes to the clubs (Excalibur, Cabaret, Andy's Live Jazz) - 7 minutes to Brazzaz (Brazilian Steakhouse) - 8 minutes to Hooters - 15 minutes to Millennium Park - 15 minutes to Sears Tower - 18 minutes to Bukingham Fountain - 20 minutes to Field Museum - And when I walked... I found all these intriguing hole in the wall places you can't experience when you take the taxi. King Suite - King size bed with tv, breakfast tray, and privacy doors. - Personal bath and closest with a security safe. - Living room to host your local guests. - WI-FI (so I yelp when I get back to the hotel room at 3:00am) - Kitchen with stove, refrigerator, microwave, and small dining table with chairs. Complimentary Breakfast each morning from 6:00am-10:00am - Its not Denny's but its enough to get a big breakfast before I started my tourist day.    Now I do compliment the hospitality of the morning servers...they're friendlier than Denny's. - Okay.. its not that great.   Mostly pre-made meals like waffles, processed eggs, and a juice machine.    But I enjoyed the fresh fruit, buttermilk biscuits, and sausage. Service & Hospitality - They got it down.   Smiles at the lobby.    I know I should have told her in person, but ISABELLA ... You're freakin HOT!   Thanks for helping out with my room selection and your smiles at the elevator!   * yes, i can't stop smiling when i think about IT!  * - Firm greetings by the bell service.    Easy to load and unload upon arrival or departure.    They got the great connection for taxi service and local recommends. Other Amenities & Services: - Tiny lap pool (worth visiting if you want to spend time alone and distress). - Fitness center - Skip it!  Way to small to declare it a workout center.   You're better off exploring Chicago on foot. - Luggage Hold:  Thank you Nathan for securing my luggages while I finalized my downtown Chicago visit.    This helps alot when you have a busy schedule. Drawbacks? - It's next to a fire station.   So at night, you might get the sirens depending where your room is at. - I wasn't lucky enough to get a great view of downtown Chicago.   I opened both my windows and saw a great big business building.   Argh! No major complaints here.    More compliments!   I spent about six hours a day at the Hampton Inn.    I didn't need a five start hotel because I really need a place to get some rest, keep my drinks cold, shower and change, internet access, and SPACE!    I really hate staying at crowded hotel rooms.     So this was a perfect palace for me.      Cleanliness and excellent service exists here (we'll that's because this was a King Suite).     So I officially crown Hampton Inn as my official Chicago hotel to stay.   I'll be checking in again soon in Spring 2008.",N
1431,Is a four style place for the awesome shower. Loved it.,N
417,Great location!,N
5749,"I got a discounted price through a third party, so it is easier to give this place a great review.  It was a very comfortable and clean hotel and the staff was quite friendly.  Wi-fi in the room is free, but you have to sign up and renew every 24 hours, which is weird.  I booked through a third party that said that this hotel was in the ""Magnificent Mile"" neighborhood.  It's really not, especially if you're carrying shopping bags, but cab fare in Chicago is pretty reasonable.  Also, the Greektown restaurants just down the street from the hotel are fabulous.  All in all, a really good hotel - just don't pay full price.",N
4863,"I just returned from this hotel. I was there from July 2-7th. I booked the hotel for the location of being across the street from Grant Park where the Chicago Food Festival was held and it is walking distance from Soldier stadium, where I had tickets to see U2 prior to the concert being postponed. The hotel is old! Simple as that. But I had no problems with odors or cleanliness. The staff were friendly and I had no unpleasant experience. It was close to Millinium and Grant Park, Walkin distance to the Museum campus, which is where I watched the fireworks for the 4th.  No problems with this hotel and would stay again. The room was spacious, had a great view, was clean and I felt safe.",Y
2180,"Back in the 80's, this hotel was a Radisson and a dump. You could look  up at the florescent lighting and see the rats running around. Intercontinental saved a beautiful landmark hotel. I had a baby shower here for my wife. The staff did an outstanding job. I've worked some conferences in the beautiful grand ballroom. The rooms here are nice, but the service is top notch.",N
3829,"Super posh decor. Interesting set up with the exposed shower (there's a curtain for those shy ones). I couldn't figure out how to turn up the air conditioning for the life of me. The floor to ceiling windows got a bit annoying at times b/c at every angle there are facing buildings that can catch a glimpse of everything you do. *Ahem* like changing. Having to use a room key to use the elevator was quite frustrating at times. Imagine going up and down the elevator a few times cuz' your key isn't being recognized. Anyway, on to the good. The staff was friendly. It was centrally located to train/bus lines, attractions, and eateries.",N
3602,"Since I'm around people who love tea as much as I do (for once in my life), we all thought it would be a great idea to have high tea one weekend. The Drake Hotel offers just that for $31. I originally thought the price was a bit high, but after going, I think it's well worth it. When we arrived, we were a bit confused on where to go. There are signs pointing the way to the tea room, so be sure to look for them. I did not see them and god knows how long it would have taken for me to find the area. I usually just wander. Anyway, once they took out coats, we were seated right away. The tea room, while large, was incredibly crowded. I didn't think having tea like this was popular, but apparently it is. I ordered the Irish Breakfast Tea, and it was wonderful. We were brought these large tea pots that were refilled with hot water constantly, as well as finger sandwiches, scones, and a variety of desserts. The finger sandwiches originally didn't look very good, but after trying a few I thought they were amazing! The scones were so-so, but the desserts were terrible. We spent almost 3 hours there, and I was completely stuffed by the time we left. I would definitely recommend this place for tea lovers!",N
1572,"I've stayed here twice.  First time, I fell in love.  It was December, cold and the hotel was sexy warm.  I opened the drapes and fell in love with the view and moonlight shining into the great room.  Room was quiet and bathroom was luxurious.  I had a big FUN king size bed.   Second time, I booked through a website.  I stayed on the 26th floor, not updated room and no real view.  I was close to the elevator and the bed was ten feet from the door so I could hear people discussing everything.  I again was dead tired and could have upgraded to another room on the water side for $15 after I talked to the front desk.  But I decided to just get dinner and call it a night.  So they would have accommodated me.   So if you book, check where the room is and etc.   I love the area and the whole downtown Chicago vibe.  Of course, parking is expensive but that's norm for any big City downtown stay.  You are fairly close to the West Loop and other great areas that has some very hip lounges and eateries.   I will stay there again when I return but will just be sure that I get the updated room side of the hotel.",N
5778,"When this establishment was first built, it was the Inn at University Village. Many medical professionals would have meetings, events and we would dine there. They had a nice buffet and it was nice and cozy.  It was fantastic to meet and greet after work. In later years, it became the Hyatt and it lost some of its appeal that we had come to love. Now, its the Marriott and I find myself distancing from it.  I think this hotel / restaurant does not have to be competitive because its needed in the Illinois Medical District. A few months ago, I went there with co-workers for cocktails and dinner. Well, the menu was scant and the food or should I say sandwhiches were not ""all that"".  I just am not impress and I miss the Inn at University Village.",N
4729,"How is this considered a 4 star hotel? Please explain....The rooms are so small, no bar in the room, no coffee machine, the room can hardly fit the bed and a small chair in the corner. The gym is even smaller than the rooms...its 100% not considered a 4 star hotel, I would rate it 2.5 or 3 at most.Very disappointed with Hotwire for making  me pay so much for so little.",Y
3125,"As stated by previous reviewers, it definitely helps if you have a room facing the lake, unfortunately I didn't get lucky, but I had a hotel rate of $89 from a friend so I didn't make a big fuss. The lounge on the first floor was non existent, and the hotel restaurant was a bit difficult to differentiate from the bar/ common area. Oddly enough I was put into room 911 and upon entering the room, the first thing that caught my eye was the window with shutters in the bathroom to the beds. That was a bit weird, but whatever floats your boat. Checked out the pool and gym on the 7th floor, which was pretty standard, but the bar on the roof was nothing to really write home about. Overall the hotel was fairly standard and the staff was very courteous and helpful whenever I needed anything.",N
4113,"Not the best Hyatt I've ever stayed at. It is at a good location, on the water and right by Michigan Ave but the rooms were not impressive at all.  The bar and restaurant areas were really nice though, so that's a plus. Random fact:  the bar stretches across almost the entire length of the hotel and is the largest bar in Chicago.",N
623,"Great service, location and rooms. The cookies are awesome. I ordered and got two boxes for some friends when I checked out!",N
4773,"Expensive hotel with no amenities. Crappy staff at the Concierge desk. Maps in the rooms directory books didn't include any floor above the 5th I was on the 14th floor. ""Historical"" means small and old here and not always in a good way. Bathroom was micro sized. Bath tub drain was plugged. One dresser drawer broke apart in my hand when I opened it.Windows opened but had no screens. And I do believe this is the only Hilton that does not offer coffee in the room. I won't send my worst enemy to this hotel. Stay anywhere but here!",Y
3242,"HRH, located just south of the river & Mich Ave, is like a mullet of a locale: one part Loop, close enough so you can go to the office; one part miracle mile, close enough so you can shop & eat & be a stupid tourist.  Solid 3.5 star hotel. The front desk staff is Post-Office-counter slow & not terribly brilliant, but friendly, managing to get the job done. (Eventually.)  Ditto for the valets. Rooms are modern, rock-hip furnished, comfy beds but overly squishy pillows. Agree w/ Gregory M., sheets are way over-starched.  Bathroom is nice, but lighting is awful (dim & overhead spotlight) so if you desire nice lighting for hair & makeup, you'll be disappointed.  Also, you can hear every door in your hallway closing & opening, so be sure to ask for a quiet room if you're a light sleeper. BASE bar always has a crowd, so if you're into that, you're in luck.  If you're looking for a chill bar, head to Morton's next door.",N
2954,"Rooms are what you come to expect from a Sheraton.  Nothing fancy, but they work.  The location was just ok, not really close to anything.  View of the river was awesome though",N
428,"Nothing to write home about, and could use some sprucing up, but clean and comfortable.  To be fair, we were not here under the best of circumstances -- sleeping the day away after a missed connection at Union Station -- but the service was generally friendly, and it was more than sufficient for what we needed.  Proximity to Chinatown means lots of interesting food choices, but no convenience stores nearby. Its proximity to the El is great for getting around Chicago, but not great if noise bothers you.",N
1207,"Close to convention center and driving distance to Chinatown. Decent, but overpriced food. Pros - comfortable and within walking distance to the convention center. Comfortable rooms. Nice work out gym/pool area. Equipped with TVs, water, headphones, towels and fitness magazines. Cons - No free internet access. Check in/ check out kiosk does not work. Often little to no ink to print out boarding passes at the kiosk. Business center is a disappointment.",N
2607,"Another Jerry Kleiner establishment in the Fulton Market District. I wasn't around for the days of Shelter, but I am told that Kleiner knew how to throw a party, and I must say that I can see what everyone is talking about. My first escapade to Victor occurred about a week after its opening. Of course, being the new club on the block, every model, B-list celeb, and athlete in town was sure to be checking out the spot, leaving the proletariat outside to wait in line for an hour (I must say once I got in I was impressed). I recently went back to Victor for the first time since then, and I like what I see. The interior remains the same, 1950's and 1960's mod furniture (Miesian Barcelona charis, some Le Corbusier, and the bubbly chair whose designer I don't recall), tasteful nude photography, and an overall very colorful atmosphere. What I really like about this place though is the focus on house music, which draws an intense following, particularly on Thursday nights. As with any place that has been open for a while, regular Friday or Saturday nights can be touch and go, so I would stick to special events. But overall, I would deem Victor Hotel to be a place that more Chicago nightclubs should aspire to--tasteful, sophisticated, experimental, and distinctive.",N
1013,"I reserved a block of rooms for my wedding here. Loal Porter was my contact and was very helpful anytime I had a question and was prompt with emails. The hotel itself was very nice.

I highly recommend staying at the Amalfi.",N
4510,"This hotel is a wonder of history and metropolitan elegance. Tucked away deep inside ""The Loop"", The Palmer House offers convenient access to just about anywhere in the Chicago Area. This area of the City is really safe, even during the wee party hours allowed in Downtown. There are a number of restaurants and bars within walking and cabbing distance from the Hotel, and a 10 minute walk gets you right to Lake Michigan and Millennium Park.",N
2475,"Not what I would expect from a downtown Hilton. The hotel is large, clean and friendly staff. I was surprised however to find the rooms had not been updated. Big old school TV's and old looking decor. Maybe that is the style of this hotel but not really my cup of tea. Also rather pricy but I suppose relativity in line with down town rates. I think I will explore and find a newer property on my next trip. The location is pretty good, either walk or take a short cab ride to just about anything in town.",N
4349,"Talk about strong energy, check out The Empire Room, their historic show room circa 1910, Liberace,, Durante, Sanatra and Sofe Tucker have graced that stage. Located just off the lobby and up the Grand Staircase. If the walls could talk, I'm sure you could sit and listen for years. Very Nice Historic Hotel, Very Small Rooms, tiny bathrooms, but, the service was wonderful. The Vibe, It's there ! This hotel was featured in the 2007 Movie ""The Fugitive""",N
1692,"Trying SO desperately hard to be hip and upscale, but there's only so much you can do with a shoebox, I say.   On a sidenote, I once crafted a Star Wars figure village fashioned out of shoeboxes. Spent four nights at the Allegro and I really didn't find anything to complain about, save for the peak time rush hours on the three small elevators.  I also can't find the words to really rave about any particular aspect of the place, either.  It was a solid three-star experience. My room was small and a bit quirky (two separate closets and only three small drawers to work with), but it was clean, quiet, and the bed was comfy.  Huge flat screen TV and iHome were nice touches, but the flat screen is WAY too big for the room I did not unlock the minibar for fear of setting of some kind of remote alarm and starting WWIII, and then getting a bill for having done so. The third star is solidly-earned for the 5:00 - 6:00 FREE wine happy hour.  A very nice touch. I attended a conference in the hotel as well, and all of the various fixin's were ok:  coffee and pastry in the mornings; cookies, soft pretzels, and chips and guac in the afternoons provided a nice variety of sugar rush fixes. All in all, a solid hotel, but $289 per night seemed like a stretch.  This is the third hotel at which I've spent significant time in Chi-town in the past year, and The James still holds the torch.",N
4340,"We had an AWESOME stay here. And I must say that the $35 late check out fee is the best $35 dollars I've ever spent. We had to check out by 3 and conveniently we needed to leave by 3:15 so it worked out great. As others have mentioned, the lobby is awe-inspiring. This is a lovely, lovely hotel aesthetically.  The room was large, clean and comfortable and the soap/shampoo/lotion etc. all smelled divine.  There is a Starbucks in the lobby which for me is a big plus. I NEED to start my days with a shaken green tea/lemonade. This property is close to a lot of Chicago's most awesome attractions. We did the architecture tour which was just a short cab ride away, went to the Hancock Building, did some shopping on the Miracle Mile, hung out at some cool places in the Viagra Triangle, walked to Millennium and Grant Park. Right outside is a train line. And across the street is a Walgreen's, next door is a pub, plenty of restaurants around (including two in the hotel itself) and a 7-11 just on the corner. We will definitely be staying at the Palmer House on our trip to Chicago next year. Friendly staff, BEAUTIFUL hotel, great location. Nothing to dislike!",N
1014,"Our stay at the Amalfi was fabulous in nearly every possible way!   -The location is terrific-River North but very close to the loop.  There are several close L stops.  Use Clark/Lake if you're arriving via CTA from the airport.  It's almost as close as State/Lake but Clark has escalators and is a larger, easier to navigate station when you're dragging luggage.  The walk to the hotel is pleasant and short. -We spent little time in the lobby but did like the deskside check in.  It's a lot more personal and relaxing than the typical ""wait in line to stand at the counter for 10 minutes"" check-in. -Our room was great!  We had an extremely comfortable king bed. The bed linens were soft and cozy.  There were plenty of pillows and the padded headboard was comfortable to prop against for reading or tv watching.  The bathroom was large and clean.  The Aveda toiletries were really nice.  The bathroom had a large counter, lots of floor area, and a lighted make up mirror.  The tub was a standard tub but had a double shower head and a curved shower curtain rod to help with that ""closed in"" feeling.  My only complaint about the bathroom was that the towels were a bit on the rough/scratchy side rather than fluffy and soft. -We were on the 4th floor overlooking Harry Carray's restaurant.  There was some noise bleeding in from outside but it was street and traffic noise, not bar goers or pedestrians.  IMO, it was similar to the noise level in any downtown hotel when you're only a few floors above street level.  We had a view of the Trump and the Marina Towers.  Not like having a spectaular skyline view but it certainly wasn't a bad view. -We loved the complimentary breakfast.  The breakfast was a couple of steps up from a typical continental breakfast.  There were a variety of pastries, bagels, doughnuts, cereal, yogurt, and fresh whole fruit.  Milk, apple juice, and orange juice were available as well as tea and coffee.  The coffee was really quite good and it was great to be able to get refills so easily. -We also really enjoyed the free drinks and appetizers each evening at the cocktail reception.  They have a nice selection of premium liquor, two white wines, two reds, two beers, and two pre-mixed specialty cocktails.  It's a small bar so they don't have every possible option but the selection is adequate.  And c'mon-it's FREE.  The food is good if largely unchanging.  Each night there was a selection of Italian cold meats, breads, cheese, and other antipasto standards-olives, artichoke hearts, peppers, etc.  One night they had Caprese salad and it was delicious.  The lounge is rather small.  If the hotel is crowded, I doubt everyone would have a seat.  We were there at an uncrowded time and one night it was still very hard to find a seat. -The business center was well-appointed with several computers (both Macs and Dells) and a quality, fast printer.  It made printing our boarding passes easier than just about anywhere I've ever stayed. -The staff was friendly, helpful, and attentive.  When we had spotty wireless reception (which is included, by the way), they were very responsive and sent an ""engineer"" up right away to investigate the issue. -Our only real complaint was with the televisions in the rooms.  We had cold, wet weather and spent our evenings mostly relaxing in our room.  The (smallish) flat screen tvs were a disappointment.  There were no HD channels, multiple pay or ""hotel"" channels, and the reception was spotty.  Also, the remote was awful and it was excruciatingly slow changing channels or even turning up the volume!  There was a dvd player with a (small, quite limited) selection of dvds to ""check out"" in the lobby-nice touch but it wouldn't hurt to update and enlarge the library. Overall we had a wonderful, relaxing stay at the Amalfi and will recommend it to friends and family.  I hope we'll be able to return sometime soon!",N

4481,"Loved, loved, loved the Palmer House Hotel. We had stayed at the Hyatt on Wacker for the first three nights of our Chicago trip because that was where my husband's conference was. We had to change hotels when the Hyatt couldn't accommodated a longer stay. This turned out to be such a blessing! The Palmer made the Hyatt look like a grossly overpriced dump. Our one year old son's knees were filthy from crawling on the floors at the 'newly renovated' Hyatt. His knees were pristine while at the historical Palmer. Also, there were five - yes five! - weddings on the Saturday of our stay, so the hotel was very busy. Even with that, we had no noisy neighbors disturb our son's naps or sleep at night. The building is stunning. Our room was huge (which might be because we agreed to take a smoking room, which was fume-free after leaving the window open a while we out exploring the city). And we got a mind-boggling fantastic deal on our room through Priceline.",N
2149,"The Intercontinental Chicago needs a lesson in Feng Shui. The room with double beds was small (not surprising considering it is a hotel in the city). Unfortunately the trick of using mirrors to expand a room was used ineffectively. Right next to the bed was very large mirror that took up practically the whole wall. I swear I didn't sleep well because of that. The only thing that the mirror accomplished was to highlight the circus like drapes of the room. I happened to like the whimsical decor but I didn't like having bad dreams. Unlike the mirrors in the bedroom, the Intercontinental is in an excellent location. It's right on Michigan Avenue and if you're into shopping then you're in luck. Bloomingdale's, Saks and American Girl are right next door. If you need to ride the L train it is also not too far away. The hotel has a fabulous pool fit for royalty. It's olympic sized and surrounded by Spanish tiles. The only thing missing was a poolboy who'll fan you and feed you grapes. Sadly, I was not able to spend some time poolside or in the water. The Intercontinental is a decent hotel to stay in. It's a reputable chain on the higher class end. The Chicago location, however, is slightly underwhelming.",N
4513,"ok this is a fancy hotel, the decor and ambiance lives up to that. But what kind of place charges for internet access AND use of the fitness room? Seriously? No thanks.",N
3868,"Quite possibly my favorite hotel. Definately in Chicago. Cool and new like a W - with the price of a HoJo. Great taste, comfortable furnishings, technologies in the room, views, architecture, great staff, and again - the price. I plan on staying here whenever in Chicago.",N
5376,"I was able to get a real good rate through Hot http://wire.com for Wed. 7/13/2001. There was little activity at the hotel.I asked the girl at the desk for a rm. with some view.I said it didn't have to be a lake view, but some city view.She gave me a view of other rooms looking on to a inter roof on the 5th  floor.There is no wi fi in the entire hotel,free or pay.FYI, Pickets outside ,because of some on going strike. So expect them to try to talk to you when you arrive or depart.DON'T STAY HERE!!!",Y
132,"I have now talked to some sort of manager named Abel.  He was the only person employed at the hotel who seems concerned about how his employees are behaving.  He asked me for times during which it all happened and specific details and then stated that he agreed for the most part that this was not acceptable.  He stated that he was going to address these employees about their behavior and then asked what I would like done.  I told him I just wanted my money back.    It has only been a few days, so I am trying to be patient at this point, but I still have not received my refund.",N
1688,"If you ask the online travel gurus, this is a three-star boutique hotel, but as far as I'm concerned, it's a four star, thanks to all the thoughtful little details. The Allegro is a Kimpton hotel, which means: 1. Free wine reception every evening for guests. 2. Your darling pussies and pooches are as welcome as you are 3. Tootsie rolls are free free free 4. Decor is zany, but tasteful There are themed suites at the Allegro, including a Lion King suite and Second City suite, if you're into that sort of thing. Staff is very friendly. The rooms are great. They can be a bit small, but the comfy beds make up for it. And the bar makes a mean roster of 'tinis. Really good place for girls weekends, bridal parties, etc. Not as romantic as some other hotels in town, but still very cool.",N

4747,"My husband and I just got back from a 5 day stay in Chicago. We were looking forward to a great stay at an interesting boutique hotelbut were unfortunately very disappointed. The rooms were so small and lacked comfort and personality. The staff were slow and unprofessional. As we entered the elevator, two employees... were very obviously wrapping up a drug deal and laughed uncomfortably when they saw us. Room service food was cold and tasteless. If I could get a refund, I would still feel like I wasted 5 nights in a beautiful city. Priceline rated this a 3 1/2 stars?!?! Doubtful. The only positive point of our stay were the very helpful doormen. They were wonderful. I would strongly suggest avoiding this ""boutique"" hotel and staying at one of the many other fine hotels in Chicago.",Y
2440,"I was here for a Chinese New Year Celebration a couple years back and the place was a maze - you could easily get lost here - the celebration took over many different ballrooms and the staff was very friendly in handling the huge crowd and answering my silly questions of getting lost.  What makes the Sheraton most memorable for me was after a long night of eating and making polite conversation, my boyfriend (just dating at the time) and I hid away at a small bar downstairs drinking Long Islands listening to the cd that the bartender had playing and he claims that was the moment that he realized he was falling in love with me. Edit: We' just got married there.  There were some ups and downs and miscommunication, but in the end, the staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Robert Neubert was a pleasure to work with and helped make the day go by smoother.  Our rooms were a bit small but I love the fact that you can actually get a hotel room with two bathrooms with two double beds - what a great deal!  They also treated us to the Daley Suite for our wedding night - what a wonderful experience!",N
691,"Ah, it was fine. We were in a scramble and it was a room. We way overpayed for it, though, but the entire city was booked, so I guess that's what happens when you procrastinate. The employees were great, the bed was adequate and at least didn't have that horrible foam comforter thing that you occasionally encounter. Not really much else to say.",N
5271,"The lobby was very nice and the room was large.  In room dining was great.  There were multiple issues with this hotel - it was not easy to access Michigan Avenue (despite what was said on the website) and no employees could direct me to how to get there without walking way out of my way.  I tried to call the front desk 3 times only to have the staff never pick up or put me on hold for 15 minutes. Also, I found some trash in my room that had not been picked up from the previous guest.  For the price point, I would stay somewhere else.",Y
3762,"The Dana Hotel rooftop bar / lounge is a must! Posh, great looking crowd, solid tunes and a gorgeous outdoor terrace - this is THE place to see and be seen. Tough to snag a table, so be prepared to hang out with your friends in a small gathering circle or dance it up a bit. Dress to impress!",N
261,"I will NEVER ever use travelocity's secret hotel application even if my life depended on it! Travelocity rated this hotel with 4/5 stars, which is pretty high since other hotels such as Inn of Chicago, Allerton, Drake, etc are also rated 4/5 or higher. The lobby was very VERY tiny and full of kids running around. The front desk personnel was helpful and friendly; she was very helpful and answered all the questions I had. I had booked a ""secret"" room through travelocity and luckily it ended up being a king. Upon entering my room, I noticed it smelled like wet towels that have been laying there for days. The room was rather small and the lights flickered. The bathroom took up 1/3 of the entire room! There were weird stains in the bathtub and the towels smelled like straight up bleach. There was a giant crack in the wall near the window (EEEEK!!!) Usually at other hotels, you can control the temperature in your own room. Not this hotel apparently. The AC kicks on whenever it feels like and every time it does, its so loud that your forced awake. It usually turns off by itself after a few minutes to let you fall asleep and then the cycle begins again! I paid an extra $30 a day for valet parking. To be honest, I was rather surprised this place offered that service to the guests. However when I asked for my car, the valet just simply handed me the key. I paid $30 for them to HAND me my key??? To make matters worse, it took me 30 minutes to find a cab in downtown Chicago around that area. The next morning, I woke up to what sounded like construction drilling. I checked out VERY early. I checked online and apparently, a room at this hotel for the night will cost you around $185!!! I only paid $75, but had I known, I would have gladly paid the $150 to be on Michigan Avenue. Overall, this place was a mess. I did like the customer service at the front desk; they were very polite and helpful. Other than that, the entire hotel is a giant dump that is not even worth 2 stars let alone 4/5!",N
2570,4 stars for the music and venue 3 stars for the crowd! This past weekend was the second time I've had the pleasure to visit. The  music is what made it for me...a great jazzy house set by a DJ I can't remember (sorry).  But def good! Although the crowd was very unapproachable and three quarters of them stood around and mingled it was a good place to people watch.   I would have expected it to be much more happening on a Saturday night. Maybe next time?,N
3702,"Old school elegance! My boyfriend and I treated ourselves to a night at The Drake for 4th of July. From the moment we stepped in, we were in love with this place. Very old school elegant. The hallways are large and the whole place is very, very clean. Our room was quite large, and the king bed was super comfy! We ordered room service in the morning - the breakfast was delicious! I also love knowing that Princess Diana, Queen Elizabeth and so many other cool people have stayed here. Love the history! There was a book in our room detailing the history of the hotel. Very interesting. I would recommend this hotel to anyone - great atmosphere, clean, beautiful, historic and perfect location to Michigan Ave and all of downtown Chicago.",N
5298,My parents stay here when they come to town because it's reasonably priced for such a convienent location.  They really like it.,Y
5228,My husband and I had a wonderful stay here. The service was really top notch and the food was delicious. We would retun here in the future. The Gym is also very nice and I highly reccomend using at at your stay.  The room is very large and spacious.,Y
2700,"oh you're so good, so good, so good. Your room service and design rocks. even down to giving out doggie treats outside your door. Your salmon and filet is delish, and excellent turn down service. Gym is state of the art great that other hotels. Thanks to Equinox fitness guru. you rock, and i am your fan.",N
5401,"I have stayed here now three times over the course of four years and I keep coming back. For the price, it is excellent value. The rooms are very comfortable and the staff are helpful and knowledgeable. The place is bright and cheery. There is something a bit unreal about the ""island chic"" decor in the middle of a Chicago winter, but I rather like the contrast. The location is very convenient to both Downtown and to the more residential northern and western neighborhoods. The 2-block proximity to the red line is definitely a plus. They also stock the bathroom with nice Aveda products. The only draw backs I can mention are that (1)  the hotel is in need of some sprucing up! It's definitely a bit battered and some new furniture, rugs, and paint would make a difference. When I first stayed here, several years ago, it sparkled. The shine has dulled. But it's still very comfortable, clean, etc. (2) The walls and doors are a bit thin. You can hear everything in the hallway (vacuuming, cleaning staff's walkie talkies, other guests roaming the halls), so if you are super noise sensitive, you might find this to be a problem. (3) The food available downstairs and by room service is not fantastic. But there are several really excellent dining options within walking distance. And since you are in Chicago, you should really be exploring the phenomenal restaurant landscape this city has to offer, not holing up in your room. The bar downstairs is a decent place to meet a friend for a drink, but again better options are nearby, including the cute and cozy Third Coast Cafe, about 3 doors down the street. All said, I highly recommend the Hotel Indigo.",Y
1888,"We stayed at the W the weekend just before Christmas. I went with a bit of trepidation, given that I am not a particular fan of the W on Lex in NYC. A major discount on the regular rate was the motivation to give it a try. When you walk in the front door, you could swear you are walking into a mini versus of the NYC Lex W with Whiskey Blue on the left and a popular after hours lounge the right. However, after spending a few more minutes soaking in the atmosphere you'll notice the vaulted ceiling, tile, and marble accents that give it a warmer, more dignified feel. The elevators will almost knock you over with their 3-d holographic-like walls. Expecting the usual W-esque room, we were amazed to find out they upgraded us to a large junior suite. It looked like the head designer from Pottery Barn just redid the place. Very impressive. What was not impressive is that they want $15 to connect to the net for the day (and no Boingo), though the lobby wireless was free. The staff was especially pleasant. Though it was -30 windchill, the door man stood outside for almost 15 minutes trying to find us a cab. He then convinced the Acura driver to drive us to Midway for no charge. They have a joint promotion with Acura to drive you anywhere within 5 miles for free to show off their cars. We wish we knew this earlier. The only problem is the location if you are going for a weekend. It is only one block from the Quincy L stop, which is nice if you are coming from Midway. But you have to transfer (or jaunt up to Clark and Lake) if you plan to use the trains for anywhere else. It is not a bad walk to State Street to Marshall Fields (ugh....""Macys""....) but a bear to get up to Mag Mile if it is zero like it was the weekend we went. Cabs are the order of the day, but not easy to find in the financial district on the weekend. Very few decent restaurants in the area. Overall, we were happy with our stay, but the location leaves a lot to be desired.",N
4130,"I have stayed here 4 times in the past 90 days and I have been thoroughly impressed with the property and staff.  Everyone is friendly, professional, and helpful.  Yes, things can and do wrong from time to time - it would be foolish to think otherwise.  However, it is how the staff handle the situation or problem is what counts, and this staff always step up to the plate, apologize (even if it is not their fault) and immediately begin to resolve it. The hotel is in a GREAT location, about a block from Michigan Ave (major shopping) and very easy walks to subway/metro, as well as State Street, Rush St, and other sights. The rooms are immaculate, clean, and well maintained.  I never had a problem at all in their area and have always been happy sleeping on these amazing beds!  The WiFi is reasonably priced, but there are plenty of free hot spots within walking distance.   I am a little sad that they do not have a pool - probably, my single downside with this Hyatt. Prices fluctuate a lot so check often.  I have scored rooms between $149-$199. The area is safe, walkable, and family friendly!",N
1097,"A Definite Winner!  Stayed here for 2 nights (Friday and Saturday), and had a wonderful time.  The grand entrance is a small bar area with check in to the right and a dual restaurant bar area to the left.  A set of grand stairs directly faces you, you know you are at the right place.  The rooms are decently sized, the sheets are organic and bed was soft; I loved the small vanity area as well as dual shower and bathtub.  Let's not forget the adjustable flatscreen!  Loved it! The room resonates modern minimalism, clean lines, simple colors and plenty of compartments for all your needs.  This hotel is walking distance to the train and plenty of buses to get around the city.  Here are 2 small complaints: 1. Towels could use some downey 2. Restaurant/bar called Aria is below par and over-priced Nonetheless, I would recommend this hotel for anyone who's visiting the city for a weekend and looking for a great place to share in the moment.",N
3355,"We stayed here on NYE and knew we wanted to see the fireworks at the fountain and go ice skating at Millenium Park so that helped in our decision on where to stay.  Also it had the best prices for a hotel in Chicago, on the Magnificent Mile, and on NYE. The hotel was fairly nice and we didn't have any problems.  I figured the room would be sort of small but it was a little bigger than I thought.  The bathroom could have been a little bigger but we were only staying for one night so I tried not to complain. If you are looking for a cheap hotel on the mag mile I would definately recommend this place!",N
5744,"At first I thought this hotel was ok. But I had to stay here for two weeks because of work. The best thing I can say about this hotel is that it's clean, and for me the location was ideal. However, customer service wise, I have never had a worse experience. You have to park valet, although most of the time the parking lot is not full. And, parking is expensive. I was sworn at by the valet because he couldn't find my keys. The desk staff has a way of making issues with check in seem like your fault, and when I had a problem with internet connection, I was told to deal with it myself. So anyway, if I had a choice I would not stay here.",N
4664,"Refreshingly modern, eco-friendly, very clean, phenomenal service! My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights, and we agree with the previous reviews of how great it is.  On top of those points, we actually only paid $89/night - a deal we got on Priceline.  For that price, the stay in this boutique hotel was a steal :) (+) modern and fresh decor (+) wonderful service from the doorman to the cleaning staff (+) comfortable beds (+) nice flatscreen t.v. (+) bathroom was as expected, compact/fast/powerful hair dryer (+) great location (-) small square footage space but not uncomfortable - we figured its tight just because its a high rise in downtown chicago We would surely come back again!",N
5647,"This is an EXCELLENT hotel. The rooms are so nice, clean,and spacious.  The beds are so comfy that you're not gonna want to get out of them!  The view in all the rooms is very nice.  Don't forget to try the room service -- they have excellent deserts!",N
5140,"Was this building originally designed to be something other than a hotel? The layout and decor are... well, not conducive to being a hotel. There is one elevator, and it is located in the middle of the floors; two hallways from the lobby. Then, on either side of the elevator on the second floor (the hotel has two floors), there are big empty areas. Then you go down a hallway and through two sets of doors before you reach the actual rooms. They hallway is decorated with exposed concrete that doesn't seem to fit. Someone had to actually make the decision to put concrete on the walls. Didn't that designer have a boss to question that? Anyway, the rooms were fine but they had bugs. That's the worst sin a hotel can make in my opinion. The continental breakfast was as disgusting as I have ever seen in a hotel. The ""eggs"" were covered in cheez-whiz. Gross! They say there's no such thing as a free lunch, and I guess you can say the same about breakfast. Also, I am not usually a big allergy sufferer, but as soon as I walked into the building, I sneezed four times, and couldn't breathe until I left. I don't know if it was the cleaning materials, beds, blankets, or something else, but if you have allergies you might want to pass on this one.",Y
5737,"I wanted a central spot to stay in while on a four day trip to Chicago that wouldn't cost me an arm and a leg so i choose the CP. Location: As written in other reviews the hotel is located right by a freeway on the boarder of Greek-town. I personally found it convenient since I cabbed all of my nightly excursions. I was able to get to where I wanted to be quickly and cheaply by avoiding street lights. The CP Metro has two bus stops that can connect you with the major transfer hubs for both buses and trains. As mentioned in previous reviews there is a full service supermarket named Dominick's across the street from the main entrance. Behind the hotel you can find a Walgreen's, Starbucks and various eateries which are open until the wee hours of the morning. Hotel : From the outside the CP metro looks very outdated but don't judge just yet. The inside has been fully remodeled in a very sleek and modern motif. It modern with a splash of Miami. The hotel offers king and double rooms most with small balcony. I had a great room facing the Sears Tower. A business center, and fitness center are also offered. The CP Metro has a full service restaurant and bar located on the ground floor named Retro . A 1940's American Eatery and Martini Bar offering American classics with a contemporary flair. Room: All rooms are fully carpeted tiled and offer a flat panel television, mini fridge and free Wi-Fi ( it was rather slow so I used the cable connection instead). The bathrooms were average in size and offered a pocket door instead of a standard one. Beds were comfortable. Overall the room was very clean. The staff I encountered were courteous, friendly and accommodating. I arrived early and they held my bags I also requested a double room because I had previously requested a king. Everyone was really nice and I got no attitudes at all. Hotel tends to be busy on weekdays since it host various company meetings and trainings. During my stay folks from United Airlines were there for a training seminar. Within Walking Distance Walgreen's 24 Hour Pharmacy, Starbucks, Sears Tower , United Center, and Harpo Studios",N
175,"My first time in Chicago and I knew I wanted to stay someplace within walking distance from everywhere that I wanted to go. This place totally fit the bill. You're 4 blocks from the Red Line and a block from Michigan Ave, you really do get a great location for half the price you would pay at Four Seasons, which is down the street. The bed was super comfortable, with plenty of pillows and a down comforter. They were still undergoing renovations so that was slight minus on the noise, but considering that I spent most of my time outside in the city, I didn't mind it as much. You do have to pay for internet, but luckily my friend brought her Verizon wireless card so we didn't have to pay for internet. There's a tiny gym on the 2nd floor that opens in the morning so I got in some quick cardio workouts before heading out. All in all, probably one of the better hotels I've stayed at for the price I paid.",N
1872,"Wow. Um. I guess a lot of you hate this hotel. Maybe if I paid $300 a night I'd be pissed, but every time I stay here I book my room through Hotwire, and I get some sick deals. The last time I stayed here I got a room for $118. I've always found my rooms to be clean and nice. The service has always been very good, and it's really conveniently located. I know the rooms are a bit small, I can't deny that, but I don't spend much time in the room, so I don't care. I've never had anything but positive things to say about the W in the Loop. I highly recommend it to anyone coming to Chicago for any reason.",N
573,"Worlds collide.  Old dog, new tricks.  In a nutshell, well done Ian Schrager, well done sir! I have always been a fan of the Ian Schrager Hotel group and I was thrilled to hear that they were opening in a grand old dame of properties, the former Ambassador East.   I wasn't quite sure how a finger on the pulse, New York second kind of guy would treat the aging beauty but I was dumbfounded by the gentle transititon that holds true the elegance of the days of grandiose with slick and contemporary style. Gratefful a dear friend was touring with an old school rocker that was housed in this gem and got to take a mini staycation while hanging out with rockstars.   So yes, the Pump Room was not my Grandma's cocktail salon and Kup and Harry Caray were just hovering from the heavens above but it was a definitely a hot crowd full of ""all the young dudes"" and lots of smoking hot beauties holding court.   Staff was fantastic as is expected from the Rockit Ranch crew and service was fast and furious. Rooms were spacious for a Schrager property says the girl who has spend extended stays at Paramount, Royalton and Morgans in my day.   Like double the size.  Ikea like in nature but sleek and comfy none the less.  Exquisite linens and lux robes and towels were my saving grace.   I will note I mistook a mirror for a door at one point and may or may not have lifted it off the wall but we'll leave that for later.   Staycation was amazing....... Public rooms are exquisite with soft yet sleek design elements, engaging staff and absolutely gorgeous finishes.   Clean, chic, sophisticated cool.  Worlds collide.  In a nutshell: old dog did new tricks quite well.",N
849,"We blocked off rooms for our wedding guests at the Silversmith. Not only did they give us a great rate (especially considering the location) at $169 per night, but the staff was very friendly and helpful. We assembled our wedding flowers day-of in a conference room they provided for us. Our suites were quite spacious. Our guests couldn't speak more highly of how nice the bellhops were and how centrally located the hotel was. Nothing too fancy here though - TVs are very 1998, no gadgets or extras.",N
5614,"I like this place. They totally beared with me during a ridiclous credit card mix-up, and were accommodating and NICE about it. Nice lounge, sushi place there is eh, but it's fast if you need something quick. Meeting rooms are well-appointed, albeit too cold...but the hotel food was good. Close walk to everything-nice. I knock a star for the smell in the bathrooms. UGH. It wasn't just in my room. A friend of mine who happened to be attending the same conference had this issue too. Nothing really made it subside. So all in all, a positive experience. I'd stay here again as long as the bathroom smelled better.",N
893,"Hotel Burnham is one of the Kimpton's more interesting hotels - maybe not as luxurious as the Palomar, but a lot more character than the Allergro.     I only stayed here one night, but the staff was very helpful and everything seemed well kept and quiet.",N

Since he had to wait a second, he looks over and says, ""Looks like you need some ice"" - then runs off to get some for me.",N
2775,"Friend and I crashed here from San Diego for the San Diego State-Notre Dame weekend in early September. I recall a reasonable rate and ""W"" ish decor. Unfortunately the sober moments in the hotel were far and few between. The front desk staff was friendly and the hangover room service breakfast Saturday morning of coffee, juice, and bagels hit the spot until the Bloody Mary later that morning put me back in the ring for Round 2. I don't recall great views but didn't really care although it was odd watching shoppers go in and out of a drug store across the way while in the shower. Oh and if you get a handicapped accessible bathroom, the floor will appear as if you just got finished washing your car in there. Spent more money in JBar than the hotel but that is another review for another day.",N
4925,"I work for a wedding planning company in Chicago, IL and worked at a South Asian wedding last night at the Drake Hotel. We have done NUMEROUS weddings at various 4 and 5-star hotels within Chicago and the surrounding suburbs, so we had a certain expectation. Let me first off say that the banquet halls where the wedding was held were beautiful-the decor, the flowers, everything. HOWEVER...we were told by the hotel management that we could leave our personal belongings in a specific place at the hotel (which we always do), so that we could work and not worry about our stuff. After a few hours, we came back to find that the wallets of the 5 girls with whom I work (including myself) had been opened and all of our money had been STOLEN along with an iPhone! No guests had access to this room-it was only hotel staff. THIS HAS NEVER BEEN A PROBLEM AT ANY OTHER HOTEL!!! I was completely disgusted. This is a hotel that claims to uphold a certain ""standard"", but they have apparently no requirements for when hiring people. To make matters worse, when we filed complaints with the security manager, he told us that ""plenty of help gets hired for the day of any wedding and they're not actual employees of The Drake"". Basically taking away any and all responsibility from the situation....I was completely APPALLED.It's not even the hundreds of dollars that were taken, but rather the principle of the matter. Coming to a hotel like the Drake, you expect a certain degree of professionalism from the staff and you certainly don't expect someone to violate you the way that we had been. As someone who has worked and attended a LOT of upscale elaborate weddings, I will NEVER recommend anyone to come to the Drake. They may have stolen a couple hundred bucks from us, but they're definitely going to be losing far more business.",Y
3234,"Anyone who knows me, knows that I am far from a swanky hotel kind of guy. When I look for a hotel, give me a Super 8 or Days Inn and I am a happy guy. On my own, I would never ever pick a top of the line hotel as my first choice. I must give major props to whomever designed the interiors here, both of the rooms and the lobby. They did an outstanding job conveying a sense of modern style and swank but absolutely did not lose any of the feeling of comfort or ""like-home"" feeling. This was a balancing act that they they excelled and I must give them major kudos for that fact alone. The staff here was outstanding. I was somewhat expecting a formal almost snobbish attitude from the employees but once again they proved me wrong. Everyone was super friendly and helpful and made me feel right at home here. If someone asked to recommend a hotel in the downtown area, I would not hesitate for a moment to give this place my seal of approval.",N

4089,"About two months before our wedding I reserved five rooms at the Hyatt for our special guests.  For some reason we had to split up the reservations between two names.  This was the cause of much confusion down the road.  Then, when we tried to get an adjustment to the pricing during a special sale, some of our rooms were canceled.  While I received email notices about everything concerning the rooms, I never received any cancellation notifications.  I only happen to find out about the cancellation when I called the night before to ask a few questions about the check in process for my guests.  We all ended up with rooms at the reserved pricing, but only after a few phone calls and too many minutes at the front desk. Aside from their difficult small group room reservation process, it was an OK place for our guests.  The rooms and facilities were clean.  The bar in the main lobby provided a fun place for our guests to end the evening. The cafe food was good and the breakfast buffet had a very nice spread.   Overall, we enjoyed staying there but I will not select this place for large groups in the future.",N

But, awhile back, I started getting my hair done across the street at Studio 110 and having cocktails before and after at the Whitehall across the street (seriously, try going to your next hair appointment loaded - it's super fun.)  Anyway, it's not your typical hotel bar.  And the food is delicious.  Specifically, the pot stickers (those are the ones that are steamed right?)  Well, these motherf*ckers changed my life.  That and their pizzas.  delicious.  use the hot chili oil.  do it!  Me and two others split a pizza and had a dozen dumplings (they had a few -- i had many) and a a delicious Cab.  I was in heaven.  Pure heaven.  Do it.  The next time you are downtown or at Studio 110, go here for food and drinks.  Plus, when you walk to the back bar area (not the restaurant) you can sit on big plush couches and chairs and hang out and drink and eat.  It's so not typical Michigan Ave. I bet staying at the hotel is nice too...get loaded and roll on up to bed.",N
3018,"There are some pretty harsh reviews on this hotel.  I've come to realize that not all the rooms in the hotel are the same bc I can't say I have some of the same complaints. PROS: convenient location views of navy pier/lake michigan friendly/helpful staff Bliss products!!! car service to local attractions (must reserve in advance) CONS: crowded elevators in the evenings due to the bar upstairs thin walls (I'm a heavy enough sleeper not to hear anything, but the bf said otherwise) All in all, I had a good experience and would stay here again.",N
1906,"This review is strictly about ""The Living Room Bar"" in the lobby. Loved it. Maybe it's because we were there early on a Saturday or because it wasn't a busy weekend, but we had the place practically to ourselves. We strolled in just for drinks on a whim while walking home. It's romantic, quiet and has cool decor.   Our server was prompt and attentive at the right times and the drink list is great.  Sure, it's probably $12 or so for the average drink, but it's a lounge-type place where you go to start of the night or to end it. I'd definitely go back if I was wandering by again.",N
1791,"We were at the Hotel Allegro for an Industry Analyst event.  I could not have expected worse. At first glance, you figured it couldn't be too bad as a Kimpton.  The unfortunate issue - service and the people were excellent.  However, the rooms just sucked.  Imagine your normal hotel room and 1/3 that size. Cramp in a king size bed and add a bathroom that's also 1/3 the size.  The building has that old hotel smell where things are musky but covered up with some paint smell.  The bathroom has showers with modern fixtures but remind you of that nyc studio you rented with 5 other people out of college.  The paints peeling on the base boards, the carpet is new, but something is wrong. I would stay at the Marriott, Renaissance, Westin, or any where else.",N
446,"Finally a decent hotel on the southside.  I have not stayed there, but I had a friend stay there, and his room was just fine.  Definately not the best, but when you go to visit an awesome city like Chicago, all you really need is a clean place to lay your head.  Now to be straight up, this place is not downtown, and there is not much in walking distance, so be prepared for that, but if you are driving then this is probably a great spot (no $40 per night parking charge).  And also, the Sports Bar in the hotel, seems to be a nice gathering spot for cool African American urbanites.  I met some friends at the bar the other night to watch the Chicago/Greenbay game, and the place was packed.  Everyone had their Bears shirts on and were having a great time.  The bar staff seemed to be a bit overwhelmed, and the appitizers that they had sitting out NEVER had the heaters turned on, so they might want to pay a little more attention to that, but over all I think that this place has the potential to be the place to be.  No more running to the north side.  And I also noticed that they have a nice new restaurant, that I will be trying out in the next few weeks.  The atmosphere is awesome.   The hostess was very nice and gave some good basic information.  I sure hope that it lives up to its potential.",N

526,"I'm completely torn on how exactly to rate this hotel. There were a lot of things I liked about it, and I will probably stay here again, but it could use some improvements. The Hampton Inn is truly within walking distance of everything we really needed. We drove from Detroit, parked the truck, and only used it when going outside of downtown. We walked the magnificent mile, we walked to Millenium and Grant Parks, we walked to Navy Pier, I walked to get Kolten's hair cut. It's in a great location! Parking: never cheap doing valet! But for $42/day....We were staying here for 3 1/2 days... and it's just not justifiable in my book. I opted for the privately owned parking lot across the street for $25/day with unlimited in-and-out privileges! Note: cash only! It was impossible to get a smile out of the owner too. Valet/Bell Hops: great during the day! They saw us coming with the stroller and opened all of the doors =) At night, we were pretty much on our own. That's not a true complaint, but it should be more consistent. Breakfast: continental breakfast! The hot foods changed each morning but the rest was still more than enough to fill me up before starting out our day. Fresh fruit [grapefruit, pineapple, and oranges], box cereal, muffins, bagels, juice, coffee.... a definite plus when vacationing! Price: Excellent for the amenities offered!! Remember to book it with the discount [AAA, etc] to ensure the price quoted reflects the discount. They even allowed late check-out without any extra cost since no one had booked our particular room, which allowed us to get in some last minute stops without driving around with all of our goodies. Pool was a great way to get Kolten used to swimming and to wind down in the afternoon. It's not olympic size but there is also a jacuzzi tub and steam room in the pool area on the 2nd floor. Hotel key entry. The room itself: -industrial view. We were not blessed with a city view. More like the alleyway, but that's okay- we wanted to see the city up close and personal..not from the room window. Plus, when we were in the room, the shades were closed to drown out the light, to lull Kolten to sleep. -Major plus for mom's/traveling with young ones: kitchenette. FRIDGE, stove, microwave, dishwasher and sink. Perfect for storing Kolten's gallon of milk, drinks, fruits, string cheese, and all of our water and snacks! I was really relieved when the honey mentioned we would have the kitchenette!! -living room partitioned off with solid french-like doors. The doors needed some serious WD-40! It made the most obnoxious loud screech whenever you tried to open it. It was useless to try to open them quietly without the monster waking up. The teeth clenching and eye squint didn't help either! -Couch, a chair with ottoman in the living room and another identical set in the bedroom, 2 flat screen TVs- one in the living room and one in the bedroom, desk and office chair, kitchenette table and chairs, coffee tables, etc. Keep in mind the furniture isn't ""dingy"" per se, it could use some updating, or maybe a good steam cleaning. The upholstery looked kind of grandma-ish. -The bed- king sized with white linens and breakfast tray. This is where the magic happens...LOL! Surprisingly, this bed didn't give me the hee-bee-gee-bee's like some hotels have in the past with their floral bedspread and nasty blankets. This my friends, is comfy, clean, and crisp. Notes: 1. When up in the morning and getting a slow start, remember to put the ""Resting"" tag on door....or else the housekeeper will get a peek of your goods coming out of the shower! 2. When tilting the 1 1/2 yr old back in the office chair and spinning it around, always check underneath to make sure it has both bolts... or else the back falls off along with the child. Thankfully, he was alright, and the manager on duty came up apologizing and filed an incident report. We also got a replacement chair. I would stay here again and recommend it to my friends, if they weren't looking to stay in a penthouse-style hotel.",N
3819,"We stayed here during a recent trip to Chicago. The hotel is very conveniently located, within walking distance of numerous restaurants and shops. As other reviewers have mentioned, the rooms have floor to ceiling windows which have black out shades, clean/modern bathrooms, and comfortable bed/pillows. The staff were all very nice and friendly during our stay. Would definitely stay here again in the future.",N
4613,"Pros: Nice location, convenient to many restaurants and touristy locations. Friendly staff Awesome ""business center"" aka computers that you can use to surf the net for free! And free printing too! Con: Rooms ARE very tiiiinnnyyy!! Not insufficient, but very cramped. I wouldn't say this is up to par for a 4-star hotel as it's listed on priceline.  But definitely a really good 3-star hotel.",N
5454,"My favorite hotel in Chicago! The service is EXCELLENT! They will help you up the elevator, walk you to your room, ask if there is anything you need, anything at all. And where else can you order room service @ 3am? Love those turkey croissant after a long night. Gorgeous, large rooms- great city views. Wonderful linens. Spa bathrooms. Impeccable service. Underground valet parking. Gotta love it.",N
5673,"This is the best hotel in Chicago.  I've stayed at the Park Hyatt, the Peninsula, the Drake, the Westin - and this by far my favorite.  Part of the ""Small Luxury Hotels of the World"" group, the Talbott fits the luxury bill without draining the wallet.  Centrally located in the Gold Cost (close to my office, Equinox, Exhale, restaurants and shopping) and across the street from some of the best cupcakes in Chicago at More, the Talbott has beautifully appointed rooms, and a staff that makes you feel at home while traveling (Robert and Stacy are wonderful). There are no words to describe how comfortable the beds are at this hotel, and I'm a huge fan of the Molton Brown toiletries they provide.  It's also great that they offer a free guest pass for workouts at the Equinox at 900 N. Michigan Ave right around the corner.  The Talbott is not only my favorite hotel in Chicago, but one of the best hotels in the US that I have experienced.  You definitely will not be sorry if you make this your home in Chicago.",N
3035,"I was treated to the stay at the W for my birthday and really its everything I could have asked for.  Our room was comfortable, intimate, and modern with an incredible panoramic view of the lake.  Before we headed out for the night we took advantage of the mini bar and some of the goodies provided (a nice little spread to which tempts you to stretch your wallet even further), which was very relaxing.   We enjoyed dinner downstairs and indulged in their door service breakfast in the morning, both of which are quite pricey, but well worth it.  Our doorman was even kind enough to bring us something for our hangovers  when he saw the shape we were in in the morning.   The hotel merchandise is a bit much and a little tacky, but we had a great experience and I am sure we will be celebrating there in the future.",N
4792,Great hotel - MUCH better crowd on weeknights,Y
38,"Location is AWESOME. It's across the street from Water Tower. If I was doing a girls night out, I would stay here! Yeah, the room we got was small. But this is an experience! It's a beautiful, historic hotel! The room design is different...artistic, some of my friends loved it! Some-hated it!",N
4997,"We have stayed at the essex twice . it is close to the red line, Grant Park and they offer a shuttle service . Yes the beds are small but so are the rooms . Our room was clean and neat and yes the lobby and bar are older but the bar does have cold Old Style . If location and saving a few bucks are for you try the Essex.....I can say we have had no problems staying here.",Y
5634,"It is said; that you learn more about people when there is a problem, than when everything is going smoothly.  I am a huge fan of Westin and W hotels and they are my first choice wherever I travel. Unfortunately, I ran into some problems while attempting to check-in with my family last week.  We were faced with a couple of reservation mishaps and billing issues. I want to commend the managers, including the General Manager Peter, for the manner in which they addressed my concerns  Admittedly I was a tough customer, and I was caught up in making a point instead of appreciating their gracious understanding of what had happened. A bottle of wine, along with a thoughtful note were sent up to the room immediately. This hotel was lovely and their staff is a first class. Our stay was enjoyable and I would recommend this hotel for their beautiful rooms, excellent food, and trendy atmosphere.  I can honestly say that they will go above and beyond to assure you a memorable visit.",N
5522,"On the outside this hotel is quite nice, compliments the neighborhood very well and is relaxing to the eye and mind. Inside is nice too but kind of looks on the cheap side but it's a Best Western so I wont be too hard on them. The folk at the desk were nice and chatted guests up when appropriate which was nice. The folk at the desk seemed to actually care about peoples stay and were helpful on questions on where to grab a bite to eat and get around. The room I got was a standard room, nothing fancy for me. My view sucked but the room was clean and comfortable enough to catch a Bears (GO BEARS!) game in the room and just relax from my flight before heading out for a bit of booty shaking at Berlin (see review) for Madonna night. The hotel is a distance from the red line about a mile but not a bad walk weather permitting but there are also buses near by the hotel. i didn't take the buses as everything was within walking distance from my hotel or I just grabbed a cab. If you get hungry or a bit thirsty there is a Jewlles and a Treasure Island just within walking distance from the hotel. I'd love to stay here again but it books up so fast and during baseball season (GO CUBS!) good luck cause prices go way up.",N
153,"After staying at a big hotel like the Hyatt, I really appreciated The Whitehall Hotel, and how quiet and cozy it is. Location, fabulous, a block away from the Hancock Observatory, and a few blocks away from Oak Street beach, and the red line. The room and bathroom were very nice (see pictures). Luis approved. Layout of room was OK, until I opened the drawers. The bed and drawers are too close to each other, if the drawers are open it blocks the path to walk to the other side of the room. I did not like this, it didn't make me feel fancy anymore. No nice view here. I don't know if I was just not lucky enough to get a nice view or if all rooms are like this. But since I didn't plan to look out the window that much, it didn't bother me. One more thing I will complain about is the temperature of the room. I don't know if it was me that didn't know how to work the thermostat thing or if It was set to a standard temperature. I love my room to be über cold, so I can sleep, and every time I would get back to my room after going out, it would be too hot for me. No likey my room warm. So I had to adjust it every time.  Annoying. The tv was pretty old too, a little upgrade and new furniture wouldn't hurt. Things I liked, were that it was quiet, it didn't feel like a mall, not a lot of people. Most of the time the elevator was not crowded, and it was fast. The service was very nice. The person at the front desk recommended me going to a nearby Internet cafe to use the computer instead of using the hotel's. That way I would get to use the Internet and get a nice cup of coffee instead of just spending my money at the hotel's business center. I thought that was nice of him. I stayed here for 4 days. I probably was that guy that came in at 2am every night, that someone commented earlier on their review, but I did not slam the door, the door makes a big noise when it locks. Sorry. Lol. Anyways. I loved coming back to my room and sleeping in that bed after a long night. I'd definitely stay here again. The things I complained about are no biggie, but if fixed they would get a 5 star.",N
3651,"Staying the night in this classic hotel was an enjoyable experience. The executive suite had a cold and uninviting decor. It reminded me of a place where the mafia gang would meet to plan their *business*. However, the suite was HUGE. OMG, this thing had like 3 connected rooms. The view of the city was blah....looking into the windows of the highrise across the street. BUT the BED....OMG. I want that bed in my home. SO why does this place get 4 stars?....well, mainly cuz I have always wanted to stay here so now when I drive south on LSD I look up at this magnificent structure and think ""Yup I've stayed there."" This place has history and class. Whatever my experience here was....it was still an enjoyable one.",N
4245,"The room was nice with a great view of the water. The location is also good. The room was prtty modern and I didn't have any complaints. I pricelined it for I think $75 which isnt bad. Remember, parking is at least $35 a night in this area. Nice place for the money....",N
4356,Great location and nice ambiance! The gym is one of the best hotel fitness centers I have seen. It's a great place to bring clients for a drink. Service is generally slow.,N
3953,"This is a hotel with a great location and great prices! I went to Chicago with a friend in 09/2010 to explore the city.  We did not plan on being at the hotel very much as we only had 3 days there (4 nights)... so we went for the great deal. After booking the hotel and reading the Yelp reviews, I'll admit, I was NERVOUS. I don't know who is writing these horrible reviews for this hotel, but in my opinion, they were completely unwarranted.   We were central to so many great places, and very close to public transportation. It was about a 15 minute walk down Michigan Ave to the river and the Magnificent Mile. Grant Park is right across the street. The Aquarium is a 10 minute walk.  The location was definitely the best thing about this hotel. We spoke to the concierge staff a few times too, and they were all very knowledgeable, friendly and willing to help. I am not one that has to stay in 5 star hotels with every imaginable amenity. When I'm traveling, I view a hotel as a place to rest my head at night only. Why would I want to stay in my hotel room all day when I'm in a great city like Chicago? The hotel was definitely older, but I think that gives it character! Of course, I love older buildings... my home was built in 1895. The elevators were a little small.. but who cares! My only comment was that the hallways on our floor smelled a little bit like an older woman's perfume.... but whatever! Who knows, maybe someone was staying in one of the rooms on my floor with really bad taste in perfume? The room was absolutely clean and acceptable and perfect for our needs. That being said, if you are someone who does not appreciate older charm & who needs top of the line amenities at a hotel, don't stay here. You won't be happy and you'll just be one of those people who writes a really horrible review for a perfectly acceptable hotel.",N
2741,"This review is more for their wedding planner/event planner not the hotel. If you are planning a wedding, I suggest going somewhere else. I can't even remember his name because it was like a bad dream. First, there was no congrats! That is just a basic greeting. Also, we were planning a wedding with a very large budget, but he was making us feel like he was doing us a favor. He just seemed liked a miserable person who was far from helpful and also suggested we move our wedding day to a Sunday when we clearly said we wanted a Sat. night wedding. I am a low key bride and this was the first time I could see how people go insane planning. There are many great hotels in the city for weddings..go somewhere else!",N
3042,"It is dark in the hallways, dark in the rooms. I understand the point of trying to be trendy, but I kind of like the idea of seeing if the room is clean or not.  This former Days Inn, next to a construction site for the next year btw, has small rooms and a bar that pretends to be trendy. W was hot in the early part of this century, but seems more vegas than anything else. Too many other hotels in Chicago that are better than this one.",N
3186,"This hotel was recommended.  I spoke to the manager and was told I would have a lake view room, which did not happen.  I prepaid for room and discovered if I had waited, I could have gotten room for a lot less.  The promised free in room Internet was going to be charged.  When I asked to speak with the manager who assured me over the phone that my requests would be satisfied, I was told she was not available the five nights we stayed.",N
265,"As a single traveler (well, OK, I do have my teddy bear with me), it's hard to sometimes find cost-effective hotels to stay, especially in city centres. I've become more discerning in deciding the important things in a hotel over the years I've been traveling. Where I used to prioritise a swimming pool and not swim, I now look for proximity to public transport and an internet connection. Seneca Suites is an older hotel reflected in its dark wooden decor but its location a block east of the Magnificent Mile is its outstanding feature. It's 4 blocks from the Chicago Red line station. My room was huge - separate bedroom, living room and kitchen. Teddy and I could almost have a room each! Although I ate out on this trip, the kitchen would certainly allow self catering to cut down on costs. I didn't suffer the problems mentioned in other reviews - the water was hot for my showers and the decor wasn't worn out. The free wifi was fast and reliable. There were 2 big TVs with a great range of channels - yup, I was stuck on the Food channel most of the time. Seneca was a bargain for this part of town",N
1172,"I'd say by far, this is one of the hotels I actually consider staying in because of its free parking and super friendly and helpful staff.  Like another person said... this isn't 5 star or anywhere close to it, BUT... it is a place that gives you the opportunity to rest your head and body after a long day of walking around downtown Chicago.  Who really NEEDS all the glitzy 5 star stuff when you'll be out all day long and evening and/or night in downtown?  Waste of money to have to have a hotel room with 1000 thread count sheets, mint on pillows, terry cloth bathrobes, et cetera... if you ask me.  Save your money on things that are longer lasting... Anyhow... had a good stay here when I went to see Madonna perform at United Center :)  Will definitely stay again :)",N
1686,"You know what?  I am a big fan of Hotel Allegro.  I'm not in creative writing mode today, so you get a list of why they're great. 1. I think our Hotwire price was about $120, but the regular price is only in the $190-ish range. 2. You are right down in the loop, which is super convenient. 3. You can bring your pet with you for no additional charge. 4. The staff is *really* friendly, and not in the fake, we're-only-nice-because-you-pay-us way. 5. The lobby is decorated in a very eclectic fashion.  I'm talkin' hot pink and wavy neon blue velour couches-eclectic. 6. Free wine every day from 5-6pm. 7. Adorable, 1940s-meets-Ikea rooms.  They are technically small rooms, yes, but I thought it was very cozy.  I mean, do you really NEED an enormous hotel room?  Shouldn't you be out enjoying the city or something? 8. Aveda shampoo, conditioner, and moisturizer.  Free! 9. Free New York Times. 10. Comfy bed with extremely comfy pillows & linens. 11. iPod dock/alarm clock! And the best two things: 12. Not only can you get a variety of standard convenience items for free from the front desk, but you can also get ""fashion tape.""  Fashion tape!  So you can tape up your cleavage!  For free! 13. There is always techno bumping in the elevators.  It's like a crazy, eurotrash party at all hours of the day.  11 a.m., 2 pm., 1:30 a.m.....really.  Who doesn't like to have dance parties in elevators? P.S. Not that I'm defending the soggy nachos that another reviewer had, but I'm not sure why they were charged $28.  The price listed for nachos was $11.  I only noticed this because my fiance had mentioned that someone on Yelp got $28 soggy nachos.  So, I'm not really sure what happened there.",N
4491,"A great downtown place to stay.  The perfect location.  It seemed like everything downtown was just steps away.  So was the El, which made all of Chicago steps away.  Great bed and shower, and I liked being surrounded by all the history.   I was put off by some of the extra charges, which seemed exorbitant.  Parking is one, but that was not a problem for me.  Why do people drive to Chicago anyway?  Any other way to get there is better.  Internet access was $15 a day, which is irritating when really cheap motels where I stay NEVER charge for wi-fi.     And I could have really used a late check-out, just an hour or so,  but they charge FIFTY DOLLARS to check out even one hour late.  Geez.  So I hauled my small suitcase around for a couple of hours between hotel check-out time and Chicago-departure time.   No cheap motel has ever charged me anything for a late check-out, either.   So the Palmer House can be a great place to stay IF you don't need any extras.",N

The new decor (they just finished the ballroom in March) is classic and very posh.... The food was beyond our vision (we're big foodies!!) and the service is the best in the city!!! We had a large wedding and we planned it in 4 Months from start to finnish and Marc was there every step of the way... He knows everything about weddings and went the extra mile for us...  The hotels rooms are brand new and they hotel staff is AMAZING with children (We have a 3 yr old ) and they brought hims snacks, toys, his own little bath robe, dvds... A great place for families to stay at...

3047,"Why does Chicago get the most unhappening W lobby-bar? Most other W hotels nationwide you walk into and the lobby is a vibrant, cool, sexy, happening bar/lounge on weekend nights. This one just isn't. The music was really good, but the atmosphere was amiss. It closes around 1AM. We went upstairs to the bar/lounge and that was as unhappening and unexciting on a Friday night. They started shutdown mode at 1:30AM.",N
5832,My wife and I stayed here July 30th. We arrived at three oclock in the afternoon and they said our room was not ready yet and it would probably be about an hour. We had reservations for 4 pm so I told the clerk this was not acceptable. They finally got us in our room about 3:30. The room looked nice but the air was not on. When we returned about 6pm the room was 80 degrees. I called the front desk and when the person arrived he told me there was no one available to fix the air and I could just open a window. (it was 89 degrees outside) Needless to say we spent a very uncomfortable night. The room was nice but I felt like the service could have been a lot better!,Y
1493,Loved my four night stay in July. Excellent location. We had a king suite and it was clean and comfortable. Join their loyalty program for free drink delivery in the morning. I love this service! Room service & house keeping are friendly. What I didn't care for is that you must enter the building and take it to level 3 to then take another set of elevators to the hotel rooms. I thought the room rate was fair.,N
1693,"I was excited when we booked this Kimpton hotel through Hotwire, especially after having a fun experience earlier this year at Hotel Monaco in Denver. I was expecting more free wine and cheese and hotel full of quirky character. I got all that AND a mirror in front of our bed. ""Why is there a mirror on the wall in front of our bed?"" He looked at me when I asked that question. He's not complaining; he loved it that there was a mirror in front of our bed. Cheers to Hotel Allegro for keeping it kinky. P.S. Just valet it if you're staying overnight. $44 for self-park vs. $49 for valet. Yup, that's what we get for staying at a hotel in the Loop.",N

We had a great stay, and I would love to stay at the Fairmont again.",N
989,"We ended up in one of their modern themed rooms - and boy was it eclectic, and TOTALLY up my alley. It was on one of the higher floors, so the floor-to-ceiling view was an unexpected bonus - especially since we booked our summer Saturday night here on chance, not reading any reviews beforehand. I'm not sure if all the rooms were like the one we got, or if we just lucked out completely, but WOW. Modern yet comfortable furnishings. Large and spacious bathroom with colorful polka dots EVERYWHERE. And even though the room itself left little space to run around and do cartwheels, we were pleasantly happy with our stay. We got a good deal (price divided by 2), and it was a pedestrian friendly commute to and from the bar/club scene. Highly recommend this place as an alternative to the chain hotels/motels for an authentic and one-of-a-kind experience in the heart of Chi-town. Request one of the 'modern rooms' to be amazed at how a fun duvet cover can change your hotel experience!",N

My only complaint is that the general style of the hotel is a little too old school for my taste. Anyway,  all in all, it was a lovely stay. OH!

You cannot do much better in the city of Chicago.  The only negative (and it is a small one) is that it is close to Northwestern Hospital, so there are a lot of sirens in the area.   The staff of the hotel was incredibly friendly and helpful.  The doorman quickly hailed a cab for us, walking down to the corner to do so.   The room was clean and bright.  Wi-fi worked good.  The bathroom was clean and well stocked with towels. I had a corner suite and I found that the room was rather drafty (hence 4 stars instead of 5).  I had to turn the heat up higher than I normally like to in order to compensate for the draft.",N
3591,"As a fan of anything with historic significance- my recent stay at the Drake made me imagine I was back in the 1920's living the life of the upper class who have stayed there over the years. Now granted- as with any historic building- your room is kind of the ""luck of the draw"". Over the years rooms have been combined, cut in half, etc to maximize the space but that is just one of the quirks of old hotels. The Drake has recently also undergone a remodel so all the spaces are new, clean and up to date. My room, on this stay, was fabulous. It was huge- easily accommodating a king sized bed, desk chair and ottoman, dresser, bar and overlooked Lake Michigan. The marbled bath was also huge- in fact- you could have put additional furniture into it. The ceilings were at least 15 feet tall and bordered in crown molding. The hallway was wide and regal. But I also know from previous stays, that some rooms are smaller, have no view, and some have 2 bathrooms and a small bedroom- and some are suites. If when you push open your door and are dissatisfied- you owe it to yourself to call the desk to see if there is anything else available. Hilton Hotels now owns the Drake so all the expected amenities are there- the comfy soft beds and linens, the Crabtree and Evelyn bath products, the well stocked mini bar and good service (although I am a frequent traveler at Hilton hotels so that may have helped out in the service area) My room rate was only $139 per night (plus an additional $49 per night for valet parking- next time I'm leaving the car at home!) One of my favorite parts of the stay was a book that was in the room chronicling the history of the Drake hotel through letters and pictures of all the famous people who had gone through it's doors. And oh if those doors could speak. Queens, Kings, celebrities have all stayed at the Drake. Also interesting were the pictures of the old ads that billed the Drake as the place to get ""Lake Michigan air"" for only $5 per night (1920) I may not be a Queen, a King or any kind of a celebrity. But for the weekend I spent at the Drake, I certainly felt like one.",N
3372,"Stayed here for 6 nights during the last week of April, 2011.  My wife and I were traveling with our 2 kids, aged 3 1/2 and 9 months.  Now, you have to understand, the main thing about this hotel is the location.  You're not booking a room at the Ritz or the Waldorf/Astoria.  It serves very well as a functional hotel, but if you're looking for 5 star quality, look elsewhere. Having said all of that, we enjoyed our stay here.  The location is on Michigan Avenue, across from Grant Park.  We booked through Expedia (if I remember right) and got the room for around $120 per night (average...remember, we checked in on a Friday).  We got a room on the 4th floor (14 floors total in the place).  The prior reviews are correct, the room is small...compared to other hotels out there.  If you want to stay in your room the whole time, seek elsewhere.  Our family of 4 was crammed, but we had what we needed.  There is a mini-fridge hidden under the TV (hint:  you can adjust the temperature using the thermostat on the back of the fridge).  There is a coffee bar too so you can brew your own java.  There's a flat-panel TV with plenty to choose from (several HBO channels included).  The sink in the bathroom is no myth...it's SMALL.  It's a round sink; I'd put it at about 10 inches in diameter (no exaggeration here...it's about as big as a soccer ball).  That said, it does it's job...it's a sink people, not a hot tub!  Speaking of tubs, there's one in the room (but it lacks jets, so it's just a tub, not a ""hot"" tub).  The shower head needs an upgrade on the water pressure.  My theory is that there's a pressure reducer in there, but that's just a theory...you decide for yourself.  The toilet also does it's job well.  Our room was on the Hilton side of the building, towards the rear of the hotel, so we had a decent view of the Sears (or whatever it's called these days) Tower.  We were pleased with the room. The staff were very nice throughout our stay.  The housekeeping folks were a little bland, but still tended to our needs (they were like mashed potatoes with no salt & pepper added).  The valet guys were good to us.  The daily parking rate was $37.  That may sound excessive, but the Hilton next door is $55 per day.  We were there for 6 days, so...do the math! The hotel restaurant was undergoing renovations while we were there, so we were provided a ""complimentary"" continental breakfast.  Now, we all know what ""complimentary"" means here:  the price is included in your room rate, so you'd better get down here every morning and scarf down all the pastries & coffee you can consume...AND WE DID JUST THAT!  Seriously though, they could have provided nothing for breakfast, so we were glad to get what we got. There is an indoor pool at the Essex with a lifeguard on duty during regular pool hours.  The pool is ""heated"", and by this I mean ""not outside temperature"".  They have a chart with the pool temperature for guests to see.  The average during our stay was 82 fahrenheit, but I disagree...I think ""lukewarm"" says it all.  In any case, the pool is small, but adequate.  There is also a sauna in the pool area, but sadly, no steam room.  The do pipe in good music in the pool area too (mainly classic rock that isn't too ""classic rock""...i.e. Freebird/Foghat/ACDC/etc).  The exercise room is very good too.  There's 3 bike machines, 3 treadmills, 2 or 3 Elliptical machines, plus several weight machines.  There are a few TV's to watch while working out. As stated in the beginning, the location of this place is key.  Grant Park is across the street, there's a Red Line train stop that's less than a 3-block walk away...you're staying on Michigan Avenue for Pete's sake!  There are several places to eat within a 5-block walk as well.  All in all, we enjoyed staying here and would recommend it to anyone that isn't too picky about the actual hotel they're staying at.  Enjoy your trip!",N
2229,"I don't see what the big deal is.  I've stayed at this hotel twice, and the rooms are super small and nothing special.  I think the ballrooms are nice, as I have been to a wedding here, and a company event here as well.  But other than that I don't feel like its worth the money.  I haven't had a bad experience with the staff, but I didn't feel like they were over the top extraordinary.I wouldn't stay here again unless it was free.  I think there are lots of cooler hotels in Chicago.",N
1337,The service wasn't really up to the Ritz Carlton standard in my opinion. Could have been that I didn't stay there long enough... I don't know. It is in a great location right in water tower center. The hotel is in desperate need of being updated. It is like 1980 in the lobby and conference center. My room was updated and a lake view room which I liked but it was somewhat smaller than my room at the Four Seasons in Chicago. Overall I liked the Four Seasons in Chicago a lot better and would stay there over the Ritz Carlton. I know they are owned by the same company but the Four Seasons is totally updated and I liked it a lot better.,N
4063,"I thought this was a decent hotel for a first time visit to Chicago. Like just with everyone else, you can get a pretty good rate via Priceline. Despite all the numerous conventions and events going on, they still need to fill up those vacant rooms. Of course if I had to choose on my next visit to the Windy City, I would choose another hotel just for a different experience. Check-in was nice and easy. The lady helping us was pleasant enough. But before I could even request a bigger room or a nicer view, we were quickly handed the keys. They probably have a big red sign flashing in red on their computer screen saying ""casual tourists, not corporate accounts."" I asked if we could get access to the Regency Club for the free breakfast daily, that got shot down. Extra $75. No thanks. Our room was no-frills, with a nice big view of an office building. Big flat screen TV and a comfortable bed, that's pretty much all we need. The walls are as thin as tissue paper, as you can hear people flushing the toilet, sneezing, or talking in the hallway. No fridge, no free Wi-Fi, or any other ""luxury"" amenities. Safe to say, I wouldn't pay anywhere near the standard rates listed on their website. Priceline prices, yeah it's about right. Maybe even a little less. Of course, the biggest advantage with this hotel is the location. We stayed in the West tower, so the elevator conveniently spits you out to Wacker street and you're on your way. It's centrally located, so you can either go north to Magnificent Mile or south to the Loop, where there is Millenium Park, Willis Tower, Art Institute, etc. Plus, it's close to all the bus and train stations. Oh, and the workout room isn't too shabby either. Gotta work off all that deep dish pizza somehow.",N
1196,"I worked on a startup in Chicago in 2010. I have stayed in this hotel for 115 nights since then..so there's little I haven't seen here - good or bad. One time, I hadn't slept in three days and was looking down at my phone while walking, so I even saw the ladies room. It smelled like roses. As someone who travels a lot, the single most important thing to me is service. You get used to the TSA, you can live with bad food, but the last thing you want is someone pissing you off or not meeting your expectations. This Hyatt consistently went above and beyond and earned every one of their five stars. What's good? Very nice building/rooms, amazing view, incredibly friendly staff, easy taxi access, nice gym, and pretty good food. What could use work? The prices are tough - room service is overpriced, and if you aren't a Diamond member, wifi could get expensive. Also, although it's extremely close to downtown, it's not quite walkable, and there isn't much directly surrounding the hotel. Staying there as much as I did, it was like being at home. 99% of the time everything was perfect (I even got scotch and cake on my birthday). What mattered more, though, was that when things weren't right, like a messed up reservation or loud neighbors, they were taken care of immediately. The Hyatt O'Hare is a slightly more modern hotel (less convention-y) but I stay here whenever I can. I saw the staff do extraordinary things for people time and time again, so I know this wasn't all because I stayed there so much. I'm actually coming back in August with some friends just to visit. I highly recommend the hotel and still hope that one day, I will marry one of the girls from the front desk in the Forno Italian Trattoria.",N
3098,"I love this hotel.  The big W outside the hotel made it for me and then some.  Altho our room was not overlooking the lake, we had a good view of downtown Chicago.   The room was pretty amazing and I love those plantation windows they have for the bathroom.  You can opt to open them if you are just doing your makeup while having to talk to whoever was with you in the room.  It was nice and different.  Even the bathroom door was not your usual door but a sliding one instead. The lobby bar/lounge was a comfort.  I ordered a sampler dessert and I didn't want to share it.  Drinks were okay.  I was also able to use the pool once, warm and big enough for laps.  They had threadmills and weights if you feel like working out. We made a good choice as this was walking distance to the Navy Pier.  We were able to make trips back and forth to the Pier, Michigan Ave etc. and our hotel very conveniently.  And it was close to almost everything. I'll stay at W again, anytime!",N
4500,"Did I book the Palmer House on Hotwire- Yes! Did I get it for $100 on a Sat. night-  Yes!  I am not even joking this was the convo I had with the front desk guy.

Me: Sounds great.  Clerk:  The room doesn't have a bed in it. Me:  Wait .  .  . You are trying to give us a room without a bed in it.  Clerk:  it is a very spacious room, we could try and get a roll away for you.  Me:  uhhh.  . That's not going to work for us. Clerk:  that is the only room we have available.  Me: the only room you have doesn't have a bed.  You are going to have to try harder than that.  Clerk:  Well.  .  .how about a smoking room. Me: No- try again.  Finally normal room non smoking.  .  . And that jackwagon was trying to give us a room without a bed.  RIDICULOUS!!!!!",N
4968,"We attended a wedding here & it was FUN & really memorable because of the uniqueness of this old hotel!  I'll agree with the previous post that the low ceiling between the north & south sides of the top floor ball room can make it feel small, but it really is a special place. If you stay there you need to keep in mind that it was built in the 1920s or so & is a HISTORIC part of Chicago's history. It is not a modern Marriott so if you need this to be happy, then do not stay at The Allerton!Here's what I'll say about the wedding I went to. They give you a lot of space between the hall where the elevators let you out & then there was an extra room for the cocktail hour so that was nice. Lighting should have been  dimmer to support the romantic ambiance of a wedding, but some of the older guests probably appreciated the bright lights.Food was good, staff was fun and upbeat, & we had a great ole time in the bar downstairs before we went up to the reception at 630. Nice surprise to have another bar waiting for us once we got out of the elevator for the reception line with the wedding party! Yee haw!Do not stay here if you're an impatient, type-A person. They have a small reception desk but the staff was really nice. We saw one business guy almost blow a gasket while he was waiting in a long line to check out though!If you're wanting your wedding there like the previous post, just know that it's an old historic hotel and the bar has to be outside the ballroom due to space, but if your guests want a drink, they'll find the bar! I'm a good friend of the bride's  & the organizing of her reception was probably a little more stressful than it should have been for the amount of money they spent!  Sound system needs some improvement too, but city views out the windows were SPECTACULAR, and it's really the guests made the reception a great one.I'd stay there again.Oh, my husband said to write that he liked the butter in the restaunt. Waiter & busboy were exceptionally attentive. Hubby thought  steak was a little small but he's a bit of a glutton so take that with a grain of salt.!",Y
1131,"Great location (steps to Millennium Park and Michigan Avenue) and well appointed rooms. We actually got a pretty good rate here ($120/night) through Priceline, but standard room rates are typically more than double that. For OOT guests, parking can be rather pricey around these parts -- the Fairmont charges $50/day with in/out privileges -- so if you're not planning on moving your car, park in the Aon Building (directly across from the hotel parking), it's $13/day on weekends.",N

Was also excited to be around the corner from the Hard Rock and their lobby bar, but the place was dead while I was here.  Front desk staff were very helpful, and was able to score a room on one of the top floors with an amazing view and a slightly larger room than I was supposed to get.  Love the $20 trick. :)  Internet worked really poorly for me the entire time I was there, which was a bit frustrating.  Also had to deal with parking my car a few blocks away for like $25/night as opposed to the hotel's $50/night parking.  Wouldn't have been that bad was it not for the cold weather.",N

3923,"Fantastic location, especially during Lollapalooza 2007. The service is top-notch and the room is quite comfortable. In our double bed room, there was no mini-bar. No big deal, though. There was, instead, plenty of room, a flat screen TV, a roomy-enough bathroom and ample lighting. Downstairs you'll find a game room, a bar/lounge, a restaurant and a gift shop. There's also access to Internet, if you fork over the monies. The lobby, along with the room, is clean. This place has character. If you prefer to stay in super upscale places with a modern touch, don't book your room here. This place is full of history and class. And after a long day at Lollapalooza, the bright, red sign ""Hotel Congress"" beckons warmly... It's definitely a nice place to stay. After all, Grant Park is nearby. You're also within walking distance of great places to eat - whether you're looking for a smoothie stop, deli, pub or authentic deep-dish pizza.

2299,"We stayed here over the past weekend for a wedding.  We got a sweet discount for wedding guests, which was really the only reason we could afford to stay here.   The good: - LOCATION!  We were able to walk everywhere, which was great - Starbucks and bar in the lobby - the view! Our 39th floor room had a lakeview, and floor to ceiling windows with which to appreciate it.  It was by far the best view I have ever had in a hotel.   - Our room was comfortable (king size bed), flat-screen tv, good water pressure, no smells - the elevators are fast, which is great when you are up almost 40 stories The bad: - would have liked a mini fridge and free internet, but no one is perfect - the tv lost the cable signal for about an hour; however, there was a pretty severe thunderstorm going on (of course, that's why we wanted to watch tv and see the weather...) - parking was difficult.  We opted to do the off-site garage parking for $33/night (expensive, but what can you expect downtown?).  The first garage next to the hotel we pulled into was full, but made us pay $6 to get out. Gee, thanks.  We accidentally went by the next one, and when we tried to just do a lap around the block, we got stuck behind a parade that had shut down most of the area.  So it took us about an hour to turn around and get back to the hotel to park again.  The validation process was easy, however.  But next time we will probably just pay the extra to valet.   If we can afford it, we would definitely stay here again on another trip to Chicago.",N

761,"I'd call this hotel a WINO (Westin in Name Only).  Every Westin I've ever stayed in anywhere has been a clear cut above this poser, but it seems Starwood gets to call this a Westin because of the spectacular, unbeatable location.  And that's the only reason to stay here: Location, the best in the city. Lobby and staff are okay.  My issue was the shabby rooms, uninspired and needing renovation.  While the bed is still ""the bed"" -- truly wonderful -- the rooms at this Westin feel like a mid-tier chain (Ramada, Holiday Inn).  And beware, light sleepers: These rooms are loud.  I vividly heard all hallway activity inside my room as if it were being piped in by speaker.  As I feared, hallway noise (door slamming, in particular) jolted me awake three times, and I woke up feeling lousy. The TV doesn't have a channel guide, so you have to turn to each channel to see what's on.  Like some other Yelpers, I too got locked out during my stay, trying to negotiate their 1990 door fixtures and locking system.   It's all about location in Chicago, and this one can't be beat.  But sadly and surprisingly, Starwood has allowed this hotel to deteriorate.  Even an average Westin at this location would be incredible -- I hope they pull it together because today, this hotel aspires to average.",N

Good view if you can get a good angle at it.   SMALL ROOMS/SMALLER THAN THE OTHER HILTON'S: The rooms are smaller than the other Hilton Hotel rooms that I've been in; and, maybe, that's because I was paying the economy/ghetto price for my stay.

3501,We could barely find the hotel. No signs that said valet parking. We got to the front desk  area and it wasn't even a true front desk it was actually 2 desks. Then we took the one of the elevators up. They have 5 elevators (2 are service elevators which they say you can't use) the elevators are so small that you can barely fit 3 people in them.  Not to mention the fact that they are super slow. We got to our room on the 13th floor (i though hotels usually don't have a 13th.  We got off the elevator and as soon as you step off a room door is right in front of your face. The halls are do tight i felt like I was in the movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and I was waiting for a little oompa loompa to wall by! And we walked into this cramped little closet of a room with a king sized bed and we asked for 2 dbls when checking in.  So we went back down and asked for our double actually this happened with all four of our rooms.  They said the other gentleman in your party has your other keys.  We asked them to re program our current keys (13th floor) to the new room on the (16th) and they looked at us like we had 9 heads.  We got to our new room which had 2 beds. It was a larger room on the end which had windows all around with amazing views.  The room itself was very nice. I didn't however like the beds.  Way too low. I also didn't like the fact that they lighting in the bathroom was very minimal.  I had a hard time sleeping because of the beds and the fact that the hotel Is right in the middle of downtown but that is just me because I live in a quiet little suburb.We also spent $100 for 3 people for breakfast buffet which was not worth it at all!,N
3679,"Crushed velvet handrails - need I say more?!! This place blew my mind. I filmed a wedding here last weekend so needless to say I saw every aspect of this building, at all times of the day for 14 hours straight. If you're thinking of getting married here, DO IT. I truly have never seen a more gorgeous wedding - yes expensive but WORTH IT. I ate breakfast at the smaller (nonaligned) restaurant here and I was not impressed. The staff seemed to have been working here since the building was build but their attitudes were less than great. I also did get the last 15 minutes of the buffet but still, not impressed. The food for the wedding however was RIDICULOUS, I'm assuming they didn't bring in their own chef but who knows, I could be wrong. I wish I could be more help in the food area, but the building itself is incredible. Having passed this place over a hundred times on Lake Shore Drive and never have gone it, I was impressed. The Drake keeps the old feel of a vintage Chicago hotel while beaming with style and class of the upper social standings of millionaires. I felt...regal :)",N

3037,"Hotels like this make me aspire for more.  Earn a degree in gold-digging (or you know, become successful on my own...) This is an older building so it wasn't too impressive from the outside, inside, however, it was typical contemporary W design. Our room was ridiculous.  It was a 1 bedroom suite with not 1, but 2 plasmas, XM radio, and 2 bathrooms.  I love excess. The view overlooked the lake which looked like the ocean as well as Navy Pier (walking distance).  It reminded me of Ocean Beach in Miami.  Outside of the hotel are rocking chairs where you can relax with a drink (HIGHLY recommend the raspberry mojito or don julio tequila sunset/sunrise...).   The bed was heavenly.  The bathroom had the ""rain"" showerhead which if you read my review on the Four Season in Santa Barbara, I go on and on about my love of it.   In-room Bliss products are also great - I am hooked on their sage face wash. The service here was also excellent - they really strive to achieve their ""whatever, whenever"" service policy.  For example, we walked in late and missed the breakfast menu, but they were still able to serve us French Toast (albeit probably out of the garbage...).   Oh and for the health-conscious, their gym is amazing...but their indoor pool is definitely lacking (though you could easily just go across the street to the lake).",N

Although hotel parking is not a great deal, there is an outdoor lot nearby that charges only $25 for overnight parking. Overall great stay!",N
270,"I found this place through yelp and I am so thankful.  This place is really sweet and nice.  I was in Chicago recently for a conference on green building.  There weren't a lot of hotels in the immediate vicinity of the conference center and we were booking our hotel much too late to get the normal hotel spots.  Initially, we were looking at some other places.  I yelped these places and saw that they were often no good.  Some had mold issues or poor service or whatever.  Not this place.  It feels like an old apartment complex, slightly worn but cozy at the same time. The service is great.  Things aren't luxurious by any means but you cannot beat the location and the price.",N
3286,"Stayed for 1 night in July 2009 and it was great!  The hotel is in the Carbon & Carbide building, a beautiful example of Art Deco architecture.  Our room was surprisingly large and was well-decorated in muted grey tones in a Dwell Magazine style.  We lucked out and had a nice view of the city.  Our bathroom was sleek, but only had a large shower stall instead of a full tub.  The hotel's location is perfect--steps from Millennium Park, the Loop, the Chicago River, and several metro and train lines. The staff was helpful--especially Concierge Paula Nascimento, as she went out of her way to help us find a late night eatery when we were out-and-about at 10pm on a Sunday night and were calling her on a cell phone...She went the extra mile and checked in with several places to see who was still open and pointed us to a beautiful restaurant/bar called Chaise Lounge in Bucktown (http://chaiseloungechica...).  Truly a great call! The Hard Rock's rates were very reasonable if you book on http://hotels.com.  In the past, we've also stayed at the Allerton Hotel and the Palmer House, both of which we liked.  Overall, however, I would rank the Hard Rock on top, as it really gets the details right and has just the right amount of ""coolness"" to make your stay feel special.",N
3308,"Tired and in need of a face lift, sort of like Mick Jagger.  Requested non smoking, first room smelled like smoke, second room not much better.  Old T.V's and date modern chic rooms.  Great for the novelty, or if it is one of the only rooms lefdt in the city during a convention.",N
5356,My favorite hotel/suite to stay at in Chicago.  My fiance and I stayed here one night for the first time in Dec 2010 for his birthday and it was fantastic.  The room was comfortable and clean.  It felt like a small apartment.  We had a great views of the lake.  There was a complimentary happy hour the night we checked in and breakfast the next morning was great!  I would definitely stay here again....and again :-),Y
4661,"We stayed at Hotel Felix just three weeks after it opened and we loved it. We ended up paying $110 a nite (stayed for two nites) which was the cheapest we could find in Chicago. The staff was exceptionally friendly. We already knew the area, so not much assistance was needed finding stuff to do. The rooms and entire hotel have a very modern feel (which we like). The beds were AMAZING. The TV was great and everything was spotless. The only real downside was that some of our TV stations weren't coming in very well, but that's not really a big deal. Free breakfast in the morning and contains exactly what you'd think: thawed pastries, coffee, juice, cereal, bagels, etc. We found street parking very easily. We opted to park in the nearby garage overnight, which was about as expensive as the valet would've been. The downsides were (as stated below) that the bar and restaurant weren't yet open, but no big deal. It's a new hotel and is experiencing growing pains as you'd expect. All-in-all, we'd love to stay there again.",N
4219,"I guess it all depends on your expectations from hotels and what tickles you in that category. I'm pretty picky and I like hotels that are new, innovative, stylish and really go out of their way to make you comfortable. So based on my pickiness, adjust the star rating! Parking: This one just flat out pissed me off. I don't mind paying for quality but getting ripped off is a diff story. So they only offer Valet at $50 per day. I should have the choice to park my own car if I want to in a hotel that has two towers on two side of the street and has more than enough parking space to accommodate valet and self park. When you ask the hotel staff for alternate parking info, the response is ""we don't know of any other parking available"" which is BS. You live and work in Chicago and don't know of other parking lots? Good thing I live in Chicago too and know that the whole area underneath the hotel, the park and some of the surrounding is all multi-level underground parking. Again, being ripped off! So don't get ripped off, if you don't mind a 5-10min walk. Directly next to the hotel's parking on the lower level, you can park for $7 overnight as long as you enter between 3-6pm and leave by 8am. I went in after 6pm so they said it would be $13 as long as I left before 8am. At the end, I decided to just stay in bed so I paid $30 for 24hr period which is still better than $50 in a getting ripped off fashion. In the winter months, that might not be the best choice. Also if you're planning on going in and out, then you might just let them rip you off! Overall: I'd stay here again if I didn't have other choices or if I happen to get it on priceline/hotwire. The lobby is spacious but my favorite feature of the lobby which is the big bar on the front desk floor, is closed during the day!!!!! I'm not a big drinker but I'd much rather sit at that big bar and have lunch! It's amazing how some hotels limit the use of their best feature....maybe they just don't see that as their best feature, who knows. Rooms: I had a junior suite so my room was fairly large with a king bed, desk, very large bathroom, sectional couch and a wet bar. With all that space, I had a tiny tall window which was ceiling to floor but very narrow! The bathroom was large but I just didn't like the quality. It was somewhat older, shower head was one of those ""I can do 15 sprays but they all suck"" type of shower-heads and amazingly, as large as the bathroom was, most of it was wasted space b/c I didn't even have enough counter space to put my stuff out. Good thing there wasn't a lady with me or I would have had to make her use the wet bar for her space needs lol. Yeah right, I'd probably end up using the closet while she uses the bathroom and the wet bar! Thermostat: I'm not sure what the thermostat in the room did but it definitely didn't control the temp lol I put it on all kinds of numbers and used diff fan speeds but I was either getting frost bites or feeling like I was in a sauna. They also have an A/C vent directly above the bed to blow on you as you sleep so you wake up with frozen sinuses! Smart. Staff: Very friendly, very professional Price: When I look at their regular prices, all I think in my head is ""are you kidding me?"" I would never pay that kind of money for a hotel like this. If you're not picky about amenities and their quality the way I am, then this hotel might be a good option. It's right in the middle of everything so if you're in town with family but on business, you can take a smelly cab to the loop while your family enjoys MI Ave., Navy Pier, Grant/Millenium Park all within walking distance. You can even skip the smelly cab on the way back and just walk from the your business meeting in the loop back to the hotel.",N
850,"Excellent value for the money.  Price was easily $50-$100 less than comparable hotels. Location was outstanding, right on the doorstep of the el. Staff was friendly and accommodating.  Housekeeping was good, concierge did her best to be helpful (Peggy) but maybe didn't quite hear what it is that we were interested in.  Perhaps because we didn't fit the demo of what was in the hotel at the time. I'd definitely recommend it to the budget traveller who wanted to be in the middle of it all and not stay in a fleabag motel. My only gripe would be what others have said-no coffee maker in the rooms.  Tough to go down to the lobby in PJ's and grab one and the time frame negates sleeping in.",N
1028,"Our experience was all around great.  We loved the location which is close to the river, and we were able to walk everywhere downtown or hop on a bus or train quickly.  The staff was really friendly and I usually won't even look at free ""continental"" breakfast, but theirs was really nice.  They even refreshed it numerous times so it wasn't like if the family with ten kids shows up right before you, you are screwed.  I loved the decor of the rooms and was inspired by their color choices in the bathroom.  I would definitely stay there again.",N
3846,"okay. its a nice hotel. brand new, really. and i love the natural earthy-ness atmosphere... but i paid WAY too much money to stay here. watch out for the 'cozy king' room... i either got the crappiest room in the hotel or they are all this tiny.  i have never been in a SMALLER hotel room in my life. ive stayed in hampton inn's with bigger rooms! the balcony they advertise (which sounded so freakin cool) was about a good 3 feet wide and not as fun as it initially sounded. also, my room had NO WINDOWS except for the window of the 'patio' door.  heeeyyy clausterphobia.  the shower was nice, but also cramped. with a little plastic toadstool for a seat. not sure who would venture sitting on it?  ew.   the bed was really comfortable but when they place you next to the staff stairwell and housekeeping room, you're not gonna sleep anyways. GUH! the place was virtually spotless clean and the bellstaff/valet were out of this world nice.  but my bill came to nearly $350 and i feel 100% cheated.   p.s. room service isnt worth it.  my breakfast and dinner were very odd tasting. almost tasted straight up like cafeteria food. you're better off venturing over to the whole foods for some food. the other star, the location is WONDERFUL to so many things. sorry, dana.  maybe next time you can give me a decent room and i wont have to be so mean to you.",N
4583,"I'm currently staying at the Palmer house and let me tell you I should have listened to the negative reviews before I booked but thought all the negative people were just being snotty. Well their not, they're right on...lobby looks like it's for kings but rooms are for servants...haha...still tube tvs in rooms, ac makes horrendous noises when turned on, can't sleep. Wall paper is coming off walls...considering this is four stars that's a complete shame, illnois must have a different star system than California cause a 2-3 star holiday inn express in California would put this hotel to shame...people giving good reviews must be booking some $1000 suites or working for the hotel to write reviews, if you book regular rooms you'll regret it...spend 15-20 bucks more and get a better hotel like W, Sheraton, or kimpton...This is the second Hilton I'm staying at and both were messes, so bad that I'm writing the review while this ac doesn't let me sleep...hope this review helps ...",N
4577,"Wonderful experience overall.   First night so so as room was small, small bathroom, 2 beds, average decor on Diamond Floor...Second night was fantastic on Executive Floor....pay the difference to upgrade...you will be glad that you did.   Hotel has gorgeous lobby, magnificent not-to-be-missed restaurtant Lockwood, lots of amenities, excellent location.   Overall great staff.   Around $50 per day for parking with valet...lower cost pakring options are nearby.   Fitness center is $10 per day.   Would go again...this place is great.  Have OJ take care of you at Lockwood and have Derrick take care of you at check-in and have Waffa take care of you for cocktails in the Executive Lounge.   These three people plus Kenneth the bellman were stellar!",N
4173,"The first impression you get when you walk through the sliding doors of the Hyatt Regency Chicago is WOW. The lobby is beautiful with a upscale mall type of look to it with an open area that has a restaurant, plenty of couches,seats etc to people watch and a lake with water fountains. You take the escalator to the concierge/directory/check in area.     The hotel let me check in at 12pm (I had a 3pm check in time). I suggest you call ahead like I did so they know you are coming early.The women at the desk was friendly and when I requested a higher level floor she was more than happy to look it up and even told me ""I have a room on the 18th floor with a view of the river or you can go higher with no view"". I thought it was pretty nice to give me that information so that I wouldn't get stuck with a room with a view of a wall.     The rooms are big (I had a doubles room) The beds were beautiful with great pillows,blankets,headboards etc. An Ipod alarm clock was a nice 21st century touch to the room. Great to plug in your ipod, listen to some music and get ready for a night out or when relaxing after a long day of touring Chicago. The view was very nice and the bathroom was spotless and had great toiletries.     Another great feature is the concierge area's computers that gives you access to printing your boarding pass before you get to the airport. You simply look at the screen, click on your airline icon and following the instructions. I had my boarding passes in about a minute. Came in handy when I got to OHare and was able to skip a long line of frustrated passengers. I was only in the hotel for 1 day, but it was by far one of the better hotel experiences I have had and I travel alot. It is a business hotel, but definitely a great choice for families and couples. Definitely would stay here again when Im passing through Chicago.",N
195,"I didn't actually stay here but met some friends here who were in  townfor a conference. The rooms are fairly well appointed. It's located conveniently across from Water Tower and the Hancock building, right off of Michigan.  The thing that sets this hotel apart, however, is the rock star pool, which is not only huge but on the top (30th?) floor with an amazing view of the Chicago skyline!",N
1863,"I stayed at this W on haloween saturday. First when we got there they put us in the wrong room.we had booked a double and got a single. The single room was ridiculously small. So we called down and they put us in a double, it was much larger and the room was decorated fairly nice. When It was time to shower though, i think they may have given us handicapped room, im not sure, because the shower was kind of just on the floor thhere was a curtain..it would make the whole floor wet and youd get really fricken cold because there wasnt a good place for the heat to build up. We had ordered room service, and the food was really good, but they forgot steak sauce for my steak..i waited, and waited, finally they got it to me but by that time my food was cold. They atleast compd me a free martini to make up for it. Finally when it came time to check out, our bill was just under 800 bucks for 2 people...just because we didnt want to take cabs around on drunk haloween night, and thought it would be nice to stay at a ""posh"" hotel. This hotel would have gotten more stars if it wasnt so expensive, because I can understand and accept mistakes, but for this price I should have gotten much better service, and a much better experience.",N
983,"The staff at this hotel are very well trained professionals. The Hotel itself is very discreet, private and unassuming. I stayed for a few nights in the earlier part of the year when it was a necessity. Their bar and food happy hour is something to look forward to each night. Anti pasto to rival any Italian B and B. good selection of beer and wine too. The beds are so accommodating and the view and location are excellent. I have stayed in many hotels around the world; this one is as impressive as any! On a side note you cannot compare this hotel to the Peninsula or Ritz Carlton. Do you compare a Toyota Matrix to a Mercedes Benz?",N
4905,"This is the second time I have stayed at Dana. Both times, everyone was friendly and outgoing. Answered any questions we had. From the moment we stepped out of the cab, till check out it's a nice place! The Shower in the room is the BEST. I am a fan of the floor to ceiling windows. Sheets and bed are sweet! Friendly service. We spent over 90 minutes at the breakfast table and not once did they try and rush us out. Room is large. TV is great. Free Internet, awesome. Huge fan, I will look to stay here every time I'm in Chicago.",Y
2338,"The Marriott is OK but pales in comparison to the numerous hotels in the area that are frankly better. The lobby fills up with people, probably because the rooms are so average in size and quality. The revolving door along Michigan Avenue is automatic, but turns slowly so there is always the desire to push it along (not a good idea). The location of the hotel along Michigan Avenue is good, and the Kinko's on the second floor is not as busy as other locations in the city.",N
4907,I had the worst french tip manicure of my life at the spa and paid $35 for it! I got it 2 days ago and can't stand to look at my nails but am too cheap to take it off for a couple more days. Will never go back.,Y
1773,"I have never rented a room here, but I have been here about a dozen times for different events - birthdays, political events, and most recently, a luncheon for a newly appointed judge.  No matter what the event, I have been very pleased at the event space at this hotel.  The food has always been good, and even though the place doesn't blow me away, the nice convenience of having it downtown is a plus.  Every event I have attended is in the ballroom on the lobby floor, and although it is not a giant space, it has a great old school charm to it that many of the newer hotels do not have.",N
4121,"HUGE hotel. 3 bars, 2 restaurants, a coffee shop and gift shop. Plus lots more that I never got to see. The service: Friendly and efficient. Got upgraded to a suite at no cost. Wifi was free after signing up for the gold passport (free to sign up). Cabs constantly coming and going at the bequest of the guys out front. The room: roomy suite, very clean and a comfortable bed. Strangely the bed was a murphy bed and at first I was a little concerned about comfort but it was perfect. Great view from the 27th floor. Could hear people coming in and out of their rooms but never heard any voices, etc. Showers had excellent water pressure. The food: Got drinks at Big Bar (Not too impressed), dinner and drinks at the Irish pub (service was excellent, food so-so). Starbucks at the coffee shop was $$$ but didn't expect much different. Breakfast buffet came with our room price otherwise I'd never go there ($25 a person for the buffet). However food was good and service was amazing.",N
5378,"This Travelodge should be closed and then imploded Las Vegas style.The staff lied to me and told me there were no smoking rooms at any Chicago hotel per city ordinance.They do not know what they are talking about and I am lucky I did not just trust them at their word. I googled around and found the lovely Essex Inn around the corner, which is 20 dollars cheaper a night and has a whole floor of smoking rooms. So I moved hotels and the Essex was orders of magnitude better than the Travelodge.There are no refrigerators in the Travelodge rooms. The elevators are slow.If you are a smoker, they offer no designated smoking area nor do they offer any smoking rooms. You will be out in the cold smoking on the street getting pestered by street beggars.The hotel was built in the 1920s and has 90 years worth of paint layers in the rooms and around the windows. Noisy elevated train line right next to your room window.Lousy. Worthless. Lackadaisical. Poor. Bad Value for Money. Lame. Dingy. Dank. Rubbish. Crummy. Delapidated. Deteriorated.In the dictionary under rubbish, there should be a picture of this joint.",Y
2186,"I would never pay full price for this hotel, but Hotwire got us a last minute deal for Lollapalooza, when hotels were tough to come by, so it was great for the price. The room was nice, the bed was comfortable for 2, the flat panel TV was large (32"" or bigger), and everything else seemed to be up to par with a nice hotel. The location is the one thing it really has going for it. Right on Michigan Avenue, a few blocks from the river, you'll get to pretty much everything from here on foot if you want to. But then there's the downsides. The ""high-speed internet access"" was a $13 per day wireless setup. When a hotel costs $350 per night for a room (full price, not what I paid), I'd expect that the internet access be reasonably priced if not free. $13 is ridiculous. And it wasn't all that ""high-speed"" either. On top of that, everything in the room had a price. Want a bottled water? That'll be $6.95 please. Forgot your toothbrush? Only $3 for this generic brush-on-a-stick. Grab a Coke out of the ""Refreshment Center?"" For $3.75, no problem! The drapes definitely didn't keep the light out as well as I'd hope, just as someone else mentioned. The towels were average, there was no fan in the bathroom so the mirror was always fogged up, and the remote for the TV was near useless. A few people mentioned that the water in the shower/sink would constantly change temperature, and I noticed the same thing in my room (I just love having my warm shower turn into a scalding hot shower). I wouldn't stay here again unless Hotwire assigned it to me.",N
471,"This hotel is lovely. I love the elevator and how you can view it from the outside. Its pretty kewl. The rooms are nice and spacias and the windows are really cute. The complimentary breakfast was tasty and there was a lot of options. We order room service, mainly finger foods, and everything was just right! I didnt hear any sex noises in the middle of the night, which is good! I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone planning to stay in downtown Chicago for a few days.",N
5489,"Small boutique hotel right in the middle of Rush Street. Whiskey bar is downstairs. I thought it would be noisy but it wasn't. Prada is across the street, Barney's down the street. Close to all the luxury shops and if you love shopping and night life, this place is in the right location.",N
693,"I walked in off the street and I am only a silver member with Marriott They hooked my son and I up with a room ASAP, i was really impressed, it was so last minute and everything in town was booked up. They could have charged anything they wanted and they gave me a great rate. I have been at the Marriott on the mile and it was not as nice as this place was. Such a good call. I love how close it was to everything. Will be staying there again. The parking was great and desk service was the best. PLUS room service rocked!!!!",N
992,"Great location & value!  The rooms were clean and nicely arranged, the staff was friendly and helpful. My friend and I took advantage of their free breakfast every day.  It was pretty good with croissants, danishes, juice, milk, tea, coffee, oranges, apples, etc.  Their happy hour is nice, too.  I only caught it once, but good drinks & snacks. The location is fantastic.  We were only a short walk across the bridge from our conference.  There's good restaurants nearby.  Good stuff!",N
1291,"If I could've just moved in here, I would've. The bed was incredibly comfortable, we got an amazing view from a high floor, the complimentary breakfast was delicious, and the location is great! The concierge was friendly and helpful and I don't have a single negative thing to say about it.",N
3084,"A friend and I ended up here last weekend. It was my first stay at a W hotel, and I will probably try them again at some point in my life. It was a lot of fun to have a nice bar, with a great view, in the building. We never really made it back here in time on Friday or Saturday night to check out the scene, but I hear it has lost its ""it"" status. Our room was great, we had a nice view of the lake. I'd say if you can get this for a decent rate, go for it.",N
3332,"The decor of this hotel is very hip, very modern, and overall we enjoyed our weekend stay at this hotel.  The rooms were small but comfortable; the bed was incredibly comfortable, one of the best hotel beds I've slept in.  Kind of a fun place to stay if you are into music, there's always a possible sighting to be had, and there are a lot of cool rock types wandering around (you won't see your typical suburban golfer type staying here).  We were seeing a concert at the United Center and did not have time for dinner, as we were delayed getting into the city; so we sat in the bar and had drinks and appetizers - my only complaint was that we did not eat or drink very much at all but our bar bill was over $100; however downtown hotels can be very pricey so it was fairly expected.  You can get a great deal on this room on expedia if you wait till the last couple of days prior to your excursion, and you can use the money you save at the bar!",N
3307,"awesome, go if you want a different experience.  The rooms are well designed, we ended up using different parts in the room for music pictures for our next album.",N
4922,"A landmark hotel, the Drake is just an iconic place in Chicago.

5804,"I was once told by the talent buyer at the Logan Square Auditorium that they refer bands who don't want to sleep in their vans, but can't afford a high-end hotel room to this place.  I can't believe a single one of them has ever stayed there once they got in to see the place. This is pretty much a vagrant hotel.  Shared bathrooms, not so much the clean, etc.  I suppose if it's below freezing out and it's between this place and a park bench, it's worth paying for the heat, but if matters are that bad, wouldn't a homeless shelter be more accomodating?",N
5706,"When I'm on vacation in a new city, I only sleep in hotels, I'm not there for the amenities so I can only comment on the room and check in/check out process. We only stayed in Chicago 1 out of 3 nights, the other 2 we actually stayed in Indiana and drove into IL (it was a poorly planned & spontaneous trip, but it actually worked out). The $70 Indiana hotels we stayed in had much more comfortable beds but ($219) The River was extremely clean and the staff were very polite and professional. Transformers 3 was being shot right outside the hotel and it was such a surreal experience, as we were walking to the valet station, we had to walk trough the set - there were overturned vehicles, ash covered streets, collapsed buildings - it was like walking through an apocalypse! There were some angry Brits yelling at the front desk about the noise and streets being shut down, but it wasn't their fault, the hotel did everything they could to make a pleasant experience out of a minor (okay... major) inconvenience.",N
3940,"I had a great time when I stayed here in 2006 with three friends. Located right outside the Loop and directly across from Grant Park, and within walking distance of The Field Museum and Shedd Aquarium, this hotel met our needs perfectly. The rooms were well appointed with good closet space and a bathroom big enough for four people to share easily. Parts of the movie ""Return to Me"" (a favorite in my family) were filmed in the hotel's ballroom. We had lunch at the buffet, which was $14/person, which seemed all right to me for an all-you-can-eat meal. Parking is in a nearby lot at reasonable rates. Also on the bus line and it's easy to hail cabs here.",N
3766,"For a hotel that boasts a spa in it's name I would have expected a more calm environment. The wonderful spa aside, I don't understand why each hotel room would be equipped with a large stereo without volume control. During the night, both rooms surrounding me were blasting club music with the bass turned on what seemed like max. If you want to stay at a hotel for the purpose of relaxing and enjoying their spa, stay somewhere else. Also, the check-in/front desk area is not well organized. Sure, they have kiosks, which didn't work for me or my boyfriend so we waited for someone to check us in at the front desk, which we didn't mind but it took an unreasonably long time. Oh and I loved when they explained turndown service. Thank you, I've stayed at a hotel before. Bottom line: If you wear Ed Hardy, like doing blow and party to techno music, this place is for you.",N
193,"Want to stay in a quiet, almost private hotel a block away from the mag mile? This is your spot. It doesn't have a grand entrance and everything here is lowkey and under-the-radar. The Westin is a block away if you want something flashy...this is about comfort. I wouldn't shell out a ton of money to stay here as I got a hotwire deal ($68!) but it was a very nicely appointed room with what looked to be newer furniture and fixtures throughout. Also a view of John Hancock and just so close to all Chicago has to offer. I've only stayed at the Sheraton in the River North area, but I'd gladly pick HS over the Sheraton. Better location, better rooms, less crowded.",N
432,"I stayed in the hotel over the weekend of Lollapalooza 2011. Yes, it IS a little bit out of the way (~20-30 minutes by train to downtown) and the nearest subway station is about a 10 minute walk. (Carmak-Chinatown of the Red Line). However, the front desk was extremely friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean, well-maintained and spacious, and the hotel itself is upscale, clean and gorgeous to look at. I would recommend staying here. I would not recommend walking around the neighborhood after midnight by yourself, but my female friend and I walked home at 11 pm on two brightly lit, busy streets with no problem or harrassment. Some additional information about the hotel: 1. Helpful front desk. Want pizza delivered to your room at 4 am? No problem. They have menus for Sarpino's, a delicious pizza delivery place nearby. There's also a menu in room for Chinese food. They also called a cab for me at 4 am for the airport. 2. Huge lobby, bar, restaurant and general store for supplies you may have forgotten. 3. Business center with computers and Internet and a printer for use. Free coffee in the business center. 4. Huge rooms, comfortable beds, HUGE bathtub. 5. Friendly housekeepers. 6. 10 minute walk to Chinatown and nearest subway stop. 7. Bus stop right in front of hotel. (#29 bus) 8. Taxi stand in front of hotel. 9 Free wifi in rooms. And it was fast! Much appreciated! I very much enjoyed my stay here and would definitely stay here again. The only downside is that it's further away from central downtown Chicago.",N

3268,"I stayed at the Chicago Hard Rock Hotel recently when attending IML; the excellent rate I found encouraged me to stay here rather than the host hotel. The decor in the hotel is very modernist with clean, simple lines and lots of photo-art featuring rock stars (David Bowie was above our toilet!). Attractive design, by and large. I stayed with my partner in a King Deluxe room. While not huge, the room was comfortable and the bed made for a restful sleep. My only complaint was that the sheets had an awful lot of starch. I just slept under the very soft down comforter: problem solved. The bathroom was spacious and came with an assortment of Aveda bath products. Mmm...minty. The customer service was really excellent. From check-in to check-out we were made to feel very welcome and comfortable. I had a minor complaint about the squeaky door in the bathroom and they sent a repair man up within ten minutes. The maids were quick and thorough and regularly maintained the room's amenities. While lacking a pool or hot tub, there is a nice gym with cardio equipment and free weights on the lower level. The same area is used for spa treatments offered through the hotel. I definitely plan on staying here again.",N
2285,"I should say that I type this on behalf of me and only me in case anyone knows me or figures out my organization :-) My experience with the Marriott was absolutely exceptional in terms of event planning. I work for a nonprofit organization that chose to move its fundraising gala to the Marriott from another Chicago hotel. Being a new venue, and ne to the organization and planning this particular event the combination of Amy (Sales Manager) and Christina (Event planner - I don't think that's her exact title) made everything easy and seemless. They were wondreful to work with and the night-of, Christina practically bent over backwards to go the extra mile for us, that's for sure! I really can't say enough nice things- from the tasting to the planning to settling the bill, everything went very smoothly. I woudl say if you're planning an event (conference, dinner, wedding, etc.) this is a good bet. The location is perfect for those who work/live downtown and for those visiting. It's pretty much in the heart of everything. The recent rennovation has made the hotel very colorful and modern, yet still very tasteful. The ballrooms can be modern, elegant, whatever you want them to be. The dinner was amazing and if you get a chance, be sure to include the desserts all made by hand. They are absolutely to die for! Best pastry chef ever! Apparently, everything is made in the hotel and is locally sourced as much as possible. The hotel even has its own butcher shop. I'm going to stop now because I'm starting to sound like an ad. If it balances out the review a little, I will say that the rooms were nice, but not exceptional. You had everything that you needed including a nice big bathroom, but otherwise, I would say they were pretty average. Great views, though. Ok, now I'm done.",N
1472,"Great location, right off Michigan Avenue.  We had a one-bedroom suite, which was nice, although smaller than the other one-bedroom suite we stayed in (Millenium Knickerbocker Chicago).   We ordered breakfast room service the night before, and it arrived promptly the next morning and was delicious.   The entrance was kind of weird--you had to get into an elevator from the street to reach the lobby, and then get into another set of elevators to reach the rooms.  The lobby was modern and the concierge was wonderful.",N
5321,I always like the customer service here plus the atmosphere and the girls are so hot and hip,Y
2634,"Aside from absolutely LOVING Chicago for what chicago was, this hotel made my experience so much more incredible. It's the little things that stick out and make staying someplace special -  The James delivered!! We had an apt suite on the 15th floor. The room was spacious, so clean and modern looking. The bed was the comfiest bed. The linens were soft and didn't make that scratching noise you get most times at a hotel. The shower has two heads, for a rain like effect. Room came equipped with mini bar, fridge, they offered to bring us a microwave if we needed too! WiFi included!!  We had a huge table with comfy bench seating, perfect for eating or working. The carpet was plush. Room service was on point, we waited no more than 5 minutes for any request. We ordered breakfast the first day, the food was fantastic. We both got egg white omelets with vegetables and coffee. I utilized the gym everyday I was there. It was WELL EQUIPPED and had high end machines. It was clean. They had pitchers of chilled lemon water and free headphones. They also provided oranges post workout. You can also request free workout DVDS for your room, muy importante for those looking not to gain travel weight!!! The staff was so sweet and kind, very helpful. The bellmen were also not bad to look at! Other things to note: Right across street from Trader Joes and a amazing pizzeria!! Also close proximity to N. Michigan, aka the Magnificent Mile. the location is just on point!!",N
3682,"Wonderful stay. My husband and I took our 3 kids there over Thanksgiving, ages 12, 15 and 18. The double Queen family room was big with 2 bathrooms and a sofa bed. They do have roll sways if needed. The workout room was 3000 sq. Feet w/ 10 treadmills. We were right next to all the shops on Mag. Mile. The hotel lobby court was wonderful for drinks and a snack before bed with great music. The hallways to the rooms are extra wide and just nice. It is very elegant and historic. We had our iPads w/ our own Internet so we didn't experience any issues there. The price was $259/night and $35/ parking. We thought it was great and will stay there next time too!",N
412,"The location is great. I use the red line frequently so you can't beat the entrance that's about 6 steps away from the hotel.  They also provide free internet in the rooms! No extra/hidden charges like Hyatt.  The staff and service was fantastic, the people were more than willing to help you out however they could. The walls are thin and sound certainly travels through the bathroom vents, as some have mentioned, but it's a hotel.. It happens. Also the elevators do run slowly during peak times. There's only three for a 25+ story hotel, which is definitely one short of the optimal amount, but expect it going in and it won't ruin your stay. The bed.. It's got that strange comfort foam stuff, which is cool, but I found that it doesn't bounce back very quickly, so I'd have to alternate sleeping on different sides of the bed. Not a huge deal, but for people who have trouble sleeping they might want to do some more research into that.",N
2384,"This is the only place I stay when I go to Chicago for work. LOVE this place! It has easy access to I-94, parking is only $43/night. The staff here are very friendly. Rooms are quite nice. Some can be quite small, but they are well kept and very clean. There are many restaurant on the premises as well as around the hotel. They do serve starbucks coffee in the morning, which is always a plus. There is a gym on the 8th floor- I have yet to find time to use it but I hear it's a gem. It's currently undergoing construction on the first floor, but even with this, I'll be going back... Good service is hard to find, especially in a big city!",N
4913,"My husband and I stayed here for our one year wedding anniversary.  We had planned a small weekend getaway to downtown Chicago since we don't get into the city very often.  I used my hotel points to book us one free night and had requested a lake view room, if available, through the hotel's online system.When we arrived, the front desk noted our request and set us up with a nice lake view room!!!  It may have helped that we were staying on a Sunday night as I hear that wedding nights (Fridays & Saturdays) are quite busy.  The view was beautiful - plenty of boats on the water and people at the beach, which is a short walk from the hotel.The room itself was very stately, but not stuffy.  The bed was firm and the plethora of pillows were very comfortable.  It was a romantic atmosphere but not overly so...we saw one or two kids/families in the lobby.Overall, while we thoroughly enjoyed our lake view room (it was free!) I would certainly consider staying at The Drake in the future...even without a comped room.",Y
3305,"I can only speak for the lobby/bar area that every hip hotel seems to have these days, but damn if they don't mix some good cocktails. After an evening of beer and wine, a few of the heavier drinkers in my group of co-workers (i.e. everyone under 35) decided to head here for a nightcap. Although I spent much of the next morning wishing I had just gone back to my hotel, I enjoyed a very delicious cocktail in the form of the ""Lakeshore"" that evening. If I remember correctly, it was some sort of vodka/gin concoction with honey melon and cucumber. Delicious, but deadly!",N
84,"Beautiful ballroom and bar area. Great ambiance. We had about 65 people at our wedding reception and suprisingly the ballroom wasn't too big, however, since the bar area is down a little corridor, people pretty much ventured to the bar to drink and lounge after dinner/dancing. It was intimate, people we're able to meet and talk.  Since we had a small party, everyone could fit comfortably into the large bar area. The food was from Philanders and it was awesome across the board- the fav main dish was the beef and tilapia. YUMMY! We received a complimentary room which worked out well, we used it as our home base. It was close to the reception area and was very well kept with a old fashioned flair. I'm very happy with how the reception turned out, I think the hotel is great for smaller weddings and is a wonderful place if you want to get away from the typical Holiday Inn reception. Our course it comes with a price tag, but it was worth it! One more side note for wheelchair users: I was concerned since a couple of the guests are wheelchair-bound and the hotel reception area is actually on a couple levels. The hotel isn't accessible with ramps throughout, but they have lifts throughout to accomodate even larger electric wheelchairs. I was surprised the lifts were insulated very well because you couldn't hear the noise in the ballroom.",N
2456,"Great location. Great views. Great rooms. One star for each. Where does the 4th start come from, you ask? Well, my room had not one but two bathrooms. Two full bathrooms? Three cheers for needless excess! I really like the Hiltons in Chicago. This one in particular offers a great proximity to Grant Park, the lake, downtown, and all the museums. Excellent for people out of town that are looking to be in the thick of things. It's also great for a nice stay-cation.",N
2190,went to Breakfast on a sunday we had made a reservation and it was not ready when we arrived on time. It wasn't that busy so I was a little surprised. the tater tots on the buffet were also a little surprising?,N
4141,"So...  I had an interesting experience with Hyatt as a conference attendee.    I had this whole long thing posted, telling the story, but...  too long!  Shortened version - they screwed up our reservations, tried to blame me for the mistake when it was blatantly obvious they had screwed up, threatened to write corporate, and low and behold, the next day, they must have been waiting for me to enter the room, because within 10 min, my roommate and I hear a knock at the door.  A complimentary water and fruit service for me.  I guess this was their way of apologizing.   So.  Would I choose to stay here again?  The rooms were ok, the iPod radio dock was nice.  The service sucked, but at least they tried in a small way to make up for their crappy service that night.  No, I probably wouldn't opt for the hotel, but if I have to attend a conference there again, I guess I'll have to stay there for the convenience factor!  They're lucky they sent us the water and gave the discount, otherwise they'd be looking at 1-2 stars!  But I guess that was the point!  :)",N
3467,"I'm not sure where everyone else was staying but that was not the same hotel I was at this week. - Rooms were abnormally small, even for Chicago.   - I did not have hot water the first day I showered there. Chicago in October, that is a problem.  The following morning, I had hot water but I'm fairly certain it was because I was the only one showering in the building (~4:30 a.m. for early flight) - Cleanliness was subpar.  Pretty sure there was mold in the bathroom from what looked like water damage on the ceiling.   - Beds were NOT nearly as comfortable as Marriott.   The only thing great about this hotel is location.  If that is all you are looking for, then this is the place for you.  If you are looking for a nice hotel, lobby, room, etc., go elsewhere.",N
483,"We went here to meet my boyfriend's mother for drinks. When you enter on the street level, whomever the gentleman working the desk was, was rude and abnoxious screaming, yes I mean screaming, at somebody inside. We thought he was yelling at us. We asked for instruction on how to get to the lobby and he remained unapologetic and angry. Anyhow, we wandered around and realized we were at the wrong Embassy Suites (Monopoly : Another Embassy Suites is 4 blocks away). This Embassy Suites does not have a working waterfall fountain at this time.",N
3336,"Poor service.  Small ""upgraded"" rooms.  Overpriced.  Not that fun once you step off the elevator and get to your room.  I recommend staying in the lobby.",N
528,"I stayed in Dec for 4 nights and the hotel was great. The standard room is fine with the view of fire dept. It's a few blocks to Miracle Mile, dining, and other attractions.  Traders Joe and Jewel Osco is not that far from the hotel too.  The staff are nice and friendly. I would come back to this hotel. The only improvement is that they need to improve on their free breakfast.",N
513,"We had our wedding here and it was perfect. For a downtown location, it is very reasonable. We worked with Thelma and she was so wonderful. The room is a little narrow and long, but that is my only issue. The staff was so nice and they dealt with many of our annoying family members with tons of grace. They did have a light malfunction that no one could fix, but our dj set up a make shift lighting arrangement with his equipment. It actually looked pretty cool! Overall, our wedding was wonderful and The Embassy Suites had a lot to do with that!",N
4420,"Got an unbelievable price of 90$ per night thro priceline. Then, upgraded to concierge level for 40$ more.. Totally worth it! Concierge level gets a free breakfast, which is an extensive spread!. Also, the toiletries are super! Beds are great. Views can vary depending on your rooms location. Great location as well.",N
1236,"the best part of staying here is close to the McCormick Convention Center, no need to wait in Taxi or Shuttle line after the show.  Yet, NO 2nd Selection of RESTAURANT Is the down fall for this hotel.  After eating there everyday for breakfast, you will get sick of thinking going into their ONLY RESTAURANT.",N
4519,"Fancy hotel.  However, it's being remodeled.  Hence the great deal I got on Hotwire.  It'll probably be great in 2008, when it's slated to be completed.  Our room was spacious and clean.  Walls are a little thin, though.  Not only did I hear the headboard being jackhammered by our neighbor, but the walls were thin enough to hear how much the female was enjoying her jackhammering.",N
4649,"This is a great hotel! recently renovated with a LEED rating of silver. The hotel is simple, but elegantly modern. The rooms are very reasonable for what you get, albeit a little on the small side, everthing was soo nice, you don't mind. Best part was that there was  a safe in the room. I also liked that you needed a key card to use the elevator. The location is also great, minutes from the subway and ""el"" trains, and a block from a whole foods! I would definitely stay here again. P.S. try there signature drink down in the bar, made with a special spiced rum, milk, honey and an herb, i think lavendar! very unique",N
2231,My parents stayed at the Intercontinental the last time they visited Chicago and they loved it. It's a very nice hotel with large guest rooms and in the perfect location on Michigan Avenue.

4083,"3.5 stars. My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago on Saturday night after getting it on Priceline for $55/night. The hotel is in a very good location with plenty to walk to right near it. If you are coming from Midway Airport, I highly recommend taking the train. It's about 30 minutes, $2.25, and less than a 10 minute walk from the Randolph/Wabash station (we found this to be the more convenient station to the hotel rather than the Lake/State Street one). Even though we got to the hotel at 11 am, we were able to check in and go to our room on the 32nd floor. The room itself was a pretty basic king bed room, but we didn't need anything fancy or special for one night. I did find the placement of the flat screen TV a bit odd as it was on the end of the dresser on the right side of the bed, so if were laying in bed, you could to be on your side to see it. For booking via Priceline, we actually had a room with a decent view. The only amenity we utilized at the hotel was the business center which is on the bottom level. Use of the internet for 15 minutes will run you $7.56 and printing one page will cost $0.83. So only use the business center if you really have to. If you want to use cabs to get around, there are plenty in queue all the time near the hotel, so you won't have to wait to get one. Overall, this hotel is not a bad option especially since it looks like it's pretty easy to book for a great price on Priceline.",N
949,"The price is inexpensive, the internet is weak.  The thermostat is not easy to operate.  If you have an allergy, the air inside will trigger your symptoms.  The room is very small.  Its a motel 6 quality.",N
5311,"The hotel is beautiful and the people are very nice, but the Internet is very slow and when it snows the cable goes out! Other then that it was a great stay we were located right next to state street with Marshall Fields. We stayed from 12.3 to 12.5 and it was wonderful at night with all of the Christmas light all in all great stay!",Y
336,"It's a great location, safe, but you get what you pay for. The rooms are medium sized, stale, old fashioned. The beds and pillows are cheap and old. There are pipes inside the bedrooms and the TVs are CRTs that I didn't know still existed. The windows are 100 years old and have 100 years of paint on them -- not child safe as you can raise them on the 14th floor and climb right out. My bathroom was updated, but my tub had a liner over the old tub which you could feel had a hole in the bottom. AC is a window unit that the maid turns off during the day, so it's stifling when you get back late at night. The maids didn't get to my room until after dinner each night, but they did a good job when they got around to it. No mini fridges. Slowest elevators. Free internet! Nice staff! I paid $170 a night for two twins (we wanted a queen) in late July. There are probably better places for a little bit more, but we took advantage of the walk to the park every single day. It was quiet, probably due to two factors: sturdy construction and unoccupied rooms.",N
2458,"Loved this hotel! Why? I was staying here on a business trip for a trade show and sharing a room with a colleague. When I asked about an upgraded room, the front desk gal said ""no problem"". I went up to our room and it looked pretty standard. I thought to myself, ""maybe she thought being on the club level was a good enough upgrade"". And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a door on the other side of the room that was half open. ""What is that?"", I thought. I walked over and opened the door and looked in. Woo! Hoo! It was a second bathroom!!! It was a dream to be traveling with someone and we were each able to have our own space. The best Hilton upgrade ever. Aside from that, the pub in the hotel has pretty good food (and beer). The location of the hotel was great for what we were there for. The fitness center was $15 for a day or $25 for the entire stay. At first, I hesitated. I paid the $25 and was not disappointed. It was actually a gym for people in the neighborhood. It had an indoor track and a ton of cardio machines and weights. Worth every penny.",N
896,"The hotel is right in the heart of Chicago. Perfect location. It's on the corner of State Street and Washington. A couple blocks one way is Millennium Park. A couple blocks the other way is the Chicago River. A short walk away from the Art Institute. A couple blocks away from Metro and bus stops. Making the entire city easily accessible. The hotel room was great. We asked from a room facing State Street when we checked in because there is some construction across Washington. We got an end room on the 12th floor. Great view down Washington toward Millennium Park and also down State Street toward the Chicago River, with a view of the Chicago Theater. The room was a modest size. The bathroom was nice. One thing that we found amusing was that the shower head was about 6-7 inches above my head, and I'm 6'3"". That hardly ever happens. The fitness room was small. Not much to it. There are two treadmills, one elliptical, one bike, and a set of free weights. It was a means to get our workout done. There are water and towels provided. The hotel restaurant was one of the better reviewed restaurants in the city. Some thing we didn't expect. I was recommended to eat at the Atwood Cafe and upon looking it up, I discovered it was at our hotel. The food was very good. Reservations are recommended. You can make those easily through http://opentable.com. Overall, we had a great trip to Chicago. And we feel this was due in large part to the hotel experience. We would definitely stay at this hotel again. You can't beat the location and service. And if you keep your eyes open for deals, you can stay here for a great price.",N
5317,"Love this place. Any chance I get, this is where I stay. Super friendly staff, great location. Attached to a restaurant The Grill with decent food. In Chicago you can definitely get better. But that doesnt have a direct effect on the hotel which is in a prime location for food, shops and walking around.",Y
5297,It's good location and a good price for the location but my outlet in the bathroom didn't work so I had no hair dryer. =[,Y
2902,"Thing about hotel business is... it's all about the service, the willingness to go over and above for their guests, and the attention you give to your guests.   Sheraton Chicago Hotel & Towers had it all.   Also what everyone should understand is that... it's the nature of the business to enjoy all those things above when you have a connection.  So I guess you can say I have somewhat a biased opinion.   We stayed in a two-room suite complete with two LCD TVs, two double beds, two full bathrooms on the 19th floor.   We also had access to the Club Lounge on the 33rd floor which was great.  Free breakfast every morning.  Hor'dourves and snacks served in the afternoon.   When we had a difficult request for a particular service, the staff went over and beyond to get it done.  And they were kind about it from the beginning to the very end, making sure it was to our satisfaction.  They even made a couple of calls to our room to make sure everything was ok.  Now THAT's what I call caring for their guests! Now it's not to say that they don't have ANY flaws.  With the kind of price they charge their guests every night, high-speed wireless internet should be FREE.   But that's a minor concern.  After all, don't we all want to be AWAY from all the craziness of emails and things-to-do's when we're on vacation??",N
301,"This hotel is not a five-star hotel. BUT for the 5 days/4 nights I stayed here it definitely was a five-star experience. The hotel is quaint, boutique-like, and very european. Our room was small and the bathroom was very clean and very art-deco. We didn't need much room as we spent most of our trip out and about. The staff was awesome! Friendly, we never were disturbed, and were even granted a late-check out free of charge. LOCATION was perfect! One couldn't have asked to be any closer to public trans, dining, and nightlife. This hotel is located at Clark/Belmont, borders Wrigleyville, and Lincoln Park. The price was good for what we got. Everywhere else in Chicago was atleast 250$/night. We were here over St. Patrick's Day weekend ( a blackout wkend for most hotels) and paid under $200/night. My boyfriend and I plan on coming back to Chicago when the weather is better and we definitely will be returning to the City Suites.",N
4392,"The pros- Excellent lobby, everyone that works at the hotel is very nice and will take care of any problem you have quickly.  You can't argue with the location and with that comes a heavy price tag.  I can't complain about the actual price for the room but all the extra add ons really get you.  Its 25 extra for a third person in the room.  Thats a bit much.   Internet was 15, I didn't use it since I have a smart phone but 15 for internet is def. on the high end.   I had no issue with the room, bed was really nice and bathroom decent. The cons-You hear everything that happens on your floor, from someone flushing the toilet to entering their room.  This is one of the loudest hotels I have stayed at.   And when you pay around 300 a night, it would be nice to actually get a few hours of sleep.",N
4413,"I'm sorry... I don't see the big deal. If my bed were in the lobby I would give this place 6 stars, but it was not so...

I took 3 baths in 24 hrs Bed:                      Like Sleeping on AIR! I was going to give this place 3 stars but the tub is Olympic size and carries two of the four stars. Third star goes to the staff and the fourth star actually goes to....... Millers Pub!",N
909,"Another Kimpton gem! Wonderful hotel in historic landmark building  with nicely appointed rooms and all the usual Kimpton amenities, like l'occitaine in your room and great bedding. I requested extra down pillows when I made my reservation and they did remember to include them, which impressed me. Very reasonable rates as well. I only have 2 comments, one of which is beyond their control:  1) no flat screen tv--odd I think. i'm not a tv junkie or anything, but I think a flat screen is more aprapos for a ""stylish"" hotel. 2) construction on state was LOUD... so hopefully that will be finished shortly.",N
4045,"I'm torn between the 4 star review and the 3. It's actually a 3.5 star. Pros: - Super close to touristy attractions either directions: Magnificent mile, Cloud gate, Navy Pier, etc. - Close to public transport ie 5 blocks or so to Red line - Attractive lobby - Friendly and helpful staff - Secure rooms that require a key to enter elevators after 11PM or so. Cons: - A somewhat dreary room with the color scheme, which looks contemporary in the pictures, but not so in person. - The glass window in our room was dirty with streak marks and such as if they haven't cleaned it in a while... I suppose this was an excellent deal for the location and all, but I expected a little bit more from a 4 star hotel. Maybe it was listed as 3.5stars. Either way, our request of a king bed was confirmed when we checked in, but when we got to the room, it was a double. No biggie I guess. It was nice though that they allowed us to extend our check out time to 1PM instead of 12PM when I called the morning of check-out.",N
1740,"Definitely caters to a clientele that likes it a bit trendy, a bit posh, a bit funky. The staff were super nice and helpful, in a genuine way, which is notable in my book. Our room was a bit on the small side, but it didn't bother us a bit, we made it work. - we travel light (like each of us has a small backpack for four days kinda light), so we didn't have a problem making our stuff fit.   We got a great rate online which really made this hotel experience rock my world. I have to say, if we paid full-on rates, I'm not sure the amenities would be worth it for me. The wine hour was pretty sweet too. Free wine, a bit of food to nosh on, people watching, what could be bad about that?",N
4126,"I recently attended the College Art Association 98th annual conference (CAA2010) at the Hyatt Regency Chicago.  As just a hotel, this place is great.  The hotel is huge and it is conveniently located near basically everything downtown.  But, when it's filled with conference attendees, it makes navigating the lobby, getting through the revolving door, or trying to get a taxi frustrating, particularly when you're in a hurry and everyone else is just milling about. At one point a big Saturday-night crowd got stuck in the revolving doors on their way to exit the building.  It took three doormen to unstick the door.  Now, clearly, this can be chalked up to the guests' stupidity, but it seems to me that these herky-jerky, stopping-starting revolving doors can be improved on. The ballroom---the location of the CAA2010 book fair---is in an absurd and rather inaccessible location.  From my room on the 26th floor, I took the elevator down to the first floor, then a set of escalators down two more flights, then walked across a big lobby, through a corridor cramped with academics conversing, across another lobby just teeming with people, and then down another set of escalators.  I was an exhibitor at the book fair and toting my credit card terminals, supplies, conference program and other documents, as well as my handbag, camera bag, and all of my winter gear, was hugely inconvenient.  Also, three floors down, there is no cell phone service.  I have a brand-new iPhone 3GS, and could make no calls, nor access 3G or wifi down there.  As a hotel that hosts, no doubt, countless conventions each year, I find this issue preposterous. As far as the room goes, it was quite nice.  Roomy, huge TV, lots of furniture, modern décor, great view, mini bar, excellent water pressure in the shower.  At one point I dropped my book on the floor and knelt down to pick it up, only to see a whole mess of dust bunnies on the floor at the head of the bed.  Also there was a Fat Tire bottle cap---not mine, I swear---in the corner of the bathroom floor, which was not picked up until my third day in the hotel.  My room was for the most part nice and quiet; I occasionally heard folks walking by my door through the hallway, but I couldn't hear through the walls like I so often have at other hotels.  The sheets were nice and I can't sleep in sheets with low thread counts, so that's saying a lot!  The bed and huge mass of pillows felt comfortable and luxurious. The staff were friendly and made me feel super-special for being a Gold Member, which I'm pretty sure just means I signed up for their rewards program. The elevator situation wasn't any more annoying or inconvenient than it usually is at a hotel filled with conventioneers all going up and all staying on different floors, but at one point the elevator I was on alone stopped on floor 19 while en route to 26 and would not budge.  Luckily, the door opened and I was exactly on the floor (not halfway in the elevator shaft like you see in action flicks), so I was able to disembark and catch another elevator up to 26. The gym was lovely.  Spacious, with plenty of treadmills, ellipticals, weight machines, as well as free weights, kettlebells, weight bars, resistance bands, and stability balls.  And those Stay-Fit-at-Hyatt gym towels are better than any I've ever seen.  I have to confess, I have a bit of a collection here at home for my own personal use.  The treadmills and ellipticals have display screens where you can run on a track or in the mountains, watch TV, or listen to your iPod.  The iPod attachment charges your device as you listen.  It's pretty rad. All told, I would stay here again.  I just hope that either the Hyatt increases its connectivity in the ballroom or else the next convention I attend in Chicago is held at the Sheraton across the river, where wifi and cell phone signals are a non-issue.",N
2825,"we were there for a new years wedding. the wedding was great, the food was very good. i don't love bleu cheese, so i didn't have the salad ( there were no choices) but the fillet and salmon were excellent. the ballroom was a little chilly but when we were dancing later, it felt good. maybe turn on the a/c a little closer to the end of the meal? the breakfast the next morning was good, there was a nice variety to choose from. i was a little hungover, so didn't eat much. but my husband, who is a lover of all things breakfast, enjoyed his fine. the room however was lacking. we got there early, my husband was in the bridal party. check in was 3, we got there at noon and our room wasn't ready. they did have another room available and switched us no problem. the remote control for the tv wasn't working, the linens from the previous guests were in the hall until at least 4pm ( i know noon was the previous check out time, so i understand at first. but 4 hours later?) the toilet had a broken handle that had to be manipulated to work. we had a special rate for overnight parking, but had to go to the front desk to have the bill fixed. we probably won't be back, but then again we have small kids and a hotel downtown isn't high on our list right now. :)",N
5752,"Decent/cheap hotel convenient for the show I went to.  why the four stars ?  Paul the hotel bartender was beyond belief.   I've lived only in big metropolitan areas and am experienced w ""mixology"" and the mystique and all and Paul was as good as any bartender I've patronized",N
4607,"I stayed here for just one night at the end of September. While the Hotel Felix is eco-friendly and somewhat chic, I can't give the spot more than a three-star rating. Here's why: While the service was great and the staff was more than accommodating, the accommodations themselves were less than stellar. I, like Colleen, was assigned an ""01"" room near the elevator shaft. Ding. Ding. Ding. Ding. Chatter. Chatter. Chatter. With the room itself being a bit larger than a walk-in closet, I made do because, well, there are worse things. But those two 4am bars' across the way? Their patrons screaming all night? No thank you. Maybe it was such that I was perfectly situated on the seventh floor, to get the brunt of the noise, the screams funneled directly into my room via wind and high-rise condos. People yelling and screaming and carousing late into the night = no sleep for this gal. Coffee? There was nada left when I came downstairs, but whatever... you can get coffee at myriad places in Chicago. I just can't, in good faith, give the Felix a better than three-star rating, despite its super nice staff and eco-friendliness.",N
4111,"I will preface this by saying that Hyatt is my favorite big-chain hotel property.  They seem to consistently deliver from town to town, with a clean, modern feel that extends from the rooms to the common areas.  I think that the fact that there are almost always herds of middle aged conventioneers adds an invigorating buzz to the atmosphere, but if you don't like them, its not too hard to avoid by going directly to your room.  I don't think the exercise room gets too busy either because these folks are preoccupied with getting their drink on and ""working the crowd"" (interpret that however you'd like). This Hyatt is particularly interesting because you can access the weird  miniworld that exists underneath the buildings in this area (offices, predominately).  So if the weather is bad out, you might be able to find a few places open during business hours.  I somehow stumbled into it one night and it was a bit eerie because everything was closed, but still lit up and walkable.  Sorta like the mall equivalent of a ghost town.  I find it a bit odd that no one else has mentioned it, so maybe I imagined the whole thing.  Spoooooky.... PS - the small Italian restaurant located in the hotel is surprisingly good - not your average overpriced, mooch off the expense account kind of place you'd expect in a large hotel.  A good soup and salad bar, and good portions of tasty pasta too.",N
3917,"I stayed here in 2000 and felt like I was in that resort in the movie The Shining. It was a very creepy place. From the looks of the other reviews, it doesn't look like much has changed.",N
4831,"I rated this four stars because while I have been to much nicer hotels the Hyatt hotel is also a very nice hotel. The location is perfect surrounded by everything you need! The staff is very helpful and nice. Their beds are comfy and the rooms are a nice size. My favorite part of the hotel is their athletic/ pool area, one of the best! Its big enough for a large group of people. The pool holds a lot of people comfortably, and that it really important. I enjoyed all of their facilities including their sauna! -Dionne Gatling.",Y
2495,This hotel is gorgeous on the inside.  I actually have not stayed here but I went to a wedding and it was beautiful. The ballroom was a very pretty room and didn't need much decorating as well as the reception area outside the ballroom where drinks were served.  They have a winding stairway that is very old fashioned and elegant and the staff couldn't have been nicer!  I recommend this hotel to out of town guests all the time!,N
774,The best part about this hotel is the location.  Excellent location for day time adventures and night time cocktails.  We had a room with a nice view looking north along the lakefront. The hotel lobby was boring.  The rooms were plain.   Definitely no wow-factor but comfortable and convenient.,N
5426,Don't even THINK of staying here. Dirty. Creepy. My daughter was sexually threatened by a questionable man in the elevator. This place is not cool and it feels very  unsafe.,Y
1467,"Stayed here for 4 days and loved it! The hotel was right in the middle of everything and it was nice to be able to just walk around the city and explore. The hotel was really nice and the people were friendly - especially the guys up front! One of them even chased down a van to accommodate our large group when we were planning a night out on the town. I'd have to say one of the major advantages of this place is the location - you don't really have to go far to dine or shop, and even if you felt like taking a ten minute walk you could go right down to millennium park, the museum of contemporary art, or you could even take the red line which is 5 blocks away if you feel like venturing out farther. I would definitely consider this hotel again on my next stop in Chicago.",N
2181,"This was the hotel that we were assigned for our winter holiday in Chicago.  Per usual, I used the ol P.line and paid a very reasonable price for the room.   The main entrance is located on Michigan avenue, and it's possible to be stopped at an odd angle, though it shouldn't hinder anyone from unloading or loading people or luggage.  The concierge desk is very closely located to the main entrance, and service was speedy. The actual room was in the main tower with a city view.  It was amply sized, and all needed amenities were present.  This is a convenient location, and includes a few restaurants/bars with a Starbucks in in the building.",N
360,"Another awful hotel located just next door to the also-awful Congress Plaza. As sh!tty as the Congress usually is, I'd have to rate this Travelodge even lower. I wish I could give it zero stars. Or even negative-two-stars. It sucked THAT BAD. The lobby smelled like diarrhea. The elevators were broken the entire time I was there, which was extra fun since the entire hotel was full of Lollapalosers and it was hot as f-ck outside (and in, since their AC barely seems to work). There was some kind of sewer gas leaking into every crevice in the building that created the aforementioned stink. The bathrooms were disgusting. And again with the protein-stains on the bedding. Um, okay hotels...people F-CK in your rooms, okay? They're going to leak their nasty juices all over your sheets so STOP BUYING WHITE SHEETS FOR YOUR BEDS! If there's going to be dried spooge on my bed, I'd at least prefer not to see it. Writing this review is a waste of my time and yours. You only need two words from me: STAY AWAY.",N
4179,"Stayed  here for a convention over Valentine's weekend.  I was chaperoning a group of 40 students and I was anticipating a hassel at check in, but it went pretty smoothly.  No free internet anywhere in the place, but the rooms were comfortable and everything seemed new.  I noticed a charge to my credit card for around $13 that I didn't make (I think for internet service) and I was on hold for 10 minutes with accounting before I hung up.  Services for the conference were excellent, but not the best customer service-wise for guests.  Too much bleach on the towels too, I thought I was going to faint from the smell",N
357,"Completely adequate and a great location. Painful for a cheapskate like me not To book the 50$ spot out in the the burbs, but location, location, location.",N
1020,"Nice rooms, comfy bed, good views, awesome shower.  The staff was excellent, though I dealt with them very minimally. Definitely worth the money if you want a plush hotel room without all the super fancy extras.",N
591,"I can't say enough great things about my experience at the Public Hotel. Not only will I stay here on my future trips to Chicago, the hotel alone makes me want to come back as soon as possible! Here are just a few of the reasons why I love this place: 1. Every single staff person throughout the hotel was friendly, warm, and welcoming. (They must hire them all from a modeling agency because they are unbelievably good-looking too!) 2. The public spaces are not only interesting looking and luxurious but also comfortable! If I have to spend 3 hours working at my hotel, why not do so sitting in a cozy sheep skin-covered chair, next to a fireplace with a delicious coffee drink! 3. Speaking of drinks, the cocktail menu is interesting and delicious as is the food menu. I haven't eaten so well since... I can't remember when! And yet the prices are affordable! 4. The social scene here is very cool. People of all races, ages, and styles make for great people watching but the mid-western charm of the clientele made me forget I was rubbing elbows with the chic and glamorous. 5. Free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel is just an acknowledgment that we are living in a technology world and should do so without limitations. Charging for internet is like charging for air. 6. Free access to the nicest gym I have ever been to: totally unique design, more pretty people, AMAZING classes, (I'm still sore!), and top-quality gym equipment. 7. Perfect location - walking distance to restaurants, shops along the miracle mile, and just steps away from the shore, (you can't beat that view!) I could go on but I shouldn't need to. Book your room now! You won't regret it.",N
4724,"My girlfriend and I stayed here in a Queen room.  We give high marks to the excellent Desk, Bell, and Spa staff.  The hotel was also very clean, but overall we can't give it more than 2.5 stars and will seek other accommodations next time.  We were underwhelmed.  This hotel looks good, but it does have some questionable design issues that are worth mentioning...1) There are too many rooms built on each floor resulting in tiny, awkward spaces.  Charming for some maybe, but not very comfortable for the price.  Our tiny room was crammed into a corner with several other small rooms.  They might have been better off building two larger rooms there and doubling the price.  2) There was no closet, just a small rack open to the room.  3) The bathroom and shower had very little space on which to set things, and the sink faucet was too short.  You could barely even wash your hands under it.  4) We had to ask for normal sized pillows instead of the small, square ones that were on the bed.  5) The thermostat and temperature were difficult to keep regulated, and the system was fairly noisy.In short, if you're looking for amenities that go beyond the minimum, keep looking.  But if the price is right, and you need a decent place to stay with professional and friendly staff, go for it.",Y
4736,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. I loved the decor, and the staff was SUPER friendly.Great bar at the Hotel, which also serves food from the adjoining restaurant, Elate - delicious! Although the rooms may be on the smaller side, it was fine for me considering I was out all day and evening. They're very clean - which is what is most important, as far as I'm concerned.I would definitely stay here again - great location.",Y
3583,"I was a little weary of staying at The Drake Hotel after reading the reviews here on yelp, and seeing how they tended to be all over the map. I was pleasantly surprised though! The Drake is charming hotel, with a very helpful and courteous staff. It is very centrally located to some great shopping, dining, and cultural attractions. One downside is that there is no free wi-fi in the rooms. The hotel is pretty luxurious, but has a little bit of that old school vibe (or charm).",N
2702,"Pretty good quality for the price we paid.  That said, anything more than what we paid might have been pushing it (we paid $187/night).  Great location, great service, great housekeeping!   I knocked off one star because the room wasn't as nice as I had anticipated.  We decided to opt for the deluxe guestroom for some more square footage and I can't imagine how small the room would have felt if we had just booked the regular guest room.  Our couch is located right UNDER the tv, which means you can't sit on the couch and watch tv at the same time and you can't watch tv if someone is sitting on the couch.  The air conditioning was wonky - it would work fine sometimes and other times I felt like we were having humid air circulated through our super warm room.  It was nice having a full size mirror in the room, but it was just a large mirror that was placed slanting against the wall.  And there was this weird patent leather chair in our room that felt so misplaced; oh and random framed artwork placed above the headboard over ONE bed (and not the other) - it looked like $3 IKEA artwork. Maybe I'm hard to place when it comes to interior design. The positives of the hotel (and trust me, the positives outweigh the weird issues I had with the interior design and AC) include: the David Burke Primehouse (wonderful!), the housekeeping (prompt, attentive, fast like ninjas), friendliness of the staff, and LOCATION.  We were all over Chicago and the James Hotel really felt like it was the perfect location if you wanted to walk to Millennium Park, grab a bite to eat at XOCO or any of the other Rick Bayless restaurants, and then grab a drink at the Hancock Tower (which was exactly what we did when we were in Chicago). If I could get another great deal for the hotel, I'd probably stay here again.",N
3841,"Oh my goodness! I had the best experience at the Dana Hotel. I want to mention that I did not go to the SPA (though I hope to in the future!) so this is a review for the hotel only. For my birthday this year my boyfriend decided to do a special ""date night"" downtown. He is really good at planning things like this and after a lot of research he decided on Dana Hotel for our place to stay. When we arrived they valeted our car. Every staff person that we interacted with was helpful and friendly. The decor of the hotel is very beautiful and modern. There was a huge tour group checking in when we arrived so the manager took us aside to get us checked in. They also have self serve kiosks for check in. Our room was not ready so they set us up with a free drink at the bar while we waited. I thought that was really good customer service. The room was AH-mazing. If you decide to stay there I highly suggest that you choose a corner room. The first thing that hits you when you walk in are the floor to ceiling windows. The beds are so comfy and plush, the bathroom is awesome and has a rain shower! I took 4 showers and was only there one night. It has all the amenity's of a nice hotel, robe and slippers, nice bath products, etc. We also liked that it had an awesome ipod docking station with really good speakers. Overall it was an amazing room and well worth the price of $160. We had stayed at a holiday inn express a couple weeks before which cost $100 per night. $60 more for this room was a great deal if you ask me. We stayed in January so I am guessing the price might be more in a peak season? While we were there we also went to the roof top bar. It was really cool, not too crowded, and there was an outdoor patio with an ice bar! I also liked that there was a fire pit to sit around with complimentary robes to wear, so you could sit by the fire outside on the roof and not be cold. There were a few things to be aware of, though it wouldn't make me drop my rating. The valet is $40 per night and when you get the room charge they add tax. The drinks at the bar are really expensive, $15 or more for a cocktail. So keep that in mind. Either way, I know that if we do another date night downtown I will ask if we can stay there again, we loved it!",N
2253,"I have never stayed here, but I frequent the hotel bar often.  The martinis are very expensive, but they have the best complimentary olives and nuts I have ever had.  I just come here for the olives!!!!",N
3366,"You can't beat the price, especially since it included a day at the Field Museum! Though I agree that the garage parking is a little bit of a hassle, the hotel is centered in a place where you can walk to a variety of interesting places (Shedd Aquarium, House of Blues, etc) in a short amount of time. The lobby and bar are straight out of the 60's - gaudy and kitschy and just plain great. The staff was extremely helpful and nice - we had some crazy drunk trying to get in our room at 2:00 in the morning (he was in 440, we were in 1440) and the front desk and security responded immediately to the call we made. My complaints about the Essex are that the walls are extremely thin and the beds are way too short. I'm 5'2"" and my feet hung off the end. No huge deal, though. I'd stay there again.",N
3248,What a great hotel!   I'm pretty loyal to Starwood Hotels.  But when Groupon put up the $99 special for the Hard Rock Hotel - I decided to check it out. Check-In Very efficient and friendly.  I was checked into my room very quickly. The front desk crew was very warm and inviting.   Great start to the weekend. The Room Very urban hip - I had the Deluxe King.   Very nice and roomy --- The Hotel Bar 1.  Great Service -  Lara was on top of her game - very attentive and      friendly 2.   The Bar Menu was great!   I ordered the Mango and Asian BBQ       tempura chicken.  Delicious... I have to say there isn't one thing I could find wrong with the Hard Rock Hotel - I would definitely visit again (sorry Starwood) and would feel very comfortable putting my family up here when they visit Chicago.,N
3709,this is about tea.  i'm a rather experienced patron of the high tea experience...been playing the game for a while.  it's good here.  i've done two bridal showers here and both turned out perfect.  here is the trick: call the Palm Court and ask them when they recommend you take your tea.  there are definite good and bad times to experience your quest for civility.  you'll want to avoid the crowd of people who show up to the city once a year on a saturday and heard this was something they should do.,N
1600,"I want to go back. I want to go back. I want to go back.  I have had a ton of hotel stays recently...and I compare them all to this amazing hotel in chicago where I stayed for a week about a year and a half ago.  even though it was so long ago, I wanted to write a review for it.  that being said, staff changes and with time, hotels change.  so yelpers, read my review with that in mind!  While I was there, they were going through some construction on some of the floors so I got a great deal from expedia.  I didn't hear a thing.  the staff were super friendly and super helpful.  I could use their business center for the interviews that I was going to go to, and I was walking distance to jazz alley, fannie mae chocolates, great food, and downtown on top of my interview.  The location of this place is INSANE.   I was reading reviews written recently where they say the rooms are smaller than some of the other hotels etc.  I don't know WHERE they put me, and if the rooms are different, but I had a great room.  it had two beds in it, a chaise, tons of floor space, a exec desk, a flat screen, amazing shower, and an amazing view.  everything smelled new and looked great.  they had coupon books for visiting and when I went to the front desk they would draw me a map wherever I went.   on one of the nights where I came back really late (because I got lost) and my friends, knowing that I didn't know the area came back with me, the hotel staff even asked if they wanted to stay with me in my room and offered pillows and bath stuff.  I was shocked.  nobody EVER does that.  amazing staff, amazing stay, I want to go back.",N
2584,"Had a great time at the Victor Hotel. No cover. Staff was friendly. Decor is great and spacey. Music was fantastic!! It was a shame that no one was dancing though. Drinks were good. Tried Grey Goose Pomegranate vodka and it was great! Never even heard of it before! Bartender was pretty hott too, too bad he is probably gay...Lots of eye candy..some gross older men trying to hit on my friend and i but other than that it was a great time. Cant wait to go back. I hear Wednesday nights is a hot night.",N
5248,"I spent memorial day WE with some friends at this hotel. Room is great! Service awesome! These guys really work hard to make it feel as good and comfy as home.

444,"The rooms were clean, but the minute we walked into our room, our toilet was not working. It took 5 calls down to the front desk before they answered and took the guy 30minutes to come up to the room to fix the toilet. The service at the front desk, was extremely slow and rude. The line for check in was 6 people deep and there was only 1 front desk person helping. The restaurant that is downstairs was horrible, it took 65 minutes for them to bring us our food, never did they fill up our water or coffee, we just sat there, we would ask where our food is and the waitress would say, they were cooking it and would be out soon. We were so pissed that we just wanted to leave. we did not leave a tip and was not happy at all when we left. alot of the other guest were annoyed as well to how long the food took. I would not recommend this hotel for anyone that is on a schedule, the staff has no sense of time and does things as they please",N

3459,"Our stay was pleasant.  The rooms are definitely small and our view was a brick wall - but that's to be expected for the reasonable deal I got on a nice hotel in a large city.  If a view is important, and it should be for anything more than one night, ask for a good one.  The brick wall was dreary. The location is what this place is really all about.  Just blocks from Watertower Mall and other Magnificent Mile shopping. The room was relatively clean, though I did see an errant hair around the shower drain which is a pet peeve of mine.  Decor is updated and stylish.  I wished for a coffee maker in the room but wasn't there long enough to worry about it.  The lounge/bar area is small but effective for late night cocktails. My only serious complaint would be the $48 for overnight valet.  That's a little steep for Chicago but my car was brought up quickly and the valet staff was friendly and professional. Overall, hotel staff was functional, the room was clean, the price was good, and the location was perfect.  I might stay here again though I'm not uninterested in trying another hotel with better views for the price just off Michigan Ave.",N
4427,"It was our second time staying at Palmer House and while we weren't as in love with it as we were the first time.  Its still a great place to stay. The pros - in the Loop, right on the brown line, some rooms have two full bathrooms which is soooo nice, great staff and beautiful lobby. The cons - preeeetttty sure our room wasn't cleaned before we checked in (dirty towels, used dry cleaning bags on the closet floor, popcorn on the floor, etc). The rooms are kinda dated. The bathrooms are fine but the rooms themselves are just old with older fixtures and a tv I had probably in 1997. All that being said, I have to give it 4-stars as if we were going back to Chicago tomorrow, we'd pick to stay at the Palmer House again. Its just easy and in our price range.",N

The showerheads are out of a dollar store with lousy pressure and the sealant around the tub and toilet was peeling up or missing. The staff was great, 'nuff about that.

5125,"The Intercontinental Chicago has topped our expectations. Not only were we greeted with the nicest staff, but one in particular, named Emily at the front desk, really enabled my boyfriend and I to have a wonderful stay. Another staff member who made the experience so delightful was Patrick, one of the guest service men. Not only did we use a groupon to get a basic room, but it being my birthday engaged them to upgrade us to the Historic Tower (which is recommended far more than the North Tower, which is the basic tower), but they also gave us the bigger corner room which allowed us more room and a comfortable space during our stay. When we arrived, they provided us with cheesecake wishing me a happy birthday, and were on call to our every need. They took care of specific requests in a timely manner and truly made our experience excepetional. One thing I feel could have been better explained is that the gym is an additional charge. This wasn't explained to us in the beginning which takes a star away because of the misinformation that we weren't provided. The gym could also use enhancements. For the kind of hotel it is, I would expect a nicer gym area. However, the food was fantastic in the dining room, and the ambience and hotel itself is clean and nicely set. We truly enjoyed our stay and would absolutely go back anytime for a stay. I would recommend it!",Y

60,"I joined Yelp tonight specifically to warn people away from this place.  I arrived at 10:30 in the evening, and by the time I was in the room for 30 minutes I had already made reservations at another place; 15 minutes later I was already walking to the new place with my bags.  I simply could not stay there.  Peeling wallpaper, chipped paint, mystery stains on the carpet, a truly frightening bedspread, ripped chair cushions, scratched-up upholstery, and a general sense of uncleanliness; but the clincher was the security chain, which had clearly been broken in numerous times before, given the EIGHT bruised nail holes clustered around it. They did offer to upgrade me, but I simply had to leave.  I am not a hotel snob, but that room just felt like a dirty motel at a truck stop.  If it was $40 / night [in this neighborhood], I could see it.  But over $100 / night?!?!  No f-ing way.  I went to the Day's Inn one block away for $13 / night cheaper...   I hate to be so negative, but they need to know they need to upgrade their facility; in the meantime, I can take some solace from helping others avoid the disappointment I felt.",N
4652,"We Pricelined Hotel Felix and got a pretty good deal.  Given what we paid, it was decent.  However, if we had paid the rack rate, it might not have been worth it. The decor is very contemporary and minimalist.  I very much liked it.  The front desk staff was very friendly, but not the most deft at using the computer system.  We had to give them the same credit card three times during our one night stay because apparently it didn't get stored to the account. We got into our room and it was small but very well appointed.  Unfortunately the bathroom was not cleaned.  It was very strange...there was a wet washcloth in there and not the full compliment of toiletries.  The manager and housekeeping staff were very attentive to this and solved it quickly. The bathroom has NO counter space.  The sink it very cool looking but not very functional.  It sits only about three inches below the faucet so you can barely get your hands under it to wash them. The bed linens were nice and the bed was very comfortable. We found their claim that the rooms are ""whisper quiet"" to be false.  We were awakened several times at night by street noises, noises in the hall, and an alarm from the neighboring room. The TVs are full HD and the free Wifi is a plus. We enjoyed a little getaway within the city, but not sure if we'd stay there again...especially if we had to pay full price.",N

3588,"My best friend and I were celebrating our birthdays recently.  Having made reservations at the Palm Court for tea, we went ahead and booked a room so we could leisurely go about our weekend.  It ended up being such a great idea! We checked in a little early before our tea service reservation at 3pm, so that enabled us time to freshen up.  Not only did we have a giant bathroom, we had TWO giant bathrooms.  Quite perfect for two twenty-something girls to get ready for a night on the town.   The decor seems dated, but it is maintained very well.  Our room was very clean and, again, the bathrooms were great!  It was really quiet at night, which was great because we were tired from a long day of being fabulous.   It wasn't cheap!  One night ran us about $300.  It was a great splurge, but be sure to check Orbitz/Expedia for better deals.",N
907,"My friend and I had a fabulous stay at this quaint hotel last week.  I received a gift certificate for a weekend stay so we took a road trip down from Milwaukee.  The building is a restored beauty with antique touches and exposed steel bones.  In fact, I learned that it is Chicago's first steel skyscraper.  The location could not have been more centrally located and within walking distance to Millenium park and Michigan Avenue's Magnificent Mile.  The room we had was lovely and clean and very quiet.  For us the most impressive part of our stay was the friendliness of the staff.  I highly recommend this hotel and plan to stay here when I come back to Chicago.",N
1547,"We had a very nice stay here.  The location is convenient to transit and the Mag Mile.  The rooms are large and clean.  The staff is very friendly, and we got a great price. Also, free internet!  I would certainly return.",N
503,Good value. Really easy to get to off Columbus from Lakeshore and close to everything. Wifi free to HHonors gold.,N
3909,"I would almost be tempted to give this place 3 stars just for location, but it is just not possible. Our human interaction with the Hotel staff was minimal and basically acceptable it just seems to us like they are banking on the fact that their location and overflow from other hotels will keep them full enough to cover their expenses and make some money. The place would be well served if some dollars were reinvested into a bit of a makeover. The place is filthy, the carpet is smelly and it just looks old and dated. It wasn't our choice to stay here, but since I snoozed on signing up for the Chicago Marathon, I had to go through Marathon Tours for an entry and the only available hotel left was this one- so we checked out the reviews before we arrived and were totally mortified by them. The A/C wasn't working in our room and based on the dismal service described in the other reviews, we decided against calling the front desk to report it. Thankfully it was cool enough in the evenings and we were able to open the windows despite the fact that it was the 14th floor. The fresh air did wonders to dissipate the musty smell from the room and the cool nights made it for comfortable stay despite the sound of the L train passing by every few minutes and the random sirens blaring somewhere in the city. Very convenient location and a bonus star for the small poltergeist I saw on the last night we were there .... a haunted hotel is a cool hotel...",N
2250,after shopping this is the perfect place to crash. i stayed here one night and didnt want to come home! the pool is ginormus! and the beds are so soft. i had like i a presidential suite...good times,N
2128,"I stayed here while my bf was on a business trip. It's centrally located, near to the train, the river, the sights, restaurants, shopping, etc. Walk outside, and downtown Chicago is right there for your enjoyment. I think I'd rate 3.5 stars if I could. I was really happy with the bed, because usually no matter how nice a hotel I stay in, I toss and turn all night long. I pretty much slept like a (semi-drunk) rock here, I am pleased to report. The room was very small, but fairly nice. I'd agree that it's not a four star hotel - more like 3. I dunno if I'd stay here again, but I don't really have anything bad to say about it. My room was free, however, and I don't think I'd pay more than $200/night for this place, if that. Maybe I'm cheap? It's been a while since I've paid for a hotel room in the US since my bf travels a lot for business... I like how they have a touch screen computer thingy in the room - that was pretty cool.",N
2863,"Nice rooms, nice club level, manager's reception is cool except that you have to pay for drinks...laaaaaaaaame. Not so nice breakfast, though.  Is it really that difficult to get something cooked to order?",N
5230,"I stayed here twice for business in the winter of 2010. One time I had a very large, gorgeous room with a wonderful view of the John Hancock building and lakefront. The size of the room almost swallowed the king sized bed. The other time the room was much smaller but came with a small sofa, and the view was of the city. The elegant decor, bedding and furniture all befit a Ritz-Carlton hotel. The staff were always pleasant, helpful and eager to serve - they were almost disturbingly subsequious... The food in the meeting rooms was the only mediocre aspect of my stays - just typical hotel food. A truly elegant, luxurious place to stay on someone else's expense account!",Y
1205,"Very nice lobby and lounge area amenities. Rooms are in good shape but overall are not that great - I hate that there is not a real closet but rather a rack with a curtain in front of it. While it is attached to the convention center it is still a hike. Also, the SHOR restaurant, Forno quick food and M/X bar are all good. I was especially pleased with the pannini at Forno. The best thing about this place? I dropped my Tiffany bracelet down the drain at 2am and the plumber came right away and looked for close to an hour for it - he found it and I appreciate him trying so hard...",N
3873,"Wonderfully decorated, big comfy beds and friendly staff for the most part.  The doormen were super helpful and friendly as was the female reception staff that worked afternoons.  The male reception staff the next morning were opposite.  Rude and sneered at us rather than a nice ""hello"" which were given in abundance the evening before.  Maids were friendly as was the wait staff in the restaurant which had good breakfast and big portions.  Incredibly comfortable stay and great views.",N
3827,"Love the Spa at the dana! Had a manicure with Erin the other day and it was great. The Spa is so tranquil and relaxing, I didn't want to leave!",N
486,"For an old building, this Embassy Suites is very well maintained and has been remodeled well.   If you ever want to see how old the hotel is...go down the stairs and check out what that's like...they never repaint or remodel stairwells.   The rooms are spacious (another clue that it is an older building) and laid out well....your standard ES....but still excellent.  The open atrium Embassy Suite trademark...makes it noisy at times in the living room...especially during happy hour or during a party.....but the bedroom in the back of the suite with it's locked door...takes the edge off the noise.  Four people can stay in this suite and not feel cramped at all...plenty of room for even 6 people.....if they let that many stay in the room. The included breakfast and happy hour...wine. beer and snacks...is very welcomed if you are on a per diem or budget.    One dinner downtown can set you WAY back......That takes the edge off staying downtown and its high prices. Breakfast is the best of any of the suites hotels around the country.   The highlight is the omlette station.   A chef prepares a custom omlette for you .   You pick out all the ingredients like peppers, onions, tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, bacon, sausage, ham, cheeses, etc.  With that you also get fried potatoes or pancakes.   Quite a wide range of selection.   There is also a large fruit area to get all your standard fruits...melons, apples, oranges, bananas, etc.  There is a danish/donut/pastry tray as well as cereals and oatmeal.   Apple, cranberry and orange juices are available as well as all the coffee.   In downtown Chicago, this would easily be a $25 to $30 breakfast if you eat alot.   Everyone in your room gets this breakfast as part of your room rate.   In addition to the breakfast is the free happy hour as well.   All the wine, beer and sodas you can drink in 2 hours as well as appetizers.  The wine is one grade above screwcap bottled wine.   Beer is standard Miller quality.    One night was puff pastry mini hot dogs and cheese balls.    The next night was buffalo wings and meatballs.   Again, in downtown Chicago, you drinking a few beers or glasses of wine plus these appetizers could easily set you back $20 to $30 per person.  However the quality was not good for the appetizers....2 stars....most of the dishes were way too salty. My only complaint here is that many times no one answers the phone ...either the operator, concierge, front desk.   They get overwhelmed frequently.    I just hope an emergency doesn't happen here and I can only call out to get help For downtown Chicago at the lakefront area, Embassy Suites is an excellent place to stay, especially if you are travelling with a family.  I like this place much better than the Sheraton up the block.",N
2588,"This club is in the middle of nowhere.  There's no way you'd just stumble upon it.  It has to be a destination with address in hand for you to even end up there.  It's not near any of the other clubs in the West Loop.  I'm an idiot and thought it was a real hotel that just had a cool lounge, and was wondering why the hell anyone would choose to stay all the way between two factories while visiting Chicago.  Anyway, we went here on a Friday night for a special event a friend was promoting and I really enjoyed myself.  Music was good, drinks were pricey but strong and the staff was friendly.  We were also able to find a parking spot fairly easily, which is a huge plus.",N
396,"This is the first place I ever stayed in Chicago, and I'd love to stay here again!  I checked in the first night and shared a regular double room with a friend.  We noticed that the room smelled a little funky, like wet horses or something.  Turns out the air conditioner was leaking water and the dampness had made the sheepskin mattress toppers start to smell a little... sheep-y.  We reported the issue in the morning and they very promptly and apologetically offered to switch the room. I was able to check into my own room at the same time, so they gave us two adjoining rooms.  I'd booked one of their ""junior suites,"" which turned out to be AMAZING - a huge corner room with a murphy bed, a full living room, a bar, and a kitchenette.  Add in my friend's room next door and we basically had a two-bed, two-bath living space that was bigger than a typical apartment.  The corner room had a breathtaking view of downtown Chicago, and I snapped a lot of photos at different times of day and night of all of the iconic tall buildings.  The murphy bed was pretty cool and actually quite comfortable for something that also folds into the wall!  I've stayed in fancier hotels, but this place takes the prize for a truly fantastic room. I had breakfast every morning at the Weber Grill, which has a pretty typical buffet to offer.  The hotel is close enough to a variety of convenience stores and supermarkets that you can stock up on some basics and keep them in the room.  I really liked the location and got a great deal on that suite when I stayed there.  I always check the prices when I'm coming back to Chicago.",N
4431,"This hotel is old and is badly in need of an upgrade.  You know, like walls that aren't so thin that I can hear every word of the TV show that my neighbors are watching, with their gaggle of screaming a**hole children.  I can hear everything that's dropped, every time someone flushes the toilet, and the footsteps of everyone who walks by.     I should rent a porno & blast the volume.  It's not like I can get any sleep with all the noise anyway. If you want to access the interwebs, it'll be $20.  That's for one day... and the internet access is spotty (the connection dropped twice in the past 3 hours).  Since the charge was so steep, I figured I'd hop online to tell all 3 people who are reading this how crappy this hotel is.  :-) This is a grand old hotel.  I don't think I'd hate this place if I only had to grab a drink or eat a meal here.  But shouldn't hotel rooms be restful? Did I mention that you shouldn't stay here if you want to get some rest? Signed, Angry insomniac",N
3742,"Dana is like a stereotypical fashion model: wonderful to look at but sorta empty on the inside and a strange mix of narcissistic and insecure. Let's do the math: Upon arrival I was greeted by the always friendly door men at the entrance (+1), and then waited and rode one floor up in an elevator to the lobby (-1) where I was summarily ignored by the two people sitting at reception. After attempting to use the strange computer kiosk check-in I finally flagged down someone to help get me my key (-1). This person was openly rude and disparaging to me for no particular reason, spending five minutes lecturing me on how not to book a room through Expedia - note that I was not the person who booked the room. This became an even larger problem when, despite taking both my ID, credit card and a signed form - they booked me into Colleen's room (-1). I'll let her explain the appalling shit storm that ensued after this mistake but needless to say, they need to hire hospitality staff and problem solvers, not petty people who hate their jobs.   The room itself was tiny and dark, the only natural sunlight came from a door to a small balcony (-1). I'm a sucker for balconies (+1). While that shower head could bring world peace with the perfect rain of water that flows out of it (+1), the shower itself was cramped and the complimentary toiletries seemed cheap (-1). But they did provide plenty of towels, cotton swabs, q-tips and a strong hair dryer so I just used the products I packed and went on my merry way (+1). The bed was comfortable (+1) and room service came fast and fresh (+1). Stay away from the in room snacks, despite looking tasty and locally sourced, they are old and stale. All of them. But the mini bar prices are super reasonable so I know you'll be tempted. Overall, it was decent. There were a lot of flaws but it was a comfortable place to stay and certainly not grimy or crappy in any way. Just a lot of smaller details and customer service issues that they could improve on. Let's hope they do!",N
1137,"Great location!  You are so close to Millennium Park and Michigan Ave.  The rooms are very swanky.  The bathrooms set the bar pretty high.  Walk in shower, large tub, bathrobes included.  I did have some problems however.  I reserved a King bed and they gave me two double beds.  They wanted an extra $100 a night for a king bed.  I don't think I'll come back for that reason alone.  Everything else was great.",N
2544,"ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww. Go for the feather-hair, ugg-boots, tight top, short skirt, make-up people watching, leave when you can't bear it anymore. wall decor is super amateur. Looks like they picked it up at target and didn't bother to change out the photos. Oh my god, is that a nipple? That's so transgressive!",N
1223,"Very nice hotel.  Clean, attentive staff.  Located in south Chicago; not a lot very close by - 2 miles of walking gets old.  If I had a bus schedule, maybe I could speed this up.  Surrounding area seems 'abandoned'.  Excellent Fitness center - huge with cardio and weights.",N
1777,"I received a call from the Hotel Allegro - with profuse apologies and obvious embarrassment . . . it took a while for them to reach me, but Mary, the manager who called, was persistent and very kind.  I feel confident that they have addressed the problems and with that resolved I have no problem recommending this fine boutique hotel!  I will stay there again.",N
2437,"It's a big, huge, gigantic hotel.  It's nice and it's a lil' fancy.  Hilton's vary so much in decor and services, you never know what you're going to get.  This one is a winner.   We stayed here for two nights when we moved to Chicago before the movers arrived with our stuff.  I got a screaming rate the week of July 4th for $129 a night.  I was upgraded to the Executive level, which was nice. The bed was really comfy.  We were on the top floor with a view of the Sears Tower, so it was a great way to spend my first night in Chicago.  The room was very spacious and the bathroom was on the small side, but with good counterspace.  It's been a while since it's been updated, the bathroom has marble everywhere and gold fixtures.  It's very ""over the top"".   Not really my scene, but it was good for what it is.  I'd stay here for business, but probably not for pleasure again.",N
5709,"I had to bail outta the burbs for some alone time with my wife and daughter and was pleased to find the River Hotel.  The location and price can't be beat.  We upgraded from the smallest to the medium sized room and was really glad we did for only $20 more.  I'm not a fan of bottled water, but each floor has free, refillable bottled water which came in handy in the summer heat.  The rooms are still a bit tight, but we were able to sneak in a roll-away bed for my daughter.  The beds were comfortable and the view was awesome.  The room had a flat screen, nice desk with some local books and a wonderfully designed bath room.  Our room was on the 9th floor with a view of the Chicago river, Trump building and the two corn-cobb towers.  While peering out of the window I felt like I was living in Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot album cover. The River is right in the heart of Chi-town with fast access to the ""L"", Millinuem Park, the Art Institute, etc.  It has free wi-fi and access to a PC and printer in the lobby. I'll gladly stay there again.",N
3365,"Zero stars - rude staff, we picked it because of the pool and the room was so cold if you were not in the pool you needed your winter coat. It was dirty and - bad sheets - heat was too hot or too cold. Staff rude - did I say that enough?",N
4128,"I like this place. Great location, nice room, great bar. We stayed here during our first visit in Chicago a few years ago... The bar is impressive - you are warned on the large/group martini glasses ;-) I am keeping the fifth star, because of their water conservation efforts. I appreciate their efforts, but I had specifically asked that they change the sheets after two days of our stay there, which they didn't. I called again and asked for the housekeeping to come back and change the sheets when we got back from the sightseeing, and they did so promptly. I say, when someone pays $180 a night to stay here, they deserve to sleep on clean sheets. There are planty of ways to be nice to mother nature...",N
2422,"I've been coming here since the Boulevard Room had ice shows in the 1960's. And I still like this place quite a lot. Last night we met before and after Daughter NO. 2's high school graduation in the lobby bar for drinks and eats. Great service, very good enough, basic bar food which everyone enjoyed. The furniture and the air conditioning made it Wonderful!! A great little ""off the beaten path"" (NOT) to hang out.",N
3081,"I was taken to stay at this hotel on my 18th birthday and I just couldnt believe how nice, trendy, and beautiful it was. I loved the lobby and the decor in it. The room was gorgous. Very chic and stylish. If your looking for a trendy/chic place to stay or even visit the bar, this is the best place.",N
5397,I stayed for 3 months working out of town.  I thought this Hotel was great.  I spend most the year in Hotels all around the world.  This Holiday inn has great people!  Every year I come back for a cpl days and they always remember me.,Y
2237,"The hotel is very nice and the staff is very attentive.  We stayed in the Historic Tower and the views were spectacular.  We had a direct view of the Trump Tower and the River.  My only complaint is that the internet is very slow, but that seemed to be a common theme throughout Chicago when using my iPhone. The hotel is in the middle of everything - shopping, food, some decent bars. Also, the indoor pool was great.  I would definitely recommend to anyone.",N
5064,"One of Chicago's ritziest hotels; definitely wouldn't mind staying here again. The place has everything you need - bar, restaurant, ect. The room service is excellent. The rooms are immaculate, no bed bugs here. :)  The staff is also very professional and polite. I would recommend this place if you're looking for a clean and affordable hotel.",Y
2031,"I work in the Mart, and this is the spot that we use to put up our customers or out-of-town coworkers.  Its a big PRO that its attached via skywalk to the Mart, has a cute bar with a great view, and has its own restaurant.  I also think they have been renovating the rooms. My word of advice if you're an out-of-towner coming for the weekend is that it is more of a 9 to 5 M-F kinda place and the taxi sitch can be a bit dicey after like 7 or 8 pm.  While it may look centrally located on a map, its a bit out of the way for doing anything in the main hub on the weekend.  That being said, they prob also have great weekend rates, and if you don't mind hoofing it a bit it could be a good deal.  they also have tons of parking!",N
3961,I like the old feel and its a great price for downtown.,N
294,"The Seneca is my new home away from home in Chicago.  The staff was welcoming, professional and positive.  I believe they actually like working at the hotel!  Patrick at the front desk let us check in early and seemed very happy to do so.  Thanks!  The room was on the 9th floor, and was quiet and beautifully appointed.  The beds were superb.  Everything was immaculate.  There was a full kitchen, which we did not use, but would be very handy for some folks.  The shower was luxurious and bath products were provided.  Check out took no time at all.  The lobby is reminiscent of the old time luxury hotels.  It was small, but beautiful.  The location, as other reviewers have pointed out, was simply unbeatable.  Check out Francescas's restaurant next door.  Excellent Italian food and good prices.  The theatre is across the street.  We saw the play  ""Working"", which I would highly recommend.  For you American Girl Doll fans, the store is right across the street, next to the theatre.  Michigan Avenue is steps away, but you are shielded from the noise at the Seneca.  We'll be back!",N
2488,"Not sure we would have been quite as happy paying full price, but our $89 bid (for a Saturday night!) on Priceline made it worth it. According to the front desk, for $25 extra we could have snagged a lake view. Parking was ridiculous at the hotel ($45 for 24hrs) so we opted to park in a surface lot behind the hotel on Wabash for $25/24hrs. The only downfall is that you can't move your car in and out. Was just fine with us as we relied on pubic transportation anyway. Cab was $7 for 2 of us to get to the river for the Architectural cruise (at least a 20"" walk) and $12 one way to get to Second City. Not bad. The room was small, but clean. Outdated, as others had posted. Pool looked really nice although we didn't have time to try it out. Did not try the hotel restaurants either- opted for Chicago fare w/ a dog at Portillos, and deep dish pizza from Giordanos. Location-wise, it's quite a hike from Magnificent Mile shopping, but do-able if you have the time.",N
2560,"I love this spot!  Only reason I don't frequent it very often, is bc I'm unsure of who is throwing the party and what kind of crowd it'll be in there. Regardless, I adore the b&w photography throughout Victor.  I always see something new.  My favorite part are the side rooms....it's nice to get away from the riff raff sometimes.  Who am I kidding?  ALWAYS! I've actually eaten at VH, I totally forgot.  We got a proscuitto panini. Unfortunately, it did not come w/ fresh fruit as described....so they discounted our bill.  I think they saw my reaction to the lack of fresh fruit and mumbled amongst themselves, ""I think I recognize her from yelp...we'd better do something to compensate.""  ;-)   Another thing to note, VH serves sushi!  hmmm....questionable. I also like the location...totally off the beaten path.  Victor Hotel will see this face again.",N
764,"My stay here this past Sunday and Monday night was o.k.  Nothing special, but nothing totally awful either.  The room was a decent size, the bed was great, but the toilet ran constantly and the bathroom had very few amenities.  Once again, I was cursed with the room by the elevator (I'm 4-4) and while I'm on the subject, I think the elevator had a ghost as it would open & close 2-3 times EVERY ride (regardless of which car I was in) before going up/down. I'm not sure if I'd stay here again.",N
3792,"Rather fun things about Dana: Floor to ceiling glass windows Fluffy gowns and matching white slippers, I know, it's the simple things... Friendly service, and bonus chocolate coated fortune cookies on the bed. Fun but unsustainable shower heads in the shower stall. Sorry Lake Michigan. A stool in the shower.... for...? Use your imagination. Also handy for shaving one's legs. The breakfast had all kinds of berries. Berries maketh the day happy. Soft beds with lots of cushions. Frigging ""WEIRD-AS"" things about Dana: A glass wall in the shower stall, with a curtain that can be opened from the outside, for maximum perving potential for gazing at your loved one while they shower, or take a dump. Exposed concrete ceilings in small low-ceiling bedrooms? I know it's trendy and retro to use exposed concrete like in the 60s.... but in a small room the only things that come to mind are ... uh... bunker? prison cell? Not so good things about Dana: No bathtub. Small rooms. Weak wireless signal. The spa services were all booked up, so we couldn't make use of the spa.",N
4977,"I stayed here earlier this year while on business. I'll start with the pros: The hotel enjoys a great location on Michigan Avenue, near several restaurants, shops and other points of interest. I also had no problem with the service. However, the hotel shares a flaw with many of the hotels in which I've stayed in Chicago, San Francisco and other cities: size. The rooms looked a lot bigger on http://www.getaroom.com, and the lobby itself seemed rather small. Also, the elevators (these were small too) were beyond confusing. You have to go up to the 3rd floor to then get on another elevator? I've never seen that before. The hotel isn't perfect, but you get what you pay for. You'll still have a comfortable stay at a reasonable price.",Y
5059,"My family and I booked into this hotel for our weeklong trip to Chicago. We are being charged $200 a night for the five of us, but I am  not impressed. I was told that there was WiFi available, but not informed that it was an additional $10 per device per day to use. The free computer terminals, which I am  using to write this review, have three computers and are quite busy most of the day.The Suite my family checked into was slightly cramped, and I had very little room. This hotel advertises as a ""family-friendly hotel"", and I guess that is who this is for, couples with small children and single businessmen. I shall not be returning here, and I would rreccomend the Embassy Suites on the Navy Pier, I have found it much cheaper.",Y
3083,"I had the pleasure of staying here for 3 nights. Granted, it felt like a scene from ""Night at the Roxbury"" every time I stepped into one of the elevators. I even began paying homage to Katan and Ferrell by bobbing my head to the side to the beat any time I was alone inside. But this got tiring so I stopped. My 23rd floor room was perfect. The view of the lake was spectacular. I did experience the bar once when a friend came out to meet me for a drink. Again, a bit Roxburyish but whaddya gonna do. The bartender was friendly. The service throughout the hotel was impeccable. The 5 stars are fully deserved.",N

We always choose boutique hotels, and our room rate was excellent, 23rd floor with view of Michigan Ave.  The room certainly was a satisfactory size, since most of time we were away from it.  Wifi in the room would have been ideal, but going down to the lounge area wasn't a problem and rather a cool place to be, whether with coffee or a drink. The location made every where so accessible, we walked all the time!  No car needed, just bought a 3 day pass and could use the El or buses anytime!  A great hotel in a great city!",N

While the W in Seattle is by far my favorite one - (I am biased for family reasons) - I have to say that the concierge (5 Big and Bright stars) at this hotel really know how to treat you right.

1871,"I stayed here for a business trip and had an average-good experience.  At least it was not the boring cookie cutter hotel I usually have to stay in for these sorts of trips.  I got in pretty early, around 10 am and I was able to check in which was great.  I didn't have much interaction with the staff but the bell hops out front who opened the front doors for me about 30 times in one day when I decided to try to see Chicago in 8 hours in between fielding work requests were great. The room itself was fine and as to be expected from a hotel like this.  Not overly wonderful but certainly comfortable.  The bathroom was pretty small and there were too many doors that you had to open and close.  If you're staying here for a while you might want to make sure you have one of the bigger bathrooms.  There seems to be a lighting problem in this hotel - there were not enough lamps in my room nor did they emit enough light.   I too had the $28 oatmeal and coffee!  Seems to be the breakfast of Yelp champions.  I do agree it was way overpriced, even by room service standards.   I feel bad for the people that work at the front desk here, they have to do everything by candlelight.  They should at least let them have bigger candles.",N

The downside is that the hotel is next to the Northwestern Medical Center, so we heard sirens all night long. Since my company booked the seminar, I had a single room, that was truly meant for a single, but my husband came with me.  The room was very nice, well appointed with nice linens, bathroom supplies from L'Occitane, and since the room was meant to be part of a suite, set back from the main hall.  But it was SMALL!  The foot of the bed was only inches away from the wall, so in order to get out of bed, I had to climb over my husband to get to the bathroom.   It was great that the room had an Ipod Home so I could charge my Ipod and listen to my music. There was a problem with my bill that was unforeseen.  My company paid for my room with the corporate credit card, but the hotel couldn't find the folio with information.  The room was charged to my account, and only when I returned home was everything cleared. The Allerton had done a conversion on their accounting system two days before, and my information was lost.   I would stay at the Allerton again if only for the location,.  The hotel and staff were wonderful.  Thank you.",N
1900,"Trendy, well-located hotel with great hospitality. The rooms are spacious but forget the view. Typical hotel bar makes a great meeting spot. We needed to print tickets off for a cubs game - instead of making us go to the business centre the front desk did it for us on the spot for free.",N
5856,"The only great thing is location.  Rest of the hotel is very forgettable, lacks any character.  Decor is stuck in the 90s.  Their customer service is extremely poor.  After our stay, we checked out and left the hotel for 1 hour.  We then realized my husband left his wedding ring on bedside table, so returned immediately to get it.  The room had just been cleaned, and I went in and the ring was gone.  The person who cleaned it said it wasn't there, but I know exactly where it was, and it was there.  So it was stolen.  The hotel launched an ""investigation"" where they determined that they were not at fault, and send me a letter letting me know that they would be doing nothing.  So we stayed in a mediocre hotel, and lost a wedding ring.  All in all, not a way to treat your customers.  If you stay here, hide your valuables.",Y
3538,Very dissapointing from what I thought it would be for a four star hotel. We got this place at an incredible price on Hotwire.  Then they wanted to charge extra if we requested double beds... (who does that by the way).. and so we upgraded to a double bed and got a suite.   A suite means you get a couch and some extra space.  Totally dissapointed. I thought it meant you get a separate room... right? The valet is okay.. takes about 10-15 minutes to get your car out unless you really call ahead of time. At least there was a place to make your makeshift minibar.,N
2669,"5 billion stars for The James as my wedding venue. The James was an awesome venue.  It isn't your typical wedding venue with pastels and white linens and chair covers with bows and ribbons everywhere, it is more contemporary and has a modern, stylistic feel.  This is what my fiance and I wanted for our wedding, so the James was a perfect fit.  We were sold as soon as we saw the reception space which has lighting included (adds to the drama) and an incredible black and white mural of the Chicago skyline.  The food was incredible, too.  Many of our guests said that they'd never had a better meal at a wedding.  Receptions at the James are catered by David Burke's Prime, so the food is pretty spectacular (esp the filet mignon).  The cost was suprisingly reasonable for the fantastic quality and venue, especially when compared to other hotels in the area. The professionalism was great, I had pretty specific requests for how the room was to be set up, etc., and Sinisa and his team executed everything perfectly.  Before guests entered the reception dinner area, Sinisa took me, my husband, and my parents into the room so we could see how it loooked and it was dramatic and fantastic (very David Tutera-ish).  It was a nice touch.  The tasting was amazing, too.  We were treated very VIP-ish throughout the experience.  Responsiveness through email can be a little slow.  However, during the 1-3 weeks leading up to the wedding, responsiveness was right on point.  Email returns were within a few hours.  I suppose these are the most crucial times for communication, so that was greatly appreciated and all in all they did a great job coordinating and setting up/breaking down the event. Awesome things about The James as a wedding venue: (1) The food is AMAZING (2) The price was way lower than other hotels in the area (3) The absence of the typical hotel wedding feel (i.e. white poufy linens and pastel chair covers & bows everywhere...blech) (4) The James Club for an after party (seriously, this was pretty awesome and I loved that you can have late-night snacks there and play pool) (5) VIP feel of the overall experience (6) free upgrade to a pimped-out suite for the bride or another guest of choice (7) dramatic pinpoint lighting included....lighting is way expensive if you bring it in yourself, and having the lighting really added something extra All in all, an amazing, fantastic venue that was a pleasure to work with.  I definitely recommend The James to other brides in the future!  I wish I had another wedding to plan so I could work with them again!",N
4964,"We have had an AWFUL experience at this hotel. Before booking, we were told that the Allerton Hotel lists itself as a ""business"" hotel with strong wi fi capabilities. This was extremely important to us when booking as we run a company that relies on the ability to upload time sensitive large files while traveling. Upon first arrival, when we realized that the advertised wi fi speed was far below the ACTUAL wi fi speed, we spoke with a manager who gave us the run around, finally transferring us to the internet service provider outside of the hotel. After hours of waiting (and losing precious time), we had gotten nowhere and had to resort to looking into other options with no help from the hotel. Finally, we ran tests via http://testmy.net and were surprised to find that the connection was running 98% LOWER than the average internet connection speed. The hotel staff was clueless, the internet provider couldn't reset the server because their system was FROZEN, and our business trip was RUINED. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL IF YOU NEED TO USE THE INTERNET. ALSO, there was a PILE of dust in the corner of the room near the television - clearly the staff thinks what you don't see at first glance does not need to be cleaned. We tried to plug in the lamp (which did not work) and saw that the floor in that corner was white with dust. Gross.Totally not a 4 star hotel as advertised on Hotwire and the rooms were smaller than any place we've stayed even in NYC or Rome. And parking is $50 a night. Way overpriced.The ONLY thing it has going for it is location. Location is amazing. But PLEASE don't stay here if you need to conduct any sort of real business! Or if you have a traveling companion (rooms only big enough for one person).",Y
4222,"Not the best. The hotel stay is expensive and then they charge $50 per night for parking. The room had exposed carpet tacks into the bathroom which I stepped on in bare feet. Location is great downtown, but I would definitely stay elsewhere my next visit. Not a 4 star hotel.",N
3865,GREAT location.  In the middle of everything. We stayed last weekend in a King Suite.  Very nice.  We also enjoyed the balcony and full windows for the great views.  Very fun weekend.,N
644,"I'm writing my review based on the overall experience I had with the staff and services of the hotel and the people that helped me make my wedding a HUGE success! Both ceremony and reception took place here in their LaSalle Ballroom and I will post pictures once I get them from my photographer.  The ballroom is decorated with beautiful chandeliers in an amber wash but the carpet, though new, is slightly hideous - but I guess hotels have to have ""busy"" carpets to keep the dirt from showing. Rebecca Kuzelka - the most amazing and organized wedding coordinator ever!  There is something to be said about someone who already has a full plate on her hands, yet she does an incredible jobs of making ME, the bride, feel like I am her ONLY account.  Her attention to detail, her proactive spirit to make sure I have not forgotten anything (when there is so much going on, only a professional like Rebecca can point out the little details that may have been overlooked).  I had 10 months to plan my wedding and unfortunately, the person that I signed the contract with decided not to show up to work one day and I was lost without a coordinator for over two months.  Rebecca took on the position in June and was on top of everything as soon as she started.  What also made it really easy was that her ""style"" was similar to mine - Minimalistic and trendy - so the way she executed her job was the same way I envisioned my wedding.  Of course, I did my homework and outlined everything I needed done and was worried that the actual day wouldn't go smoothly - However, the day was seamless and I put my FULL trust in her and she made my day the happiest day of my life (well almost, marrying my best friend was even better)!  She organized all my vendors, all the staff, ensured everyone was where they needed to be and had everything done before I even thought about it.  I couldn't have been happier! Ben - I guess he is the lead doorman - Wow - he treated my guests with a smile all the time, no matter how long his shift was!  Thanks Ben! Alfredo - awesome concierge - really took care of me and my out of town guests who probably bombarded him with questions and reservations of all sorts - Friendly and professional Chef Alfredo - Executive Chef - I had always wanted an Asian Fusion menu for my wedding because I knew that the traditional Chinese banquet would not suit all the palates of my friends. He welcomed all my suggestions to incorporate many of the Chinese traditions of a wedding menu.  We were able to include roast pork, peking duck, udon noodles, wasabi, ginger, enoki mushrooms, bok choy and fish into the menus and the food was incredible!  We requested medium rare filets for all who ordered it and they were all cooked PERFECTLY medium rare!  It's not easy to cook for 85 guests to perfection but all of my guest said that this was the BEST wedding meal they have EVER had in their life.  I think the Hors D'oeurves were really the star of the show, people couldn't stop eating them! Waitstaff during the reception - I don't remember the name of the head honcho there, but he was extremely attentive to our needs during dinner, making sure that we enjoyed our food and it was hot enough etc.  His wait staff was classy and elegant serving everything butler style in tuxedos and white gloves!  Loved it! Bridal Suite - We were booked into room 2616 which is the Michigan Suite - gorgeous city views with a HUGE dining table, wet bar, seating area for 10, a Murphy Bed - then adjacent to the room was the master bedroom and a giant bathroom with a standing shower and a bathtub fit for two.  Largely impressed with this and tastefully decorated (recently renovated).  It also had an alarm clock with iPod connections but the TV was outdated and no DVD player in the room.  Our king sized bed was super comfy and the murphy bed even, was AWESOME - my maid of honor slept there the night before and she has insomnia - even she was able to catch a couple hours of zzz's prior to the big day! I'm so thankful for the people at the Doubletree who made this a great day for us!  I recommend the staff and services of this hotel to anyone looking for a wedding venue in downtown Chicago.",N
3509,"I have to start off by saying this hotel made me want to extend my stay in Chicago.  The room rate was pretty comparable to other hotels in the area.  They also have special web rates if you book directly with them.  Parking is $51 a day with in and out privileges.  The bellmen were great and helpful.  The gentlemen at the front desk were extremely polite and helpful.  He even asked if we wanted an upgrade to a 2 bed room which my cousin and i turned down at first not knowing how small Chicago rooms were.  The 1 bed room was pretty and all but my cousin and i needed a little more space considering that we were going to go shopping.  We called front desk to see if it would be a hassle to change rooms and it wasn't a problem.  The  2 bed room was much roomier.  I would recommend the 1 bed for a couple.  The cocktails were excellent and the lounge/ restaurant.  Also , the location is in perfect walking distance from everything (landmarks, shops, eateries).",N
1719,"One of my friends in Chicago was diagnosed with kidney disease and I desperately wanted to see him.  So, we shopped around online and landed a good deal with Hotel Allegro.  Our flight to Chicago was scheduled to arrive at 7:30 am.  We called the hotel and asked if we could have early check-in and explained to her the reason of our visit. The manager on duty was terrific and extremely helpful. Since the hotel was not fully booked, it was no problem checking in at 8 am with no extra charge. Now, that's a service!  To top it all off, she did a research before we arrived and gave us a list of flower shops, in case we want to get some flowers for our friend in the hospital. Yes, the room was small.  But it was beautifully decorated, with touches of modern and glam decor. Marble bathroom and vanity.  It was clean.  The bed was comfortable.  Good location and fairly quiet at night. Our verdict?  We would definitely stay there again.",N
4406,"We stayed at The Palmer House for a wedding last month and overall we had a good experience here.  We booked the room on Expedia; this was a first for me.  Of course, you never know what you're going to get (at least that was the lesson learned).  We arrived at the hotel at about 3:30 pm just about check in time.  After being completely amazed by the grandiosity of the hotel lobby and the friendliness of the door men, we were met with the line from hell.  Seriously? Are there this many people checking in right now? Actually, their computers were down, so check ins were being done...I actually have no idea how they were doing them, but it took a while.  As we stand in line, hotel staff are walking around handing out glasses of sparkling wine.  Okay, I can live with this.....two glasses later, we are checking in.  When the man at the front desk sees my reservation, he mysteriously disappears to the back for what seemed to be 20 minutes.  Upon his return he says he upgraded our room to a queen bed.....from a twin??? WTF! Why would you have a twin bed in a hotel? At least that's what both my boyfriend and I heard, but we were too stunned to ask more questions.  We were also given a cute little gift bag that we later realized was not from the hotel, but from the wedding party   So our grand upgrade was a small room with not much of a view and a tiny, but beautiful bathroom.  Since we were not planning on spending much time in the hotel, this was perfect.  We needed a place to sleep and get dressed.  We were walking everywhere, so we didn't need the gym and we were not driving, so valet and parking wasn't a concern. The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance to Millennium and Grant Park, the Art Institute of Chicago, Navy Pier, Wendella Boat Tours, and a ton of shopping and food options.  The wedding events were less than two miles away, so it was a pleasant walk when we wanted to or a short and inexpensive cab ride when we didn't want to walk.   We had the brunch buffet at the hotel restaurant, Lockwood, one morning.  The food was good, but it was way overpriced.  Although, I'm a sucker for lox and bagel fixings every time, so I was happy.  Overall we had a great experience.  The convenience of everything close by, made our stay here worthwhile.",N
4184,"First of all- this hotel is HUGE! I found a cheap room- $79 on Hotwire, while checking in, they wanted to upgrade me to a city view room for $20- I declined and received one facing the Wrigley Building anyhow. The room itself was great even though there was a slight odor (coming from the fridge- Do Not Open??). The downside is that you have to pay for watching TV- 4.99 a show. You can review news headlines, but that's about all- a little cheesy if you ask me!!",N
3051,"As far as W's go this hotel is nice. Most W's are old hotels that they ""renovated"" with purple lights, techno music, and a giant W. The hotel feels like a real W. Try to get a room with a view of the lake. The room service is also very good and if you have status you'll get a nice box of white chocolate whoppers. WARNING - For business travelers there's a very long line to get a cab. It can take as long as 45 minutes so make sure to plan accordingly.",N
1578,"We held our wedding at Hotel 71 this past July, and we could not be more pleased. Now that the renovations are complete, the hotel is beautiful and suited our needs perfectly. We chose Hotel 71 based on the penthouse city views-- which are amazing. The majority of our guests also stayed in the hotel, and we received several compliments regarding their arrangements. Rebecca Lachman, the coordinator for the wedding is very professional, and helpful and did an excellent job ensuring that our wedding day was perfect and put together.",N
1397,"I will never stay here again. My girlfriends and I came downtown for a birthday celebration and got a room for a night. I got a pretty good deal on the room with a travel site, but given the price that it should have been...not worth the money. It was less than impressive, I've stayed in nicer hotels in Cleveland. But regardless, the main reason for my rating is that they have a ton of hidden fees, and on top of it all, they charged my credit card for items from the mini-bar that I did not take. When I called to ask if there may have been a mistake, I was simply told no and that I would be charged anyways. Moral of the story, I have a hard time giving this hotel anything but one star when they cant admit their mistakes, or they are just simply ripping people off on purpose. Either way, they will never get my business again.",N
5110,"nice posh seeming hotel in lobby, semi decent conference rooms with dirty,plain bathrooms for a luxury seeming conference center BEWARE! no safes in rooms, be sure to lock your luggage or utilize safe deposit boxes. had items stolen during turn down service, so if your liking turn down service ( which was just fruit snacks on the bed)look somewhere else. maid service -horrible. bed haphazardly made and clearly rummaged through our luggage.( somewhat our fault, lock broke on suitcase) pool very small. not handicapped friendly, which you will find in most of Chicago. offers wifi only in lobby, is actually 14.95/day in room , not advertised on web sitebeds were comfortable, food good but outrageously priced as are drinks for a coke. staff extremely friendly, but overall not worth the price of the rooms!! be wary of the go van service- the hotel offers as free transfer to o'hare which was really $28 when you get thereif you want to be nickled and dimed without being informed, this is the place to stay",Y
5703,"Beautiful art deco decor mixed with modern and a great location make this a great hotel to stay during your trip to Chicago. The hotel is right across from the Trump tower, with the Chicago River separating it, and steps away from Michigan Ave. We would go have breakfast next door at the Corner Bakery every morning and just look around at the wonder that is downtown Chicago. Also, each floor had a bottled water refilling station. The downsides were that the beds and pillows were not that comfortable and the TV was very small. There was no iron or ironing board in the room, but they were located in a closet down the hall. Otherwise, it was a great stay.",N
1027,"We stayed here two and a half years ago when we were apartment hunting before moving to the city.  I can't say enough good things about it.  Every night there is a happy hour buffet of delicious food appetizers - a lot of them Italian like fresh mozzarella and olives and bruschetta.  They also have a server making drinks, including their specialty, the Amalfitini, made with lemoncello.  When we stayed there we had asked at the front desk for a resonably priced restaurant recommendation.  The concierge recommended a delicious restaurant and since she knew someone who worked there, set us up with 25% off the meal and free desserts as well.",N
2466,"Extra charge for wifi! That's obnoxious and out dated. Enjoyed coming here when I was a kid, the brunch was great often peppered w football affiliates. Our clerk couldn't recommend parking when there lot was full. Disappointed this visit. 2 bathrooms per room is great and the history of the hotel is exciting. I can't get over what a setback charging for internet is! Come back when its gets renovated.",N
3757,"I travel for work all the time, so needless to say, I have stayed at a lot of hotels.  I tend to like the historic properties (Palmer House), but this one is the exception.  I really enjoyed this hotel, restaurant and meeting room facilities.  If my company makes some money next year, I will be back as often as possible. Every person we dealt with was friendly, helpful and professional.  What a delight for Chicago.  The sushi........oh.........yum!!!!!!!!!",N
2763,"This is a pretty cool hotel... the room was hip and ultra modern, albeit a little small.  Comfortable bed, and free wifi... of course if you have that I'm generally pretty pleased.  Two small complaints... the first time I tried to shower there the water was ice cold... they sen up someone and it was fixed soon enough.  And the massage I had there was a mix of relaxation and pain when the therapist managed to find the most uncomfortable parts of my back to focus attention on (also there is no shower for the spa, so you will walk back to your room covered in massage oil).  All in all it's a good place to stay if you can find a deal on a room, but I'm not sure I'd want to pay full price.",N
3463,"Location location location! This place is right on Michigan Ave., and it's a breeze to walk anywhere in the Near North side, out to Lake Michigan, down to the Chicago River/Millenium Park. Thumbs up right off the bat. After that, it starts to go downhill a little bit. I should have been forewarned when I walked down the 3' wide hallways, but man, the rooms are tiny (and I mean TINY). Upon walking into your room, you pretty much fall into your bed. Eep! They had large 40"" flat screen TVs in every room, which would be super awesome...if they had cable.  Sorry guys, but the local news in HD really doesn't do it for me. The hotel has a pretty small fitness center on the top floor, with a couple of ellipticals, treadmills, and free weights. There's no free wi-fi (ACK!). Wi-fi is $9/day for 0.5Mb/sec, and $19.99/day for 1.5Mb/sec. Yuck. Some pluses were the iPod alarm clock, free morning coffee and USA Today newspaper, super plushy pillows, and Bath & Body works shampoo/conditioner. A few simple upgrades (cable, wi-fi) could make this a 4 star. Until then, it's exiled to 3 star land.",N
2569,"What the heck!  This place--when it was newly opened--was such a delightful breath of fresh air.  Now they went cheapo on the alcohol for their martinis leaving a most unpleasant taste in ones mouth.  :(  You can't tease us with the grey goose and break us with Skyy! It's just cruel. So, one recommendation: specifically request your martinis with your liquor of choice lest your sense of taste be bombarded with clearly subpar alcohol. Eh, I still come back time after time.  It's just something about those Mies Van der Rohe Barcelona chairs--gets me everytime.",N
1854,"Hmm, I wonder if the management has changed, because most of the negative reviews are fairly recent.  I had my 30th b-day party here last year and the staff was wonderful to work with.  The party went off without a hitch and it was a really memorable experience.  I've also stayed here a number of times and it was great every time....granted, that was a few years ago, so maybe things have changed! They have the cutest plum pillows on all the beds.  They're not plum colored, they actually look like stuffed plums!  I fell in love with them and my husband decided to give me one for Valentine's day.  Only, they weren't for sale in the W store.  So, he got in touch with a concierge who bent over backwards to locate one.  After a month of phone calls to various places, he found my plum!",N

Good location, close to Union Station and mass transit. 2. Friendly staff and very good customer service. Always remember me. 3. Bed was very comfy, love a firm mattress. 4. Close to main highway could here traffic outside, but can still sleep. 5. Bathroom is postage stamp size. Had to close door to get in shower. 6. Restaurant off lobby is average. It's Italian, but they do breakfast too. 7. Free internet. Big plus for me. Can't be without my computer. 8. Green friendly. You can opt not to have sheets changed everyday and to use the same towel for a second day. 9. Nice fitness center. If your business is in The Loop and near Union Station, this is a good choice.

5025,"This is the last time I book any of my colleagues and clients at this hotel. We've booked with W Chicago-Lakeshore  in the past and there has always been something but this time around was the final straw. I booked a hotel stay for one of my colleagues and my colleague was suppose to check in on Sunday. I called a week prior to his check in date to prepaid for his stay (since every time I asked for a CC Auth form, I never received it). The account woman took everything over the phone and said my colleague was all set. Here comes Sunday, the day my colleague is set to check in. They will not let him check in because they require him to put his card down for room & tax. My question is...what's the point of prepaying for a room when the guest is going to have to put down his/her card for ROOM & TAX plus incidentals. My colleague called me explaining the situation that Sunday night. Then I called the hotel and spoke to the night manger, who name begins with a G. She herself told me that she can see that an authorization has been made to his account but the account woman clearly didn't input the hard swipe. Another question I have to ask, why is that our problem? That was negligence on your employee's part not ours. Then, for her to say we have to put down for incidentals and a night stay in order to stay at the hotel(which would have been $650+, after I repeatedly told her I would send the details over to her first thing in the morning and my guest can not pay for this. I don't think Ms. G understands that everyone doesn't have $650+ to give at the drop of a hat. Which is why the company was paying for his travel.To cut a long story short, my colleague was waiting outside of the hotel for about to 2hrs, at night after flying in from NY to be told he couldn't stay at their hotel because a W Chicago Lakeshore employee was negligent in processing a CC Auth form. Which lead for me to intensely search for a hotel for my colleague to stay in for that night and the next 3 days.  I am just beyond frustrated with this hotel. They treated us like we're new to doing business with them and we don't  book a lot of our colleagues and clients at their hotel. Never again.",Y

Total loss ~$100 and I was just there attending a conference.",N

I had an unimpressive view of a office building and got a wake up call that I didn't ask for or need. They could also use a concierge upgrade.

5305,"I am a Kimpton Hotel in touch member and became one specifically because of the incredible service and LOVE I feel when I travel on business to Chicago.  What an incredible property full of architectural beauty and old world charm.  But, more important, is concierge level of service you recieve from all of the Burnham staff.  From the desk to the doormen to the restaurant everyone makes you feel totally special and at home.  And here is the bonus. This is a pet friendly property.  Since I cannot travel with my dog when on business I so enjoy seeing other guests pets whenI stay here.  AND, there is a wine reception everyday where many guest come to enjoy a nice glass of complimentary wine and bring their dogs for all to enjoy.

352,"I understood when booking the hotel that it was a two star hotel. I did not expect the Hilton. However, my stay was completely awful. I chose the travelodge because I had stayed there before because of it's location. It is super close the the red line and downtown. However, I would rather walk until my feet fall completely off then ever stay there again. The hotel rooms were disgusting and out-dated -- not to mention the staff was so damn rude. I felt like I was in trouble when I talked to them. I will save up and travel further...I hate the travelodge.",N
1941,"Stayed here between Christmas and New Year's.  Starwood Gold membership gave me a free upgrade, and the much larger room on an upper floor was great - absolutely no complaints. Unfortunately, I had a REALLY ANNOYING experience with the keycards they give you for access to your room.  At first, it worked only after about 10-15 attempts.  Finally, shortly before checking out, it stopped altogether, and of course, I was experiencing nature's call at the time.  Called down to the front desk and waited nearly 20 MINUTES for someone to come up let me into my room.  They're REALLY LUCKY I had not wet my pants. But the Bliss Spa welcome kit was really great (enormous bar of soap that is still enormous after using every day for a month) and the staff very friendly and helpful.  Also, they allowed me early (11 am) check-in and late (4:00 pm) checkout, which was really cool and not always possible at other hotels.  Would definitely stay here again.",N
4058,"I somewhat feel that 2 stars is harsh for my experience here, but ""meh. I've experienced better"" most definitely sums up my feelings. However, since that'd be quite a short review, allow me to elaborate: i found this hotel on Hotwire for the low low price of $70 a night. I have a feeling it would have been a lot more had I not booked it before there was a playoffs game scheduled the same weekend. It was worth this price, I guess, but I still wasn't pumped about my stay. First off, the hotel is really not all that convenient for public transport. We had to hoof it to Clark and Lake to catch most all of the trains. In the Spring/Summer/Fall that would be OK, but in Winter it just meant we took a lot of cabs. Suddenly the $70 room got a lot more expensive. Second, our room was TINY! The walls were paper thin, so we could hear every frickin conversation in the room next door. And they were boring conversations. The bathroom is right off the bed, and is only separated by a sliding glass door. Sometimes when two people are sharing a room they don't want the other person to hear your bathroom noises. This was impossible in our room. I tried to turn on the sink to disguise them, but the water pressure is so low that wasn't much of a help. Still, the room was clean and had a fantastic view. I have no MAJOR complaints about this hotel, but still, it's probably been my least enjoyable hotel stay in Chicago.",N

4690,"A hidden gem boutique hotel! Modern feel and luxury amenities, great location just off Michigan Ave. Excellent service and friendly staff.  I loved my daily Happy Grams they give you. The rooms are small, but very chic with a NYC feel. Price was right as well! $99/night for a Fri and Sat night in downtown Chicago at an upscale hotel - Unbelievable! I would give it 5 stars if the walls weren't so paper thin.......go there to party, not to sleep!",N
3631,"Sooner or later we all grow up  - so you might as well do it over tea and biscuits.  The Drake Hotel, aside from being an awesome hotel, offers a great High Tea.  Never tried it before?  It's simple, you dress up and drink tea with the who's who of Chicago.     Insiders notes: try the Earl Grey - its great!",N
171,"I love this hotel! It is really close to Michigan Avenue, but on a quiet street. The location is excellent, and the staff are welcoming and friendly. The room prices are very reasonable, and the rooms are clean and comfortable. We booked a block of rooms for our wedding, and were so happy with how everything turned out. Our guests loved the location, the rooms, and were very satisfied with the room prices. While it is not new or very modern, the rooms are very nice and I would recommend this hotel.",N
2281,"This review is specifically for the fifth floor banquet hall.. If you know you will be attending a meeting or symposium here, I highly suggest you swing by Starbucks beforehand to get your favorite drink in a Venti cup and a big yummy pastry to get you through the morning, because I'm sorry, Marriott - dry apple strudels and a choice between house blend or decaf is not my idea of a quality breakfast. When you're competing with places like the Union League Club, which serves three-course meals to its conference attendees, that's just embarrassing. Also, bring a sweater - the banquet hall is cold!",N

1096,"Love this hotel. We had a great view from our hotel room. We can see Lake Michigan. Staff was awesome and very accommodating. It's downtown and walking distance to everything. Nice soft bed. It was a suite but given the really nice comfy, classy way of decorating the place I say I'll come back to this place again. Pretty pricey but then again-who cares?",N
2131,"We stayed at the historic tower and I can definitely see why it is called historic. The pipes in that building are so old, every time I shower it sounded like something one of the pipes would burst any second. Also the air conditioner sucked, we had it on the lowest settings but the room would never get cold. Only pros about this place is the location.",N
258,"It a relativity a well kept hotel and the staff are very accommodating.  It is however just another Holiday Inn...nothing out of the extra ordinary to mention.  However, there is a lot of family staying so it is loud and usually have a lot of kids running around. The restaurant needs a little work, it just a pizza place that attached.",N
1481,"I didn't actually stay here but I dog sat for the last few days for an adorable little pup while her mom and sister took in the sights of our beautiful city. This was a great hotel complete with extra friendly staff, super clean rooms and when a hotel is dog friendly how can they not be good? The lobby smells terrific too, it could be the yummy candles burning when you first walk in that automatically put you in a soothing state. My clients told me that they would be back because they had such a great time so I gave the The Omni a star from them too.",N
1087,"The Fairmont is STILL fabulous.  My Marathon Man and I stayed this weekend, and the location was just perfect.  Less than a mile to the starting line.  The hotel was rather gracious about extending the checkout time by an hour and a half, so that runners could get their post-race shower. The bathroom is great...beds and pillows were just about perfect for me (husband's ribs were a little sore - I guess his sleep number score is a little higher than mine).  The office chair was inspired by the Eames aluminum group - handsome.  I especially like it that the rooms are spaced in groups of four, so hallway traffic is minimal. Even if you aren't in town for a race, it's a couple blocks from Millennium Park and scads of terrific sight-seeing.",N
1952,"DON'T HAVE YOUR WEDDING HERE!!!!!  I had mine at the W City Center and although it is a beautiful place, I can't imagine how they could have screwed up more.  This is even considering I had my own private wedding planner.  I don't want to know what would have happened if they did the event on their own.  I'll make this short  and only include a couple screw ups.... 1. They screwed up my PARENTS' room....yes my parents'...the ones actually paying for this 300 person event!  They were supposed to have a suite with a King Sized bed and they had a room with a double.  They kept giving them the wrong keys to the room for about and hour and with all of this hassle made them late to rehearsal dinner. 2.  They threw out the top of our cake!!!!!  Who does that!?  That's a common tradition to save that for your first anniversary.  They apologized and said they would make us a new one for our anniversary.  So, a year later I got in touch with the catering department to coordinate our new cake.  She said ""no problem"" etc.....then the woman didn't return my phone calls/emails the week before my anniversary and we AGAIN didn't have a cake! This was absolutely NOT what I anticipated from one of the nicest and most expensive hotels in the city that could have held my wedding!",N
4238,"This hotel is a complete waste of money - consistent with my experience at most big chains these days.  No personality. Guest are treated like cattle and nickel-and-dimed. Unbelievable. You'd think in this economy they'd actually try to win/keep customers. The Hyatt charges $250+ a night then has the nerve to charge another $15+ for Internet use (PER PERSON in the same room!), and the rooms aren't even that nice - there was actually construction going on in some places. What is shocking is how people put up with this crap  - they must not know better.  When I was unable to find a place to sit down and eat lunch at the main bar/restaurant during lunch (the place was packed for a trade show/conference) I noticed a bunch of tables that were blocked off. I asked if our party could sit at one of these tables. The answer was no, they are not open until later. Are you kidding me? And forget about using your cell phone in the main conference rooms - they won't work. Amazing.  I checked out after one night, went around the block and found a nicer hotel at a third of the price that offered free wireless (even free access to desktop computers in the lobby so you can print your tickets prior to departing), unlimited bottled water and had superior service - like they actually cared about their customers. Well, they won me over and thankfully they have locations in most major cities. Never again Hyatt. Bye.",N
4930,"Don't have your wedding here.  Some of my gifts got stolen and some of my guests purses got stolen from under the table.  When I told the Drake that night, I was told oh well- it's a public hotel.  They were super difficult to work with and I was constantly triple checking everything.",Y
4635,"Hotel Felix is just enough off of Michigan Ave. and the beaten path to lend itself to a quiet room at night, but certainly close enough to plenty of shopping and dining choices. Coffee makers and a mini bar are not in the room but no worries as coffee is provided in the lobby until 10am and a fantastic bar is open late.  If the bar is closed, head over to Elate - the restaurant on the lobby level. The rooms are small but have plenty of storage space.  In fact, my husband missed the fact that the bed had additional drawers until I pointed it out when I joined him in Chicago 2 days after his arrival.  The bathroom is small too, much like that of a cruise ship, but outfitted with modern touches including a nice shower head and mod like sink. A large flat screen TV and desk round out the notable features. Hotel Felix has a card entry fitness center that consists of 2 ellipticals and perhaps 2-3 treadmills and some free weights.  There is also a card entry business center with 3 computers and a printer for use anytime. The decor of the lobby is chic and the Hotel Felix prides itself on green initiatives.   If you are looking for a boutique hotel in a prime location, look no further.",N
3637,"Ugh.  I hate giving this place even one star.  I was thoroughly disappointed.  Not what i expected AT ALL.  Who expects to have a list with 12 - that's right TWELVE - complaints (in one room) after my 4 day stay here. For freakin' $425.00 a night, someone should have rubbed my feet before I went to bed! or at least I shouldn't have awoke in the middle of the night itching like crazy TWICE!!!  This place is OLD and though ""The Drake"" sounds all hoity toity, it is NOT all that it is cracked up to be.  The staff was 50/50.   Don't stay in room 415.  It stinks and I think it has bed bugs.  I'm not joking.",N
5309,"Through a connection, we were able to get all of our wedding guests (over 40 rooms were reserved for our family and friends) to stay at the Silversmith Hotel.  IPrior to the stay, due to a lot of personnel changes, I was very skeptical about how our time at the hotel would be.  But I shouldn't have been so concerned.The hotel staff were very courteous and did everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and seamless.  They even assisted with the limo and charter bus pickups.  By the end of the weekend, all of  the staff knew my face and name.  It was fantastic.",Y
2981,"I stayed here and thankfully I pricelined this place for a fraction of the price. This is a huge convention hotel and if you like crowds or thongs of families and kids, or teenagers attending an event then this is your hotel.  It looks like they put ALL their money into the lobby and elevator banks on the main level. Look carefully at the doors on your floor, they are 2 shades of brown! Oh and the bathrooms have clearly seen better days. I would be upset if I spent $200 a night to stay here. The room (at least mine) had a very dark, masculine feel. They charge you $12.95 a day for the internet here and you cannot get a wireless signal so don't even think about it. New LG LCDs are in the room and a decent cable assortment made this stay tolerable. They did put out hot cider and fresh cookies twice while I stayed here which was a nice touch since it was about 10 degrees outside, but thats winter in Chicago. Everyone says this location is off the beaten path...it really isn't unless you are a typical lazy american but I could see how walking back at night could be troubling to some as its a bit empty. All in all, an OK experience. Oh the Sheraton Sweet Sleeper bed was comfy, room clean so no complaints on that.",N
4379,"Despite the fact that the lobby is quite nice, my room is huge, and I got a reasonably priced air/hotel package, I just can't give this hotel more than 2 stars. I'm writing this review from my hotel room, and am paying $14.95 a day for the internet connection. I guess that's not so unusual, and at least there are three differently priced connection options based on speed (I went for the cheapest). But I just feel nickel-and-dimed! It really started with the $25 extra fee for early check-in (about noon). I've never heard of that before. Kind of ticked me off right when I got here. I was pleasantly surprised to find a huge room. But was very surprised to find a teeny tiny bathroom, especially given the size of the room. The bathroom is so small, that even though I am the only person in my huge hotel room, I can barely get into the bathroom and have to squeeze around the door, then shut the door to have room to stand at the sink, or anything else. But first I have to get the light to turn on, so it is not pitch black when I close the bathroom door. This is a major production since it is kind of stuck in the ""off"" position. To add insult to injury, although there is a magnifying mirror attached to the wall (the kind you can use to put on makeup extra-carefully), it's attached at a height designed for someone about 6 feet tall! Since I'm 4'11"", I can't actually see myself in the mirror. It just taunts me by being there. On to the actual room. Clean. Comfortable. Wait, why am I only giving this hotel 2 stars? Well, there is no coffee maker! I can't remember the last time I stayed in a hotel where there wasn't a small coffee set in the room. I guess they want me to buy the starbucks in the lobby instead. But I was kind of counting on the coffee set to heat hot water, so I could make my Trader Joe's instant oatmeal packet in the morning for breakfast. Hmmm. I guess they'd rather I bought the hotel oatmeal for $5 a bowl. And I also guess I could ask for a coffee set to be brought to my room. Would only cost $8. *sigh* Well, at least I brought workout clothes for the 4 days I'm staying here. At $18 per day (or $45 per 3 days), it's a bit pricey just to be able to work out for a few days, but at least I'll be able to use the spa amenities too, right?. Well, luckily I checked out the fitness center before paying, because I just don't like it. Most folks would probably like it fine, but the elliptical machines (only thing I use) here are *again* made for someone 6 feet tall, not someone my size. And the spa amenities aren't all that appealing. And since there are no 24 hr fitness locations nearby (I'm a member), I guess I brought my workout clothes for no good reason other than to use up the space in my luggage. Okay, this review is getting kind of long, and a bit too whiney. So for my last issue with this hotel - I tried calling the ""guest service hotline"" several different times since I've been here to ask some questions, but I don't think they actually staff the ""hotline"". On four different attempts, I only once reached an actual person, and I let it ring about 20 times each attempt before giving up. Last night all I wanted to know was where I could get some ice. When they finally directed me to the room with an icemaker (near the elevator), it was a room with peeling paint, cracks on the wall, and a flickering lightbulb. Yech. Tonight I wanted to ask some questions about getting back to the airport. I guess I'll just have to figure it out myself.",N
1270,"This Best Western is the closest hotel to McCormick Place other than the Hyatt McCormick, but it is not exactly walking distance to McCormick Place. This decent hotel at the southern edge of downtown is well situated if you are going to the museums or to Soldier Field, but you are away from the shopping action of the Magnificent Mile.",N
1483,"The Omni is a very pleasant hotel that is sort of on Michigan Avenue. Its main entrance is actually around the corner on Huron, but its feature restaurant 676 (formerly Cielo) faces onto busy Michigan Avenue. The rooms are like mini-suites so they are sizeable and comfortably furnished.",N
2414,"I was here for NYE 2006/7 and did the whole ""stay at the hotel/go to the party in the hotel"" thing. An awesome idea, if I do say so. Not having to worry about how you were getting home was awesome. Knowing the bed you were going to sleep in was probably made by fucking angels was ALSO awesome. And the fact that the double rooms have two bathrooms was super convenient and a really nice touch. We had one minor issue with the hotel, and it revolved around them charging us for things we didn't take from the mini-bar, but that was resolved with a quick trip to the customer service desk. I'd stay here again, but only if I suddenly became very wealthy and can afford to do so. The price is really the only thing keeping this place from a 5-star review.",N
754,"If the customer service here is as great as typical Westin Starwood properties, I would have kicked in one more star.  However, the mediocre service is a let down for this hotel that has a lot more potential. Pros: -It is at a GREAT location, next to Macy's Water Tower, in the heart of Michigan Ave -Sometimes they have promos in the lobby like free massages or free beverages -The lobby is very well decorated and has a very nice classy feel to it -Rooms are nice and clean, though on the smaller end -The gym has new machines and is well ventilated with dim mood lighting Cons: -netural, uninterested staff who look like they are forced to be there and is waiting for their shift to be over",N
2491,"I like the Hilton...I haven't stayed there but I walk past it every time I go to school and I've eaten in both Kitty O'Shea's and in their big dining room.  I also went for a school orientation and they served a nice meal in their conference hall.  Every time I walk in there it makes me feel like I'm on vacation in some important place.  Plus...the doormen always smile at me (in a good way, not creepy) when I go past.  I'd really encourage everyone to try Kitty O'Shea's if you have the chance.  Their Irish food is authentic (as far as I know) and really really good.  Also, in the summer they have students from Ireland working there so you can experience their sexy accents.",N
27,cheap hotel for the location.. i paid under a 100 bucks a night (not including tax)... as for the hotel itself.. it's a bit dated.. however the bed is really comfortable.. towels are relatively soft too there's only 1 elevator available for customers.. however they will open up the service elevator if it's busy.. the wifi is free and pretty quick too..,N
2782,"Near Perfection. I have stayed at the James twice.  When i first walked into the lobby i knew i would be taken care of.  Every detail, from the location of the front desk, the lighting changes as one moves through the lobby, and the subdued modern decor show so clearly that someone thought very hard about how to make ME and my friends comfortable. Everyone is polite, but none suck up.  We are all equals, from the people who clean to the front desk and the managers, all of us part of an experience, that has been an integral goal of human society for ten thousand years--how to welcome a guest. Well, this hotel has it figured out, at least for me.  Everything is clean.  the decor is subtle, almost minimalist, but complete.  There is no hard sell of candy, no 7 dollar charge for a sip from a bottle of water left on the bedside table.  Internet is free, easy to log on and available throughout the hotel.  Lighting in the room is perfect for a computer, not a  newspaper.  The hotel is a remarkable achievement. If you can stay here do!",N
4023,"I was in one of the updated rooms and they were very nice.  The room was clean, modern, and inviting.   It is a convenient location to Michigan Avenue, but it's almost as if once you cross to that side there's nothing there except the hotel, which seemed to attract some shady people standing around the corner asking for money to patrons heading back to the hotel.  This was annoying. While the room was clean and modern, there is an issue with the really thin walls.  I could hear everything in the room adjacent to mine.  A man and woman were having a conversation and if I really wanted, I'm sure I could listen in and understand the words that they were saying.  But I was headed out and had no real interest.  Luckily at night it was quiet, but if you had some rowdy neighbors could totally see how this would affect the rating of this place.   I'm not sure that I'd voluntarily stay here again, but I wouldn't nix the idea either.  There are better hotels in the area, but my experience here was fairly positive for one night.",N

168,"Chicago has many lovely smaller old-fashioned hotels of the boutique variety. The Whitehall may just be the classiest of the bunch. It can barely be categorized as a smaller hotel, but with slightly over 200 rooms it definitely is no behemoth convention hotel. The building is a charmer, and it has a great location just off from Michigan Avenue. The rooms are plush and so are the bathrobes.",N
2859,"How in the hell does this place only have three stars!?  (Btw, people... ANY place in downtown Chicago charges and arm and a leg for parking... duh.  Overnight anywhere is no less than $40 ANYWHERE, it sucks, but it is what it is in Chicago... use the public transportation, duh... and if have business outside of downtown, stay there, it's cheaper.) I came into town with my daughter to see my parents who live outside of downtown so we thought we'd get a room downtown make it easy, see some museums and all that good stuff.  We found a ridiculously good price, below $200.  I've stayed at numerous 'high end' hotels and this is right up there, easily worth about $389 for the two bed room we had.   My overall ""five stars"" comes from the value per dollar.  The last time we were downtown we stayed at the Fairmont, which was an absolute joke for the price (small, useless lobby), nowhere to eat, ugly rooms without any function, it was sooooo overrated. However, not the case with the Sheraton.  AMAZING place, top to bottom.  The lobby is the best/biggest lobby I've ever seen in my life.  It has different sitting areas, some with ""coffee tables"" that are actually touch-screen games (chess, checkers, etc).  There is a nice sports bar right there... all with an amazing beautiful view of the river through the enormous windows (whereas the Fairmont is closed and dark).  This lobby is super open and inviting.  Note, though... the two ""you are here"" maps are wrong, their stickers are flipflopped, so finding the elevators was a bit of a task at first. Our room was great.  Super clean, good-sized, amazing view.  Flatscreen tv (which has become standard at this pricepoint these days), great sitting area by the window.  The beds were too comfortable... no joke, I couldn't wake up.   The location is perfect for walking around.  First of all, it's right on the river, you can't beat that.  And, it's a couple blocks from Navy Pier for the tourists in town staying here, but the pier has a great children's museum.  It's right off Michigan Avenue, the Wrigley building is right there (which is basically the heart of downtown).  This location doesn't get any better for seeing downtown. Eating.  There are a ton of restaurants on the grounds here, all seem to be great standalone places that happen to be in a hotel.  Yes, they are all a bit higher in price than tourist trap places, but the quality is great.  We had breakfast at the place downstairs... for $25, it was all you can eat buffet.  They serve regular breakfast but I'll agree with my parents (who are extremely cheap, btw) that it definitely was expensive, like $12 but a basic breakfast; couple eggs, toast).  But for $25 you get it all -- and it's all made fresh.  (Damn, I need to review that place now, if I can remember its name) Anyway... other than Vegas hotels, I couldn't remember a hotel having more to offer than this one.  I highly recommend it, especially if you can score a sub $200 deal like we did.",N
5612,I booked my room from Priceline and I was surprised on how big the room was. It even had a living room. I only paid $80/night in 2002. It was a great hotel and the staff were really nice. Kudos to Westin!,N
4671,"3 1/2 is more fitting. A fine hotel in a good neighborhood. Safe to walk back to if you've had a long night and close enough to the L. Lots of good restaurants in walking distance. Everyone is bitching about the room size but honestly, compared to a lot of other more expensive Chicago hotels, i.e. the Palmer House, the Intercontinental, etc. the rooms were really not that small. The rooms were also modernly decorated,  and the bed is very comfy. You can control the thermostat (in some eco hotels this is an issue). The bathroom is big and the shower(water pressure, SPA toiletries, set up) is good too. One of the things I hate about some upscale/boutique hotels is there is always an absence of drink/ice machines. Maybe they feel the machines are too Motel 6y, but when all you're offering is a $6 hot bottle of water I appreciate a $3 Gatorade from a machine. AND, this is just an assumption, but I think there is a drink/ice machine on every floor. NEGATIVES - A shit view. Just a dumpy looking roof and bricks. Elate's breakfast menu on their website is completely different then what they actually have. It is the same old omelet, $8 side of bacon that most hotels have, thats why you should just hike two blocks to either Eggsperience if its late or Yolk any other time before 3pm. But the staff was great and okayed a late check out and its close to Michigan Ave. if you're into that sort of thing. And if you're not, cabs are easily acquired.",N
2165,"I booked a room in this hotel for my friend and myself for the night before her wedding. My idea was to get a great night's sleep and be able to get ready for her wedding day in a beautiful setting. The Intercontinental lived up to all of my hopes. The Intercontinental takes classic hotel charm to a whole new level. The lobby is magnificent and the entire experience makes it worth every dollar spent to stay there. The rooms are beautifully decorated, and the bathrooms are huge! A definite benefit when getting ready for a wedding. 2 things I really loved about this hotel: When our mini-bar fridge started wheezing and whining at 12AM, they sent a repairman up immediately to fix it. Instead of fixing it in the room and keeping us up for the 45 minutes it would take, he actually brought a whole new fridge and switched the broken one out in less than 10 minutes. Sleep lost: none! Second, there's a Starbucks in the lobby. As any Starbucks addict will tell you, being able to get your morning coffee in your pajamas is a wonderful, wonderful thing. Location is great if you're an out-of-towner, rooms are comfortable, service is excellent, and the decor is beautiful. If you can afford it and are looking for more of a classic hotel vs. a modern boutique hotel, definitely stay here on your next trip to the city.",N
1417,"The man and I decided to do a last minute hotwire valentine's night in the city and this hotel is one we got. I have to say the price, $95 is incredibly low for a downtown hotel. I loved the close proximity to the Mag mile shopping and restaurants. The hotel itself is very quaint but they have remodeled it in a streamlined way. The room was small but big enough for two. The bed extremely comfortable and the big screen TV a hit. I was disappointed that there wasn't a bath tub (it being valentines day and all) but the rain head shower was nice. Staff were friendly, the girl at check in with the dripping nose should probably get a hanky though! LOL I'd go back and might if it ends up being my hotwire selection next time!",N
5114,"We have stayed at various Marriotts across the country, which is part of the reason we selected this hotel. The location was good, and with the supposed floor to ceiling windows that opened for a fabulous city view, we thought it would be a great spot.1. The windows are not floor to ceiling as advertised, and they only open about 3 inches. We really had no city view at all, since the inside of the windows were iced over for almost our entire stay. I live in the Midwest where it gets quite cold, but my windows never ice on the inside...2. As a result of this ice issue, the room was FREEZING. I am a person who sleeps in shorts and a tank top in the middle of Nebraska winters with the fan on. In this room, I was in pants, long sleeves, buried under the covers, and still freezing cold. All this while the heater was set on 77 degrees. 3. You'll realize how ridiculous 77 degrees is when you realize the room is tiny. I've stayed in Super 8s with bigger rooms. I must say, they take flattering photos for their advertisements! The room really was way too small. The restroom was tiny. Thank goodness I am a small person, because I don't know how anyone too much bigger could even get in the room enough to shut the door. 4. Our ""city view"" was none other than a view of a busy road and some crappy roofs. We could not see the skyline from our room. So how they can sell this view for an extra price is beyond me. 5. Not all of our TV channels worked. This created a problem since it was bowl week, and the channels that didn't work were channels showing games. The staff could not have cared less, and never offered any help other than suggesting we ""go to the bar"" to watch the games. Coincidence? 6. 24 hours of internet service is 15 bucks. We were charged for 2 days even though we only used one. To make matters more irritating, the Marriott homepage somehow became all 12 of my ""favorites"" on my Mac. Even when I got home and cleared my history, it continued to pop up. I don't know if they installed some kind of cookies or what, but they messed up my computer. It was a mess getting it set back the way it was.7. Leaving was a mess. We called the front desk and ask if they had a booking/reservation process for guests that needed to retrieve their vehicles from valet. They said no, and that it would only take 10 minutes. Yeah, right. We waited almost 45 minutes to get our car back.  So, unless you're leaving at 7 am, plan for it to take forever to get your vehicle upon checking out. I would not stay at the location again. Its location may be ""convenient"" but it's little else. I could have stayed at a different hotel, taken cabs everywhere, and still spent less than $700 for 3 nights.",Y
4429,"When I won this hotel on Priceline with a $70 bid, I was pretty pleased with myself.  The pictures of the lobby looked spectacular!  I wasn't disappointed when I entered the hotel last night - it was super swank-or-rama.  It lies in stark contrast to the rooms, however, which are outdated and unattractive.  My room also smelled of smoke, though it was a non-smoking.  I asked where the gym was, and the concierge said it was on the 5th floor, but that it was closed, and if I wanted to use it it'd be $18 anyway.  Really?  $18 to use the gym?  Sigh.   I decided to go for a run outside (it was only two blocks to Millenium Park) and was chilled when I came back (it was 10 PM in mid-October).  Fortunately, the shower was great - nice and hot with great pressure, in a clean (albeit tiny) bathroom.  Things were OK for a while - I watched crappy movies on Showtime (Bound with Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon) since there was no HBO, and eventually crawled into my huge, soft, king-sized bed, sleeping peacefully until I was woken up at six by the phone ringing over and over - in my neighbor's room.  It was a sad morning after that. To summarize: The Pros: Location, nice beds, good showers, pretty lobby The Cons: Ugly, outdated rooms, small bathrooms, paying $$$ for the gym/internet/parking, terrible sound proofing between rooms.   Except for the lobby, this is far from the four star hotel it purports to be.",N
1388,"For the price ($99/night) it was great, especially for the location. Its just off Michigan Ave. where all the awesome shopping.The staff is friendly and courteous. However, this hotel is really run down. The decor is nice but obviously worn. The bathroom is like a motel 6. The shower drain was clogged so that when you showered, it would pool at your feet. eeewwww. The beds are unpleasantly lumpy and uncomfortable. But, you can't beat the price for the location. Worth repeating because it's pretty much the only thing going for it.",N
1763,"A boutique hotel located in the theatre district of Chicago with the usual feelings of one. The hotel is somewhat spotty when it comes to chic and then downright cutting corners, you will notice them. The TV is out of date along with the mini bar and look - feel of the room. It's a quite small room and tiny. That's all i really have to say about this one, try The St. James if you want the boutique experience, or even the Burnham Hotel",N
234,"It's okay.  I booked Hotel Indigo on Hotwire for just over $80/night after taxes and fees (it's a 3 1/2 star hotel in the ""Gold Coast"" area, if you're looking to Hotwire it..), and it was a decent place to stay. Like everyone else, I can't help but be confused by the beach-ish theme. Coming here in the dead of winter, it seems.. incongruous at best and somewhat taunting at worst. Smallish rooms, but clean and well-appointed. Free WiFi. The location is good, definitely in a cooler, hipper, more residential area than Mag Mile or Loop hotels I've stayed in before, but the hotel itself if nothing spectacular. Free caramel Andes candies in the lobby. I doubt I'd pay full price for it, but - like nearly every hotel I Yelp - it was a good Hotwire find.",N
1593,"Formerly the Executive Plaza, the Hotel 71 (named after its numeric address on Wacker Drive) has a nice location along the bend of the Chicago River. This makes the rooms on this side much more desirable than the ones on the opposite side, which looks over an alley and assorted buildings. The standard rooms are very sizeable and comfortable here. I hear there is a plan to convert this property soon to a combination condo-hotel tower.",N

4220,"My accomodation arrangements become nonexistent while i was waiting for my luggage at the airport. (a friend completely flaked on me).  I called home and  my husband booked a room through Travelocity at the Hyatt.  I showed up, probably looking a little stressed, dishelved, beaten and the front desk guy was really pleasant and upgraded my room to the Club level - you need your room card to get to these floors.  I felt special, instantly.  And things just got better.  The service at the restaurant was great.  There was loud noises coming from the next door room, - marching music and a phone ringing, seemed liked they were timed to go off every 5 minutes, so i called the front desk and someone took care of it by the time i went to sleep.  Everywhere i went, to ask questions, to buy a snack, room service, everyone was superb!  And my room was super comfortable as well.  Thanks for ending my horrific day on such a positive note. It is interesting that my room was on the 33rd floor as well!",N
1948,"W = Will not be staying here again. The room was TINY - the bed was super hard (Fred Flinstone's bed people), there was track lighting on the floor - which was difficult to turn off.  And the best part?  Our heat was broken - and our room was 90 degrees by the time we woke up in the morning.  I couldn't wait to leave. We got our room comped because of an event my boyfriend was attending - so thank god, we didn't pay for this.     This is my first experience with the W chain and I must say that I am not eager to try this chain out again.  Too bad that the City Center spoiled this supposedly fabulous hotel line for us.   There are plenty of hotels in Chicago - and you can do a lot better somewhere else.",N
2401,"Though I've never stayed in this hotel, I've been here for a dinner event and really enjoyed myself. The food was good, the service was good, and the venue is quite elegant. Definitely take cues from other jilted guests -- carry your junk with you or lock it down. Though it may look it from the inside, you're not in Oz and your crap will get jacked if you leave it out in the open. Take a tad bit of personal responsibility and you won't find yourself trying to get the hotel to reimburse for your lapse in common sense. Seriously, I read that review and wonder if it's the same woman whose kid hit my car with a shopping cart and then gave *me* the stink eye when I asked her what gives. Also, the acoustics were good.",N
245,"I want to check back in, and crawl right back into their bed sent from cozy heaven. Best night of sleep I've ever gotten in a hotel. The comforter is just heavy enough, the sheets smooth enough, and the pillows soft enough to sleep for 12 hours straight. (I wake up from anything) Our room was also in a weird corner nook, which may have had something to do with it being wonderfully quiet. Try to book in a _11 room. Unlike the Nashville Indigo, I think the hotel got the design better here. It feels much more peaceful, and the room layouts make more sense. As for the ammenties, the hotel has a gym and spa services. Indigo isn't stingy about towels either, which is a star in itself. I also liked that there were video games, and the tv remote was a Nintendo controller. The staff was nice, but the garage (owned by the city) is run by a real asshat, and it was 30 something a day for the PRIVILEGE, plus they demand you valet. BAH!",N
712,"I just got back from a week long convention at the McCormick Center in Chicago.  I was very satisfied with this choice for a hotel.  I typically stay at Marriott properties when I travel.  This was one of the better Courtyards I have ever stayed at.  The rooms were clean and standard ""Courtyard"" setup with the exception of the beds and linens that seemed brand new.  The bed was really comfortable, rivaling Westin's famed heavenly beds.  The staff was bright and attentive no matter if I was wearing a suit in the AM or crawling back from Rush Street in my jeans and a ball cap at 1:30 in the morning.  Location wise this hotel was perfect.  Shopping and nightlife is right outside the door.  Most other attractions are walking distance or a short cab ride away.  The fitness center is small but clean and functional.  Actually it did have about six (6) treadmills plus free weights et al.  The hotel restaurant, Viand, has a nice bar and half priced wine special on Tuesday nights that is such a value in Chicago it drags in some friendly locals.  I would definitely go back.",N
1676,"What can I say... I LOVE this place!! I booked a vacation through Orbitz and this was the hotel that came with the package I chose.  The location is perfect (close to everything you need... restaurants, shopping, theaters) and soooo cute!! Beautiful lobby with free ""wine hour"" every night from 5-6pm (you can't beat that!!) Our room was a little on the small side, but for two people (and the price) it was a DEAL!! The staff was so friendly and helpful too!! The concierge became my best friend that weekend!!  I loved this city (and this hotel) so much I will definately be back SOON!!!",N
3341,"Mark P.  hit it on the head, you should be able to give different stars to different parts of this place. Quick backround: went there for a bachelor party with 4 other guys, reserved the extreme suite at $800.00/night. When we got there we were all dressed nice as we were about to go out and reak havoc on the town. The guy checking us in asked if there was a special occasion and we told him our friend was getting married. He doesn't even let us finish before he starts lecturing us about how they have a strict no party policy and they wont hesitate to call the police if we get too loud or out of line (mind you we are all 27-30 years old, dressed nice and just booked an $800 a night suite at the Fucking Hard Rock Hotel.) So we went up to the room and it was very nice size, but the couch had all sort of love stains on it and half the stuff they said came with the suite (fridge, guitar with amp) wasn't there. We still had fun and checked out the next day, letting the same dude that checked us in know that we didnt party as he gave us this shitty kind of grin. They have a bar downstairs that was pretty good, but the restaurant they have there, China Grill, was overpriced and not that great...It was also my first time to Chicago and I was eating bomb ass deep dish pizza so that might have had something to do with it. All and all three stars in fair, might check out the W the next time I go to compare.",N
3014,"So we ""took the long way home"" after an epic business trip. That's code for making up a reason to go somewhere cool to just drink. We drove from Kalamazoo, arrived around 8, had a drink in the lobby and proceeded to hit as many bars and restaurants  we could find before crashing at around 2. We were up by 8 to make a flight.  So, if you do the math, we spend about 7 hours at this W. That said, yeah, I'm totally a fan. This is the kind of place that is thinking about how to make an impression even if you don't notice. Well, I noticed - probably because that's my job. An example: taking the elevator after check-in, I noticed the rugs said ""good evening"". Through the fog of the previous night, the next morning I noticed they said ""good morning"". Possibly kitchy but the W can totally pull that kind of stuff off. So, I didn't spend enough time there to weigh in on the food or much of the service but from a pure ""great place to crash"" perspective, yeah - I'm totally a fan.",N
1621,"A dump.  Stayed here for way too much over the marathon weekend.  Paint peeling in the bathroom, unfinished elevators/lots of waiting time, dark and unimpressive lobby.  Really cheesy furnishings too in the rooms: leopard chaises??  If you can get a good deal and need a good location fine, but don't go for quality.",N
5506,"I drove a thousand miles across the country to move to Chicago and brought my mom, brother and sister with me (manual labor help, of course).  None of them had been here before and I wanted to find a nice place for us to stay that allowed cats. Anyways, I did some research and found this BEAUTIFUL hotel online and I couldnt have been more pleased with the room (except for maybe the view of the parking garage next door, but I didnt even really care about that).  It's soooo nice with great location in Lakeview and the staff is so super friendly and helpful. Funny story - my mom and sister were waiting outside for the pizza delivery guy and my mom saw two guys walk by holding hands.  Being from the suburbs in Texas, my sweet mother thought it strange.  My sister said ""did Carri not tell you about this neighborhood?"" and when my mom looked blankly at my sister, she told my mom that we were staying in the gay-berhood.  Totally thought she was going to have have a heart attack.  She really is a nice lady - I should have just given her a warning or something. Back to the hotel - dont let the name fool you.  This is like no Best Western you've ever stayed in.  It's elegant and classy, yet comfortable.  I highly recommend.",N
3664,"My review is not about the Hotel it self but about their Tea Service.  If you have never done High Tea, it is very fun.  You sit on either cushy sofas by the plants or in chairs by the fountain.  You pick out your tea from a list and depending on preference you can also get a flute of champagne.  You then start out with scones and other sweet breads included are clotted cream and jam, this is followed by finger sandwiches, I think there are four or five different kinds, and finished with a variety of little desserts.  It is a great experience to try with your girlfriends or take your female family members to.  Just remember nothing is served in great quantity and while I would not recommend stuffing your self before you go, also do not come starving.",N
1,"The only place inside the Loop that you can stay for $55/night. Also, the only place you can have a picnic dinner and get a little frisky on the 17th floor roof and then wake up in your room the next morning to an army of ants going in on your picnic leftovers.",N
2811,"Good hotel, great location.  You're right in the middle of things at this Embassy Suites, around plenty of shopping and public transit and sightseeing possibilities.   The suites are pretty typical fare.  The front room is a combination dining room-living room-kitchenette, with a sofabed, fridge, and microwave.  I was happy to see that the front wall of the suite was an actual wall and not a curtain-covered window like many Embassy Suites properties.  The bedroom had its own vanity with a sink and mirror, which was a very nice touch.  If I'd been sharing the room with anyone, that would've made things a little easier.  The bathroom was well-lit and very clean, and the toiletries smelled nice enough that I actually used them instead of the ones I brought.   Breakfast is free but can get pretty mobbed.  There's also a free happy hour, though I was never around for it.  For all of the freebies, though, it's disappointing that the internet access is over $10 (with tax).  I think in 2010, internet should be an amenity provided to guests and not a pricey luxury service.  Can I trade the extra sink for some free wifi?  If it were free, the bad connection and crappy speeds I experienced would be more excusable. I'd stay here again, though I'd be tempted to return to the Hilton Garden Inn that's across the street instead.",N
4524,"The Palmer House is a large, old, but still grand hotel in Chicago's Loop. Although it has been surpassed by newer and brighter properties with larger rooms and shinier amenities, this place has one of the finer hotel lobbies in Chicago. Take a look at the ornate details on the walls and ceilings of the second floor lobby, perhaps on your way to get a drink or use the public bathrooms. The guest rooms are rather standard in size, and those along the ""L"" tracks can be a bit noisy.",N
5679,"I stayed here on a mini vacation to Chi-town with my husband in February and I really loved this hotel. Other hotels around it were all glitzy and overpriced but this place was just what we wanted: small, clean, luxurious, quiet and comfortable. We got a standard room and it was lovely and rather spacious for a big city hotel. The location is great and I found the staff to be super friendly and helpful. The concierge made spot-on suggestions for all our requests, from cheap(est) places to buy wine, great restaurants and even help us find some cool independent book stores. Every time we left, the doorman asked if we needed a cab or directions. When we called down to the front desk to ask for a mini fridge for leftovers (and to chill our wine, of course),  they sent one up within 10 minutes. It's true, the elevator is on the slow side but not a big deal.  We also didn't try the room service but that stuff is never good anywhere and you don't need it since you're in a major metropolitan area where restaurants will deliver right to you at all hours if you don't feel like hitting the town.",N
4374,"Having worked at the Ritz Carlton during my younger days, I'm somewhat of a hotel snob. When you're used to providing exemplary service, you kind of expect it when you stay in a hotel right? I don't mean to be a snob but this is one industry where customer service is everything. You're leaving your home to sleep and eat somewhere else. You should feel like you're staying in a second home. My family and I took a family vacation to Chicago to bury my Grandma's ashes and do some sightseeing while we were there. My Mom booked this hotel from Priceline so I was skerred all the way there. I'd never seen the PH so I was skeptical at best. They were doing some work on the front of the hotel and it was a mess but they were very careful not to inconvenience the guests which was much appreciated. Nothing is worse than fearing for your life by entering a door. (It came out beautiful by the way). When we arrived, we were given a key to my Mom & sisters room and another key to mine and my brother's room. My room was SO small and on a different floor than my Mom's room so I asked if they could move us. Good thing! We got a room that was twice as big and had a better view. You could have put another 4 beds in that room and it wasn't considered a suite. Sweet for us! The lobby is amazing and gives you that feeling of old-world Chicago. It was like getting in a time machine but not in a bad way. Everything was well maintained and all the employees made us feel like they were honored we were there. We even got a nice note from the front desk worker a few hours after we checked in. The hotel bar is a little pricey and stuffy so we opted for the dive bar next door with all the pictures on the wall. Help me out with the name here people, I loved that place. It was literally next door from the entrance that faces the El. I was worried about the location of this place but we managed to walk everywhere we needed to go. It was really nice having Corner Bakery on the corner too, they have great breakfasts. Didn't try the breakfast in the hotel because we were usually in a hurry to go on an adventure. I guess the only reason why I can't give them 5*s is because I'm still and always be a hotel snob. You're going to have to ramp it up to mimic the Four Seasons or Ritz for me to max it out. I did love this place though, I'd recommend it for people staying in Chicago & not wanting to spend a billion dollars on a place to stay.",N
5329,"Great location and lovely friendly Midwestern staff.  The rooms aren't huge, but the decorating is fresh and there were plenty of fluffy white towels.  The Starbucks in the lobby is handy for coffee.  The Viand restaurant offers a convenient (slightly expensive) breakfast.",Y
3788,"We stayed one night in the tranquil suite the night we got engaged. The room was fantastic--incredibly spacious, unique views of downtown, and a minimalist aesthetic that we enjoyed. The living area of the suite has a pretty large mini fridge, couch, and coffee table, so it was a nice spot to relax and have a bottle of wine before dinner. The bathroom was incredible--I am still dreaming about the double rain shower! I can't give this place 5 stars though for 2 reasons: 1) the bed was incredibly uncomfortable. I felt like we weren't even sleeping on a mattress, but rather a giant padded pillow. And not in a ""it was so soft"" kind of way. The bed was just incredibly unstructured--lumpy, sagging, not comfortable at all. It was bad enough that I wouldn't be willing to pay full price for a room here, and especially wouldn't be willing to stay more than one night. I'm not really picky about beds, but there was just something wrong with this one (my fiance agreed). I haven't noticed any other complaints about this though, was ours just defective?? 2) We didn't interact with the concierge much, but it seemed like the staff could be a bit absentee. I don't really care about luxury service or anything, but if you're the kind of person that does, I could envision this place not being attentive enough for you. Overall, a positive and memorable experience, but what was wrong with our bed??",N
3231,"There is nothing really special about this hotel.  It has a rock & roll theme so basically means that there's a picture of John Lennon in your room instead of.. umm... dogs playing poker?  The room, bed and bathroom are fine but the details are where this place misses.  For example: -no free wifi in the room -the service is friendly but not good, i.e. really slow -the tv is fine but the remote is so crude and cheap that it's just not worth it -lighting in the rooms and lobby that is truly terrible -the hotel bar looks like it belongs on MTV but feels out of place in Chicago Do yourself a favor and book at the Renaissance across the street--same price point, same location, and free wifi.",N

Room with 2 beds accommodated 5 people (2 adults, 3 young kids) - no problem with the hotwire reservation.  25th floor, nice room, flat screen tv with real HD.  Nice location - walking distance to North Michigan shops or Navy Pier.  We used buses down to the museum campus and up to the zoo - no problems there.  Several breakfast places nearby and tons of restaurants in the area.  Had a nice stay, really positive for the price.",N
2455,"Its a huge hotel, this Hilton. Don't get lost. If you're driving to it, parking is a bit tricky. Do not pull up in front of it on Michigan Ave. Instead, drive past, turn right, turn right again, turn right again and viola, you'll be in the right spot. Where the bellmen will help you unload your crap, point you toward self-parking or valet your piece of crap car as if it were a brand new Porsche. The rooms are standard fare for Chicago hotels of this calibre. Nothing special. Nothing negative. The resto in the lobby area is actually not bad. Pricey of course, with the normal compliment of dumbed down foodstuffs for the masses.",N
5847,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay here in February, 2010.  What a great value.  Recently remodeled, our room was more like a suite with refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, and sofa.  We had a large window overlooking Franklin street with extensive desk/counter space.  Beautiful decor, large bathroom, and very quiet (very important feature for us).  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Parking is convenient and reasonable (for Chicago).  A delicious full breakfast buffet was included in our room price.  I was disappointed in the size of the pool and hot tub, but we had only limited time to use it.  I will definitely stay here again in the future.",Y
1153,"Overall, we had a great stay. We enjoyed the 24 hour room service, the large and beautiful room, and the nice views of Chi-town. Our experience with the staff was incredible!! they were on top of everything, especially ensuring we were having a great weekend!! The conceirge, Tim was amazing, hands-down. He  was what made our weekend incredible, by suggesting great places to visit, dine at, and truly went above and beyond to ensure our stay was top notch. The only thing that was disappointing was the noise of the doors of other hotel rooms. We were woken up both Sat and Sunday morning as early as 7am by other hotel room doors slamming closed. This was not fun, esp since we were hoping to sleep in late both mornings. Honestly, we heard every hotel door near our hotel bedroom slam closed. The insulation is horrible. And the noise level of the slamming doors was awful. We did note this to the concierge, who stated he received similar complaints from other hotel guests. So, if you're looking for a great hotel, amazing service, but the noise of slamming doors (due to poor insulation and bad architecture), this is the place.",N
1626,"hm. room was ok, bathroom looked like someone's crummy apartment though.  not worth the money. but the real problem was the experience.  After calling to confirm our room with a river view for a special occasion the day prior, we somehow still did not get our room with a view as confirmed.  The desk manager managed only to repeat that he didn't know what to say, that we wouldn't be charged for the better room. we chose this hotel based on it's location and view.  i also noticed we weren't the only ones with problems unfortunately.  so the service, again, was not worth the money. won't be coming back or recommending it. overall, i feel that a city as great as chicago should expect more of a hotel in it's tourism center.",N
2571,"I want to like this place more than I actually do.  From a style perspective, I love it.  It's in a hip area and unlike New York, there's REAL meat packing going on here. What I don't like: No mojitos (come on!), changing reservation minimums (it's a bit sleazy to entice people to do bottle service telling them they can get bottles of wine and then changing your mind when someone willing to spend more cash shows up and you are told ""Actually, it's $50 per person minimum""), how the crowd dies out so quickly, and $10 cover for guys after 11 P.M. even if you have multiple women with you. What I do like: Great location, attractive crowd, diversity of the crowd, very cool space (bonus points for the high ceiling), excellent decor, and a generally friendly vibe.   Why the rating? 4 stars because I don't see this as a place to get a night started and not end it.  If I was a person who went to bed at 2 A.M., this place would get 3 stars for leaving me not fully satisfied.",N
3877,"Sad - it's a beautiful space, but geez, weird and bad service. I had a reservation for a room with a king bed, there was a queen bed. There were holes in one of the sheets and comforter cover. When we turned out the light to sleep, there was loud base beat and our windows were shaking. Vertigo is on the 25th floor and we were on the 18th floor. We called the front desk and asked to be moved but were told they were full up and nothing they could do (no apology or anything but attitude). They said they'd send up security to give us ear plugs and they didn't show up until 45 minutes later. There was also this periodic knocking noise in the hallway or in the walls.  Breakfast seating not good, we sat at the bar because we were seated at a huge community table where it appeared people were waiting a while to even order. Staff were running around like their heads were cut off. Food wasn't very good and we had to ask for the usual salt, pepper, cream, etc. that you'd expect from standard service. Just too much bad stuff to shake off when you're paying over $200 an nite for a romantic weekend.",N

The HR is in a great spot right off the river with amazing views of the river and Michigan Avenue. It's centrally located between the loop and the mag mile -- you really couldn't ask for more. I also like that it's very self sustaining with several restaurants, bars, etc. all in the hotel.. not just one selection but several good choices. The rooms were nice and the service from the front desk to the maid service was all well above average. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat and would highly recommend to anyone! :-)",N

5462,"Stayed here for a conference recently, and although the hotel was okay, it's really not so great for business travelers. Internet was $9.95/day and a pain to deal with. I was told, upon check in, that because of the way I'd booked the room, the internet was included in the price of my stay. But, lo and behold, the charges were on my bill when it came check out time. And I had to argue with the front desk staff to get it taken off, and they acted like they were doing me a big favor. Also, the last day of my stay, the wireless was ""unavailable"" and there was no one onsite who knew what to do to fix it. The # of channels available on the cable TV selection was pretty lame. And like others said, the sheets kept coming off the bed, which was pretty annoying. The good points about this hotel is that the staff (aside from the whole internet debacle) was very accomodating and friendly and it was quiet (although the fact that I was on the 21st floor may have had something to do with the lack of street noise). It wasn't a horrible place to stay, but I wouldn't stay there again. There are much better places in Chicago to stay for the same price. Oh well, now I know...",N

My room was just a tad bit small, but no need to complain because my huge, King size bed made up for it. It was so comfortable. I also enjoyed the free hot chocolate that they would serve in the mornings and evenings at the lobby. Seeing the marshmallows and chocolate bits melt into my hot chocolate made me giddy. Hehe. :) Another great plus, is the LOCATION. Right on Magnificent Mile where all the good shopping and good food take place. :) I think the only complaint I have are the tiny and slow elevators that don't even have sensors. They only stay open for a few seconds, then afterwards, it'll just smoosh you as you're getting in. Although, I WAS in the elevator with Michael Phelps. So that was cool. I swear, that was him.

The door to our room looked as though it had been on the receiving end of a steel-toed boot recently, which we found a little disconcerting. There was a small TV mounted on the wall with only a few channels, no towel bars at all in the bathroom, and absolutely no amenities. For aficionados of 60s touches like fleshtone bath fixtures, the originals are still in place here. Worst of all was NO internet connection, and people at the front desk seemed clueless as to what a router was, or how to get online. This was a major inconvenience, as I had work to get done. The part-time elderly guy at the counter shrugged and referred me to the 24 hour Kinkos nearby. The ""breakfast"" was your typical motel carb-fest and really bad coffee. We found the parade of quirky characters coming in and out entertaining, except for the woman running around yelling in the parking lot at 5 a.m. I will say that everything was very clean, and we'd probably stay here again solely because of the price, as long as we didn't need to get online for anything.",N
1706,"I didn't stay long enough to get find out how everything was, but honestly how can you screw up a one night stay?  Well I'm sure there are ways.  But overall I had a good stay.  The decor was that of a Kimpton - eccentric and themed.  They wanted you to feel like a rock star so the decor reflected that.  The bathrobes in the closet were leopard print and zebra print.  There was Mr. Bubbles bubble bath for the bath.  My favorite amenity was the Aveda products.  I also had a end suite which had a separate sitting room area complete with an oversized round stool in the entry way. I ordered room service for breakfast and that was probably a mistake.  The coffee was terrible, tasted pretty water down so I didn't finish it.  It was also pretty spendy but room service usually is.  Don't order fruit yogurt, they take plain yogurt and add strawberry jam to it - or at least that's what it looked like.",N
58,"I had a good experience here, for the most part.  The building is old, and I liked that.  It had some character.  The room was clean and comfortable, the price was right, and the people were friendly and efficient.  A great location too.  As noted by other reviewers, the room was chilly.   BUT -- I was really put off by their blatant misrepresentation about wi-fi.  The web site says: ""Complimentary high speed wireless internet access."" I have posted a picture of the sign on the building that says ""Fast Free HSIA,"" which must stand for high speed internet access.   And IT'S JUST NOT TRUE.  When I checked in, the friendly desk clerk told me, standing not ten yards from that sign, that there was ""slow"" internet for free, but ""fast"" cost $6 an hour.  She said the ""slow internet was OK for checking e-mail, but that's about it.  She was right.  VERY slow.   It's not a big deal to me whether there is a charge for internet.  But it is a HUGE deal to me that the hotel flat-out misrepresents what you get for your money.  Very offensive.",N
5550,"Possibly the nicest La Quinta I've ever stayed in.  Also great free breakfast.  Staying here next time I visit Chicago, for certain.",N
1762,"This hotel wasn't exactly what I was expecting based on the reviews I read. First things first...go to the lobby for free wine!  You can't go wrong with that. But, to my dismay, there was no thumping techno...in fact, often there was no music piped in a lot of the time.  When there was music piped in, it was lame pop/rock and it was not the same music as you moved through the elevator/lobby-lounge/bathrooms off the lounge area.  Even though the decor was swanky and AWESOME, the music really sucked the energy out of the spaces for me. Our room was tiny but pretty.  The subway tile in the bathroom is gorgeous and pairs well with the baby blue ceiling.  All the mirrored surfaces entertained me.  It was nice to have two closets; one for him and one for me.  We didn't have bathrobes in our room.  Maybe because it was hot outside? I did sleep well here.  The two Roman shades allowed me to adjust the lighting in the room when morning rolled around.   It was impossible for two people to get any work done with the amount of surface area available, so I wouldn't recommend planning to work from a standard size room here. The location was very convenient to the freeway, but not as convenient to Chicago hotspots.  Things seemed to close early around us. In short, I have mixed feelings about this hotel.  It's chic and boutiquey, but I think I want to try somewhere else next time I'm in Chicago.",N
3927,I wish I had good things to say; but never stay here.  My wife and I have stayed here twice.  The first one was bad and we should not have gone back.  My wife was back in September 2011 and the hotel placed her in a room with a connecting door.  She was suspicious of the lock on the door; but it required a key to lock.  She placed her shoes in front of that door as an indicator.  When she got back to her room - her shoes had been tossed away from the door and the person who had broken into her room had gone through her suitcase!  When she talked to management of the hotel - they were reluctant to give her another hotel room and wouldn't apologize for the break in or the fact that the room staff did not lock the door in bewteen the rooms.,N
495,"The beds were comfortable enough and the location is nice for downtown happenings... We had someone trying to sleep in the ""first"" room, on a Friday night, and that was a mistake, as the lobby stayed pretty loud, and a group of drunken revelers tried to get into our room at 3 in the morning... they finally did manage to get into the room next door, and the walls are pretty thin. $15/day for internet is completely unacceptable. Breakfast was ok, especially for the price (free) but the cooked-to-order stuff is the way to go. The buffet offerings don't stay warm or get refilled often enough... you have to get lucky.",N
4336,"A very nice older hotel on the south side of the loop, the Palmer House Hilton is a stunner when you walk in.  The rooms have recently been updated and the decor is tasteful and appropriately retro-esque. NOTE TO FAMILIES:  These are nice, big rooms!  If you get a double double, you can also fit both a rollaway AND crib in there - no problem.  Looks like there are lots of adjoining rooms available also (yay for older hotels!).  Bathrooms are not as big as the bedrooms in terms of scale, but nice. WI-FI is not free!  This is pretty ridiculous in my book.  I think it's $8 per day. PARKING overnight through valet is a whopping $61!!!  Do yourself a favor and park at one of the many lots surrounding the hotel.  You'll save 50%. KUDOS to the housekeeping staff.  They kept our room beautifully.  (Tips do help)  Big bonus:  forgot a necklace in my room when we checked out.  Went back two hours later and the maid had turned it in.  We've had things stolen at other hotels, both after check out (only to turn right around and stuff has ""vanished"") and during stays - so THANK YOU to the woman who cleaned our room.  You clinched the fifth star of this stay!!",N
1831,"Honestly, this is really a 3 star hotel.  I gave it the additional star because the concierge gave us a magic card that put us at the top of a VERY long wait list at Yolk for brunch the Sunday of Labor Day weekend. Fairly recent renovations, decent check-in staff, Bliss amenities..... We had two ""Superior"" rooms.  Tons of room.  Nice bathrooms.  I typically stay elsewhere when I'm in the city, but it was great for what we were doing. We did drinks and apps at IPO, the restaurant in the hotel.  The service was EXCEPTIONAL.  Everyone was very helpful.  The drinks and apps were great.  I'd definitely try some dinner there next time I'm in town.",N
2313,"This review speaks completely to the Marriott as a venue to host a meeting or event. I was here for a conference and I must say that I was impressed by some of the renovations. The colors look very modern, hip and trendy. The layout of the hotel can be a bit confusing but the hotel did a great job of placing signs to assist those who may have gotten off track. The food served for every meal, break, and the reception was great and well thought out. It didn't feel like the hotel food of ""yesteryear"" . A few negatives: the hotel didn't anticipate the need for hangers for the coat racks on a cold November day so people were tossing their coats on top of the racks while staff stood about and eventually got more hangers. Escalators were not in service and the stairwell needed to access the floor where the sessions were being held was kind of scary and dingy. Lunch serving staff seemed very unhappy, many people weren't offered drinks with their lunch or coffee. When I walked up to the hotel I was not greeted by any staff or offered any assistance though i'm sure I look baffled since I was looking for a specific entrance.",N
3224,"Tonight is our first time here, and we are loving every bit of it! Our room is clean, stylish and comfortable to hang out in. We really appreciate the attention to details that the Hard Rock displays, we immediately understood the brand as soon as we stepped in. Confetti exploded in our brains when we heard we could rent a guitar for free - we had no choice but to try it out! We even loved the guy who brought it up to our room, he was full of energy and personality. -- In fact, everyone we've encountered here has been that same way; which makes me think that either the company management treats them very well or that cool people just happen to work here (I hope both). I don't think one night here will be enough time to experience all that this hotel has to offer. We will definitely be back.",N
3687,The Drake hotel is a lot of fun. My friend and her mother went there for tea on new years eve. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly. The interior is warm and gracious. The tea service is perfectly proportioned and the service is dignified and graceful. A must if you enjoy tea!,N
5310,"I stayed here for a convention at the McCormick Center in Chicago and The Silversmith was a decent hotel. It was clean and my room was very large. I had a separate living and sleeping area with a king bed. As I was on the 8th floor facing the side where the trains ran, I could still hear the train from that high up. It wasn't loud enough to keep me from sleeping, but it was bothersome. Otherwise, the location of the hotel was great, right on Jewelers Row and surrounded by a decent shopping area. I especially liked the Nordstrom Rack and Macy's nearby.But even so, I will probably not be staying here ever again. When I first arrived, I had requested from the front desk some extra toiletries to be sent up to my room, as the ones they provide are sparse. The front desk said someone would be up with them soon. No one ever came and I still did not receive new or more toiletries my whole stay here (I checked in on a Saturday evening and checked out on a Thursday). I also tried to request a late check-out as my convention ended at 2 PM on Thursday, but the latest they could accommodate me was only 12:30 PM, barely any difference from their current check-out time of 12 PM. So I checked out and left my luggage with the bell hop there until I could come back and retrieve it. When I did come and try to retrieve it, I waited half an hour for a bell hop to arrive at their stand near the entrance of the hotel and no one ever came. I went to the front desk with my luggage ticket and asked to receive my luggage, they radio-ed the bell hop and they didn't even receive a response. I proceeded to wait another 15 minutes for someone to finally come to retrieve my luggage. I believe one of the hotel cleaning staff working in the lobby had to come and help me get my bags.The internet is also neither wireless or hi-speed. I ended up getting so frustrated by the lack of wireless internet and slow speed of the wired internet, that I ended up using my iPad data plan for most of my stay here.I would expect more from a hotel for the rate I received (Ranged from $169 to $279 per night during my Sat. through Thurs. stay). Luckily, I was staying here for business, otherwise I would be very disappointed in how much I spent on this room.",Y
3167,super friendly and helpful staff.  my large room overlooked the lake and it was a shame I was there by myself. The doorless bathroom with the window was a little odd...especially with the 2 beds in the room...,N
2932,"I stayed here for an ABA convention for work and it was a great experience. The Hotel staff was excellent and did everything i requested. The room was spacious and had great amenities like, flat screen tv, memory foam bed, and awesome views. the location was great. walking distance to everything. great bar on Hubard St, again all walking distance. if you are looking for a place where u can have a peaceful time and no need for a car this is the place.",N
1749,"This is a great hotel which is rather unique. The big CON is they have small rooms. It's a renovated older hotel so its not like they designed it this way to begin with but it was rather tight. I, for one, don't mind since I rarely stay in my room that long... I am a up and about type person. For some people, this is a big deal since they need a large room. Don't let that deter you though. The staff here is great. Very helpful, very service minded. They mailed a post card for me an gave me an umbrella when I asked where I could buy one. My friend got upgraded to a suite because they made a small mistake. These are good service minded people. I like the decor but it could be a bit much for some people who like a more traditional feel (Kimpton hotels are mostly like this though, its their thing). As other people have mentioned, they have wine every day for an hour or so. Really really really cool of them. It's also a good way to meet other guests. If you get a deal on this hotel... I'd say check it out.",N
3657,Got to stay here with my BF while he was working and it was very old school Chicago. But still a great experience. The lobby made you think you were in a movie. The service was very good. The staff was nice. This is definitely a place for old school chicago and people who love nostalgia with old hotels. = ) I am one of them.,N
348,"Good: Cheap rates, clean bed, clean bathroom, two good inexpensive restaurants on-site, and good location. Bad: Tiny rooms. Though the essentials were clean, certain things were a little dirty... such as exposed sprinkler system and other nooks and crannies. I don't expect these areas to be cleaned daily, but they should be cleaned at least a few times each year. The carpet was a little raveled in places. The hotel website incorrectly list a ""complimentary"" internet station. You actually need to swipe a credit card to use... no big deal, but poorly stated on website. Also, the printer at this station did not work for my entire 3-day visit. Again... no big deal, but I felt the staff should have placed an ""out of order"" sign on the device. (I would've been upset if I paid to print... only to find out I could not.) I compare this hotel to a Motel 6. Though I love nice hotels, my goal was to see the city and sleep cheap. It served the purpose. Again, the location was great... within walking distance to several attractions and only one block from the CTA (Harrison-red line-subway). Would I stay here again? Yes. However, another $20/night may get a nicer place.",N
1413,i've never stayed at the hotel but i did work with them to plan our med school Winter Formal. We got an awesome deal on catering and drinks and the staff was more than happy to have our group. The room where we were was amazing! The light up dancefloor gave it just what we needed to make the formal a huge success. they were more than accomodating and i would not hesitate to work with them again. my only complaint (and it was partly our fault because we got started late) was that they picked up dinner plates really quickly and some people were not done eating yet. other than that everything went off without a hitch!,N
1742,"The decor is unique. It's out there - definitely clashing wallpapers , furniture, and colors, but it works. As for the rooms..they're tiny. And the bathrooms are tinier. The sink in the bathroom is awkward because it doesn't have a lot of depth...so washing your face means splashing water on your legs too. Some of us actually opted to wash our faces/brush our teeths in the bathtub because it was less messy. A really important note: THE WALLS ARE SUPER THIN. You can hear everything. Let the staff know - they'll probably comp your room for you.",N
1148,"Loved the room and the view,",N
3252,"Yeah yeah yeah its in the Carbon and Carbide Building. I love Chicago architecture but there are many architecturally significant buildings in the city and its not like the hotel and its decor reflected any of the buildings stylings.... so it really has nothing to do with the hotel. BUT I liked the decor. Of both the room, lobby and bar area. Very sleek and modern. Loved the gray-purple walls in our room. The minimalist decor. The meant-to-look-expensive Warhol-esque rock-star images were cheesy but acceptable. Color-scheme - thumbs up. Aveda bathroom products - good job. Great bed and lots of extra pillows in the closet - rock n roll. The curtains definitely kept the morning light out - but, the rooms were not quite soundproof (from the bed, which was some distance from the door, I could hear the elevator and neighboring rooms' doors opening and closing - strange, not too mention light Saturday AM traffic). I laughed at the outrageous prices found while purusing the room-delivery menu and the mini-fridge items. Not like I was surprised. I just feel bad for the people (i.e. the out-of-towners up late night) who are stuck having to pay for all these things. (Whereas other guests may know there way around the loop or not be intimidated searching for a local convenience store). $3 for a can of pop. $7 for a bottle of designer water. etc etc. Good god, how horrible. My friend, living in the suburbs, got the room to serve as the base for her birthday celebration and I enjoyed the comfort and swankiness of the hotel but wasn't *super* impressed. The other guests we encountered during Saturday checkout were anything but urban sophisticates - which was cool. But contrary to what others have posted.... definitely touristy. Basically I place like this is a bit too gratuitous for my tastes but I have nothing against it. It was pretty cool but still nothing to write home about.",N
3171,"I guess when you take the old Days Inn and give it a new ""look"" you can charge a lot for the same room.  There is definitely a cool vibe to this hotel and the location is great, but the price is a little much.  The rooms do have great views and it's nice since it is a little off the Michigan Avenue path.  All in all, I wouldn't send my visiting relatives there due to the price.",N
345,"I was shocked at the reviews of this place after staying here. In fact they almost deterred me from booking, but since I was on a holiday budget and http://Priceline.com gave me a room for $50/night I said lets roll the dice. Now that being said, I wouldn't do this hotel again for $100 or more like many of the other reviewers seemed to have paid. I could see why they felt ripped. The nearby Hilton and other gorgeous hotels on Michigan probably go for more and I see how these guys undercut the budget market. But try not and pay full price for this place or you might feel taken.... While old and charming, the hotel is run down. Really old. Old bed, old TV, smaller room, you get it...but they do have HBO.... however ESPN was down and that was all I wanted to watch a bowl game. But we were all about seeing the city and received nothing but a great experience. We were able to walk to Millennium Park, the Art Institute, The Sears (aka Willis Tower), Navy Pier, a bunch of good eateries -- and best of all a block from the train. I'd be back... but only for a http://Priceline.com -- $50 deal --  nice stay, friendly staff and the little breakfast cafe downstairs was actually decent and cheap. The only bummer was the parking is $28 extra a day.",N
137,"Once you step out of the hotel to the right, you can see the John Hancock tower looming over you. Nice! The staff is professional and accommodating. They allowed me to switch my room from a 1 queen bedroom to a 2 queen with no hassles. The room was spacious and clean.The bed was very comfortable for me especially after I ran a marathon. My only issue was this dark brown fur coat thing on bed that was used for decoration. I certainly hope that it was not real animal fur. I quickly threw that off to the side. The hotel is across the street from the Four Seasons. Save your money and come here instead. This spot is cheap compared to other hotels because of its location. At the time I went there (October 2009), they were still renovating, which wasn't an issue for me. No free internet here and you pay $10 a day. I didn't realize this until my last day that they offer free wireless in the main parlor room in the lobby. Closest El Train: Chicago-Red (about 4 blocks away)",N
3656,"Had afternoon tea party at the Palm Court. I thought this place was elegant, however old fashioned. The finger sandwiches and scones were good, but nothing to rave about. I had better afternoon tea sandwiches at a less luxurious place. Tea selection and variety could expand as well. The harpist in the background was a nice touch. Service and ambiance were wonderful. Loved the powder room :)",N
1269,"Functional. Don't get a room on 11th  street side. Faces a music schl=loud music all day.  Tiny rooms. Huge gap under door to room. Holly nice desk girl. Night staff underwhelming. I'm not messy, but I never had a housekeeper in my room the entire time. I would like to have my coffee replenished and fresh towels, but had to ask for them every night because the housekeeper didn't come to my room.  Loud door slamming ALL night, and someone kept smoking in the hall.  The heater was next to the thin windows so it kept going non stop and that side of the room was freezing while the other side was HOT.  The wall thermostat was broken so I had to keep walking to the thing to adjust it.  Also, the lighting sucks in the bathroom. and NO water pressure in the shower.",N
3120,"I'm as surprised as anyone could be that I'm only giving the W Lake Shore 3 stars.  Last weekend was the third time I've stayed at this hotel and I'm sorry to say that it is getting to be about time for some renovations.   The downstairs lounge area is still as W as ever and I love the location, but the rooms were just ""eh"".  Our bamboo blinds were broken so the middle one didn't go up all the way and we had a lamp that was on when we came in the room, but that the switch was broken off of, so the only way we could figure to turn it off was to actually unplug the light bulb.  Not ideal.  Also I'm not that big of a fan of the rain shower head if it is only used in order to disguise low-ish water pressure, which I had the impression was the case at this W.  Under the rain shower head = warm goodness.  Everywhere else in the shower stall = BRRRR.  My legs were less than thrilled that I had to actually hold them under the water while shaving them because any other action would have been a direct trip to Goose Bump City.  Also the walls were really thin.  While getting ready for the wedding we went to Sunday night, we could hear every word coming out of the television next door.  As though it was in our room (and I don't even think that our neighbors had it turned up past normal volume). Anyway, W, if you are listening, maybe put some money into making the rooms more like new again.  The rooms are good-sized and the location and views are top-notch.  Easy fixes, I say. Until then, W Downtown might be a better bet.  Or if you are feeling silly spendy (or have the ole expense account working for you), stay at one of my all time faves, Park Hyatt Water Tower.  Sigh.  No Starwood points there though, my friend.",N
1030,"I stayed in this hotel the first time I came to Chicago for a college visit. It is precisely why I am moving to Chicago in a few days. When we first arrived there, the doorman greeted us and took our bags (surprisingly, thats not done much in DC) and guided us to the front desk. All of the staff we spoke to were very polite and helpful. They gave us great recommendations on where to go to for food, and advised us on how to travel when we return to the city. The hotel was quite beautiful, and very comfortable. Our rooms were a few doors down from the free happy hour and breakfast sites so my parents were pretty satisfied. The only reason I give it four stars is because the view kind of blows, but that is no reason to totally down this hotel.",N

2429,"I have been to the Hilton Chicago on several occasions, and all times  were for work.  The first time was in 2009 for my association's Interim BOT meeting.  The second time was for a site-visit for my association's Annual Conference, and the third time was for the actual conference. On a personal level as a guest: 2009 - I had to stay a night for work and I found the room, as well as the hotel, to be dark, out-dated, and almost haunted.  I was so freaked out in my room, which was a basic king room, that I stayed up and watched The Hangover and ordered a pizza through room service.  I ended up sleeping with the light on (yes, I am scared of the dark and this hotel room didn't help) 2011 - Stayed here the last night of my conference and got a pretty sweet room.  It was a King Jr. Suite and it had a view of museum campus and the lake.  Too bad I was working and couldn't really enjoy it for long.  I still found the room to be small, but less dark and out-dated than 2009. Either way, this would NOT be my first pick if I was visiting Chicago.  The hotel has a lot of history, and certainly has one of the most beautiful ballrooms I have seen as well as amazing suites - both the Conrad and the Imperial Suites are breath-taking, but an average person would not be paying to stay there.  If anything, I say visit the hotel on a tour, but dont' pay the money to stay there unless 1) you get a great deal or 2) can afford one of the suites.  While the hotel isn't centrally located to many Chicago attractions it is close to museum campus, the infamous Buddy Guy Legends, and is a short cab ride to the Magnificent Mile. On a professional level as a meeting planner: 1) The exhibit space isn't ideal for exhibitors especially if you are on the Lower Level because of all the columns.  The meeting rooms, with the exception of the 2nd and 3rd floor, are small and cramped and make you feel like you're in elementary school again. 2) The prices are ridiculous - I have never been to a property that charges so much for a gallon of coffee!  We definitely had to have a serious conversation with them in regards to pricing for items such as coffee, internet, and electrical.  As a planner, consider yourself warned, and be prepared to discuss bringing prices down and compromising in certain areas. 3) The staff - everyone from the front desk, facilities, banquets, the blue coats, to covention services and even the chef and GM are beyond amazing!  I have worked meetings at a lot of properties and the Hilton Chicago staff are definitely up there.  They were extremely accommodating, professional, and a true pleasure to work with.   If I am still with the association in 2014, I look forward to going back just to be able to work with their staff.",N
2342,Perfect location for shoppers but not the greatest hotel in terms of quality of rooms.  The lobby was amazing and so was the staff.  The rooms on the other hand were just dull other than the views out over the city.  We turned the couch around and had a bottle of wine looking out over the city at night 33 floors up and it was perfect!  Overall best location for a hotel for shoppers but your paying for just the location not the quality of rooms.,N
995,this place is pretty skanky. i hope i never have to do that again.,N
1365,"We stayed here for 3 nights.  Great location as it's right off Michigan Avenue that you can easily walk to all the shops.  If you don't care for the hotel amenities, then this is is a decent place to stay. We were on the 10th floor, but right near the elevator which was annoying at times because we could hear people talking.  The room was smaller than expected, but I liked the modern decor and the 42"" TV which was the biggest I've seen in a standard hotel room.   Bathroom was clean and up-to-date with a rain shower, but the toilet was surprisingly too high for me that it was a little uncomfortable.  The coffee and the coffeemaker were cheap and terrible for this hotel.  I think they need to upgrade both.   Internet was $9.95 a day, but we opted out as we did ourselves a favor by not doing any work.  From our window, we were able to see a glimpse of Lake Michigan.  Overall, a decent hotel.",N
4397,"Since it was New Year's Eve, I will need to start out this review by saying that I didn't really pay attention to specific details of my experience at the hotel. I do know a few things though. Enter the Palmer House Hilton: location is decent. If I were a guest staying downtown and wanted to experience the city, I probably wouldn't choose this location unless you want to be closer to Millenium Park. Walking into the hotel, it's gorgeous. It's massive size reminds me of hotels in Vegas that go on for miles. In fact, I believe that the lobby with all of the bars, etc. also reminds me of a Vegas hotel (without the casino of course). I wanted to get there early to have a cocktail prior to leaving for my party, but ended up falling behind. Never EVER wait until after 5 to check into the hotel on NYE. The line was nuts. Lucky guests waited in line while others in their party got them drinks from the bar. I knew I should have brought another person with me. Oh well. On the website, I was notified if you are staying on the Executive Level, there is a quick credit card check-in option to avoid long lines. This was not the case when I got there and the lady at the front desk never heard of that. Interesting. Perhaps something for them to look into during crowded periods? Though, for my long wait, the front desk lady gave me late check out at 2pm for free. I chose executive level because 1) it sounded cool 2) I figured it would be quieter with more business people (or just less children). Little did I know it also comes with breakfast and appetizers from 5-7 on a special floor. Fun stuff. The room was NICE. It was large and came with a couch, tv, desk, nice bed, and decent bathroom. The bed was comfy. Or it felt that way after my NYE partying. And it's not squeaky and has plenty of pillows. I just hope they wash their sheets. Vending machines. All I wanted in the morning was a bottled water, but did not have enough 1s. So I thought since it was $2.50, I could buy two and use a $5. Well, I found out it only takes 1s. Not cool. I don't like to use the glasses in the rooms due to shows about how they are never washed. I was forced to use one. :( I didn't end up using my late checkout since I got about 3 hours of sleep (it was New Years!) . I checked out on my phone to avoid lines and grabbed some ""breakfast"" in the lounge upstairs right before it closed. It was pretty much picked through, but I got a sesame bagel and chive and onion cream cheese. Definitely needed something in my stomach. All in all, I really enjoyed staying on the Executive Level. I did feel cool. We had separate elevators where you have to insert your key to get in. And the elevator was right by the front desk. I'm not sure where the other elevators were located, but that was pretty convenient. The hotel definitely served its purpose and I would stay here again if I'm in the area.",N
4660,"I had booked a hotel on Priceline for the Cardinals/Cubs series and managed to get the Hotel Felix, while I wasnt looking forward to my stay based on the reviews on Tripadvisor I have to admit I was impressed. While many of the reviewers on TripAdvisor were right, yes the rooms are on the small side, however the bathroom was large but lacking much counterspace. The staff was extremely courteous and the hotel offers free wi-fi, which is usually unheard of at a hotel like this. The location isnt the best, its a safe area however you are a few blocks away from Michigan Ave, so if you are expecting to be in the middle of the shopping district you may want to reconsider. However the hotel is only about 3-4 blocks to the Red Line, and about the same distance to Michgan Ave so it is a fairly quick walk.",N
278,"Lucky us, the Seneca overbooked and we were put in the Presidential Suite!  SWEET!!!!!! Excitedly opened the door...  DRIP!  What the...?!  I was scared to call for fear that they'd move me into a regular room.  Instead maintenance was sent and fixed the drip (coming from the AC) in no time.  NIIICE!!!!!! Love the Seneca Hotel!",N
2745,"Cute bar and reception area, but once you get past that point, get ready for incompetent service, bad attitudes and a strange, dirty smell in the elevators. Kind of a mess.",N

2708,"I don't even know where to start... this hotel was EXCELLENT!!! We spent our HONEYMOON at a suite at the FABULOUS James Hotel, Chicago. We arrived to rose petals everywhere including the shower, champagne and strawberries. It was VERY sexy! Checking in was incredibly fast, as was checking out. We felt like this hotel went above and beyond our expectations. The bed was FABULOUS and we are thinking of buying one with our wedding money:) I also didn't want to part with the deluxe robes, sheets or towels. If you are into any of the guest room amenities - you will LOVE the products they use and i hope you appreciate the linens as much as I did. If you like, fresh, clean, new, urban, cool spaces - you will LOVE this hotel.",N
2036,"This review is not based on staying as a guest in a room, but a review for it as a wedding venue.  I officiated my friends wedding here and helped with a lot of the planning details.   When I heard my friends were getting married at the Holiday Inn because it was a fantastic deal, I was happy that they found something that fit their budget, but I wasn't expecting it to be super classy.  I was so wrong. Barbara, the in-house the wedding planner was a breeze for the bride and groom to work with.  She was calm and thought of everything.  I too found communicating with her to be very easy.   The food was well beyond my expectations. The salad was not your average crank them out wedding salad.  The greens were fresh, the string beans delicious.  If you told me I was eating local organic produce, I would have believed you.  The steaks were so thick and delicious you would have thought this was a $150 per plate wedding meal, which I'm sure it was not.  The Holiday Inn outsources their cakes to Alliance Bakery.  I'm not a big wedding cake fan - because most just aren't that great.  This one was fantastic.  (Chocolate buttercream, chocolate cake, raspberry filling.) The venue let our friends bring in their own beer from outside.  This is unheard of at a hotel wedding venue.  Upcharging alcohol is a big part of how they make their money.  But our friends were able to pick up fantastic beer and bring it in to be served at the bar.  It saved them a bundle. They had an open bar all night long.  I'm not big into mixed drinks so I cannot comment on that aspect. Free rooms were included for the bride and groom and parents on the night of the wedding.  The couple said that nice perks like that were present throughout their whole experience. The only things I did not like were: They typically don't provide a holding room for the wedding party to wait in.  The part of the room where they stood for their ceremony had an exit door and exit sign right behind them.  Not the most beautiful backdrop to a wedding ceremony.  And when the clock struck leaving time - they threw on the florescent lights and herded everyone out as though it were a police raid.  I have worked catering and understand well the need to get guests out so crew can start to breakdown.  I'm sure their method was effective in doing so, but they could have used some more tact.   These negatives were minor compared to the service, the good price, the good food, and great views. I think this is one of the best kept secrets as far as Chicago wedding venues go.  Five stars indeed.",N
4938,If I could give this place zero stars I would.Lets just say if your sister gets back from Iraq and you want to meet her in Chicago at the government rate (which she had MORE than earned). DO NOT come here. They refuse to accomodate military personnel in any room with two beds. So instead of a great rate for a returning soldier (190) you can instead pay more than you do on any travel site if you need more than one bed (415 was the quote for a double).Sad. You can have my priority club card back. PS your hotel front desk was just as bad if not worse than your 800 number rude staff. Trust me I will be telling everyone I know about this. The Holiday Inn/Intercontential?Crowne Plaza people DO NOT CARE about our returning soldiers. So much for our girls weekend.,Y
975,"This hotel kind of reminded me of the casino hotels in Biloxi,MS to give you a reference. Some of the staff was nice and some not so much. It was weird no one offered to bring our bags to our rooms but only helped with our bags on our day of departure. I liked the complimentary lemon cookies from Maggiano's Little Italy which greeted us at the welcome desk. Although their breakfast is not as great as the ones served at Holiday Inn it was very sufficient with it's yogurt and bagels with various condiments such as cream cheese and peanut butter. The location could not be beat within walking distance of Michigan ave and Wacker Dr the dock for the Architectural Boat Tour and Xoco Rick Bayless restaurant! Next time I'm in town I definitely wanna check out the complimentary happy hour.",N
260,"With conventions in town, and my company asking me to stay longer, the Holiday Inn @ The Mart was booked.  So I had to switch hotels today. This Holiday Inn is located about 2 miles from The Merchandise Mart, very close to the Sear's Tower. It's pretty tiny and out of the way.  Not conveniently located to anything walking distance. The service is decent.  The view from the hotel is atrocious... It's actually costing me $220 a night to stay here... I'm glad it's only for 3 more days. One good thing... they also have free wireless here and since they have less rooms, the wireless is less used and it's much faster than the other hotel. UPDATE: I just woke up from my first night's stay...and I have to give 1 more star! These beds are SOOOOOOO comfortable.  Much more comfortable than the other Holiday Inn.  The pillows are VERY soft... I love this bed!!!!",N
627,"Pleased w/the hotel despite the initial biatchy front desk gal & the miscommunication about the type of room, got smoking.  ICK!!!   Transferred into a non-smoking room after the first night & it was literally what the pillows stated, 'Sweet Dreams': -Lots of pillows -Neutrogena bath products -Fluffy towels -Chewy, warm walnut choco cookies, that STAY chewy.  OMG. -Numi tea bags -Wolfgang Puck coffee -Super friendly doormen -Location, location, location. Check out was seamless & I wouldn't hesitate to book nights here again.",N
2090,Stayed here on business.  Got a corner room with a fantastic view.  Lots of space and a small fridge in the corner.  The coffee maker was fine. The bathroom was a little old in appearance but everything worked fine.  The room was likely dated but these things don't bother me if I can get a good night's sleep.  Noise from below was at a minimum but this might be that I was facing the river.  Location is great with the metro just outside the place.  You can walk through the attached buildings and not go outside. Didn't try the bar but it did look like a nice view.  The hotel was going through some renovation but that didn't seem to affect anything.   The staff was friendly and helped pick some places to eat that night.,N
1838,"Quick Thoughts: - lobby is one of the best W lobby's anywhere if you're into that sort of thing...hotel bar as expected is solid - bed fell short of W standards and sucked compared to the average Westin bed - typical W gym - small, but does the trick (towels in the fridge is a great call) - internet speed in the room was great (based on wireless - they have both wireless and wired) is 1Mb/s down and .26 Mb/s up - billing was annoying given the ridiculous deposit - 40 SPG stays in the past 2 years and this was the 1st time I've had a hassle - staff is great - from room service to check in The W is 4 stars compared to most other hotels, but 3 stars compared to the better hotels I've stayed in the Chitown (Conrad, Blackstone, etc...).",N
3069,"This is just a review of the bar. I really like the design of the downstairs bar at the W.  It's really stylish and it's right on the water, which is pretty cool.  I'd like to go back there sometime around sunset for dinner.   I was suprized how few people were in the bar when we were there.  Usually when I go to W's in other cities, they're really packed.  The crowd there was quite touristy, too.  But we had fun!  I had the red sangria, which was delicious!",N
5102,"When my family and I stayed here during the first part of the summer it was relaxing and the service was outstanding and attentive. However, as our stay extended for another two weeks I began to notice that the first-rate service I had previously experienced completely flipped. I felt as if we were staying at a completely different hotel. Housekeeping would come to our room but would leave a pile of dirty towels on the floor and one day housekeeping came to our door at 8 in the morning to chastise my father for calling the front desk after our room had not been cleaned. I thought it was completely unprofessional and unwarranted. Additionally, when I ordered a bread pudding from room service there were moldy strawberries on the plate. Although I enjoyed the first week of my stay, I felt like the last two did not match up quality and service-wise. One good thing about the hotel though is the rooms.Additionally, for all of you fitness buffs the gym is not complimentary but it costs about 15 dollars a visit.",Y
1400,"I work kitty corner from this hotel, so I recommend that coworkers stay here when coming in from out of town. I haven't been in the rooms, but they say they are nice and clean and fine. I have found the loby bar a nice place to stop and get a drink with colleagues after work. Service was very friendly and responsive. Haven'd dined in the restaurant, but appetizers in the bar were delicious.",N
3079,"My fiance and I stayed at The W for one night this week, and we were astounded at the type of hospitality you are provided with for how much you pay for stay there. The lobby is gorgeous, and has a relaxing atmosphere. Checking in was pretty easy. The woman at the front desk was very eager to answer any and all questions we had about our stay. Now for the bad. The room we were provided with was absolute junk. The door to the room would not shut unless two people applied their entire body weight to it. The same goes for the bathroom ""door."" It is made of some sort of mock-bamboo material, and ours just did not want to close, even when the two of us tried. At first glance, the bathroom itself looks very nice. However, it gets about one star from me, because there is no functionality to it what so ever. The ""bamboo"" shutters is by far the worst thing about the room as a whole. You have the ability to shut them, but that does not mask any sounds coming from the bathroom. I love my fiance, but not enough to listen to his every move while using the toilet. The bed sheets in this room were filthy. Stains of God knows what were all over the place when we attempted to take a nap before heading out on the town. That is when we had enough. We requested a different room at the front desk, and were given one with no hassle at all. The door to the new room was completely functional, as was the one to the bathroom. However, there were cracks in the ceiling and while we were sleeping, bits of plaster would fall on to our faces. The temperature of the room is almost impossible to get right, you are either freezing cold, or sweating through your clothes. The shower was horrible in both rooms. Very pretty looking, but when in use, it gets water all over the floor since there is only half of a ""door"" and no curtain. The knob on our shower was also broken, so it took about 15 minutes for us to turn it on. All in all, the W was beautiful on the outside, but for what you are paying, it is definitely not worth it. At $53 a night for parking alone, I would be much more satisfied staying at a Hilton or even a Holiday Inn.",N
3093,"I attended a corporate event here and had a good time. However, the prices should NOT just be about location. The W seems to be an old, rundown hotel they took and tried to gussy up. My friends' room had scuff marks on the walls, cheap wood (or press board?) paneling nailed to one wall, and it was TINY. The bathrooms have a window, which is not only weird, but provide NO sound barrier. Pretty awkward, depending on who you're staying with. The shower heads are low and her husband almost wasn't able to fit under them! The bamboo blinds were also filthy. When you enter the room, you are greeted with a basket of goodies. Wow! Now, this helps to explain the $300ish for a crap room rates... or maybe not. We soon realized that next to this basket of ""goodies"" was a price list. An individual can of Pringles? $5! You can also buy 3 or 4 condoms for $12 and a ""Take me Away"" CD for $13. Wow. sexy, huh? Not really. Oh- and if you want anything that isn't in your room (towels, food, etc.) it's a $3.50 DELIVERY CHARGE and a 20% service fee. Wow. The 33rd floor (I believe it's called the Altitude Room?) is pretty nice, but the bathrooms have no main door. Again... awkward. The stones in the sink were pretty cool though, I have to admit. I would never, EVER pay to stay here, but people seem to like it. I guess when you have money to throw into the air at mediocre service and rooms, it's worth it.",N
731,"Ditto the other Yelpers about great location, nice service & rooms needing a Ctrl+Alt+Del.  The view from my 17th floor room was really beautiful, though, so ask if you can score a Michigan Ave. facing room. The fitness center was better equipped than I would have expected, judging from the otherwise older, outdated hotel.  Medicine balls, swiss balls, yoga mats, walls of mirrors, lots of cardio machines, all pretty new. If you're looking for a Miracle Mile hotel and this Westin comes up pricing less than expected for other hotels in the same class, now you know why.  So, if it's a luxe experience you seek, keep looking; but if you want a nice, standard Westin with a killer location, you'll be happy here.",N
4138,"What is WRONG with these people! I LOVE this hotel!... Don't try to say I don't know my hotels.... I have traveled a lot more than your average bear, in over 40 US states and at least a dozen countries.  This may not be the most posh, or the most service oriented, but they give you a very good quality stay for a decent price with a TON of perks. The location is terrific.  I like to take the train in from the airport, but that's just because it puts me in a city frame of mind.  They have a very nice airport pickup/drop off for people who are a little more practical and less city-romantic than me.  The hotel faces the Chicago river... so you can watch the drawbridges go up and down, and all the sailboats stream in and out to the lake, and yes... many rooms have a view of the lake.  If you can't see the lake, then you CAN see the beautiful city lit up at night in all her glory.  In the winter, a desert dweller like myself can enjoy the underground corridors.  You can go to the sub levels and travel around the city for blocks.... get your nails done, go to a lounge or restaurant, or do a little shopping.  If the weather isn't horrible, Michigan Ave is across the street.  I could wander the area for days. The atrium lobby is spectacular... a great place to sit with your coffee and FREE WIFI",N
2409,"Although I did not stay at the Chicago Hilton, my employer had two galas in the ballroom in late October. All I can say is my oh my, do I wish I had the cash to have my wedding in this place! Stunning from floor to ceiling, with glitzy gold and mirrors everywhere to reflect the shimmering light. I could do without the disco ball, though; odd decor choice for such a beaux-arts-type venue.",N
1231,"Let's start with the good things about the Hyatt Regency McCormick: - very comfy bed - decent toiletries (soap, shampoo, etc) - All North facing rooms have a great view of the Chicago Skyline AND Lake Michigan to the right. - Connected to the HUGE McCormick Place and convention center What's so bad about staying there? - There is NOTHING around it.  It's a $15.00 cab ride to the loop.   - You're stuck paying a premium on parking, restaurants and even bottle water because there isn't a drug store around. It is close to the Midway Airport.  The Orange line cost $2 but once you get out on Roosevelt Ave, there isn't much cabs in that neighborhood, so you can walk 12-15 blocks or wait for a bus. I'm not thrilled to come back in July but that's where the convention I'm going to will be hosted. Edit 08/03/07: overcharges for everything.  Surcharge for the privilege for a package to be delivered to the Hyatt. $10/day for Hard Line (not even wireless) internet access at home and if you go downstairs to the lobby the wireless internet is $10/more a day. SHOR restaurant is overpriced bland food.",N
4771,"My stay was on 8/20 -21/2011.  A friend and I had adjoining rooms on the 9th floor. I am in my 50's meaning I have stayed in many, many hotels over the years. The bed in my  room was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, in my life! The hotel staff was wonderful and the room was very spacious.  I was told I was in the old part of the hotel and that the older rooms are bigger than the newer part. I love old, so for me to see the original hardware, etc., meant a lot to me.  When I return, and I will, I will request the same room or at least the floor. Love it, love it! Don't miss out on this great historic opportunity! In reading some of the other posts regarding the speed of the elevators...who cares? Really, are our lives that insanely rushed that one has to complain about the speed of an elevator? Life is the journey not the destination.  I have to add this from a ""fan"". "" If the elevator was taking them to see their maker, they would think the elevator was going too fast."" How profound. Let's reflect on that comment people.",Y
1860,My experience in this hotel was not very good. If you want a good W in chicago the lakeshore one is better. My room was looking into some other building and the bathroom has a weird setup. Not that great for a W. Lobby is pretty neat though and i love the bar here. Actually to my liking the bar here is better than at the Lakeshore.,N
980,"I stayed here in 2004 and thought it was incredible, and I was very excited to return. I was a little worried that I had overhyped it to myself, and it wouldn't quite live up to the expectations of the younger, more easily impressed me. I was wrong. The Amalfi is one of the best hotel experiences a person can possibly have (outside of the people who drop like 5k a night on rooms). Upon entering, the lobby is nice with music playing, and the checkin is very smooth. The rooms are great. The bed is the most comfortable bed I have ever been in. the mattress, sheets, pillows, everything. I can go on and on about these beds, they are that comfortable. Nice LCD TVs and they leave a few books and jazz CDs in your room which is really cool! I read they have a library of DVDs and CDs if you want. I didnt check out the minibar but from my last experience i think i really liked it. There's not much of a view, but who cares. Nice robe and slippers in the rooms also. The hotel as a gym which is basically a few treadmills, but it helps. USA today at your door every morning. Each floor has a breakfast station which is really cool. Juices, bagels, pastries, etc. The hotel as a complimentary happy hour also, from 530-7 with free alcohol (tip the bartender because they are very nice and hook you up) and some food. cheeses, foccaccia, salami, brushetta, etc. The $ for the hotel is very good for where it is. In the area, there are plenty of bars, grills, restaurants etc. For business travelers, its about a $7 cab ride to the sears tower. The hotel is perfect for business or for traveling to visit chicago with a spouse. I will definitely be returning here!",N
2054,"The best part about our room was the view.  Other than that, it was a little run-down.  If I had been staying for pleasure rather than business I would definitely have complained and/or requested a different room, but I just didn't have the time to deal with it.   Although I'm pretty picky about cleanliness, I think even some basic things were ignored.  The light switch in the bathroom was COVERED in grime and a layer of dust on top.  The bathroom sink was an undermount, and there was a ring of mold around the entire sink under the lip of the sink.  Ew.  Toilet wasn't cleaned thoroughly.  Ew.  The towels seemed old, and scratchy.   We were across from a housekeeping/laundry room where there always seemed to be several employees hanging out talking LOUDLY to each another.  Although the sound-proofing between rooms seems good, the sound from the hallway travels directly through the door.  It was like they were actually in the room with us.  Really annoying. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were not, despite their ""pillow menu.""  It's been a couple weeks since my stay and I still have a crick in my neck.  I think the bedding was fairly new, but it already looked worn. Overall I don't know if I'd stay here again.  The tip-able staff was nice, but the front desk folks were pretty morose.  And despite the renovation, the rooms were still shabby, just with new TVs and a pillow menu.",N
1485,"The Omni is geared toward business clientele.  It's all meat and potatoes, and very squared away.  Service is impeccable.  I was particularly needy when I discovered that I had lost my driver's license immediately after checkout.  Three staffers checked everything, including the cleaning people who by then had moved on from my room to another floor.  One evening, we had martinis in the onsite resto 676, which proved sophisticated and fun. On the down side, I would have been happier if our suite was not looking directly into new construction, or if the check-in people had alerted us to this detail.  But good for you, Omni, for finding great real estate right on the Miracle Mile.  It was a confortable two day stay, but as a leisure traveller, I will venture out to another property when I get back to Chicago.",N
81,"Perfect for a classy, understated event. Free parking, too. Sure helps when the host and hostess are the classy, driving force behind the event! (xoxoxoxo Lisa B and David!!)",N
999,"I travel to Chicago about once a month for work, and I always try to stay at the Amalfi if possible.  It is a boutique hotel (so no reward points), and the check-in area is a bit unconventional, but the service and amenities here are always great.  The rooms are on the small side, but they're adorably decorated and stocked with Aveda products.  I take *really* hot showers, and I've never had problems with the heat or water pressure here.  The workout room is very easy to find and set up nicely, with multiple treadmills, ellipticals, stationary bikes, and cable tv. During my first stay, I was surprised by the fact that there are no vending machines in the building.  The rooms are stocked with ungodly expensive designer bottled water, but luckily, there's a 7-11 right around the corner where you can grab your necessaries.  Room service comes from Harry Caray's across the street; it's not great, but there are plenty of better dinner options in the River North area within walking distance (I recommend eating at the bar at Frontera Grill).  I do appreciate their complimentary continental breakfast, which is available on every floor.  The selection isn't mind-blowing or anything, but you can get baked goods and fresh fruit, which is all I really ask for. The best part is that I've never had to spend over $179/night on a stay here!  The Amalfi's not the cheapest place in town, but if you do your research and get on their mailing list, you do tend to hear about their deals and specials.",N
1754,"Just a very nice gesture.  My wife and mentioned we were in Chicago for our 39th wedding anniversary, and when we got back to the room after going out for dinner, there was a bottle of champagne chilling in an ice bucket, plus two very nice champagne glasses and a congratulations note!  Now that's class!",N
92,"We stayed in the motor lodge for work and those rooms are just so so, kind of an old look but clean. The resturant Barklays is pretty nice, the food is good, but the female server wasn't all that friendly.",N
3253,"Nice. Convenient to millennium park and the mag mile.  Friendly staff. For the price that I paid - $119.00 - it was 4 stars.  However, there are other places in the immediate area that I would probably stay at first if the price were the ""normal"" in-season rates.",N
3894,"A few things... 1.  Price was good for location.  On Michigan Ave across from the park.  $139 per night is what I paid.  Overnight parking is $28, also pretty good for downtown Chicago.   2.  Room was small, but clean and well decorated.  I was on the 4th floor facing the parking garage across the alley.  Windows opened, so that was nice.  View, not so good and sort of noisy, but it's an alley and to be expected.  I'm not bothered by much, though. 3. No late night room service!  For me this is a downer.  I love getting room service at 2 a.m. and for a hotel in that area it is really a shame.  I did order room service, but I didn't feel the choices were that great.  I got chicken strips and fries, so it's hard to really judge...what do you expect.  I will say that Hardee's has better chicken strips.  These were over-breaded.  I think I paid $15 for an order of five with fries.  I understand room service comes with a cost, so I got what I expected. 4. No internet without extra charge.  This is something that really aggravates me about higher-end hotels.  I can go to the Super 8 and get free Internet service that works great, but then when I stay at ""better"" places they try to charge me $15-25 extra a day.  With the cost of Internet being what it is today, I know it isn't that costly and there are ways to secure it so not everyone is using it without being a guest.  I find it ridiculous.  I know there are some costs to the initial installation, etc. however, who doesn't use the internet?  I use my mobile hotspot on my Droid and it works fine, but I'm still grouchy about this and it's not just with this hotel.   5.  Service was friendly, but my room wasn't made up until 4:00 pm on the days I was there.  I just like to have it done while I'm out and not come back to the room and it still not be finished.  I know, it's a minor complaint, but that's what's important to me. Summary...for the price and the location I give it that.  I guess everything else falls under the, ""you get what you pay for"" line.  It is a nice, clean place and I didn't see any ghosts.",N
4508,"I was SO excited to spend a night at the fabled Palmer House this past spring!  My place of business had rented a room there so some of us could get changed after preparing for an event on Michigan Avenue, and I decided to crash there overnight before heading home the next morning.  The room was small. Very small.  But, okay, the Palmer House has been there since, when?  the late 1800's?  So I'll excuse the size of the room.  Decorating? Gauche. And NO FAN in the BATHROOM!  Imagine three women trying to shower, change, do hair in a postage stamp room when there's no fan in the bathroom.  All of the mirrors were fogged over.  NOT good.   After the event, I was ready for a great night's sleep. It was around 12:30 when I crawled into bed. At 1:45, someone started banging on the door across the hall, and yelling for ""LaShonda"" to wake up.  this went on for about three minutes, and, just as I was about to call security, LaShonda got out of bed, opened the door, explained that she was drunk and had puked all over the place, and let the door banger in.  I fell asleep again at about 2:30.  At 4AM, the guy in the room next to me decided it was time to call Mike and see if they could ""get some women.""  Bill, the other guy in Mike's friend's room, kept saying, ""It's 4 o'clock in the morning."" But Mike's friend, apparently had a deep need for a woman.  I didn't know whether to call the front desk or yell through the wall the suggestion that Mike's friend and Bill go across the hall and get LaShonda.  After about ten minutes, I heard the door bang and Bill and Mike's friend headed out onto the mean streets of Chicago to look for women.  Then, at about 7, the families started trundling down the hall with their wheeled suitcases and squeaky-voiced children.  This eventful night at the Palmer House set my company back $321.  Maybe they have extremely nice suites available for more than that, with sound proofing that really keeps you from hearing about LaShonda's puking or Mike's friend's need for women, but I would not go back. Ever.  We complained to the management, and they were unmoved.  So, in this case, you get 'way less than you pay for. Does not live up to hype or its storied history.",N
179,"I'm from a college town in central Ilinois. I travel a fair amount for twentysomething, and I was raised by a single mom without a ton of money to burn. So that's my perspective going into this. My mom was asked to come up to the city to have a corporate meeting and dinner with the suits afterwards. Since we're very close and I'll take any excuse to be in the city ('sup H&M and newly opened Topshop), she got the okay for me to come along. She was assured that the room was put on the company card and she wouldn't have to pay for it to be later reimbursed. She even got a printed confirmation of this, and the company card info. When we got there, this wasn't the case. I waited out front in the rain with the painfully friendly valet workers for a while and found out that they needed her to pay for the room after all, and it would only be straightened out once the corporate people got there. One of the employees wasn't too nice about it, and said that the refund could only be done by the manager the next morning. This was a lie, because a regular old employee did it anyway (still the next morning, however). The rooms are very spacious. There's a little kitchenette/minibar type situation (with no liquor, though, boo) with small appliances, a living room/office with a pullout couch, desk, chair, table, and a flatscreen. The bathroom is nice, and the shower has a tall showerhead (I'm almost six feet, rejoice). The bedroom is okay, with lots of pillows and another flatscreen. The brightness of the TVs auto adjusts to the light in the room, which I like. We were almost on the top floor, and when I was in my bed, I was looking right at the Hancock Building, which was across the street. WiFi costs $10 for 24 hours, which I did not see coming, and wasn't too happy about. Location is obviously fantastic, even if the closest train stop is slightly farther than convenient after a long day. If you can afford to stay here, you're probably not taking a train around town. At the end of the day, it was impressive in the ways it needs to be for its demographic. But for a college girl who knows the city like the back of her hand (read: just wants convenient trains to neighborhoods I care about, not to eat at the Cheesecake Factory and shop at Water Tower) and is used to free WiFi and breakfast in her hotel rooms, it left a few things to be desired. But hey, we didn't pay for it! Well technically we had to. But we got our money back the next day.",N
2485,"The World According to Noelle Allergic Girl's Guide to Life HOTEL We stayed at the Chicago Hilton for the majority of our December vacation. Valet, Front Desk, Concierge and Housekeeping staff were always friendly, helpful and efficient. We had a parlor suite that overlooked Grant Park- it was rather large and spacious. There were double doors that led to our suite. Upon entering one will note the bathroom on the left, walking a few more steps one will note the living room on the right with a large sofa, large comfy chair, coffee table and huge wet bar. The wet bar was full sized (with a sink and small fridge) something you would expect to see in someone's home. In the middle of the room was a large dresser with a huge television, built in the middle of the large dresser was a fridge w/ the hotel mini bar. On the left was our King bed and a few steps away from our bed was a large desk. Our room was rather larger. There were two heaters- one in our bedroom and the other in our sitting room. From our suite there were breathtakingly beautiful views of Grant Park and the Lake, everything was covered in a blanket of snow. They also had a cutesy gingerbread house not far from the Grand Ball room. Absolutely gorgeous Christmas Tree and other floral decorations throughout the hotel. RESTAURANT Upon our arrival we ordered room service. Apparently the menu we had in our room was old. We ordered burgers with blue cheese and dessert- apple tart and chocolate cake. The food came in a reasonable amount of time. I noticed our chocolate cake was not on our tray. When bringing this to the server's attention he said- ""No, you did not order chocolate cake."" My better half asked him to look at our ticket and low and behold we did order the chocolate cake. The server said sorry and left to get our cake. It took forever for the chocolate cake to arrive. Upon closer inspection of the apple tart- we noticed the tart portion was uncooked. We sent the apple tart back and ordered the apple pie. The apple pie was dropped off quickly. Upon careful inspection we noticed more than half the crust of the apple pie was missing. So we sent back the apple pie. They really did a mess-up job on the desserts. The customer service was lacking. We called room service to speak with a manager and the person who answered the phone said we were not allowed to speak to the manager. That is when we decided to call the front desk and speak with the general manager on duty. The GM took comped the entire dinner and was sorry for the problems we encountered. We decided to no longer order from room service. GIFT SHOP, ETC Medium sized filled with things that a traveler might forget to pack- floss, nail clippers, nail polish remover. They have a good selection of gifts that sport the name ""Chicago"". Customer service was friendly. They also have a FedEx located in the hotel. A WORD TO THE WISE For a hotel of this size you would expect free internet. That is not the case. Internet costs around $20.00 for a 24 hour period. Valet Parking is around $53 dollars a day. Self Parking is around $45 dollars a day. Noelle's Notes A beautiful and historic hotel. Presidents Obama and Kennedy have stayed here.",N
2909,"great hotel. comfortable beds, had the nicest gym in a hotel i've been too, . The pool was not working during my stay though, but they even have a balcony lounging area. Stayed on the 23rd or 24th floor I forget, but the window view I had was overlooking the river/ferrys/, and staring at some chicago university/college. Pretty gorgeous view.",N
1696,"Here is my pro/con list: Pro - Very nice decor - Free wine hour every evening - Nice location in the Loop - LCD TV - Very nice service staff - Free paper if you like Con - Horrible Internet (come on people, Internet needs to be standard, and I'm taking better than what I can get at home) - Rooms are small - They don't use a proper bottom sheet, so the sheets move all over the place (one of my biggest pet peeves)",N
3273,"Decent location for this part of Chicago. Nice room. Clean building. Staff was nice. Vibe is sort of douchey at the hotel bar, but whatever. I'm not a bottle service type guy. If you can get a good groupon deal or something like we did, go for it.",N
2524,"I stayed here in mid-February 2008 for 6 nights and was mildly satisfied with my stay.  There were some really nice aspects of the hotel counterbalanced by some major flaws which can result in an average rating at best. To start with the pros.... Hotel was very cheap (approx $100 a night).  Granted, it was the off season but this rate was considerably cheaper than many other Chicago hotels in the same class.  The Hilton was also very clean, fairly upscale and in a great location. Now onto the negatives.... First and foremost, the room was EXTREMELY dry.  The Tunisian Desert would seem humid compared to our room.  Every morning began with an extremely dry throat and feelings of impending nosebleeds.  I drank more fluids than a marathoner running in Hell.  We called maintenance to check out the heating system but they were not able to do anything to correct the situation.  We eventually ended up sleeping with the heat off, windows open and water filling every container in the room (ice bucket, all the cups, sink, bathtub.... etc). The second major problem was with the housekeeping staff.  They do an excellent job cleaning the rooms and keeping the hotel in great shape but they can be a major annoyance.  Every morning (even on Sunday), we were awoken by knocks from housekeeping before 10:30 AM.  There were privacy dials on the doors instead of the standard ""Do Not Disturb"" signs but the housekeeping staff obviously pays no attention to these at all.  Even better was the constant peddling of coffee... On several mornings, we had knocks on the door to ask if we needed coffee.  Again, the privacy knob was turned and we did not call for the coffee.  By the end of the stay, we had a growing stack of coffee packages which we never touched. If it was not for these few major flaws, I could see giving this hotel a 4.5 out of 5 but the way things stand, a feel that a 2 star rating is generous.",N
1047,"This place is located in a great area. It was easy to hang out at some of the new places like Trump Tower & Hilton Rooftop among other places. I stayed here based on a group rate for a wedding. The things I enjoyed were the free happy hour from 5:30-7 daily. The staff is extremely friendly. The rooms were very clean except for a couple noticeable stains on the chair which were gross and moving the trash again back near my clothes when I kept moving it away. The things I did not like were thin walls, slamming and kicking of doors early in the morning for the complimentary breakfast rush. It felt like it was never ending. The only relaxing time was after everyone went on with their day. Definitely not a place to go when you are jet lagged and can't handle the time difference. Beside the problems with the doors, I had a problem with my shower knob. It would slide from cool to extremely burning hot. I told the front desk but the problem was never solved and I stayed for 5 nights. I don't know if I would go back. I even asked specifically for a quiet room. When asking for a late check out, they do charge an additional fee.",N
5187,Great place to stay for a weekend. There are many businesses near by that is great while stay at Allegro Hotel. Highly recommend!,Y
3408,"This hotel is centrally located on Michigan Avenue right near all the shops (Apple store right next door, Walgreens right up the street, Trader Joe's & Garrett's Popcorn down two blocks).  Very convenient to load up on water and snacks for your room while you call Allerton Hotel your home for the duration of your stay in the Windy City. Between the six of us in our group, we had three different types of rooms.  I lucked out and paid $104/night for our king suite.  The guys had a two double bed room (decent size) and our other friends got a teeny-tiny queen size petite room.  It's all good though, we only picked this spot for the convenience of its location and the awesome deal we got through TravelZoo's website. I must say, this was the swiftest check-in and check-out at any hotel I've been at. When we arrived at 2:00 after taking a cab from Chicago Midway, we were quickly greeted by the front desk and was able to check into our room right away.  Awesome. We hung out at the lounge a few times to grab a cocktail and some happy hour food. Five stars for having a $5 menu and for having nightly drink specials.   I loved the $5 flavored-vodka special they had on a particular night. The room was kept clean so no complaints there.  We had our own mobile hot spot device so we didn't have to pay to have wifi access in our room, but getting a strong signal between all the buildings was quite the challenge.  Oh well, free wifi in the lounge if you ask the front desk for the access code. Overall, I loved the Allerton Hotel.  I have no complaints since it served its purpose well in the four nights we stayed there and provided a great deal that fit within our budget.  The room wasn't big enough to store a dresser, so I ended up keeping most of my clothes in my suitcase since I had no where else to put it.  Oh well, I still managed. If I return back to Chicago, I know I would not hesitate to stay here again.",N
205,"Okay, this is a toughie... because the hotel itself was pretty nice, and definitely a convenient location, pool/hot tub/sauna, comfy beds... the problem really came to the service.  The rooms were not cleaned until late afternoon/early evening. Not really a problem, just later than I'm used to, and really we only needed some necessities replaced. However, towels were not replaced (even after calling to ask for new ones). Toilet paper was not stocked (we assumed there'd be some somewhere in the room if they didn't replace the empty roll... we were wrong). When we asked for a mini fridge to be brought up to the room, we were told it wouldn't be a problem. It never came and we had to call 3 times before it was finally brought up to the room. We waited nearly 30 min for valet to bring around the car after being told it would be 15 min... normally I'm patient, but when given an expected wait time, I tend to count that it's accurate. It only made things worse when we were completely ignored while we were waiting. It would have made things slightly better it some one would have at least come up to say 'we apologize for the wait.' (One last side note on the cleaning, on the last day there, on doing a final check of the room to make sure everyone had their things, I discovered a random shoe of unknown origin... just one... who knows how long it had been there).  Overall, it's a nice hotel, and -very- convenient. Just be prepared for repeated calls to get what you want.",N
5551,"This is the best La Quinta we have stayed at so far in the USA! The rooms are brand new, the staff is so friendly and accomodating and they are PET FRIENDLY! We appreciate clean rooms and great service and are LOYAL La Quinta guests, but this location is exceptional! Great value and great location!",N
4059,"Great hotel in the middle of the Chi-town action! I had a beautiful room with a great view of the Chicago river and North Michigan avenue. My hotel room was an ample size for one person and came with standard amenities, including a comfy bed and coffee that housekeeping replenished each day. As a Hyatt Gold Passport member, I got the Wall Street Journal delivered to my door every morning, which saved me the trouble of rushing downstairs to pick up a complimentary copy before the business class crew totally swiped every last one. The hotel has bars, restaurants, snack and gift shops on-site, so you technically never have to leave the hotel, but who wants to be cooped up inside all day when the hotel is in the center of everything? Shopping, jazz clubs, boat cruises, restaurants, and great sightseeing are all within walking distance. There are tons of tourists and locals out at night time so I found it completely safe to walk around the neighborhood when the sun went down. The customer service at the hotel is excellent! The hotel staff assisted me with everything I needed in record time. I would definitely stay here again!",N
3288,"Excellent service, all employees so nice and friendly.  Treat you like a rock star (sorry to sound cliche).  Rooms are loads of fun...instead of cheesy hotel artwork, there's photos of your favorite rock stars and memorabilia.  Awesome HDTVs in rooms. Location is great. Hotel is really neat.  I would say only for 60 years old and younger.  Views are great if you stay in the tower. I also tried out a few awesome Gibson guitars (for free) that the Hard Rock has for guests to use.  I know there's a ton to do in Chicago and I did it, but c'mon, this is fun stuff and can be done in between sight-seeing, before dinner, etc. Only negatives: Lighting could have been better in the room...especially at night! AND, be careful to not touch or move anything in the in-room bar like the snacks, sodas,etc.  A sensor will say that you ate/drank an item when you didn't.  I wanted to put a water bottle in the fridge and moved items to do so!  It supposedly happens all the time, but the front desk should warn you about that as $50 of extra charges were on my bill when I took nothing!  The front desk removed the charges and understood what happened.",N
148,"I was kicked out of my condo one night (long story) and had to find a place in the city to stay, so I thought I'd treat myself to a four-star hotel. Despite my better judgment, I went to HotWire and selected a ""blind"" 4-star at $159/night in the Streeterville area, which turned out to be the Whitehall. As other reviewers have noted, this is a clean hotel with friendly service and I have no doubt that 70 years ago it was one of the top hotels in the city. Unfortunately it has remained largely in its original state. The beds are comfy, the pillows are fluffy, but the place is extremely out-dated; almost as if you'd walked into a time machine. The elevators are tiny, bordering on claustrophobic, and if more than two people are attempting a ride, they will all become much better acquainted than they might have liked. The hallways are equally confining; narrow, dark, a little depressing. The rooms aren't large, there's no wireless Internet, the lamps are original fixtures with unchanged (and probably untested) circuitry-- as confirmed by a quirky switch on one in my room, that refused to turn on without some coaxing. Similarly, the bathroom telephone had a poor connection. Worst of all, my room smelled of decades of cigarette smoke. Horrible. The decor is somewhat dreary, definitely not warm. All of these are symptoms of a hotel begging to be upgraded. On the plus side, the location is great, my room was quiet, the staff was friendly, and the price was right-- although next time, I'll select the hotel myself, pay the additional premium for the privilege, and enjoy it perhaps a little more. This is definitely not the place to stay if you want something light, modern, and cheerful.",N
155,"I will keep this short & sweet...  Chicago is a beautiful, clean city!  As far as our hotel stay for a week not so beautiful.  The bed was very comfortable, but the room felt dirty.  We were supposedly upgraded to a room with peeling wall paper and very scuffed up furniture and walls.  I wouldn't consider that an upgrade.  The location and beautiful city, good company of my significant other and bed were about all that I remember.",N
5476,"This fine property is in the Gold Coast/Rush Street area. The hotel is not that large as far as number of rooms, yet it is contained in a glossy highrise. Its nice rooms have a cool and contemporary look to them, and each bathroom has a bathtub and a separate glass shower stall. The modern lobby is smallish, but perhaps to push you towards its extremely popular Whiskey Bar & Grill.",N
3907,"Hotel Bar Review: I had, quite possibly, the worst bottle of wine to ever cross my lips at the bar attached to the Congress Plaza Hotel.  In case you're wondering, it was a 2008 Parducci Pinot Noir.  Avoid it at all costs.  And the cost?  Over 40 bones.  Bogus. Other than that, you're just looking at a boring, lame, empty and if I'm being honest, too brightly lit hotel bar. No thanks.",N
3296,"I'm glad I was only here for one night! The place is advertised as a four star hotel, but it felt more like a 3star to me.  Maybe that is because I had just checked out of the Westin in Minneapolis and had a truly 4 star hotel to compare to.  Don't get me wrong, the place tries--they have minibars and 24 hour room service, as well as a fancy remodel. But they just can't help that the building they remodeled is old and dumpy, and some aspect of that character still shows through the remodel.  The spa and fitness club were a couple of rooms in a dark windowless basement with low lighting and no locker room I could find--not at all spa like.  The rooms were clean, though, and the place was generally fine. I guess I just expected more--but hey, you get what you pay for and hard rock is a pretty cheap option in a city like Chicago.",N
3322,"Solid hotel, if you can get a good price online. It's in a very old building, converted to a modern hotel a few years back. This is evident with some of the structure inside, but they did a great job with decorating, etc. Great sheets/beds and modern feel to the rooms. Ask for a city or river view for some great pics right from your room. Perfect location for MI Ave area. Valet has always been very prompt (especially compared to some other hotels in the area).",N
4561,"Location, Location Location!!  This very historic hotel is a truly unique experience, especially if you are a history buff.  The hotel is only a block away from the Chicago Art Institute and less than two miles from almost all the down town attractions.  We paid a little more and stayed on the executive floor where you receive a continental breakfast, drinks and snacks throughout the day, and appetizers in the evening.  They also have bar service on the floor until 10:00 PM each night.  Don't expect much from the food on the executive floor, it's cereal, muffins, hardboiled eggs and such.  It is really nice to be able to grab a drink without going down to the lobby or paying five bucks for a coke in the vending machine.  However, I wouldn't count breakfast here as a full meal.  The lobby and overall decor of the hotel is phenomenal with authentic Art-Deco styling's.  This isn't faux reproductions as displayed in Vegas or other hotels. It's the real deal.  The current version of the Palmer House opened in 1925 but it's origins date back to 1871.  Even if you don't stay here, stop by and have a martini at the lobby bar.  Soak up the atmosphere around you.  Think of all the history that has passed though this lobby and the people that have had a drink at this bar.  The roaring 20's, Black Friday 1929, WW II, heck it is even quite possible that Al Capone and his henchmen had a drink at this bar.  The rooms are small by modern standards and the bathrooms are very small.  Remember this hotel was built in 1925, and at that time these were large rooms.  The water pressure in the shower was very low but again this is a historic hotel and we were on the top floor.  As with most Hilton properties the bed is very comfortable.  Down pillows and comforters are always a hit in my book.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  I feel that the bellmen and doormen outshined the rest of the staff I came in contact with.  They were sincerely friendly, funny and helpful.  During our departure, our bellman ran out into traffic on State Street to hail us a taxi.  It almost looked like a cop commandeering a car during a police chase.  I would most definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone doing the tourist thing in Chicago, especially if you are a history buff.",N
2875,"Before arriving to Chicago, I had called the front desk to ensure that there was a shuttle running from O'Hare to the hotel. The employee who took my call assured me there was a shuttle and that it ran 24 hours - although this was contrary to the hotel's website, I took her word for it. Flash forward - I land at 11pm, am outrageously tired and navigate the terminal to find the shuttle service (which is quite a trek). No shuttle there. I call the hotel to ask if there's a schedule or something, and the woman on the phone laughs and says ""the shuttle stops running at 7:45pm."" Needless to say, I was not happy. Sheraton must have a sixth sense that involves knowledge that I like to write about things on Yelp, because when I checked in, they upgraded me for free to one of the fancier floors with a view of the lake. No free internet, though AND I still had to pay $12 a day for the gym (are you serious). Unlimited membership throughout your stay will set you back $20. The bed was very comfortable and climate control (aka making the room nice and toasty) was intuitive and functioned properly. As a New Yorker, I am pretty used to walking everywhere. Even by my standards, the walk to and from public transportation was a little bit long - 10 to 15 minutes depending on which L train you're taking or the Metra. Good thing is, quite a few L lines are in the vicinity of the hotel. Downtown gets pretty dead at night, so it's not the place to stay if you like to party or enjoy nightlife. 3.5 stars.",N
1865,"this review is for happy hour only. I enjoyed the vibe (too cool for school) and the drinks, though expensive (standard downtown $12+ for martinis) were good.  An A for decor and atmosphere.  bar area is small but very hip.",N
2757,"I had a excellent experience at The James Hotel.  My number one problem that I have when traveling is that I can't find a hotel that will except a rottweiler.  Sure, they'll advertise they are pet friendly, but what they really mean is only lap dogs are allowed.  The James Hotel accepts all breed and has no weight restriction with pets.  The rooms were ultra modern and cozy.  As for their bed, it's awesome.  Its also in the heart of the city and if you don't mind walking, you definitely don't need to hail a cab.  I would love to stay there again...in a heartbeat.  Very pricey...be warned!  But I guess you get what you pay for.",N
5449,"Overall, nice room but with some quirks. I checked in to this hotel for a 8 night stay. When I got to the front desk, they didn't have my reservation. Great. Luckily, I had my Expedia confirmation page and everything was squared away. My room was on the 6th floor and had a view of nothing great, just the nearby neighborhood of condos and Rush St. below. The room was pretty spacious. It had a decent size closet, king size bed, desk, dresser with TV on top, mini bar, and a lounge chair with an ottoman. Closet had an extra pillow, lots of hangers, and laundry bags. The bathroom was very nice. It had 1 sink, a toilet (yes, obvious), a shower, and a separate bath tub. They had a lot of towels in there and also a terry cloth robe for use. There was also shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, body lotion, and 2 different bars of soap (one was aloe and the other was oatmeal I think). The maid was always good about replenishing the supply of bath goodies everyday. I liked that. They also had a hair drier for guest use. Wi-fi is not free and there is a daily rate. However, you can get free internet just by signing up as a member of the Sutton Hotel hotels. Signing up to be a member is free and you can do this on their website. When I was setting up my laptop, I called down to the front desk and told them I had a membership and they gave me the code for the Wi-fi. Pretty simple. Maid service was great here. They always did my room in a timely manner, did the bed, put fresh towels, and refilled on the bath goodies. Fantastic! So with the above, I would have given this place 4 stars but not everything was that great. I had a huge issue with the bedding. The bedding consisted of 4 huge pillows (awesome), a mattress cover, and a thin comforter. Where were the rest of the sheets? During my stay, Chicago was in the 40's to the 50's at night, and I had a hard time sleeping because I was freezing my ass off. I had to get up and turn the heat up to 77 just to get comfortable enough to sleep. Another issue was the Wi-fi. It was very weak. I couldn't even load two pages simultaneously. Annoying. The shower in the bathroom was also an issue in that it leaked water. I'm not even sure from where it leaked, however the first time I used it and I got out, there was water that ran all over the floor and then on to the carpet at the bathroom doorway. From the stain on the carpet outside the bathroom door, I could see that I wasn't the first guest that had this issue. I used the shower only once because of this and just stuck to baths (which isn't bad) the rest of my stay. Location was pretty good. It was in between 2 Red line stations so it was easy to get on the L and go around the city. It's also fairly close to the John Hancock Observatory and the shops on Michigan Ave. Overall, it was a good value when booking through Expedia in advance. Can't say I would stay here again though.",N
4054,"This is one of my favorite places to stay while in Chicago. The service is always superb- friendly, warm and most importantly, helpful throughout the whole stay. They especially treat their platinum members with additional care and make certain that all needs and requests are met. The rooms are better than average. I do feel they could update their bathrooms to make them a bit larger, but the two bed suite or kind bed suites are always spacious and great. The staff is lovely and other than some of the housekeepers being a bit rude, I find this hotel to be luxurious and wonderful for a short stay!",N
5250,"This was a great hotel. Service and amenities were excellent. Parking was reasonably priced. The location was fine - didn't feel at all unsafe, but we were glad we had our car because there weren't many good restaurants within walking distance. We got a really good rate on Priceline, which made our stay seem that much better. Highly recommended.",Y
4877,"I stayed in this hotel last night, and felt compelled to write a review. I was at the hotel on business for one night. Upon arriving I was struck by the nostalgic feel. I said to myself ""this place must have some great history"", and went to the Internet. First thing that came up was that it was haunted. Great. I'm not into that kind of stuff and have no desire to experience it, so quickly became less enthused with the prospect of staying there. It was already 10:30 PM though so I didn't have a lot of choice. First, the hotel itself: I was greeted warmly by the check-in staff, and enjoyed chatting with her. I was put on the 10th floor of the south tower. I had no problems with the elevators whatsoever. The corridors looked vintage; it was like a flashback in time. Kinda cool. Ditto for when I entered the room. It had a classic look to it: crown molding that had been over painted through the years, older wallpaper but which had the hotel's logo, a pedestal sink in the bath. Certainly nothing fancy but at the same time everything you need. Ample work space, a flat screen tv mounted on the wall, and the bed was a little hard but nothing bad. My view of the lake was spectacular. The only problem I had was the noise from the street. It was a Monday night but there seemed to be a lot of vehicle activity. Busses, trucks, loud motorcycles, cars with their radio jamming, the L-train. I heard it all until around 2:00AM or so, which surprised me a bit since I was on the 10th floor. So did I see any paranormal activity? Nothing I saw, but two times just as I was drifting off to sleep I hear the faucet in the bathroom start for 5 seconds or so and then turn off. The first time I layer there frozen. I started to drift off again and about an hour later I heard it again. This time sprang out of bed, ran to the bathroom and turned off the light. I saw nothing. I took a towel and dried out the sink; if it happened again and I went in there and it was wet, then I would know for sure something was up. It didn't happen again. So I will let you make up your own mind as to what it was, but I am 99% sure that it wasn't the toilet running or coming from another room. In short, it freaked me out a bit. In summary, I thought it was a nice hotel that just felt kinda dead. There just weren't a lot of people there and the place felt empty. Of course it was a Monday night. Anyway, I won't stay there again, but solely because of the whole haunted thing. I'm just not into that. If that doesn't bother you then I would go for it. It's a nice slice of history situated in a great location.",Y
3859,"I've never reviewed a hotel before, but this experience has been so fantastic in every detail that I wanted to reciprocate in kind.  I arrived in a stress situation (my original hotel had blown it with my reservation) and from the moment landed at  Dana, everything was better.  From the incredibly helpful doorman to the reception staff, from the dynamic textural surfaces of the floors, walls, and ceilings to the artful food for breakfast, from the rain showers to the incredibly delicious beds, every single detail has been exemplary.  Sometimes you can stay in hip hotels and feel like you have landed in the home of the terminally hip.  At Dana, you feel like you have landed in what life should look like at all times.  Tonight I try the spa, and imagine it will be as excellent as the rest of the experience.",N
1718,"I'm a fan.  I was looking for a business hotel for one night in central Chicago. First the location is great.  2 blocks from the Blue Line metro stop which runs straight for the airport.  It's close to Millenium Park where I'm going jogging in the morning, and close to the offices of the businesses I'm visiting. The hotel has been recently remodeled and upgraded.  The lobby is plush and comfy; the $109 room I got from http://Kayak.com was clean, modern, although not super big. Surprisingly this was the 2nd least expensive option available.  The cheapest option had abysmal Yelp reviews, everything else for $30 or $40 more didn't have stellar reviews either.  Allegro is a good middle of the road choice for the casual business traveler. What I also liked, and which prompted me to give the 5-start rating, is that they didn't nickle and dime me for things that should be a commodity.  I can't stand it when hotels charge me $10+ for 24 hours of wireless access.  The Allegro has free wireless if you sign up for their (free) customer loyalty program.  That's a fair trade.  Same with things like toothbrushes.  I'm always annoyed when I stay at a $150+ a night place and they charge me $5 for toothpaste.  That's just ridiculous.  The Allegro actually has a list posted in the bathroom of the toiletry items that are free (all the most common ones are) and the ones they charge for like nail clippers.  And the fee is moderate too. Tumbs up also for the fluffy duvets and super comfortable bed. It seems run by conscious people that care about the customer experience.  Recommended.",N
3539,"I recently stayed at the Avenue for 4 nights and I really enjoyed my stay. When I first got there I was upgraded to a suite from my regular room because my boyfriend and I were celebrating our anniversary. We had a great room 2615 which had a great view of the Chicago Skyline which I would look at as I fell asleep in our giant king size bed. The room was also on a corner so our bedroom was very bright when we had the curtains open. The room also had a lot of closet space, one in the livingroom and a walk in closet in the bedroom. I dont know what people are saying about the TV channels.... there were plenty... 50+ so either they upgraded their cable or I think 50+ channels is enough in a hotel... since you're not there to watch tv on vacation right? The only thing that might annoy people is that Northwestern University Hospital is across the street so ambulances come and go all the time with sirens on. It didnt bother me at all but I am a sound sleeper. But I also live i a big city and am use to sirens all the time. The rooftop pool was awesome. I went everyday and it was really warm... 70F or 20C. Great view from up there too. The only real issue I had was with room service. I ordered a french onion soup which was delicious and a garden salad which in the room service menu said it was with mesculn greens, tomato, cucumber and croutons. When it arrived to my dismay it was the non nutritional heart of romaine lettuce and most of the pieces were white and it did not have croutons. When I told the front desk they looked into it which I was happy about. Later she told me that room service said I got what I had asked for which I certainly did not... I know what the menu said and it did not match what arrived at my room. I was happy that the concierge took it off my bill but they did not include the 20% charge that goes on the $5.50 they took off my bill. I was not wanting to overcomplain so I am yelping you to advise you not to order the garden salad from room service. Special shout out to our housekeeper Elizabetha. She was amazing friendly and engaging. I love her, shes really doing a great job. I would stay here again for sure.",N
4101,"The Hyatt is a nice hotel.  The setup is a bit strange.  We stayed in the west tower and we came to find most of the amenities in the east tower.  So that was a minor inconvenience.  Some of the amenities that were in the east tower that we used/ visited were the big bar, the bistro at 151, Stay Fit fitness center, J's Express, and the gift shop.  Essentially all of the amenities we used. The room was nice.  The only annoying thing about the room was the lighting.  There was no centralized lighting.  The staff was very nice and courteous. Would we stay again? Probably not, because there are so many other nice hotels in Downtown Chicago that we have yet to try.  By no means is this a knock of the Hyatt.",N
2939,"Overall the experience here was a good one. I spent three nights in a room facing the lake on the 26th floor. I wasn't supremely impressed by the rooms but they were clean and had a coffee maker and comfy beds. For the rates I ended up paying, this hotel was pretty good.",N
640,"Awesome hotel, good location and deal. Playstation in the room!!!  Free wi-fi if you go into the lounge downstairs, I guess that's cute so people can socialize.  Great during our Holiday trip to Chi town!",N
3963,"I visited Chicago the weekend of May 20-23, 2011 and stayed at the Congress Plaza Hotel. The hotel is being picketed by union workers and has been for the past 8 years. While the hotel is historic, it's run down. My room was neat & clean, but the carpet was ratty, featured old paint and the bathroom painfully tiny. My room faced Grant Park and I heard all the traffic on Michigan Avenue. There was a protest happening across the street which made it tough to nap Saturday afternoon. Saturday night, The Congress Plaza Hotel hosted a local prom and as you can imagine, the place was humming with giggling teenagers. Lastly, I paid with a debit card. They overcharged my debit card to cover any incidentals, which there weren't. They rang up an additional $110 which wasn't credited back to my card for 72 hours. There must be better, cleaner, and quieter places to stay in Chicago.",N
1447,"Alright, I've stayed here a few times. Here is what's going on at this swank joint on the Mag Mile: I'm going to say I do NOT recommend making this reservation via Priceline or Travelocity or a site of the type. You will end up getting their ""Studio"" room which isn't really given in ANY of the room descriptions (as it different GREATLY from the regular one rooms that others will get. I learned this my first time staying. Needless to say, I was not happy that I wasn't getting the room type I had asked for. I spoke with their CS Rep online and wasn't given any remedy to make it right. Worst customer service call experience I ever had. Finally, the hotel manager offered a consolation to the misunderstanding. Before you book, also, make sure you save up for their Guest Rewards Programn, which entitles you to several freebies. The rooms are SWANKY! Very nice indeed. Modern furniture and the bed will make you just want to sink in it and never get up. Heck, you even get ROBES! The restaurant they have there is nice. Nice decor, decent food....but pricey. But hey, let's face it, if you're staying here, you're obviously not broke. Hotel staff is generally very helpful in anything you need, so don't be afraid to ask them. I had all my requests taken care of. It's prime location for all your shopping needs. My SO (Significant Other) was pleased with the location and was poised to make this spot for our stay as it is so close to so many retail stores. Downers about this place? The access to the lobby and elevators. They are on the 2nd floor which requires an elevator to get to. It's weird. Also, I'd like better customer service. Mine wasn't bad....but I've had better. I'm paying good money for this hotel so I'd expect excellent customer service.",N
5828,"Would recommend this hotel to anyone.  My wife's sister booked us a room at Crown Plaza thru her work.  The address we were given was 733 w Madison, upon arrival we find out that our reservations were actually in Skokie, Kurtis the front desk worker was awesome in helping my wife and I figure it  out, then got us in contact with his manager, who cancelled our reservations at the other hotel and got us rooms, right there off the loop.  Clean rooms, great service, 5 block walk to either set of trains, and access to Greek town, and great food, and service.",Y
2395,"As an out of towner, this was a lovely place to stay for a short trip.  There were tons of pubs and restaurants within walking distance, not to mention the park.  The room was clean, the amenities were about what you'd expect for a Hilton, and the beds were like clouds!  Be careful though, the parking situation is pricey - $45 to do it yourself and almost $60 to valet per night.  If you find the Hilton through a bargain website, make sure to add parking to your price.   *tip* if you DID happen to valet, don't pay to have the hotel hold on to your bags during that extra time after check out if you still want to see a little more of the city before you leave - the valet folks will bring your car around, put your bags in, and then park it again so you can explore baggage free.",N
1104,"I spent the fourth of July weekend here and I enjoyed my stay immensely.  The Fairmont is an ideal location for an out-of-town visitor.  It is on a very traffic street itself, but surprisingly central to everywhere you want to go.  I ate in Aria and enjoyed my dinner very much.  The staff were invariably friendly and competent.  I was upgraded to the Gold Level and enjoyed mytime in the Gold Lounge.  Christopher is a super nice guy and will do all he can to accommodate your request.  The room was clean and spacious.  The bathroom was just beautiful and there was a nice roomy closet.  I was very satisfied.  Join the President's Club and wifi is free with the room.",N
3070,"As a Starwood whore I never miss a chance to stay at a different W.  The rooms are a little on the tight side.  The bar is well done, roomy and flows nicely into the living room.  Scene is what you would expect..tools wearing sunglasses inside with anorexic sacks of skin stuck to their arms. Great views of the lake and Navy Pier.",N
5439,"I guess if you're as poor as me it'll do... but honestly you might be just as safe sleeping outside. It really looked like something out of a horror film. The door didn't lock, the windows were held together with duct tape, there were stains on everything, the water runs yellow for about 30 seconds after you turn it on, and the hallway and elevators smell like urine. But the toilet was very clean and the staff were friendly. It's quite an experience and it's something to tell your friends about later.",Y
5040,"I'm not really into the W-thing.  I've stayed in some W's in the past that didn't pass muster, so I wasn't expecting much and ended up being pleasantly surprised.  I prefer classy older hotels over urban hip establishments.  But, having said that, I actually enjoyed my recent stay here while attending a medical convention.  Overall, this hotel suited my needs as a business traveller.  I was greeted very warmly by the receptionist upon check in .  The lobby was contemporary/ minimalist, but beautifully decorated with flowers and candles that made a good first impression.  I found my room to be pretty standard business class, but the bed was extremely comfortable with thick down pillows and eqyptian cotton sheets.  The room had a full mini-bar, an LG flat screen TV, DVD player (hotel had a nice video library that I did not sample), an IPod docking station, nice bath robe, bliss bath toilettries, and 24-hr room service.  As a single traveller, I did not mind the window with shutters that opened to the bedroom from the bath.  I actually liked to have the shutters open so that I could watch TV from the bathroom while brushing my teeth in the morning.   The elevator ride down to the lobby was usually awkward in the morning, as strangers in business attire crammed in next to me in this dimly lit minidisco with piped in sexy disco musak. The entire lobby turned into a night club on most evenings during my stay.  It was a lively scene, and I found that my colleagues were all eager to participate.  We tried the restaurant ""Wave"" for lunch and dinner and I would highly recommend it.  I sampled many of the dishes from the tapas-style menu and they were excellent, including hummus, spinach and feta pastries, flank steak, and octopus.    The hotel is conveniently located a few short blocks from Michigan ave with it's fantastic shops and restaurants.  Overall, I enjoyed my stay and would probably stay here again.",Y
3002,"Stayed over the Christmas Holiday this year! This place is HOT! Friendly helpful service! Upgraded to a suite with a great view! Had some family over for pre dinner drinks and appetizers, room service was fast and efficient and the food recommendations were out of this world! I highly recommend the W-Lakeshore when in Chicago!",N
4175,"I've stayed here with my boyfriend on two different occasions when we were in Chicago and didn't want to drive back to the suburbs or sleep on our friend's couch. Both times the room was comfortable, clean, and had great views of the river and surrounding buildings. We had drinks and the Spanish pizza from the big bar. My martini (my yelp picture) was giant, probably had about 4 shots in it too. I was definitely feeling a buzz after that. I would recommend staying here to anyone looking for accommodations under $200/night in the city.",N
700,"I had my wedding at the Courtyard Marriott and it was great.  The Marriott hasn't done too many weddings so I was really afraid to put my trust in them, but the end result was amazing.  Looking back on my photos just confirms it.  My guests can't believe how great the food was.  We had our ceremony and reception at the Courtyard, the reception was in Viand (the restaurant in the hotel), which is a perfect set up for a smaller wedding.  There is a new events coordinator who came in at the tail end of the planning (mine left with barely any notice- Bride's worse nightmare) but she seems to really ""get it"" and will probably help build their portfolio of weddings. Michelle and Melissa in Sales were great.  The hotel just renovated most, if not all of it's rooms and all of our guests loved it.  They gave us great upgrades as well. The banquet captain, Alfredo definitely worked with us to make the day great which is the key thing to find in a venue. The food again...amazing! One of my guests when they RSVP'd wrote ""best menu option ever"".",N
2045,"I had my wedding here and it was AMAZING! Everything from the moment I viewed the space through writing the last check was a fantastic experience. Barbara Martin is incredible. She is so calm, professional, attentive, and relaxed me whenever I spoke with her. The food is great, and the view from the ballroom takes your breath away! I had a 5:00 November wedding ceremony and reception here and everyone could not stop talking about how fabulous it was. I was so happy I decided to get married here. The Cityscape bar is great, great views too. You can go straight to the merchandise mart and never go outside, which is great for elderly guests and also makes for great pictures. AND the Bridal Suite is soooooo cool. It's two stories and has spiral staircase. I felt so special all weekend. I can't gush enough about how fantastic, incredible, and special my wedding weekend here was! You will not regret working with Barbara and the Holiday Inn for your event!",N
1094,"This Fairmont certainly one-ups it here. Large clean rooms with actually tasteful decor. Marbled bathrooms with a huge shower n' bath. Plush robes. Miller Harris toiletries. NY times paper at your door. Free hotel valet during our stay and the most random phone near your toilet should need room service from there? Our package also included a $100 Saks card which was pure heaven for me aside from the fantastic hotel services. The valet service can be hit or miss some nights - having to track someone down can be a pill. The other amenities include (but we didn't use) a great spa that was open almost 24 hours daily. Pool n' work out room for $10 bucks all day pass. The hotel is also a little ways away from the shopping, so if you plan to hit the Mile then be prepared to do some walking. Overall no complaints, fantastic hotel and would stay again and again.",N
1053,You get what you pay for. Cheap price and cheap hotel. The building is falling into disrepair but the staff is nice and the beds comfortable.,N

1561,"I booked a room at this hotel prior to reading the reviews and was a little nervous rolling in. I have no idea what half of these reviews are talking about. Parking: its downtown Chicago, deal with it. Every hotel I have stayed at downtown charged at least $35 a night, so they aren't out of line. I stopped by a few self parks near by, and there was almost no savings, so I just valeted every night. Plus you get in and out. Elevators: Either they changed this problem, or other people stayed at a different hotel then I did. It was a concern of mine after reading the reviews so I made sure to time them. The longest wait I had was 45 seconds. They had 4 elevators 2 serving the first half and 2 serving the other. It worked well. Rooms: Mine I believe was an older one. It was still clean, fairly updated, and without any complaints. My view was of some surrounding buildings and a bit of Michigan Ave, but I didn't care. The location is stellar (within a short walk to every el line in the city), and the price is right. If you're not a chain hotel points whore or some super high maintenance jerk,  you should have no problem staying here.",N
3281,"Stayed at the hard rock hotel because the W was full and it was a good, central location. The rooms are nice and roomy though the hotel itself is quite cheeseball. Not overtly tacky but just being there left me feeling a bit of a poseur surrounded by impostors. The guys at the front desk were friendly and flirtatious and full of information. There were absolutely no mishaps despite my preference to pay in cash up front. The rooms are large. The bed is super comfy. Pillows were perfect. The bathroom was nice but no tub.  I could see the Bean and Millenium Park through my window (and through the skyscrapers). If it wasn't a cheesy hard rock hotel I'd highly recommend it.",N
4199,"Great location. I can walk to just about all the major attractions in Chicago. As for the hotel itself, it's no W but it tries. It's more of a trendy business hotel. I stayed in a double room that was pretty updated looking. Service at the concierge was pretty friendly as well.",N
3274,The rooms are badazz! The view from the room is even better! The fitness room has bottled water and a fruit table.,N
4208,"#1 choice in Chicago, it has the best of everything and close to the Mag Mile... great for jogging along the river and hitting other hot spots.",N
3338,"Definitely a cool place to stay, good music in the lobby and very modern feel to the rooms.  Stayed in a corner suite. However, went during very cold weekend in Chicago.  The heater in the bathroom wasn't working.  When we contacted management, they were not very helpful - they were willing to have us switch rooms, but would not offer a discount on the room, nor did they offer an upgrade for our inconvenience. Also, we had called to add on an additional night to our reservation prior to arriving.  Well, they actually made another reservation for the last night, so when we came back to our room after a long day, our key did not work. The front desk had not bothered to tell us that we would have to get a new key because they didn't add another night to our existing reservation but made an additional reservation for the extra night (which also meant we had to pay 2 separate bills). Finally, they have a very cool check in/rock out program where you can pick a guitar from the catalog to play with in the room.  However, after making a big deal about be getting to choose which guitar I could try, they brought the wrong guitar to my room. Overall, the view was great, location was good; but for the price, I felt like everything in the room should work (especially the heater), and management could definitely have been better.",N
5200,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.  I arrived at 3:45, check in is listed at 3 p.m.  I had booked a non-smoking room.  The smiling girl at the desk informed me that there were no non-smoking rooms available, but for an upgrade i could pay an extra $20 (i was already paying $200, nice 10% add on Hotel 71).  I declined the upgrade and informed her that i'd booked a n/s room and that's what i wanted... so she said i could wait 45 minutes while they ionized my room to get rid of the smoke smell.  i was tired.  fine, i'll try it.  my wife and i returned to our room around 9:30 to chill out.  The tub was broken so my wife couldn't take a bath.  They had booked us in a room at the end of the hall with the entire rest of the floor booked to a wedding party.  We were up all night.  People in and out of their rooms, slamming doors, knocking on doors being loud...oh and now the smoke smell was re-emerging in our room.  finally at 1:30 in the a.m. i called the front desk, i couldn't take it.  Miraculously, now there was a N/S room available at no extra charge.  They sent up a security guard who just handed me a new room key and left.  No help w/ our bags or anything for the 1:30 IN THE MORNING ROOM MOVE!  They wanted to make me feel  better by giving me free breakfast.  When i checked  out the next morning, the counter girl said 'you're all set'  without giving me a receipt. after i requested the receipt and checked it.-- $50 room service fee for the 'free' breakfast they promised.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.",Y
4509,"Fabulous!!  They now have a Starbucks in the building for coffee in the morning!!  The lobby bar is a gorgeous place to go and just relax.  It almost makes you want to put on that ballgown and head to a party.  The rooms are very comfortable, the beds felt so cozy, and all the extra pillows made everything feel like home.  It seems as if everything is within walking distance, or at least a short cab ride away.  The history of the building is seen in every turn, and it is exquisite.  I could live in this hotel.  It is one of my favorites.",N
5642,this is a really nice place. my friend stayed here when she was working in Chicago and I went to stay with her. The rooms are nice the beds are comfy and she had a Mac in room so we took some crazy pics. She has status so we raided the club floor-nice.,N
4808,"Just spent 3 days during at theWit while on business.  I could walk or take an instant cab ride to every appointment and meal.  Super convenient.  The staff was great and I felt like I got to know them personally -- even O.C. the awesome doorman.  I liked the rooms even more than a W -- stylish, great beds, nice HD ... but more functional than a W.  StateLake (server Sarah was great), the community table at Ciba Mato was way fun ... and David, Eric and Mike at the ROOF top bar were just fabulous -- I can't wait to go back in the summer.  theWit is now my only place to stay and party in the Windy City.",Y
2309,Been here many times over the years for conferences.  Enjoyed the visit lives up to expectations for Marriott.,N
3112,"I was blown away by the negative reviews that this hotel has.   Yes, it was previously a Days Inn that just happened to be situated in between the prettiest waterfront in town AND the magnificent mile.  Yes, the glitter wall with the giant W at the driveway (which was very poorly designed, by the way) was very tacky, as were the (skankily dressed) non-hotel guests and visitors of the Living Room who loitered around the reception area on Friday and Saturday nights, making it almost impossible to navigate through the crowd and into the bank of elevators. As a side note - the vibe that I got from the lobby is very similar to that of the V Bar at Hotel Valencia, and the skankily dressed non-hotel guests and visitors remind me of San Jose's Santana Row's clientele: cougars on the prowl and 50-y.o dudes with 20-y.o golddigging arm candies.  Nothing beats the feel of home when you are a few thousand miles away. And I do think the attempt to put a ""W"" on anything and everything was a tad overdone.   But in all fairness, they did a good job transforming a dying and derelict Days Inn into a hip hangout joint. The cacophony stopped right there in the lobby.  I got the peace and quiet that I wanted in my room on level 20th, with an amazing view of the frosty Lake Michigan and Navy Pier.  The bed was comfortable (although the odd-looking soft black furry cube soon found its place on the floor), the toiletries are from the phenomenal Bliss Spa, and there was lots and lots of natural light.  I even like the window to the bathroom - although I don't know if I'd feel the same way if I wasn't traveling alone, since I'm not much of an exhibitionist. The service was consistently satisfactory.  Need a dental kit? Done - someone was already at the front door with an assortment of toothpaste / toothbrush / dental floss / mouthwash within 5 minutes.  Need a late check out? Done - 2PM.  Want more of those awesome Bliss toiletries (who doesn't love freebies)? Done - no questions asked. Lastly, those who complained about lack of proper storage system need to spend a week in a Manhattan hotel and then revisit their assessment. And oh, 9 out of 10 hotels charge for wi fi.  Get over it.",N
2195,"My company hosted a gala in there this past weekend and man this place is beautiful! Can't speak for the rooms and overnight stays, but the event nooks are awesome. littered with old school charm",N
400,"I have only stayed here once, but will return for sure.  The price was reasonable and the accomedations were fantastic.  Every employee was polite and greeted us in the hallways.  Check in was quick and we were given a corner room with no traffic in the hallway.  The room was clean and comfortable and had a tremendous view. I really can not wait to go back!",N
1965,"As everyone knows, the W is known for it's contemporary, chic decor and of course, the Bliss Spa.  W City Center needs a little help, though.  It's decor lives up to W's reputation, but the rooms are very small and the bathrooms feel more like the Holiday Inn.  The Bliss producst are fabulous, but  I was very disappointed in the hotel overall.  It needs a lot of updating, architectually.  The hallways are narrow, the walls are thin, and the rooms are small and stuffy.  I had trouble sleeping as the airconditioner never really cooled the room off (despite the thermostate being turned down to 66).  The restuarant is fabulous and they did let me check in 4 hours early, so I will give them that.  Overall, the W hotels in Chicago (including the Lakeshore) are disappointing.",N
4137,"During our stay at the Hyatt Regency Chicago, we enjoyed being only a few blocks from Millenium Park, Macy's and the Art Institute. Our beautiful room (1064 in the East Tower) overlooked the Chicago River and the Magnificent Mile skyline. Automatic check-in was quick and easy. We arrived before the 3 p.m. check-in and were able to check our luggage easily. Before we settled in, my husband did his usual 10-minute bedbug search with high-beam flashlight and magnifying glass, and there is no problem here. My number one priority in hotels is getting a good night's sleep, and we slept beautifully. The beds were incredibly comfortable, and the linens and pillows of high quality. The blackout curtains did their job, and there was no noise from the street or adjacent rooms (the hotel was full at least one of the nights we were there, so we did have neighbors). We visited in the summer, and the room and public areas were always delightfully cool. Transportation was excellent, with the Number 6 bus to Loop stores and Hyde Park stopping in front of the hotel, and the Number 151 Michigan Avenue bus on the corner. Valet parking was easy, and there was always a line of cabs at the hotel. The housekeeper was very nice and she kept the room spotless. The shower felt great! Hotel staff is genuinely friendly and helpful, with none of the ""have a nice day"" automatic civility of many businesses that cater to the public. After I tried and failed to get tickets for Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House tour, I turned to the concierge, and she walked me through booking the tour on the Robie House website and printing the tickets. Another concierge printed driving directions back home for us. Breakfast Buffet: The selection and presentation is terrific. It's like attending 12 bar mitzvahs!  Manuel made me a wonderful omelet, cooking the onions and mushrooms thoroughly, as I requested, before adding the spinach and cheddar cheese I had selected. The fruit cup and pineapple spears were very fresh. There are options to match any appetite and special diet, and for those without time to wait for an omelet, there were at least a dozen egg and pancake dishes on the steam table. Smoked salmon, excellent cheeses (including artisan cheddar, goat cheese and brie) and freshly made waffles were available, and there was an extensive selection of breads, pastries, cereal and drinks. Service was exceptional!  Manuel brought my omelet to the table, and the waiter brought me coffee, water and a newspaper. One of my restaurants pet peeves is constant sound. While there were televisions in the dining area, the sound is muted, leaving guests in blessed silence to enjoy this fabulous breakfast. The workout room was clean and well equipped, and you can hook up your iPod to the cardio machines. My husband and I enjoyed a drink at The Big Bar. The negatives: Constant noise from the bathroom fan, loud enough that we had to keep the bathroom door closed; a squeaky bathroom door; and intermittent motor-like noise from above the ceiling. I asked to have these problems fixed and they weren't. Also, the flat screen television did not have a very good picture, most shows were not high definition and there was no programming guide. At one point during our stay our key cards stopped working. Assistant Front Office Manager Rocco LaFronza was just delightful. He got us into our room and comped us breakfast buffet the next day, turning a negative experience into a positive.   I look forward to staying at this luxurious hotel again.",N
1075,"I love Chicago! I cannot wait to go back and explore some more of this great city. I have to thank my job for sending me to Chicago this past May for an employee recognition trip. This was a great experience and i really happy i was able to share it with Meesh. We got there a day early to get the exploring started early. The Fairmont from day 1 impressed me. The service was top notch and the staff always had a smile on their faces. Always eager to help and make our stay more enjoyable. I felt like a little kid as we walked in the room. The bed was humungous and comfy as hell. Beautiful bathrooms and a sweet view plus they put us on the 20th floor so we could take advantage the view. We were there for a few days and soaked up the hotel and the city. Its located right in the middle by Millennium Park and everything is but a short cab ride away. Quick tip - walk around the block and check the Noodle place. Freaking delicious. We found it the last day there. Epic fail. if not, we would have been noodled out. Will i stay here again. If the price is right then yes. It can get a bit pricey but since my job was paying i was not worrying about the bill. Where to next ? travel buddy/girlfriend/adventurer Meesh Adventure is out there!",N

1573,"If nothing else, this hotel was located in the PERFECT location for visiting/tourist-ing Chicago, and our river-view room had an amazing view. We got to the hotel, and we were actually able to check in about 4 hours before the 3pm check in time, which a huge positive! The space of the room was ok. Nothing special, definitely not boutique-like, as I was hoping it would be. The interior reminded me more of a Holiday Inn than of a hotel that...well, charges as much as this one does. The room size was perfect, even roomy I would say, for 2 adults, while the bathroom size was pretty standard. I know there are some complaints about the elevators, but we were on the 28th floor and had no problem at all. From the lobby, we actually didn't have to wait for one the whole time we were there, and anytime we needed one from our floor, we didn't wait longer than a minute. My biggest complaint was that every single night we stayed there (3 in total), I was woken up by noise in the hallway. Once from noisy elevator traffic and the other two times from a group of drunken girls yelling on the floor. As an NYC native, I have no problem sleeping through noise, and I actually brought/slept with earplugs in all nights, so I think this is really a testament to how thin the doors are. My only other big issue was that the bed was quite uncomfortable. I mean, when I'm traveling, I'm really paying for two things: a bed and good nights sleep; and this hotel couldn't meet either of those. Lucky for them, their location bumped up their rating from 1 star to 3. In all, if you can get a good deal on hotel71, then it might be worth the stay here. If you are a tourist like I was, it more than likely is worth the stay. If you end up having to pay full price, you may be disappointed.  Oh, and if you do end up booking some nights here, make sure to request a room on one of the higher floors.",N
3609,"This is your grandmother's hotel. That says it all right? I am a Chicagoan transplanted to the Washington DC area.  I grew up three blocks away from the Drake along the lakefront in a building that you'll find in art history text books.  I had my wedding reception at the Drake. So...you'd think I'd give a higher rating, right?  Shoot, I almost gave a two-star rating, if it weren't for the beautiful service I got at this establishment. I guess it's hit or miss if you get a renovated room.  I really didn't think that you could get a more dreary room than mine, despite the fact that it was big and had a fairly nice view of the lake.  The room screamed of the 1960s, and I don't mean in a cool Mad Men kind of way.  I mean in a drab, hadn't been given enough attention way. I mean, it was long and had a separate sleeping and tv area, but why was I longing for the Hilton Suites hotel just half a block away?   The wood trim all around the room was dark, the closet was pathetic, and the wallpaper hadn't been changed since at least 20 years ago. Really, if it weren't for the amazing people who work here who were helpful, friendly, and professional, I probably would have given 2 stars. I just expected more.  But...you will see in later reviews that I think highly of Palm Court. Quel dommage.",N
2552,"I came here last night to listen to my boy play records.  I otherwise would probably have never come here - it has been off of my radar and my friend's radars for whatever reason. Well, my boy - being excited about starting a regular thursday night gig there - was excited enough about the place that I figured I'd go take a look see for myself. I knew with my boy there playing music that my ears, at least, would be happy.  After all, he was put on this earth by god herself to play house music :).  And, I was put on this earth by god herself to listen. The space itself is perfect!  High ceilings, perfectly lit, intelligently and pleasingly decorated, relatively smoke free, and a nice open floorplan that makes moving around very easy.  This was a Thursday night and the place was comfortably populated - male, female, gay, & straight hotties everywhere.  A real nice crowd.  Apparently a new sound system is on the way - not an absolutely necessary improvement but louder and clearer is always better right? :) The only reason I won't give five stars is because of the damn drink prices.  HELLA EXPENSIVE! The crowd was surprisingly diverse.  As some others have mentioned - there is definitely a creative streak allowed in terms of style of dress for men and women.  I don't think you'll feel comfortable in a ball cap and gym shoes but there is freedom to express yourself otherwise. Best part of the night - I met a 6' tall blonde girl and her name was Yolanda!  For real!  We didn't get along so well because I couldn't stop fucking laughing :).  How fucked up is that? ;) Me:  Hey there, whats  your name? Girl:  Yolanda Me:  *gasp* I'm sorry, what was that? Girl:  *louder and slower* Yo-lan-da Me:  Oh, hi Yolanda, my name is Johnson.  *stupid grin on my face* Yolanda:  Johnson?  Is that your first name? Me:  Yeah, Johnson baby, Johnson :) *bigger stupid grin on my face* We didn't talk much after that :)",N

4110,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this hotel. I stayed here about a year and a half ago (wasn't really a yelper then). It's a very pretty hotel that has some amazing views and is in a great walking location--although not very close to an EL stop. This place can run really expensive, but I lucked out big time when I booked through their website and got a really cheap price (I think because I booked so far in advance). Since then, when I've come back to the city I haven't been able to afford the place because it books fast and usually the expensive rooms are the ones left. I would definitely recommend this place, and will stay here again when I can.",N
5610,"Maybe there's a reason I haven't rated this place even though I've stayed here before: it sucks! This is supposed to be the better of the Westins here and I'm going to be staying at the one on Michigan Ave a lot more. First, the bathtub is clogged and the AC isn't working properly. I asked them to check it out while I was out, came back and they either didn't come up or whatever they did didn't work. Second, the food is taking forever:forever on hold, forever to order, forever to get here, forever! Third, the wifi isn't working and apparently it's only MY room. A room, btw, that I was told was an upgrade because of my ""status"" and really there's nothing different about it from regular rooms. Oh and the best part? There is no freaking comment card in the room so I can bitch about it in writing! WTF!",N
3752,"I work as a third-party hotel vendor, so I get the privilege of staying in a lot of hotels in several cities. Most recently in Chicago, I stayed the Palomar, which was lovely, and the Best Western, which was atrocious. Trumping them both is the Dana, however. From the moment you arrive outside the door, you know you are in a great place. It's trendy and comfortable, that's smart. Doormen greet you immediately and show you to the concierge, which is a 1-2 person desk. Very humble: smart and casual, if you will. Keys are needed to ride the elevators, so as to avoid the squatters who just want to check out the visual delights of this boutique hotel - which definitely don't disappoint, mind you. Rooms feature hardwood floors and floor-to-ceiling windows offering a view of the city. They are modern and inviting. There are robes and slippers, a full work-station, complimentary wireless Internet, a television and big, comfy beds. Complimentary fitness center, a full-time business center, air travel kiosks, a chef-driven restaurant (free breakfast vouchers if you book direct with the hotel), and a swanky spa compile some of the fabulous extras. Don't forget one of the hottest, best-kept secrets: Vertigo, their sky lounge. Absolutely loved this place. Huge fan.",N
5837,"Wife and I stay here when we visit. Went up on my 50th birthday for 4 days. Had a corner room reserved and they comped us a suite. It was like having a apartment in the gold coast. Service was fantastic, had maid service 2X day, turned down bed with chocolates. Didn't hear any noise from construction, concierge was very helpful and called us by our names after first day, made our reservations and gave us coupons for restaurants. I like staying at these small boutique hotels because you get the personal touch. Only complaint was they no longer have free coffee in the lobby in the morning. Best kept secret in chicago, will be staying there again.",Y
5172,"I work at Sears Tower and this hotel is pretty much second home to me. Our company puts all of our out of towners here and when they know we will be having a busy week put their employees up here. Two years ago my house was damaged in a fire and the W gave me a stellar rate of $70 a night for just over a month. I couldn't beat the location, because of work and the staff was always accomodating. The rooms might be on the smaller side, but  this hotel is perfection.",Y
2323,"Love the fact that the Marriott sits right in the middle of downtown Magnificent Mile where everything is walkable - shopping/restaurants, Wendella Boat Rides, Chicago Tribune, Chicago River Walk, etc. Convenience always helps when you are on trips!! If you don't mind staying in a small room (not your standard Marriott spacious hotel room but managed to get by with 4 people), then go for it! There is a bar and open lounge area right when you walk in and a Starbucks inside right next to the concierge.",N
150,"Okay. I am SUPER picky about hotels and I usually pick the hotel but this time my b/f chose the hotel. The Whitehall Hotel is an older hotel. It has old charm and it is in a awesome location. (walking distance to pretty much everything) But, again, it was an older hotel. The elevators were small and every time I walked into my room it smelled like an old folks home. Also, the walls are thin. It never failed, each night at 2am the guy above me came in, slammed his door and took a shower. I could hear it all. BUT, on a positive note, the staff was friendly and helpful, the hotel was in a good location and the bed was comfortable.",N
4403,"My friend and I spent the night at the Palmer House for New Years Eve. The room was nice and clean. I absolutely love the old time feel of this hotel. The staff was friendly. It was great that they had hired extra security to keep out anyone who wasn't a registered guest from heading up to the room. I was expecting a ruckus night of morons running up and down the hall. But it turned into a peaceful, alcoholic night of sleep. It was a great place to crash after a night of horking down free shrimp and downing a couple pitchers of pink lemonade at one of the Chicago bars. One thought kept haunting me though: I really hoped they changed the linens (or burned the beds) after IML.",N
4375,"I lived in Chicago for a few years between high school and college (sometime shortly after Gutenberg had printed his first Bible).  I was too young and too poor to enjoy many of the places I would have liked, so when I registered for a huge scientific meeting in Chicago I chose The Palmer House as my hotel. When I was explaining my choice to some colleagues I told them that it used to be very elegant, but now was a little worn and frayed around the edges and the plumbing was a little iffy.  One of the younger members of the group said ""That sounds just like you, Dr. Rick"" to which someone added ""When the hell was Rick ever elegant?"". The service was perfect and the room, albeit small compared to newer hotels, was very comfortable and quiet.  I have a 3G wireless widget  for my computer, so I didn't have to pay for their expensive Internet connection.  A coffee pot would have been nice in the room, but there's a Starbucks on the street level.  All in all, my stay was pleasant and since it's so close to the museums and other downtown attractions I'd stay there again if I had more time to enjoy the city.",N
894,"Architecture defines the ""boutique hotel"" experience. Staff extremely friendly and accomodating.  I left some items in my room, and hotel staff went out of their way to find these items and ship them to me.  All the while, they kept me updated by phone. In-hotel dining (Atwood) is of quality. The room itself was beautiful,  corner windows overlooking the busy Chicago streetscape. This would make a great place for a couples getaway.  I would stay here again and recommend the hotel highly.",N
2543,"Here's the thing: This is Chicago. It is not Manhattan. It is not South Beach. It is not L.A. It is not Paris. This is Chicago. So I need the over-entitled and under-exposed people at Victor Hotel to understand that. I know from ""exclusive"" clubs. And you, Victor Hotel, are not an exclusive club. You never will be, and you need to stop acting like it. I've only been here at the invitation of younger (that is to say ""20-something"") friends for birthday celebrations, and to a time, I regretted going. It's like a bad scene from 1994, with unnecessary lines, a ridiculous cover and bottle service, and the ever-elusive ""list"". Here's my thing: I don't stand in line anywhere. And that is not pretention, it is the truth. I happen to work in a profession that has afforded me access to ""exclusive"" places -- much better than Victor Hotel. So, I don't stand in line. And I definitely don't stand in line at a bootleg club in the industrial district in what we're now calling the ""West Loop."" My other thing -- I do not beg to get in. If I tell you that I'm on the list and drop the name we both know and agree is the contact, let me the hell in without a shakedown! Maybe if I was in my 20s and never lived outside of Chicago, I'd think it was a hot place to be. But I know the kind of bad fruit these folks are selling and I don't want it. The last time I was there, I was so worn down from standing in line (because my name mysteriously disappeared or was never on ""the list""), conceding to paying a $20 cover (because my name mysteriously disappeared or was never on ""the list""), and trying and failing to get table service replenishments, that I couldn't even enjoy the DJ. I was too irritated. I paid my respects to the birthday girl and kept it moving -- knowing that I wouldn't set foot in this joint again. I'll leave it to the kids who still enjoy it because they don't know any better. And I'll keep partying elsewhere with grown folks.",N
2967,I like this building because it reminds me of an updated Merchandise Mart.,N
2060,"this is my go-to chicago hotel.  stands head and shoulders above all other holiday inns i've ever stayed in. +1 for location.  atop the chicago sun-times building.  you can get to the merchandise mart L station without even having to go outside (useful in summer and winter).  from the hotel lobby, there's a back set of elevators that will take you to the 2nd floor.  walk straight through merchandise mart on the 2nd floor, you'll run right into the L station (brown line, one stop away from the loop) +1 for having some class.  seriously.  if nobody told you that it was a holiday inn, you'd have very few indications of such. +1 for clean rooms. +1 for brand new plumbing/hardware in my bathroom (21st floor). -1 for expensive parking ... but what else is new, chicago?  dump your car elsewhere and take the L to the hotel. +1 for friendly hotel staff. +1 for taking care of priority gold members.  voucher for 15% at the hotel restaurant, italiasia. +1 for good breakfast buffet at italiasia. +1 for cityscape bar.  overlooks the skyline from the 15th floor.  fantastic at night. +1 for the folks at the bar letting us come in and use the Wi-Fi for a few hours (without buying any food/drink). +1 for free Wi-Fi (with passcode obtained at check-in). +1 for banquet halls and meeting space. +1 for offering AAA discount rate. +1 for pool and fitness center.  nothing too special. i've stayed at this hotel perhaps 8 times now.  recommended, even if you're on a budget.  i'll return the next time i'm in the city.",N
3201,Room was tiny and a bit beat up.  View was gorgeous.  Room service was overpriced...$68 for 2 burgers and 2 sodas...yikes!  Breakfast was excellent in the restaurant.  Complimentary drinks were also nice.,N
3373,"We stayed here a night in January. We came via the red line which is only a few blocks away and nice to be able to take public transportation to. We booked the King Suite, which meant we were on the top floor (15th). The room is not huge but we did not feel cramped either. The rooms have recently been remolded which is really nice. We had a fantastic view of Grant Park, museums and the lake. I would get this room again for the view! It doesn't happen much in Chicago that you get an unobstructed view and it was nice to have one. The bathrooms, as others have posted are tiny. It is an older hotel and you just work around it but yes, very, very small. The heat is controlled for the building so in the winter it is heat and you can't control it for your room, you can turn the fan on though and we found that this was enough to keep us plenty warm. The walls are not the thickest and we heard other guests getting off the elevator all night. All-in-all, a nicely appointed room with a few quirks, but we would stay here again for the view and location and price.",N
259,"Ehhhhh.  Extremely noisy, curtains were completely ripped up, weird rust-colored (blood-colored?) stains in the tub, semi-questionable neighborhood, and ""valet"" parking is a complete joke (don't pay for it, just park in the adjoining lot for half the price).  The staff, however, were incredibly friendly and helpful, much more than you would expect given how shitty the hotel looks, hence the 3 stars instead of 2.  That, and it's very accessible via both public transit and the interstates. I stayed at this Holiday Inn because they were the only downtown hotel I could find that had a room and parking package that was within my per diem, and that will be the only reason I ever stay here again.",N
1297,"I was highly disappointed.  The room itself and atmosphere was nice, but I had a terrible parking experience.  Seems to be that b/c they're an expensive hotel they think they can absolutely gauge their guests on all fronts.   I paid for parking which I thought was $45 for 24 hours (still really high).  Come to find out the hard way that it's 24 hours or up until 3 pm the next day, which comes first.  In my case, I was parked for about 21 hours and paid $74!!!!!!!!  Outrageous.  I spoke to a couple different people and got no where.  ""it's the policy""   My policy - stay elsewhere.  Nice hotels aren't hard to fine, go with one that has better service and concern for their guests.",N
4247,"We held our wedding reception at the Hyatt Regency in the Crystal Ballroom.  We also had a brunch the next morning for guests.  Both were excellent.  The staff was very professional and helpful at both events.  And we really, really loved our reception.  The coordinator there, Rebecca, is fantastic.  We did not have the budget to hire our own coordinator so it was really nice to have most of the reception details covered because we were pretty overwhelmed with other details.  We looked at a lot of hotels for our reception and we thought the Hyatt was very reasonable - and the Crystal Ballroom is very cool [it was one of the few hotels with a ballroom with a view that could hold 200+ guests].  In addition, they had a promotion where you could get several nights free at hotels across the country after the wedding [we ended up getting 5 nights free at a Hyatt Regency in Hawaii for our honeymoon - such a great deal ].  We would have loved our reception without the honeymoon promotion but that was a very nice touch.",N
1925,"Great location, comfortable rooms,",N
2096,"I have to be honest -- when I told a colleague I was staying here, she said, ""really?  I'm sure there are other hotels in the area that are nicer.""  I stayed with it, and really enjoyed it.  They must've done renovations recently, because the place looks great -- the rooms are terrific, the lobby is gorgeous -- great views, and more.  The staff was outstanding -- very helpful concierge.  One tip:  Try not to get a room that surrounds the atrium -- it was a bit noisy with the bar and restaurant just below, although keeping the fan on drowned that out.  But a bit off and you'll be happy as a clam here!",N
3715,I love this hotel! It has awesome views from many of the rooms and the area around the hotel is full of places to shop and eat! If you are looking for a nice hotel in the city that is accessible to a lot of places this might just be the place for you!,N
793,"DO NOT have your wedding room block here!!!!! We had our wedding room block here in August for our wedding (our wedding was not at the hotel though). We had nothing but issues, issues, and more issues. It was the biggest problem that we had in all of our wedding plans. The hotel itself is nice, clean, and the beds are very comfortable. I have no complaints about the quality of the hotel and furnishings. Our first issue was that we were misled about the nature of the room block. We were reassured that when the initial block was filled, we would be able to add 5 more rooms at a time, no problem whatsoever. What they failed to mention was that they would hassle with us about the room rate. Next issue, my grandfather needed a handicapped room. The reservation was made 8 months in advance, and when he checked in....no handicapped room for him. Had to wait 24 hrs. for a handicapped room. Unexcusable. Next issue, multiple guests were not able to check in by 3 pm. One guest had driven from Canada and was not able to check into her room until 7 pm. This was because someone was still occupying the room. They reassured her this person would be charged. They did not however offer her another room, or offer anything to her at all! Again, unexcusable. Next issue, the gift bags I provided for the guests were not properly delivered to the right guests. I had provided a typed, very clear list of which guests were to receive bags to the bellman (this is the Westin's policy). I had to speak with the bellman multiple times about gift bags not being delivered. I should not have to do this the weekend I am getting married!! The biggest issue...they charge $2.50 per gift bag. When I'm paying for this service, it should be done correctly. The service at this hotel is ridiculously unexcusable!!!",N
3066,"My company held a convention this past weekend at the W and I must say, it was lovely. Since I live in the city, I only stayed over one of the three nights, but I spent the better part of those days in the W and it was quite nice. The first night's event was at Altitude which is the open space at the 33rd floor... The room is all windows with an astounding view of the lake as well as the city.  The ceiling was a little low, but again- the view made up for any nit-picky short comings. Even the elevator is a delight...or a party. It always smelled lovely in the elevator, which you don't realize how nice that is until you're crammed in with a flock of tourists... The elevator music was not your typical sleepy tunes- they were playing Peter, Bjorn & John and other hip anthems. The food was catered by the W and it was good. Not great, but really decent considering they were feeding more than 300 people. On the final night, I stayed over and the room was terrific. I probably had one of the few bad views (looking right out to a cement wall) but even that didn't take away from the overall pleasure of staying there. The bed was possibly as comfy, if not more, than mine at home, and the dcor, while sort of cheesily-trendy, was very comfortable. Also- no generic combined shampoo/conditioner and dry smelly soap... All the cosmetics and soaps were from Bliss Spa... Very nice! All in all, when I start making the big bucks, I will opt to stay at this chain whenever possible.",N
4875,"This place smells and looks like death. The staff is rude, the carpet looks like a million years old, the heat (which we didn't think we'd even need) is shady, at best. My girlfriend swore up and down the bathroom door didn't close all the way. For what we paid and the hype about this place....el gross-o!",Y
2547,"OK, I'ma preface this by saying I'm only writing this review of this place I've been to once because it's the only ""new"" place I've been to in awhile, and I guess I'm long overdue for a review.  Also, I only went here because my friend was deejaying, and I drove all the way to Dekalb from work to pick up my other friend who's car broke down and then drove all the way to Chicago only to get lost for over 2 MORE hours because my friend the ""navigator"" that I picked up thought that our dj friend told him to turn on FULLERTON when it was FULTON the entire time.  All in all I drove basically 6 hours to get to this damn place so I'm already a little biased walking in here. First of all, there's a dress code apparently (even though my dj friend said there wasn't.)  After some explaining and talking to a bouncer and a manager they let us in with our sneakers as long as I took off my hat.  Awesome bouncer, but right off the bat I find out it's not the kind of place I would normally go to. Secondly, drinks.  It was sponsored by Hennessey that night but unfortunately it didn't do a damn thing for drink prices.  $6 for the average selection of beers and $8 a mixed drink and $9 a shot.  Average prices for some clubs but this ain't exactly the place you can get your ""drink on"" on my budget. Thirdly, Victor ""HOTEL?""  Not only did my friend get the streets mixed up, but we were looking for an actual hotel the whole time.  What's the deal with these places with false-advertisey names? (Like US Beer Company, which is not an actual brewery or anything and they run out of beers a lot of times too.)  Are people actually running out of names for these clubs and bars?  I know it's a ""thing"" but call it ""Victor Club"" or ""Victor you'll never find us in this meat-packing district bar"" or something. There's a couple of little rooms from what I could see, not sure if they were VIP and I believe there was an upstairs as well (which I'm also unsure of its VIP statusness.)  I mostly congregated around the dj stage drinking my anger away.  Apparently they were doing live art somewhere too which I was too late to witness. The music is a moot point because I obviously liked it since my friend was deejaying, so I'm not sure what their normal selection of music is but by the judging of all of Frodo's cousins there looking confused (the Douche Baggins) I got a feeling that they weren't playing what the normal crowd comes to hear.  Parking is valet only unless you're lucky to find a spot (which is nigh impossible.) All in all, the online magazine that was throwing this party is trying new adventurous things and places, but I don't think this particular place is one I'm coming back to.  Two and a half stars.  Hey, it could be great for all I know, but I don't care.  SIX-HOURS.",N
529,"Huh? Did all of these people stay at the same hotel I did? I stayed here for 2 miserable nights and  will not be back. The ONLY reason to stay here is that it is close to the redline. I booked a room for some last minute travel right before New Years. Since my stay in Chicago was going to be over the holiday, I wanted to be close to the redline so I could visit friends. This hotel fulfills this need well. The room was clean, but horribly dated. The counter/minibar area was beat to hell. Huge gouges in it, I have no idea what happened. The bathroom was much the same way. The cabinet doors under the sink were hanging off their hinges. Not what I expected staying on the Hilton Honors floor. Putting an LCD tv in an otherwise 30 year old room does not update it. This is all cosmetic, so I didn't care much. And for those of you reading this thinking I simply put down Hamptons, read my other reviews, I tend to stay at Hampton Inns more than any other hotel. This is by far the worst I have ever been to. There was 1 open outlet in the proximity of the bed/desk area. Huh? some of us have to charge our phone and laptop at the same time. Imagine that The ABSOLUTE worst, is the fact it is across the street from one of the busiest firehouses in the city. Nothing better than listening to wailing fire engines all night. I honestly think the guy that was passed out in the elevator when I got back on New Years slept better than I did in my bed. If you are looking for a hotel in the area, look elsewhere, or bring earplugs.",N
3446,"I have stayed here for a weekend here and there with my boyfriend at the time....the second time we stayed here we came back from dinner and drinks to find our door barely open....we checked out the room and everything was fine, nothing missing, but I promptly called security in a rage. Turns out the lock deal wasn't locking properly and after having maintenance come up, past midnight and totally tipsy I might add, he said he couldn't do anything right then that the mechanism would have to be replaced. They upgraded us to a fairly decent suite after I ranted and raved....I felt this still wasn't sufficient seeing that I could have had some very expensive Louis Vuitton and other designed merch snatched out of my room due to their ""malfunction"" and we wouldn't have any time to really enjoy a suite because we were leaving early the next morning....I complained to a manager at check-out and he was kinda flaky and said well I guess next time you come we can upgrade your room then and I asked well how can I prove you promised me that and he said ""I will put a note in your account""...right, I am sure you will buddy. Needless to say, we never returned. The hotel bar however carries Tyku which is a delicious Japanese liquor that pairs great with sprite. The hotel otherwise is decent, but desirable because of its location right off Michigan Ave.",N
3092,One of the better W hotels out there...  Been here for business (meeting people in town) as well as staying here just to get away from Naperville a few times... Always a great experience.  Rooms are decent sized for downtown.  Nice staff...  Even the breakfast the next morning was delicious. Haven't experienced upstairs so I cannot comment on that...  Had a collegue in town that liked it though.,N
3025,"Location is probably the only thing key about the W Chicago. I didn't have a BAD experience, but it was none the less that great either. I was a little peeved knowing I would be charged $14.95 a day for internet service in my room, for how much it cost to stay here, you'd think it would be complimentary. The bathrooms are another story, I really would like to meet the designer and pick his/her brain over the concept! They are ridiculous and not ""edgy"" or ""modern"" or whatever term you want to call it. W Chicago isn't our normal hotel we stay at while on business in Chicago, but we will definitely not be booking here again.",N
3802,"Very posh accommodations for any out-of-towner! My room actually reminded me of a studio apartment (a VERY NICE studio apartment), rather than a hotel room. The hardwood floors and desk made it feel like you were coming home at the end of the day...and I like that feeling. The floor-to-ceiling windows were cool (awesome views) but it got to be a pain by day two, as you have to pull down the shades if you want to take a shower, change your clothes, or do anything that you don't want the businessmen in the building next door to see :) OR if you are an exhibitionist, this is the place for you! And I'm still confused as to why the shower is glass on both sides, especially the side closest to the bed. Does someone who's sleeping NEED to see you washing your hair? The privacy curtain takes care of that problem, but I'm wondering why it was built that way originally. Based on the last two hotels that I've stayed in for work, The Curtis and its talking elevators (""I seee youuu"") and now the sexy shower at the Dana... what kind of job did I just sign up for? I kid, I kid... I would absolutely stay at the Dana again, as its location is within walking distance of a lot of great shopping (Hello Michigan Ave!) and cute brunch spots. For someone who isn't terribly familiar with Chicago, I felt like this was a perfect spot for this Country Mouse :)",N
1747,"3.5 stars I just checked out. We stayed here for mini one night get away. There is no doubt that the service is good. Room service was very nice and so was the front desk. The couple of complaints I have are mainly about the room. I was given a mini bar key, but there was no mini bar, wtf? Ok, I can live with no booze...but the room also felt a little grimy and small.  I don't think I'd stay here again, unless I was staying in a clean suite.",N
647,Beautiful large clean room. Dream bed. Warn chocolate chip cookies upon arrival. Wolfgang Puck coffee. Spa toiletries. Found this room on Hotwire for $77. Normally it would be 200.,N
506,"Stayed here for five nights - didn't have a car (thank goodness). I think it was the time frame we were there but the hotel seemed to have a lot of families.  Nothing wrong with that, just take it as a comment.  I'm more used to staying in hotels that were more business people or couples.  When you add in a bunch of children it changes the dynamics a bit. Breakfast -- Crowded but seemed to work itself out.  You either went early or went last minute.  If you wanted the ""made to order"" then you would need to be there early (tips are accepted).  The cook was amazing.  Also amazing were the people who cleaned up after the hordes.  These folks kept tables cleaned and new people got tables. The food was broken into three areas.  Made to order, hot dishes (eggs, bacon, pancakes) and then continental breakfast. Kudos to Oscar -- always had a smile and kept tables moving... Rooms - Ours had a comfy bed and the rest of the furniture was a hodge-podge.  The televisions had a limited number of channels and the only pay per view worth watching was ""The Kings Speech"", but why spend time in the room.  There was a fridge and a small microwave.  You will have to borrow some plates/silverware for your food. Dominicks is across the street so you can get food from there if you really need it. Evening food/drinks -- yep, it's there.  Nothing to go nuts over (no pun intended).  Small drinks (beer, wine) and some mixed drinks.  You save a little with not going to a bar but it depends what you like.  Munchies were of the nuts, salsa/chips variety. Noise -- even with the noise of the families your room isn't that bad.  Yes you can hear them next door but if they aren't the party type then all is good.  Put the TV up a little. Elevators -- very fast Internet - go across the street to Dominicks or down the street to Panera Bread and use theirs.  Also there is a business center on the ballroom floor that you can hook at cat5 cable into and not use the wireless but it is a small room. Workers there were very very nice -- even with the rude tourists.  I never saw them lose control.  Even the mother who dumped orange juice all over the place and proceeded to yell at everyone.  They cleaned it up and kept things moving.  I like the people there. Would I go back, sure, if the price was good.",N
3482,"Perfect location on Michigan Avenue - the Allerton has what big city travelers want. Who cares about big bedrooms and excessive bathrooms - the hotel has attentive staff - smart, caring, and willing to make it work. Yes rooms are small, bathrooms awkward at times - but the vibe of the hotel is positive and the people I met, amazing. All willing to make it work for you. If the room first selected is not to your liking, ask again, I did. Finding my 'suite' in a dark corridor, weird layout and not at all safe feeling. I asked to move, and front desk found a much better room, same rate that worked. Every person I dealt with was kind, empathetic, and willing to beyond to make my experience better. Bar served neighborhood crowd (church choir) as well as out of town guests. And all were welcomed by nice bar tenders. The maid service was great and also real in a face to face conversation. I loved that bathrooms while tiny and awkwardly designed, were stocked with ""just enough"" NOT TOO MUCH towels, etc. SO I felt no guilt actually using and not worrying that other towels had been left to linger. Thank you Allerton, nice staffing, awesome location, and great experience.",N
162,Stayed there for three nights in June 2011. It's a convenient location and the price was fairly reasonable. Negatives: 1) elevators are small to begin with (6ppl max) but then they broke down 2) poor mattress - caused back pain 3) dark room with poor lighting 4) old building and rooms (not sure when was the last time they renovated Employees were friendly but would not stay there again because the mattress gave me back pains.,N
1222,"I would not recommend anyone stay at this hotel, unless you're attending a conference at McCormick Place. Negatives- 1. Far away from city. $12 cab ride/each-way. 2. Food in restaurants is horrible and super expensive. 3. Parking situation is crazy. They never explain to you the difference between Self park and Valet. 4. TV's are ancient. With 30 cable channels only. 5. No Wireless internet and its $9.99 a day. 6. Bed has no fitted sheet. They lay a flat sheet on mattress so by the end of the night, you're sleeping on the mattress. Gross! 7. Freezing- The hallways are kept at 50 degrees. and... NO ONE ELSE IS HERE I can't think of a pro, other then there is hot water?!?! Do Not Stay Here!",N
722,"For a Westin, I was expecting more. I thought the interiors and bathrooms were lacking, and their toiletries aren't anything special. The written instructions for their eco program to skip housekeeping, and return the card are unclear. Perhaps I should've known to keep my card, and give it to the front desk rep when checking out. I interpreted it as giving several options, one of which to drop off in the room card box. Calling the Michigan Westin after my stay to request Starwood points didn't work since I didn't comply with the instructions. No Starwood points for this guest. I think there are nicer hotels to stay at in Chicago like the Palomar or W, than this Westin without sacrificing much for location.",N
5478,"This place is the shizzzz.  Too bad they don't accept Westin points.  Spacious, nice soothing decor, friendly staff and just around the corner from Le Passage, where my company hosts their annual customer reception.  Aside from their top service, you get a chocolate on your pillow every night!  Now that's SWEET.",N
1903,"What's up with the average 3 stars? Guess they weren't in Suite 1209 -1210 After a hell day of travel, miss connection due to Delta errors, cold front and rain... I was soooo elated to check in!! The lobby was extremely inviting with tall white tufted serpentine couches, chess tables, coffee table books, and bar.  We just didn't have time for it.  Our main purpose was to see as many shows at Lollapalooza as possible.   Whatcha get: King size bed Two bathrooms, two plasma screens, comfy couch, streamline sound system that we turned up late night with out a peep from our neighboring guest's complaint. Bliss products Lots of closets Over-sized lamps and a view that was on the sad side (but who cares we were out enjoying the streets of Chi Town) Concierge was  friendly and didn't mind answering questions like: where to buy an cheap umbrella (which we brought at Walgreens -Totes brand did the job fine), how to get to the metro, is it worth taking the architectural tour etc   Maid service fine. All-in-all great clean, peaceful stay and won't hesitate to visit again.",N
1178,Def not a top notch hotel...it was clean and did the job for someone coming to shop and sightsee...it was good when all you really did was sleep in the room...if you are looking for a nice hotel with a lot of amenitites this is not the hotel for you!,N
2333,"My fiance says I shouldn't make Mormon jokes while we're checking in at the Marriott.  Maybe that is why Mom's room had all kinds of stuff in the bathroom (q-tips, cotton balls, shower cap, etc.) that we didn't have and she had chocolates on her bed!!!  Damn them giving me the special Atheist room!   There are some fine features about this hotel: 1) It couldn't be in a better location.  We walked all over this lovely city and could easily catch a cab at a moment's notice if needed. 2) The elevators in this joint are CRAZY fast.  I don't know if they are run by space rockets or what, but if you can catch one that doesn't stop on every floor to pick up other people, you won't believe how fast they move.  3)  The hotel has been recently renovated and the room was very clean and fresh feeling.  4)  The staff members were all very nice and the operation was insanely efficient considering how big and wildly busy the place was. Not so lovely things about it would include the following: 1) Feather pillows - hate them.  It would be great if there were are alternatives so that you don't feel like you are resting on a pile of birds.  2)  The hallways are seriously over air conditioned.  They could settle down with the A/C and save some of that money to send to the church.  What are they thinking?!  3) Bad hairdryers - Low is not warm and high is insanely blowing your hair all over the place.  Mom agreed on this one.  4)  The windows seemed like they were not double paned or not thick enough.  Our room faced Michigan Ave. and even though we were on the 32nd floor, it was so loud with sirens and cars honking.  We were there for the July 4th weekend, which was probably an especially loud time.  It just seemed like there could be better windows to make it less noisy inside.  I need some peace and quiet to curl up with my Book of Mormon and read more about the angel Moroni.",N
1944,"Supposedly special weekend that I had written to the hotel about before arriving.  This hotel failed in so many ways I hope that others will think before booking here.  Service - non-existent.  4 of us at the lounge for over 2 hours - nobody ever came to see if we needed anything until we were getting ready to leave.  Concierge?  Non-existent at the hotel - had to go 4 times before somebody was there for us to ask for a breakfast recommendation (instead - I Yelped and was EXTREMELY pleased).  One person at the desk so wait time to check in was long and tedious.  All in all - I would not go back here especially since there are nicer and better hotels in the Chicago area.  This hotel seems very worn down and in need of an update too.  Finally, I don't need to have self-help sayings plastered all over the place!",N
4424,"I had to walk a dog in this hotel once. Not only is parking down town impossible but they make worse. I had to go to this place 3 times on a weekend, (sat & sun) They wouldnt allow me to park in front. I ended up haveing to spend money for a parking garage. NO parking down town ever of course but when i got inside the staff at the front desks were rude. Like i was impossing on them. I was walking a dog for a wedding in their hotel you would think they would be more polite. But they werent",N
2881,"3.5 stars to be exact. Want a place close to Michigan Ave, clean rooms and friendly staff? This is your place. This is not your place if you expect gym access to be included in your $200+ room/night or count on a handful of cool places to eat and drink right around the corner. Sure MIch Ave is right there so not that much of a biggie. You're on business, stay here. Want to explore like a local, try some boutique hotel elsewhere.",N
1613,"I want to start out by saying that my first visit to Hotel 71 was one of the most magical experiences that one can have in Chicago. It's located right on the river and the Premiere River King suites have breathtaking views, rainforest showers and modern Kuerig coffee makers, a welcome relief from those Hotel coffee makers that sound like someone is violently gargling as if choking to death only to produce a cup of coffee that tastes as if it were strained in a traveling salesmen's soiled sock. I have however deducted stars for two reasons. 1) they no longer serve adequate room service (my first trip they had this wonderful lox served on wafer-thin bagels that I am yet to locate in any health food store) and 2) my last trip they put me in the wrong room and then transferred me to a small Premiere room that was nothing near what I had come to expect for the same price. Repetition is required for excellence in my book. I want to state that I fully intend to try this hotel again and update my score if it improves since my first visit was so memorable for me. I still recommend this place over some if the others I've tried on the river. Please Hotel 71: bring back the lox on thin bagel crackers, upgrade the room service and keep your promises when people book a room. Thanks.",N
3967,"This hotel kind of blows. I wouldn't recommend it to travelers, except for its location, which is in walking distance of some of the most famous sites in Chicago. I couldn't get the wifi to work, and I have never had to wait so long for an order of pancakes (hour and 45 minutes!) in my life. The wifi reception doesn't work anywhere except the lobby, so if you're using one of the convention rooms you are pretty much out of luck because there are no LAN plugs.",N
2347,"I recently stayed here while attending a local convention.  The room was okay, but I did not like the fact that they charged $14 a day for internet service.  Perhaps this is common in Chicago hotels, but it seems like it should be included in the room cost.  So if you are a business traveler, keep this in mind.  Also, I found the bathroom and room a little small, although comfortable.  Overall the lobby was great, and the staff were friendly and helpful.  You certainly will enjoy a beautiful view of the City of Chicago from your window.",N
431,"I have to agree with the other reviewers. I would have loved staying at this hotel if I were on a high school or college road trip (its the cheapest hotel you can find this close to downtown), but as a professional adult there is no way in the world I would stay here again. Unlike what one reviewer said - there is a day spa, but its hard to find. It's the Kimberly Coleman Salon, which is located in the hotel (great salon by the way! see my review about that). The ""gourmet coffee"" snack people are horrible. The food isn't bad, but the coffee sucks and is way overpriced. The hotel lobby is nice. Its obviously new. But the rooms.... the rooms... the rooms....................are completely bare-boned, nothing extra. It looks like the furniture came from the 1980's, the TV channel selections suck, and worst of all.... the bed was hard as a rock. I'm not kidding!! I couldn't sleep on it. I pulled my air mattress out of the car and slept on that!!!! If you are planning to stay here for a convention, family reunion, church revival whatever - make sure to book using http://Hotels.com or something. As everyone has already said - this place is not worth the price if you pay the full value. http://Hotels.com had it for $79 per night when I booked - the hotel wanted $139. NO WAY!",N
3090,"I have a love hate relationship with this place.  I went there last year to catch up with a good buddy.  He ended up paying with his frequent flyer miles which was good because apparently this place costs a mint. Good:   Beds.  They are amazingly fantastic.  I haven't had that good of a night's sleep since.   Water.  The showers are awesome and the bath room pretty cool. TV.  Great HD tv with this hypnotic trace music set to soothing visuals when you first turn it on. Bartender.  The upstairs bartender was possibly the most beautiful woman I had ever seen.   Bad: Pretentious.  Pretentious.  Pretentious.  They turn the lobby into a mock night club with a live DJ at night.  If you're not wearing clothes they consider appropriate, you'll be asked to leave.  Its a god damned hotel lobby?!?!?!  Are you kidding me?  As a guest, I should not feel awkward about being in the lobby of the hotel I'm staying at.  Not only that, but the bouncer was incredibly rude about it.  Saying anything like, ""We get sports and movie stars in here all the time and they can't wear their hats either."" is not cool what so ever.  You're a bouncer.  . . GFY. Generally the staff did not look interested in being helpful and had more important things to do than express interest looking after this guest.  Don't judge a book by its cover people. . . Funny Anecdote- As I was leaving, I noticed a huge tour bus parked outside.  I didn't think anything of it until I got a call from my buddy.  Apparently I was leaving just as Snoop and 50 Cent were on their way in.  If I had known that, I would have stayed another night. . . I'll give'em that as a plus.",N
310,Nice quaint non chain hotel right across from my favorite club Berlin. It's always been my favorite place to stay at since all I have to do is cross the street and I'm snug in my non chain hotel exceptionally comfortable bed. It is on a busy road near the El if you are a light sleeper be aware. But the location is unbeatable.,N
865,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights with another couple this past weekend, and overall our experience was very good. The location of the hotel can't be beat, as it's on Jeweler's Row at the corner of Madison and Wabash; easy to get to and within walking distance to TONS of places, including the Amtrak station, Grant Park, and Michigan Avenue. Taxis, buses, and the El train are all very accessible as well, so getting just about anywhere is a breeze. Even better are the shops and restaurants just outside the front door, making it very easy to find anything you may need during your stay. The hotel itself is ""old world"" in style/decor, but the amenities are definitely modern: high-speed internet access, a roomy, updated bathroom, and a powerful AC unit are all worth mentioning. The rooms are on the small side, but that's to be expected given the hotel's downtown location. The only complaint I have about the room is regarding the beds, which were rock-hard. This is pretty typical for hotels nowadays, though, so I wasn't too surprised; it was just the only thing that kept the experience from being 5-star. FYI, our bed was king-sized. I've read there are some people who were bothered by the noise of the El train, which passes right outside the hotel. The key to this is to get a room at the back of the hotel, away from the street. That's what we did, and the noise was barely noticeable; it just sounded like it was raining whenever the train passed by. It's MUCH louder when you're facing the street, though, including when standing in the lobby. Just something to keep in mind when booking. Another thing to note is that the hotel does have several adjoining rooms. This was not something I remembered reading anywhere, so I thought I'd mention it; we would have taken advantage of that had we known about it. The staff was very accommodating and friendly, allowing us to check in early (around 1:30pm) and storing our bags after we'd checked out. They were also happy to accommodate our requests for change (bus fare), directions, and a move to the aforementioned adjoining rooms. (They weren't able to move us due to other bookings, but they were very nice about it!) We would absolutely stay here again and recommend the hotel to others.",N
115,"Stayed here via Hotwire for $79 on a Saturday night. We arrived around 9pm and the staff at the front desk was extremely rude. The redheaded woman that checked us in never made eye contact once and didn't bother listening to us either. We were given a room on the 2nd floor at the end of the hall.The rooms are very small and the hallways are equally as small. Our room faced Wabash so there wasn't much we could do about the noise. I would hope higher floors didn't have as much of an issue with noise. Upon checkout the in-room service was not functioning. We called the front desk and the staff was just as rude as the evening staff and abrubtly hung up on us. The only saving grace to the hotel was the breakfast in the morning. All in all - we got what we paid for with a location we wanted. NOTE: Parking at the hotel is $40 valet, you can go around the corner and use public parking for $34 for overnight.",N
5183,"Overall, our experience was positive (great location, clean, unique decor) but there were a few things that needed improvement: 1). Standard room was WAY to small. Our king-size bed took up most of the standing room. Forget about using the ironing board...You practically have to stand on your head! Luckily my husband and I were celebrating our anniversary and really didn't mind the close quarters...Had we been there for more than two nights, or had there been ONE more person in the room, it could have gotten pretty ugly. 2). The fitness center was nice and had a variety of equipment, but only 2/4 treadmills worked. In a hotel that size, it was totally inadequate. 3) The walls are tissue-paper thin. I was in the hallway, a full five doors away from our room and I could hear my husband's telephone conversation quite clearly despite the fact that he was speaking in a regular tone of voice. 4)  An in-room coffee pot has become a standard amenity at most hotels...*ahem... Did someone forget to mention that to the staff at the Allegro? 5) Speaking of beverages, where did they hide all the vending machines? Oh yeah, they don't have any. I guess this is to ensure that we'll purchase the high-priced drinks/snacks from the in-room ""wet bar"". The wine hour didn't make up for it either, since we don't drink alcohol. I suggest you take a stash of pop if you're in the same boat.  6) Word of caution: Even though it's located in a great place, surrounding restaurants tend to close early...maybe because everyone heads to the theaters? Don't get caught hungry after about 6 pm. Your choices will be severely limited unless you want to get a cab.Finally, would we stay again? For the quality and price, you betcha!.",Y
3697,wow. got this room on http://hotwire.com for $100 while everyone else is paying upwards of $230. what a beautiful place. sofas in the elevators? check softest bed you will ever sleep on? check super nice staff? check parking? check quiet after hours? check great food and bar? check hot spot of old chicago money? check room looking like the one from my best friend's wedding? check a very satisfied customer.,N
1091,"I am sad to give this hotel only 2 stars because I was looking forward to staying here.  It was a complete disappointment. We stayed for the 2010 Chicago Marathon.  If running the marathon, do not make the Fairmont your first choice, regardless of how close it is to the starting/finish line & runner reunite stations. So many things went wrong with our visit and I would be reluctant to book with them again for the 2011 marathon. When we checked in, we were given a smoking room despite requesting a non-smoking room. The room reeked of smoke...as if someone just had a cigarette in the room right before we entered.  I was with my husband and children (3-years and a 15-months), and it was completely unacceptable to have them breathing this polluted air.  And I would be running 26.2 miles...it was beyond upsetting that I'd be breathing this air the night before the big run.  The one bed also seemed a bit 'off' like it was hastily made. We called the front desk to explain the situation and were told the hotel was fully booked and the best they could do was have maintenance clean the room again.  They could not commit to a time though, told us to go out for a few hours, and hopefully it would be in better shape when we got back.  Staff was not terribly rude, but they were certainly less than helpful or sympathetic to our issues. We proceeded to look for other accommodations rather than stay here.  While we were looking for hotels, my kids knocked over the wastebasket.  Lo and behold, they found a box of cigarettes, a bottle of beer, and a used condom (not in its wrapper) and the torn condom wrapper.  Thankfully the condom was stuck to the bottom of the wastebasket, so my kids didn't touch it.  We immediately called the Front Desk, let them know what we discovered, and within 5 minutes, they called us back and moved us to a nicer, non-smoking room. Obviously, the room was not cleaned before we arrived (or at least cleaned properly), and I assume someone may have even been in there moments before we arrived which could explain the strong cigarette smell that we encountered and mussed up bed. Again, I'm extremely disappointed to have to write a terrible review, because the Fairmont is in a wonderful location and seems to be as classy as the other reviewers note.  We often use the Fairmont in my company as well, and I've heard good things about them.  But obviously our experience does not say much for their cleanliness. I do give it two stars because I appreciate the staff getting us into another room quickly, though, I wish we didn't have to come across a used room and condom to get there.  Oh, and in-room dining was good, including the big bowl of pasta I had to prepare me for the marathon.",N
5362,"I had a wonderful time staying the the Wheeler Mansion Hotel Chicago. The accommodations were exquisite, quiet and clean. The new manager, Stephanie, made sure all my needs were met.

4207,"The lobby is decorated a bit tacky, but overall the hotel is nice, and pretty inexpensive considering the location. The concierge was absolutely wonderful, and the guy at the front desk was pretty awesome, too. Rooms are a little small, but the view was nice. There is also a bar around the corner - Houlihan's. The drinks were, (obviously), less expensive than the hotel bar most of the people were locals - you get enough interaction with the tourists in the hotel. Although not 4-star worthy as their website indicates, it was a nice hotel - I have no complaints.",N
3073,"I love W Hotels and try to stay at them when I can. The W Chicago Lakeshore is located right on Lake Michican (well, across the street  from it) and has the typical W feel and vibe. It appears as if this was an older property that was converted into a W Hotel a while back. Not the coolest or newest of W properties that I've stayed at, but when I'm back in Chicago I'll stay at the W Chicago Lakeshore again (or check out its sister property, W City Center).",N

We reported this to the management who assiged us to rm 1901 and promised to get the room inspected and ""taken care of"". I insisted that they get all my clothes laundered, which they did. Interestingly, no one from the management, other than the security guy who came when we first complained, even offered any apology for the inconvience. I missed couple of meetings that day. The next day, I called as I forgot something in the previous room, only to discover that the room was already assigned to the next guest. So much for reporting!",N

For the location it isnt bad, lot of good shopping in that area. Keep in mind parking is at least $35 a night in that area.",N
4358,"Considering this place is a 4 star hotel, I was slightly disappointed with the room decor. The hotel lobby area was so grand and beautiful. I was sure the rooms would be just as nice. Unfortunately, I was slightly let down once I walked into my room. The lighting could've been a lot better, the bathroom door didn't close correctly, and the TV they had was probably the oldest TV I've seen in a hotel room in a while (it wasn't even a flat screen...WTF?). I don't like how these ritzy type hotels charge for internet. I mean, if you're going to charge us that much for a room, at least provide us with some internet so we can get work done, check our emails, Yelp...you know? But other than that, I was comfy in my room. Location was great, next to Millennium Park, short walk from the Cultural Center and Art Institute, and a bunch of restaurants nearby. There was also an entrance to the subway line right in front of one of the hotel entrances. I'm not quite sure if I'd stay here again. Depends on the neighborhood and prices and everything. I wouldn't say that I would never consider this place again, but maybe I'll check out something new if I were given the opportunity.",N
2860,"I'm not usually a fan of the Sheraton, but this time, I really had a great experience that was much better than my last two stays at each of the two W Hotels.   Several great things: 1. Price - I booked far in advance so was fortunate to get a good rate of about $215 and ended up with a corner room on a high floor, so was very pleased.  That said, they did fill up quickly, and the rate goes up when that happens. 2. The bed was comfortable, plenty of pillows.   3. Great location - just a few blocks from the Lake, which has a nice running path. 4. Nice restaurants and room service. 5. Friendly staff.   6. Free bottled water in the rooms. 7. Minibar that left space for me to put my own drinks in the fridge. A few problems though: 1. My window wouldn't open.  They were very nice about it and sent a technician who was friendly and fixed it pretty quickly, so no minus points. 2. The shampoo.  The Westins and Ws have pretty nice shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc, but the Sheraton stock supplies are horrendous.  No body wash is provided, only a crappy bar of soap.  No face was is provided.  And the shampoo and conditioner leave my hair feeling like I washed it with glue.  Bring your own and please complain so hopefully they change it.  Minus one star. 3. They double charged me for internet because I connected on Wi-Fi and with the wired connection.  But they fixed it immediately when I called in and emailed me my updated bill, so no minus stars.  Internet was still pretty slow, though. Overall, a 3.5 star experience, that I'm rounding up to 4.",N
5380,"I checked out a day early and drove 4 hours in the middle of the night to get away from this hotel. This is a warning for you, even if you think the price is good! This hotel is terrible and the photos at their website are grossly misleading. Even understanding that is an old building, that doesn't excuse the other issues going on inside the rooms. First of all, we asked for a new room after being put in a tiny corner room (that looked like a prison cell) on the 8th floor because it smelled so badly like urine and mildew. Our second room (the exact same room, only on the 11th floor) wasn't much better. It was mildewy, but less of a urine odor. To be honest, we didn't spend much time in the room the first day. Here are the other issues with the rooms: the elevators are very slow, the TVs are old and have horrible reception, the air conditioning is via a window unit which barely works and only blows air through the mildew smelling curtains (which you have to keep closed because there are people working in the buildings adjacent), it takes forever for the water to get warm let alone hot, there were dead bugs smashed on the bathroom wall, hair everywhere, mold on the shower curtain and just an overall feeling of uncleanliness. We left early due to the fact I have mold allergies and I began to develop an upper respiratory infection. The manager still charged us for 1/2 the day, but we were just happy to leave. We drove 4 hours back to Detroit to get away. Yes, we left the Chicago Travelodge for Detroit if this gives you any idea of how terrible this place was. (I've never missed Detroit so badly!) The mold is something that is embedded in the carpet, tile, etc. The mildew sheets and curtains could be better if they used better laundry techniques, so I felt that this is just a cheap place to stay. I would never stay here again, or recommend it to anyone.",Y
5699,"We had a few family members in Chicago for the weekend, so we booked a room at the River Hotel because of the location. It's close to Wacker Drive and the room was contemporary albeit on the small side. Went out to meet a few people for dinner and we came back finding out that the AC was not working. We alerted the staff at the lobby and realized that the maintenance guy had left for the day. How can the hotel not have a maintenance person 24 hours a day? Needless to say, we were shocked to hear about it. We did not pay more than $150 and get a room that is as warm as an oven. When the staff learnt about our story, they unempathetically asked us to open the windows instead!!! Mind you, that does not make any sense considering the weather outside was about 90 F. They then offered to move us to another location away from the river but we refused because we chose the location for a reason and it is an unnecessary inconvenience to us at our expense. It was not our fault to begin with. After that they offered us a crappy fan which finally worked when we gave it a few knocks. It was a warm and miserable night for our family who came all the way to Chicago expecting something wonderful from this hotel. The next morning, we mentioned about it at the front desk again and all they could do was apologized. Not a single time did they compensate us in a form of a lower rate for putting us through this. After all, we did not sign up for a room which has AC problems. After much complains, the staff finally offer us a free upgrade if we come back the next time. That is not acceptable. What is the use of a free upgrade if the AC is not going to work?? Well, we won't be coming back anyways. He can keep his offer. You shouldn't come here either.",N
4195,"I went here for a conference and enjoyed everything they had to offer. The staff was attentive, courteous and discreet.

3601,"An Open Letter to The Drake Hotel: I have to say that I was most displeased with the way The Drake Hotel handled a situation early Saturday morning. Just before 1am on 9/3/11, I awoke to screaming from a friend of mine: ""SOMEONE JUST RAN OUT OF OUR ROOM!"" The two of us who had retired just after midnight awoke startled and saw our other friend who awakened us run out of the room. While we slept, someone had entered our room and taken the cash ($300) out of my friend's wallet on the nightstand next to the bed. They then proceeded to reach over me while I slept on my cot and took the cash out of my wallet ($250), which was on the floor next to me. They then left the room and encountered our friend in the hallway. The security staff at The Drake Hotel was less than helpful. They took a report and left us with the phrase, ""Well, these things happen."" When we asked them to call the police for us the best they could do was give us a phone number (the wrong one) and we had to call CPD ourselves. The police have been most helpful and the detective in charge has informed us that he thinks he knows who committed the crime. These leads me to believe that this is probably not the first time something like this has happened at The Drake. I am most bothered by two things. First, at no time were we dealt with as victims of a crime by the staff at The Drake. Rather, we were treated like ignorant tourists, unaware of life in Chicago. There was no sympathy - only bored indifference. Secondly, The Drake has a stated policy behind the front desk that says no one without a key card will be allowed in after midnight. When we arrived back to our room on Saturday AFTER MIDNIGHT, no one stopped us to check our room key or even acknowledged our presence. Sunday after midnight however, we were stopped - a welcome change to be sure but TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE. This incident could have been so much worse and I am still haunted by the ""what ifs."" What if I had woken up as some criminal reached over me to grab my wallet? It is not a far stretch to imagine that I could have been injured or even killed. Would the staff of The Drake have cared then? My group has been coming to The Drake for years in order to celebrate Notre Dame's opening weekend. We have always assumed that we would be safe inside her walls - an assumption that we will never make again. Not only has The Drake Hotel lost our business but it, along with the entire Hilton chain, has lost our trust. Since The Drake Hotel has decided to ignore our situation and refuses to even regard it with an apology, I will take all measures to spread the word about what happened. Along with passing a warning to visitors on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media avenues, I also intend to publish an editorial regarding the event in my magazine. I'm sad that it has come to this. I expected better from such a reputable American institution.",N

621,"Stayed here 4 nights during my first time visiting Chicago.  Couldn't be more impressed: 1.  Service: Every Doubletree employee was SO nice and helpful.  They helped with directions, always had a pleasant demeanor, and let us check our luggage into a room since our checkout was in the afternoon and our flight was during the evening.   2. Beds- These beds are INCREDIBLE.  I must admit that although I was excited to be exploring Chicago for the first time, there were moments that I thought about how excited I was to get back to the hotel so I can curl up in the bed.  Yes, they were THAT amazing. 3. Location- the location is perfect.  it's right in the middle of shopping & dining, and public transportation...we had no problems getting around and catching buses within a block from us. 4.  The smell-I have no idea what scent Doubletree uses but I want to buy it in a bottle and febreze my closet, sheets, and apartment in this scent!!! The entire hotel smells sooooo gooood. Thank you, Doubletree Magnificent Mile.",N
3030,"I loved this hotel! It was walking distance to the Navy Pier and it was surprisingly cheap. I stayed here during the week for work and it was well worth the price. The room was great - nice flat screen hotel, bliss products, comfy robe. I also loved the decorations! I had a bunch a boxes shipped to the hotel for a tradeshow I was in town to attend and they did not charge any extra for receiving them (many hotels do this and they charge by weight). All of the staff was extremely friendly. When I am here next year I will be sure to book here!",N
744,"This Westin is great! We went during Taste of Chicago and it was the most inexpensive hotel I could find on/near the Magnificent Mile ... considering the location and amenities offered I think it's an excellent value. Yes, it's somewhat sterile in terms of decor because there's nothing trendy or flashy about it... they focus more on form than function with their comfy beds, dual shower head, etc. Service was very friendly (friendly than the Hard Rock!) and I highly recommend it.",N
1198,"After walking 1.5miles from the Adler Planetarium to get to the Hyatt the Staff was super friendly even though I looked sweaty and gross with my giant back pack I was lugging around. Everything I would expect from a 4star hotel pool-check sun tanning balcony-check fitness center-check 4different places to eat within the hotel- check King size bed and extra clean +roomy room all a major check. Reason why not 5 stars its a little further away from downtown but the CTA runs right outside the hotel which makes it easy to commute, and no free wifi Come on 10dollars a day?! its 2011 starbucks and coffee shops give free wifi If I'm staying at a 4star hotel I would expect that to be free too but oh well. I would come back when I'm back in town.",N
3633,"Although I've never stayed at the Drake, I went to High Tea after seeing The Nutcracker several years ago. I like the Drake's ""old-fashioned"" feel and authentic atmosphere. With all the renovations happening everyday, it's nice to visit somewhere from another time. As for the tea, I think it's something everyone should experience once in their life. The food was good--finger sandwiches, scones, tea (obviously). And the tea was even better. Compared to the Ritz, tea at the Drake seemed more believable, more appropriate.",N
1165,"I was very surprised that a hotel in such a good location offered free parking and free internet. By free, I mean there's no hidden charges! I stayed there in mid March and was very surprised at how well decorated the rooms were. My boyfriend and I decided to get the queen sized room (it was very spacey). The bathrooms were very clean and well stocked with towels and toiletries. The location was wonderful because it was right by the Magnificent Mile and State St. We walked to everything without a problem, even late at night. There's a McDonalds right across the street, next to the Rainforest Cafe. I highly recommend booking the rooms online. Checking in took me literally less than a minute. I just had to show him my ID and picked up my room keys. Checking out was also a breeze because I had prepaid for the room online. All I had to do was return the room keys. We will definitely stay there again!",N
5348,Had a great stay at Hampton Inn & Suites over the weekend.  The staff was extremely friendly & welcoming.  The rooms were clean and updated.  I would stay there again.We went to Howl @ the Moon for a birthday party and it was super close to that and alot of other bars!,Y
350,"Though I haven't had an opportunity to stay at this hotel, I must comment on the customer service I received when calling for some information! I had several question regarding my travel plans...parking and nearby lots, the best restaurants in the area and fun nightlife I was interested in. I spoke with Edwardo on the phone (front desk person) and he was very helpful and courteous in answering all of my questions. I felt like i was on the phone with GOOGLE! Very informative and patient, he really helped me with my trip details! I can't wait to book my stay, I know that if all else fails the customer service will be there to accommodate me.",N
5253,"I stayed at the Hyatt McCormick Place and was very impressed. The suite was beautiful, the views were outstanding. We were able to view a fireworks display at the Navy pier form our room on Saturday night - I wondered if Liz, the  Guest Experience Manager, ordered that display for our party. Service was excellent, the suite was excellent and very roomy. The view of downtown Chicago and the lake were awesome. The staff was great and helped us out by providing extra trash cans in the room. We had a get together at my suite after the graduation, 30 people and tons of food fit easily. The staff helped us transport the supplies and food in and out of the hotel.It was an excellent location as I was attending an event at UoC. Access to downtown was very easy.  I would very much like to stay here again. As a matter of fact, it was very hard to leave the room to head back home. LCD tv, great walk-in closet, nice living room area and very highly recommended!I want  to thank Liz and the staff for making my stay a memorable and enjoyable stay.",Y
414,"Don't stay here, the you're better off going to the adjacent hotels for a better hotel stay and are more accommodating than the Hilton.  The Mariott and Hampton have been a better experience for myself and was just a little more money per night.  Paper thin walls that everyone can hear you and neighbors will complain when coming back from the night.  You only get one personal warning and the second time they come up they will kick you out by force.  We were literally in the hotel for 30 minutes before we were told we were being kicked out.  We were kicked out with excessive force by police after trying to negotiate with the manager who was stuck on kicking us out.  We had 8 police officers escort people who were quiet by the time the officers came.  Not worth the cost for people enjoying the city or even for business trips since everyone can hear everything.   I've already told our sales force to never book any nights here and instead, we go to the Marriott now.",N
2776,"Been here, it's a very nice place and the bar downstairs is definitely a place to get a drink. I would stay here again, very comfortable and clean. Just the way I like it and being downtown is a + as well!",N
2508,Nice hotel! the food was just OK!,N
3304,"The Hard Rock Hotel is in one of the best spots in Chicago - smack dab in the Magnificent Mile right on Michigan Avenue.  Outside - it looks like an obselisk reaching towards the sky but the inside is very chic and the customer service here was great.  I visited a friend who stayed here last year and she raved about how awesome it was.  From the vallet attendants to the hotel manager, Hard Rock Hotel staff went above and beyond what is expected of a five star hotel for her - she's a baller so she booked a suite in their private tower and what impressed me is that they only have three rooms per floor.",N
2502,"Before I moved to Chicago, I stayed at the Hilton & Towers twice.  Each experience was very enjoyable -- and comfortable beyond belief!  Normally, I'm the type of person who is hauling her pillow around place to place, and for the first time ever I didn't need to use my own because the hotel pillows were perfect!  Our room was super sized, including two full sized, separate bathrooms.  It was very cozy, and I'd definitely recommend it.",N
5240,"As someone who traveled every weekend during undergraduate and graduate school, this is BY FAR THE WORST hotel stay I have EVER experienced. Apparently this hotel can't keep up with the expedia orders and there is around a three hour delay from the point you make the reservation to the point the hotel enters it. Now, this is a KNOWN issue, but of course there is no warning on their page or in their e-mail. So when I showed up luggage in hand (an hour and a half after making the reservation) after waiting in line for 10 min, I was informed that I would have to wait for her to deal with the other 10 people before she could help me. This took about 45 min. It should never take 45 to check into a hotel. Moreover, when I finally got up to the desk the women took the confirmation sheet and asked for my ID. I informed her that the person I was sharing the room with made the reservations. She informed me that she could not allow me to check in until the girl got there. Since she was at a work function I would have had to wait for about 7 hours. I asked her if there was anything I could do and she just stared at me blankly. Finally, I asked to speak to a manager. Once with the manager I explained the situation and put him on the phone with the girl I was rooming with. He was hostile towards her but finally agreed to let me in the room. Next, I get to the room and try to connect to the 'free' internet. Of course it is not working. I'm not really surprised at this point. I call the in house help number, which puts me through to the front desk which is plainly pissed that I am calling, and unable to tell me anything other than to call the Broad Band Support number. I call they tell me the problem is at the hotel and they are going to call the hotel to try and fix it. It never got fixed. The I was like well there is no internet, so i'll check out the pool. Of course, the other information not posted is that their pool is an outdoor and has been closed for MONTHS.Then when I get back to the room, half of the lights in the room don't work,WORST HOTEL EVER. DO NOT STAY HERE.",Y
4216,One of my favorite hotel lobbies - so good for casual drinks with friends.,N
4198,"the good: *convenient location *when they didn't clean out the room in time, they upgraded us to the top floor. the bad: *they forgot to bring us another comforter, and when they did, they literally left it tossed on the bed *it could've been a lot cleaner *there was a mysterious charge that showed up on the bill (it was erased, though.) i suppose i would give it 3.5 if possible, but i'm rounding down to a 3.",N
394,"We decided to take a weekend and pretend we were tourists, hotel, museums, whole bit.  We found a reasonable deal at the Hilton Garden by checking prices and waiting until the day before to book the room.  It has a great location (grand and state) right by the Red Line L.  We were close to everything we could ask for.  The room was really spacious and all their beds are Sleep Number beds now, so its fun to play around with that.  There are a ton of families, usually coming to and from the pool, so we were never alone in the elevator.  Which inhibited us from getting the token ""mirrored ceiling in the elevator pic.""   In your room you'll find a menu of places that deliver, and you MUST order from the breakfast delivery place.  It's a RELIGION, and the true way to a woman's heart is good breakfast delivery. Well... this woman, anyway.",N
3798,I really enjoyed staying at this swank hotel. Minus 1 star b/c the bathroom/ shower is a bit awkward if you're staying with somebody you're not dating/married to. Basically a shower with a window into the room but to close it the curtain is on the outside of the shower in the bedroom... Everybody working there was great and the rooftop bar/lounge was nice. Security was quick to tell a rowdy room to be quiet when we called to complain at 3:30 in the morning.,N
31,"I agree that this place is pretty small, but in the city it's hard to find a place this cheap that isn't. The value is huge with this place. It's in a great place, standard high-er end rooms, and above all pretty quiet. We stayed Halloween weekend and had no issues with hearing people in the hallway/people hearing us. The crowd seemed to be mixed, some young some older so I was little worried about noise level, but nothing happened (which is more than I can say for some of my other hotel visits). I mostly interacted with the night guy. He was great. Really knew a lot about the hotel/area and he was very friendly- even went out of his way to find me a lighter :) The biggest downside was really just that they never asked if we needed more than one key, so at a few points in time I got locked out of the room and had to call someone to let me back in... but that was pretty minor :) Can't wait to stay again!",N
1170,"Great deal.  We got the ""internet only"" deal and then used a coupon for a $10 upgrade to a suite. All this is on their own web site. The suite coupon was ""subject to availability""  but we got one without trouble. One king bed and one couch bed.  The suite was  very comfortable and clean.  Fridge, two TVs, lots of chairs to relax in.  Looked brand new, no marks on wall, etc. Staff are very helpful with tourist tips. Right across the street from Hard Rock Cafe and Rain Forest Cafe but room is quiet.  EASY walk to the Magnificent  Mile and the amazing stores (check Bloomingdales for the stain glass windows). No breakfast or any restaurants in the hotel, they do have a bar. Free broadband Internet. Essentially a basic , clean place  . A suite in a downtown area with FREE parking for $100 a night (plus 23% tax) !!!",N
4076,"Waiting in line to get my room. Got a top floor room. King bed with the desk behind the bed so I could work on my laptop and see the TV at the same time. Nice room and comfy bed.  The only thing that freaked me out was upon settling in, I opened my 34th floor window to see my view only to find no less than 3 HUGE spiders hanging out outside and many, many egg sacks in the creases. Who knew bugs made it up that far a building. I wonder if they have ever been down the building or if they just live their whole lives up there swaying in the breeze.",N
4615,"Nice boutique hotel. All of the staff we interacted with were friendly and helpful.  I was nervous due to some of the reviews complaining about the size of the room, but it was fine. On the small side but if you aren't spending a lot of time in the room (we were out most of the day, used the room for sleeping). The room had a nice modern decor and we had a nice view. Close to Mag Mile, banks, Starbucks and Sports Authority (in case you need ponchos or jackets due to unpredictable Chicago weather, hint;) Not so positives: Did not like the bathroom sink, too shallow, bad design, was clogged. Doors tend to close very loudly. This was very apparent with the jerk next door who kept going in between rooms early on morning. Loved Chicago, would definitely stay here again.",N
2244,"This Chicago hotel is a classic, but had seen better days until the recent renovation of the historic building.  I was in town for a meeting at the property otherwise I probably would have selected somewhere else. When I checked in and the receptionist indicated my room was in the 'historic tower"" I got a chill up my spine.  She most have noticed because she then went on to explain the recent renovation.  While my room on the 17th floor was still a bit oddly shapped, it had in fact been lovingly renovated.  The hotels old signature grill work and other decorative pieces (see the ballrooms) are still in place, but the guest rooms are modern and comfortable.  The pool, if you haven't seen it, is certainly worth a visit.  The hotel location with a door right out to the center of The Magnificent Mile makes its location unbeatable.  With a great new wine bar (serves great wines with nice little cheese, olive or sweet plates), the hotel is once again on my list of favorite historic properties.",N
2305,"Excellent location obviously and the shared areas are pretty nice but the rooms are underwhelming. Did have a yummy crunchy french toast at the restaurant and the bar has an excellent selection of local brews. All in all, not bad, but far from great.",N
2252,This was barely a three star. The only redeeming quality was the comfy bed. I got the historic tower aka old. It was terrible. I couldn't even look out the window because it was a little square window over my head. It was more like a prison window. You also have to pay for the gym which is cool but they should tell you ahead if time so you don't need to go up and down the elevator to gain access. Very disappointed.,N
3361,"Best rates in the area yet excellent service and comfortable room.   Friday night in July - King size bed - $179 plus $31 TAX (Thanks Daley, Stroger, Blago) Free shuttle service to area attractions including Navy Pier or the Museums.   Nice big pool for the kids and full service restaurant & bar for the adults.   Grant Park is just across the street and great food choices are within a few blocks.   I recommend bringing the bikes and go across the street and head south towards the museums for an awsome lakeside ride.   The only street I crossed was right at the hotel.   The bike trails takes you under LSD and over the Metro tracks.",N
3874,"Cool, affordable place to stay in the River North area.  Love the room, free internet, great service & amazingly low priced mini bar (comparatively)!",N
997,"Located in River North, the Amalfi Hotel is in an excellent location. You can walk to House of Blues, great food, and shopping. The El is about a block away. The hotel is very well decorated with modern furniture and design. Unfortunately, you need to be lucky to get a good view. The hotel is surrounded by brick buildings and you're more likely to be staring into an alley instead of the skyline.",N
1873,"I  haven't been to the W Chicago - City Center in a while, so I thought it was time for a visit while in Chicago.  I'm a points whore so doing a ""mattress run"" is a no brainer for me. Hotel is located in the southwest portion of the loop, directly across from the Quincy CTA station. I arrived at 11 AM and noticed the lobby has been renovated.  It's eclectic modern.  Oversized lamps and an s curve sofa make up the main area of the ""living room"".   I walk thru the living room and over to the pods which are located in front of the elevators and I'm greeted warmly by not just one, but two staff members. Since it was so early I was going to ask if my luggage could be stored until check-in time and ill go out and do some other things.  They tell me no problem and as a returning guest they've assigned me a nice suite.  Surprisingly I was told my room was ready.  The property recognizes my Elite status, asks if I need a late checkout and inquires if I need my receipt emailed to me after check out..  Little things like this go a long way.   I go around the corner and enter what I describe as the vertigo elevators of death.  If you look at that mural for too long, you'll be sure to earl. I walk into my room to find I've been upgraded to a room I'd previously been assigned.  The room has been renovation the wall and door that separated the parlor from bedroom have been removed. There is now one central wall that houses a flat screen TV for each ""room"" When you enter the room, there is a powder room on the right and closet on the left.  As soon as you pass thru the entry you're in the parlor portion of the room.  There is a wet bar are and a half wall with a TV above and a desk below.  The desk is nice and very practical but with only a few sockets. The furniture on the parlor side of the room is a bit tacky and its like the hotel was trying to hard to be eclectic.  It's just didn't do anything for me. The sofa is hideous! Passing thru to the bedroom side of the room, the decor is much better, now this what I  think a W should ""look"" like.  The W Bed is totally inviting.  On the wall is 40 HD TV that is identical to the TV in the parlor. Due to the location there is not much of a view, but the room does offer a view of the Quincy CTA Station, which is perfect for train spotters.  I thought being close to the train might cause some noise, but I didnt hear a peep Off the bedroom is a hallway that houses a closet and leads you to the bathroom.  The bathroom is rather awkward. Walking into the bathroom, on the left near the door is the sink and to the right is the toilet and tub/shower. Disappointing that the room doesn't have a double vanity and that there is no separate shower. The sink is pretty small and does not leave much space to spread out. Two people cannot use the sink area at once.  In addition, I got water everywhere.  The room doesn't have a shower only a tub, but it's got some nice hardware and good water pressure.  The bathroom is stocked with the typical Bliss sink side six pack of toiletries. Sweat has nice equipment, cardio machines and free weights, but there is no pool. Some additional information: There is a small business center on the mid mezzanine level. High speed internet available for free in the lobby and its $14.95 in room and the hotel offers Acura service within five miles of the hotel. At checkout on of the associates I'm familiar with said, ""you're one of my favorite guest. You're so funny.  You've got to stay with us for more than just one night the next time you come."" FINAL IMPRESSION If you'd like a good hotel while in Chicago this is the place for you.  Just know that on weekends there isn't much around the hotel, so you'll need to travel outside of the loop for dining and entertainment options. The overall staff attitude has greatly improved.  They appeared to be appreciative of being employed and more than willing to help.   After checkout, I had a small billing issue (this is why I always request that my folio be emailed) where 36 dollars of items from the mini bar was charged to my folio.  When I called about this, it took a minute to remove, the staff apologized and I wasn't made to feel like a liar.  Good recovery and follow-up was good.   I would return to this hotel based on price and time of year, in the winter months i would prefer to be closer to Michigan Avenue. It's a nice hotel for a business or leisure traveler, but better suited for the business traveler based on the location.",N
1954,"This was the cleanest hotel I have ever been in. The service was also fantastic. Every person I encountered was wonderful from the doormen, to the wait staff, to the cleaning personnel. The service and friendliness made my weekend getaway fantastic!",N
3052,"Located on Lakeshore drive and directly across the lake, the outdoor patio and rocking chairs have an awesome view. It's absolutely relaxing. Everything about the W is super chic. There are awesome bamboo chairs in the reception area. The bar/restaurant, Wave, has comfy chairs and a bigger area in the back where you can lounge comfortably. The drinks were super yummmmmy! The Wave-jitos was refreshing, but the bloody mary was my favorite - it was light and tasty. We also got some side dishes: broccolini and truffled risotto. It took a long time and I ended up scarfing down a lot of the garlic/cheese crackers. The room layout is a typical hotel room, but the small touches makes it special. I love bathrooms and this one especially! There's a window that looks directly into the rest of the room (yes, there are shades so if you have friends over, you can do your business in private) and a sliding door. The shower doesn't have a door and there's a rain type shower head. The Bliss fab six sits on the shelf along with a robe. There's a mini bar and safe and a LED TV. You have the option of a wake up call or using their wake-up CD in the alarm clock provided. My room was on the 31st floor, you have to slide your key in the elevator in order to go up and when we got to my floor, we noticed a telescope next to the window in the lobby. Heeheee.... peeping time! We checked out all the people in boats in the lake. Fun times! Lastly, the staff is super friendly and very helpful. Definitely a good hotel choice. OH and there's a Bliss spa in the lobby... what else can you ask for?",N
181,"This was a great location for what we were doing in Chicago, and they take pets (although ours wasn't with us).  The rooms were nice, and it was a nice property.  This definitely isn't a high-end Hilton, but there was nothing wrong with it.  It felt a bit stale - like some of the downtown hotels that you experience in New York.   That said, we enjoyed our stay and the price was right.",N

5053,"I'm comparing this hotel to the Embassy Suites Chicago Lakefront at 511 North Columbus, Chicago, IL, the Embassy Suites at Washington Square in Beaverton, OR, and my prior experiences with Hilton resort properties.I stayed there with my wife and our 2 y.o. infant for 3 nights in October 2010.The Good: The staff was very, very friendly and helpful.  I had to take a breakfast tray back to my room while managing an infant, and a staffperson offered to help me without me having to ask her.The location is also very convenient as it's located in the heart of the River North district.  A Jewel/Osco is across the street.The Bad:The rooms are outdated.  The walls are thin.  The bathroom smelled funny.  The carpet was musky.  The sleeper sofa was outdated.  And the curtains don't blocked out enough light.The breakfast buffet was very poor.  The scrambled eggs were rubbery (even when they served a new batch.)  The fresh cantaloupe and honeydew tasted stale.  The omelets used frozen spinach and not fresh. They did not rotate their offerings.Summary:I will never stay here again.  It was not worth the money to me to stay in a sub-par room and be served a sub-par breakfast.  In the future, I will either spend the same money on a better room and buy breakfast separately.",Y
2457,"I was in town for Lollapalooza and stayed at another hotel down the street for Friday and Saturday.  On Sunday night, I was just planning on crashing on a friend's couch.  But I looking on the web and found out someone picked up the Hilton on Priceline for $70 for Sunday night.  Sure enough, my $70 bid did it and now I had a place to cool off inbetween bands, as the Hilton is right across from the park. Couldn't ask for a better room... love the dual plugs in the lamb on each nightstand.  Totally awesome hotel layout.  Apparently the building was put up in 1929, and it looked like it was probably THE spot back in those days.  My only gripe was the overpriced ($14.95/day!!!) wifi.  Staff was excellent, though!",N
403,Very good HGN in a fantastic location and not that expensive either. If noise does bother you then become a member of Hilton Honors. That way you can specify to be put in a higher level room and away from the elevator. This is what I do and I haven't had an issue.,N

4795,"My husband and I met my parents at the Wit, they were staying there, and overall we were disappointed. We had a few drinks on the very crowded roof top deck. Our waitress was nice, but evidently miss informed. As we were getting ready to leave we asked if we could take our drinks with us to our room, to which she replied ""of course"". Obviously that was wrong, because as we left my husband was surrounded by about six employees, who ALL proceeded to tell him he could not leave with any drink, even to go back to our room. We've never been to a place where you could finish your drink in your room. Bummer, we won't be going back there any time soon.",Y

Anyway, this really was a fabulous hotel. It was quiet and sort of minimalist without seeming austere. The concierge had that kind of haughty politeness that only concierges at fancy hotels can rightly have. The bed was *amazingly* comfortable. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The European breakfast comprised very tasty baked goodies. And bonus points for being across the street from Trader Joe's. It's hard to imagine how you could really be disappointed booking here.",N
3781,"I haven't actually stayed here, but I spent so much time in my colleague's hotel room during her stay last week that I feel as if I stayed here... And I like this new modern looking hotel! The people who work here are super friendly. We were big fans of the concierge who didn't even blink when we asked him if he knew of any strip clubs that served lunch. The rooms are very spacious and I especially loved the hardwood floors and rain shower surrounded by glass doors on all sides (there is a curtain to shield yourself from peeping toms). Business travelers will also be thrilled to know the wifi is fast and free...and this hotel just happens to be located in a very convenient downtown location. If you get hungry Ajasteak is right downstairs and there's plenty of other good eats (quartino is always a winner) within a block of the hotel. My colleague found this room on http://quickbook.com for just over $200, which I thought was quite the deal for a quality hotel during summer in Chicago.  She seemed quite happy with her 3 nights in the hotel as well, her only complaint being that the walls were super thin so you can hear everything in the neighboring hotel rooms. I probably won't ever stay here since I live just minutes away, but I'll be recommending it to out of town visitors and may visit the inviting spa.",N
1894,"This location seems to have the smallest rooms that W has to offer.  Otherwise it is a standard modern and clean W hotel.  The room service was fine,  except for parts of the meal being cold.",N
953,"This hotel was great. The location was awesome. It was the best deal I could find for downtown (everything else was 200-400 dollars a night and the Red Roof is 119.) I expected it to be more basic than it was. The bed was comfy, the room was clean, the service was decent. The decor was modern. We requested a room that faced Ontario street like our guidebook suggested, and we got a corner room facing ontario street (windows on two walls) which was great. It even came with a fridge and a microwave. The only two things that would have made it perfect would have been coffee makers in the rooms (there is a horrible complimentary coffee machine in the lobby, which was broken half the time) and a business center where we could check our email or bank accounts online. Although the coffee situation sucked, there is a Starbucks across the street which was pretty convenient. I would definately recommend this to anyone visiting Chicago who is on a budget.",N
1702,"I am pretty shocked this is a Kimpton hotel. It is sort of like a knock off or half brother of a Kimpton. The room seems run down (wall paper separating, drawer knobs wobbly, base boards beat up, broken toilet). Yes, they had the nice Aveda bath products and nice minibar, but the comparison stopped there for sure. Next Chicago trip, I'll go back to the drake for sure.",N
2046,"This was my home for the past 2 weeks.  Luckily it was on my companies bill, because I almost went pee pee in my pants when I woke up and found the bill slipped in underneath the door. $2,124.36!!!!!!!!  Ooochee mama... and that's with NO room service, a little dry cleaning, and watching 1 movie. WOW. The Holiday Inn itself is okay, I utilized the pool a little bit, and the view from my room was just AWESOME.  (check out my photos!!!) It's connected to the Merchandise Mart (aka Chicago's World Trade Center) which is convenient since that's where my offices are. It's walking distance to just about EVERYTHING. I really did enjoy the area and the stay.  As for the hotel itself, it's about average... but the location and view makes it a prime spot. One other useful bit of information.  They have free wireless, but if the hotel is full... it got rather useless early evenings.",N
5456,"Great stay! Big rooms, nice bathroom, and good service. I did find it a little weird that the 'fitness suite' is nothing more than a converted room with some machines--but they have an elliptical, 2 treadmills and a few weights so it's not bad, just weird. Would definitely recommend, and would definitely stay there next time we're in Chicago.",N
1892,"I stayed at the W on a recent business trip...nothing but great things to say. Location is perfect if you're in the central loop. The room was clean and cozy! WE, the restaurant in the hotel, is so yummy, with a fabulous wine list to boot! The lounge is great with free wifi to tap in, check emails or go online. All in all a great trip.  I'll certainly be back.",N
5278,What a dump!  no phone or garbage can in room.  old flea hotel.  van that pick up at airport was rusted with torn seat covers.  said there was a pool...it was outside filled with rain water and brown leaves.  said on the internet..robes!!!  what a joke.  don't stay there,Y
4929,"Drake Hotel of Chicago is wonderful, I got a chance to visit this wonderful place few years ago(2006) when i was in Chicago. I was impressed with everything of hotel Drake,those moments will be always memorable for me.",Y
2341,"I attended a special event here and have to say that it was pretty nice. The lobby entrance was a little chaotic and not clean because of construction, but the conceirge staff directed me where to go for my event.  The banquet and event floor is really nice and airy. The dark red and yellow carpet complements the rich wood lining the walls. The event that I attended took up all most of the ballroom.. The ballroom matches the hallway as well. In general, the facilities were nice. The lunch that they served us was pretty good I have to say. For being hotel conference food, it was good. They served chicken parm, ceasar salad, and steamed veggies. It was a tasty, light meal that was decent. For the cocktail reception, my first cocktail was pretty strong, but the second one was a little sweeter. Out of all of the food they served, the chocolate brownie was killer. It was a good mix of sweet and rich. Best hotel chocolate brownie that I've had. In general, the hotel banquet facilties were nice and clean. The food was pretty good too.",N
3706,"I've never stayed here.  However, I interviewed the General Manager as part of a research project I was working on. I was so incredibly impressed by the staff's professionalism and staff, but even more impressed by the general manager himself. One of his quotes basically said that he's not only in the business of retaining the old memories, but also continuing to make memories (the actual quote is much better stated, but I don't have it on me at the moment). His view of cutting-edge technology (he's in favor of it) was surprising to me. But his friendliness and willingness to give me his time was even more impressive. The hotel definitely has a historic, English grandmother's-attic aesthetic. According to the interview, he's in favor of maintaining the historic feel and look of the Drake, but also wants to stay modern and relevant.",N
2405,"Having won my Chicago HQ off of Priceline for $67 a night, I was a bit disappointed when it was unveiled.  For hotels, I'm more of a contemporary modern type of guy and the photos for this place were definitely ""historical Old World"" luxury.  But, the old gal can surprise a jaded Pink Mafia member like me.   I had woken up at 345 AM to make a 7 AM flight (Why the heck did I do this on my vacation?) and then used public transit to get into the city.  I walked the remaining 5 blocks dragging my suitcase through the streets of Chicago for all to see.  Sort of a paleta man but with underwear, t-shirts, and shoes instead. Entering the building from a side entrance, the place is monstrously big (taking up a whole city block) with dark carpet and wood everywhere, shops, various public rooms, meeting rooms, and staircases galore.  Finally, I hunted down the front desk which was equally big.  But, Sara was warm, cordial, and professional - with her tone, she was able to scale down the hotel so that all that mattered was our chat. There are 14 elevators to take you to your room:  4 of them are reserved for the HHonors members' floors while I, as a member of the riff-raff, had to 'fight' for one of the other 10 elevators.  In my 2.5 days there, I never had to share one with anyone so those of you wanting to hear about ""Elevator Fight Club"" will be disappointed. Requested a wired internet room (only 30% of their rooms are capable of this - but all are WiFi enabled).  You get choices of broadband internet:  premium, advanced, basic, and hourly.  Rates per day:  $19.99, $17.99, $14.99, and $2.50 respectively.  Yes, no free internet.  Yes, it is nuts.  Forewarned is forearmed. My double/double room had 2 full bathrooms at either end of the room.  Why?  I don't know.  Reading up on the hotel, it turns out that only 300 of the 1,544 rooms have this double bathroom thing going on.  So, for you bathroom-philes, here's your personal Nirvana.  Request and enjoy.  Just for kicks, I took turns using each bathroom.  Hey, I was on vacation. The bedding and linens are upgraded with Sealy Serenity beds, high-numbered thread counts, and a good assortment of new pillows.  The bath fixtures are gold-colored so popular decades ago but functional.  My standard huge armoire had an old-school TV in it.  No in-room safe, though.  I declined the mini-bar key so if there were bundles of cash or jewelry from the Titanic in there I can't tell you. It was stuffy when I opened the door so, being a resident of the South, I knew that the first order of business was to turn on the air conditioning to the maximum setting.  When I returned from lunch two hours later, it was still unpleasant.  I called the customer care hotline:  Ann promptly answered within 2 rings, apologized when I explained the situation, and promised to dispatch maintenance immediately.  He was at my door within 5 minutes and fixed the issue within 10 minutes.  Ann called back to follow up within 5 minutes departure of the maintenance guy.  I thanked her for the prompt service and follow up.  This was a memorable part of the great service - they really do care, even if you low-balled them on Priceline. Fronting South Michigan Avenue and Grant Park, there are plenty of buses and cabs available if you want to get to other parts of the city.  The ""El"" (elevated train) is a few blocks away.  The well-designed Millennium Park, the stupendous Art Institute, and the amazing Cloud Gate sculpture (commonly called ""the Bean"") are also an easy 15-minute walk away.  Overall, the Hilton Chicago is a good value for $67 per night for even a non-traditional guy like me.",N
3533,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for our anniversary and we were more than pleased. First of all, our room was HUGE. We had a suite and were not aware of it because the room was cheap. We booked the room a week in advance on Expedia. We had a sitting area with a TV, a full bathroom, and a separate bedroom. There were two TV's,and an i-pod home (LOVE THAT). They will charge you, however, if you use the refrigerator. Stupid Chicago rule... Anywho, we also had drinks in the pub downstairs and I believe I had the best martini in my life. It is called a Castle Wrecker and you must try it--hints of raspberry, peach, and lime :) What I really liked about this place is that we are very young looking for our age and we were never discriminated for that. I have been to places where I have been looked at oddly because I look young, but I am in my mid-twenties and I can easily afford nice things. This place treated us with respect and I highly appreciate that.",N
4223,"I'm staying at this hotel for four days. My first impression as I walked in was ""awesome"" but when I checked in, the room is terrible. Mine has stained that looks like blood, cigars and the room smelled like smoke, even though it's  a non-smoking room. My parents room was so small and stuffy. My friends room were small and stained as well. When I asked the front desk if we can switch, their answer is no. This is not a great hotel to stay in. Trust me. Howevee,It's a great place to hangout at the bar, relax and chill.",N
2823,"okay, so i had a 1-night stay here over a year ago  because i won a certificate at my niece's baby shower.  i did not pay for this stay.  everything was comped, even my dinner at heaven on seven. i loved staying here, and not because it was free.  we had a suite and anything that feels like home to me wins my vote.   the room was clean.  i am a fan of cleanliness and meticulous cleaning.  i was impressed. there was a fridge and microwave. the living room area was cozy.  the bedroom was huge, i love spacious quarters.  the view was of the neighborhood, not bad!  i love chicago, although i don't like chicago costs. the hotel is ridiculously close to shopping and action.  we had a good time sightseeing and WALKING everywhere.  it was nice. the ONLY thing i did not like about this hotel is the atrium - i think it's ridiculous.  i want a hotel to be a hotel.  not a mall.  or a federal building.  i thought it was weird opening my door to an open floor.  did not like that.  but then again, i wasn't sleeping in the atrium, and i also did not pay for it, so i guess i will get over it. i would definitely stay again.  and in fact i wish i would have chosen embassy for this year's local getaway instead of the sheraton.",N
214,"For the price and location, this is a great hotel.  It's quiet and clean and all of the staff is professional.  It feels like a beach house in the middle of a concrete jungle but it was always comfortable to come back to, especially the gas fireplace. For tourism, it's only about a 10 minute cab ride to just about anywhere you want to go and any landmarks/museums you want to see.  I would absolutely consider staying here on a future visit.",N
5048,"If you like waiting, this hotel is for you.  Due to so many rooms/people in the hotel, you will always wait for an elevator.  Getting coffee or breakfast is like navigating a sidewalk in NYC.  Good luck with trying to enjoy a beverage in the afternoon.  Long line.  Better take your smartphone...  The hotel lost my dry cleaning and messed up my checkout/receipt.  Good grief!",Y
3677,"We went to Chicago for our first time just recently, and of course we had to stay at the historic Drake Hotel. It was certainly very beautiful. The next night we actually ended up staying at The Talbott hotel because this place was booked, so after that stay, I could see why I prefer boutique hotels better, like The Talbott.  The Drake had a lot of beautiful chandeliers and the atrium was amazing. I enjoyed the many references to the Queen of England, which made the place seem more regal. I did feel like I was on a special vacation being there, but the nice luxury 'special' touches that The Talbott had were missing from The Drake. Perhaps it's because it's owned by the Hilton and every Hilton hotel room is standardized the same, so that charm was kinda missing. Either way, it was a beautiful hotel and our view of Lake Michigan was really nice. We also snuck a peek of all the ballrooms and wow, are they BEAUTIFUL! What an amazing place to get married in! The one thing that really made it seem less charming was their breakfast buffet. Our waiter took a little while and the buffet was a little over $20 for nothing outstanding at all. I think the menu food is quite a bit better so I would order from that instead. All in all, it was a nice stay.",N
839,"I stayed at the Silversmith for 4 days in July.  The hotel lobby was pretty and the lounge/guest area was huge and comfortable. Our room was in an L-Shape.  I had a King Size Bed (think it was California King), desk and couch in one part of the L Shape. The other side of the L was the half Kitchen (Miniature Fridge and wet bar) and HUGE bathroom.  If anybody is curious, my room was 1012.  My friend also stayed in 512, which had the same layout as mine. One of the great things about the hotel is that they have ""Dessert"" hour from 9pm - 10pm from Mondays thru Thursday. And their dessert was impressive.  When we went, they served three types of cake (two cheesecakes and a Carrot Cake) with cookies and coffee/tea.   The weird thing that I found about the Concierge is that when you check in, they prefer that you have your Confirmation number instead of providing your name for some reason.  I sensed that they were really persistent with getting the Confirmation number before searching for your name on the system for some reason.   But my stay was great, in the middle of the loop, two blocks away from the Blue Line, next to great Pubs and shopping area.",N
3450,"I think I plan to make this a go-to place for my future Chicago stay-cations.  It's a nice old fashioned historic building with a contemporary interior.  You get the old fashioned feel from the narrowness of the building itself, but the rooms (i've stayed in a regular king room and a king suite) are really nice - clean.  with down pillows and mattress tops. I wish they had more amenities on top of the basics - more products, like lotion in addition to shampoo and conditioner and bar soap.  Some fridge room would be nice.  They should also keep a closer eye to detail - my bathroom faucet had a missing piece that looked like it broke off.  The bed and the room overall looked clean except for a random blood stain on my sheet.  I think every hotel that charges for internet is just ripping you off a little bit.  it's almost like charging you for potable water.  They do it because they can but they really shouldn't given this day and age where free wifi is not only welcome but a required amenity - charging for it is just like throwing away customer goodwill.   Breakfast in bed was good - but pricey - I guess that's what you should expect from a hotel. But if you're feeling lazy and want to pamper yourself, the food doesn't disappoint. the suite is great because you have a tv in the outer room with a desk and then some private space in the bedroom.   not great for stays longer than 1-2 nights.   the gym on the 25th floor is pretty good - well kept and with water and towels available.  some hotel gyms are just horrible but this one is nice.  could be brighter. i got the internet rate for about $109/night ($125 with tax).",N

4400,Words cannot describe how terrible this hotel is. I decided the empty airport is a better place to stay the night rather than the disgusting room that cost me $170. I've stayed in roadside motels that were better.,N
4212,the best rooms are in the west tower.  We got hooked up with a jr suite in the west tower which is way better than the east tower where we stayed in the beginning of our trip.  Huge suite and everyone was super nice.  The location is about 2-3 blocks from everything but it's a nice walk along the water on your way back.,N
3540,"One word describes this hotel to a T: sleek. From the moment you walk in the lobby door you are surrounded by modern touches and a friendly staff to boot. The rooms are relatively spacious for a downtown hotel, and the furnishings are very luxurious. After I stepped foot in the room, I never wanted to leave again. Plush zebra print chairs, a beautifully designed bathroom with a huge sparkling clean bath, and the best part of the room, the plush bed that I had to drag myself out of the next morning. I've never ordered room service before but I almost did just so I could stay in bed longer. I live in the city, so my needs for hotel accommodations are few and far between, but should I ever need a room again, I will definitely be staying at Avenue Hotel.",N
1301,"This review is for afternoon tea only. My Mom and I love afternoon tea. We go whenever possible no matter what city we're in and usually the Ritz no matter the city is outstanding. It's usually a safe bet for excellent service and quality. Not so here. Now, I'm familiar with the Chicago Ritz. I've dined here many times for dinner and the greenhouse room is a gorgeous place to stop by for a drink (pink champagne is a must). But the tea? Expensive? Yes. Worth it? No way. So disappointing! Everything had been pre-done the night or days before and then must have sat in a refrigerator. It tasted like it too. It had that old food taste. And not just the soggy and stale sandwiches. Everything tasted old. My Mom thinks now that her salmon turned. She later complained of a stomach ache from something but we're not too sure what got her ill there. I probably dodged that bullet because after my one bite of turkey that tasted day old or older I was done with the sandwich portion. My poor Mom felt better the next day but had a bad night. So it was sort of like bad icing on a really nasty cake. There was nothing fresh. Even the scones seemed nuked and were cold in places rather than being recently baked. The rolls seemed pre-done somewhere else. And who eats a cold roll with hot tea? The tea was fair. I'm something of a tea snob and would guess they're buying in massive bulk at a cheap price. It's not Mariage Frères or anything high quality by any stretch of the imagination--but they'll charge you like it is. They treat their teas badly too. They plunked the green and the black teas down on our table at the same high temperatures and then let the leaves sit the entire hour we were there meaning the last cup of tea had turned bitter by then. It's like they filled the pots from the red spigot by the industrial coffee maker. This is not how tea has ever been served to us at any other Ritzes before. Each tea has it's own temperature and time. Usually this is completely respected and every attention is paid to the finest of details. Uh...not here. Add to that not one of the three servers working the entire room could give us any help in tea selection. We each said what types of teas we enjoyed and asked them to recommend some things and the servers went and asked each other before deciding they couldn't ""decide for us"" Huh? Hoookay...... I asked for milk for my tea (East coast girls don't do cream XD) and it took over twenty minutes for the milk to arrive. The ONE time tea was poured for us (the first), (and the pots were HEAVY--too heavy for my  Mom so I had to pour for her the entire time) was when I was in the ladies room. I came out to find tepid tea waiting for me. I also couldn't find a server to help when my cup had a huge sharp chip on the rim. After ten minutes of looking around, I gave up and drank from the other side. Ridiculous to have to do that at $30+! One of our water glasses had someone else's old lipstick on the rim. Yuck. We kept asking each other is this the Ritz? Srsly? Ew. Pretty room. Bad service. Bad quality. Horrible after experience with my Mom getting ill. Next time I'll try somewhere else. This is not worth it at all.",N
4144,"Booked via PL for a rate of approximately $85 after taxes.  For this area, I was pleased. I am a Gold Passport member, although this was my first ever stay at a Hyatt due to the lack of them in areas I often stay in when spending a night somewhere, and was treated like I was an elite member.  You won't get this kind of attitude at the vast majority of any other hotel you stay at.  Was checked in at one of the Gold Passport desks only because it was empty and I was motioned over there by a clerk.  When she inquired about me being a Passport member I told her I was and she was INCREDIBLY polite and friendly despite me booking via PL.  Asked about a more quiet room away from elevators and she put me in a room in the West tower on the end.  No view, but it was definitely quiet. Loved the room.  Odd location for tv and armoire, but bed was great, and bathroom was very nice as well. Check-in area was a zoo.  Not enough room for the size of a hotel it is.  Not sure what's going on with the street entrance to the West Tower, but it just seemed odd. The one real complaint I had was with one of the guys hailing taxis and helping with bags outside.  I tipped a buck after he slung my bags in the back and he didn't even close the trunk.  I had to get out and slam it shut once we realized he was more concerned with getting the next tip. I was only here for a night and just wanting something towards the center of the city since I had one day of sightseeing on my own to do.  3-4 blocks from the Red Line, but overall a good location.  The staff impressed me the most.  Good job, Hyatt.",N
3061,Just finishing up my stay here and it's been pretty enjoyable. Let me first tell you I got a killer rate. $109 (free parking & 2 drinks tickets) a night so since parking is $48 and each drink runs your about $10 at the bar it's a pretty good deal! The staff here is great and they really try to take care of you while you are staying here. The rooms are nice - and if you get a lakeview room the view is pretty amazing.  The odd thing is with all the windows open in your room while you are taking a shower you can look at the view at the same time! I would totally stay here if - especially if I got the same rate!,N
4158,"This hotel is crap. I've stayed here twice and both stays were less than impressive. The sad part is that the owners of Hyatt live in Chicago, so you'd think they would put more effort into this property but we have nicer Hyatt's in Colorado. I've stayed in a lot of the hotels around Michigan Ave and usually don't feel the need to write a review but last night's stay was ridiculous. The weather has been pretty brutal in Chicago and my apartment does not have central air, so I thought I would treat myself to a hotel for the night. Well I used Hotwire hoping I would get anything but this place, but that did not happen. I showed up around midnight because my girlfriend and I had been to the movies. Now I find sometimes if you get a really laid back night shift crew, they won't make you put down a credit card. I mean it's already midnight and checkout is at noon, why fill out more paperwork and hassle me with having to check that the ""authorization"" drops off. Well I guess this place thinks they're the W because they would not budge on a $50 authorization. $50 bucks!!! Even if I rockstar trashed the room, I'm so sure the $50 would cover it all. Oh well I let them authorize for $50 even though my room was pre-paid and then got offered a queen bed. Not okay. I can sleep on a king at home, I'm not paying to sleep on a queen. We finally compromise with a king on a smoking floor. I then asked if they knew of any late-night delivery open because I did not have my laptop to Grubhub something. The dude hands me a Sarpino's menu. WOW! The room was just what I had expected. Paper thin walls, rock hard bed and no wine glasses(just paper cups). Yeah, we got the longest bar in the country and you can't put real glasses in the room. To top it off, housekeeping woke me up at noon even though the privacy sign was up and the front desk said if I wanted to stay till 3 PM it would be 1/2 a night in price. No thank you! Do yourself a favor and skip on this place. The W, the Dana and even the Hotel Felix are better than this dump.",N
2913,"If you enjoy and/or need a firm mattress, this hotel is NOT for you!   The Sheraton has taken the ""pillow-top mattress"" concept to a whole new level, one which I (fortunately) had never experienced.  One which takes effort to crawl out of.  One which is nearly impossible to roll over in.   One which I would dare call a ""pillow mattress"", with no back support whatsoever.  Our room had two double beds, which we ended up using because we kept sinking into each other. The linens and duvet were lovely, our room had a great view of the river, service was good, it's an easy walk to Michigan Ave... I would have given it 4 or even 5 stars with a firmer bed.   PS: We Pricelined it day-of for $89. PPS: Overnight valet parking was $48. PPPS:  It's offically called the Sheraton Sweet Sleeper(sm) Bed, a ""custom designed plush top mattress set"", introducing, ""a whole new level of comfort"".  I'm sure there are folks out there who consider it cushy indulgence; I'll let you be the judge.",N
5627,"Stayed here when went for a graduation party at the house of blues last summer. Location is ideal, only a couple of blocks from Michigan Avenue and a great view of the river. The hotel is great, nice lounge, fun decorations. The room is tastefully done. It has all the expected amenities, flat screen TV, bath robes, and the amazing beds. Westin by far has the best beds, even better than the JW's I have stayed it. Pricing is reasonable, went in the beginning of Chicago summer, and this place was $150 ish a night. Highly recommend.",N
1542,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel last week. Overall, this hotel was just ok.  I give it three starts because it did the job, but I probably wouldn't stay there again when I go back to Chicago. The room was big, it is in a great location, the view was nice, there were plenty of pillows, a spacious bathroom, and the staff was very friendly. What I wasn't too crazy about was of course, like most reviewers mentioned, the elevator.  I mean, come on!!!  There are two sets of two elevators; one set for the bottom half of the hotel and the other of course, for the top half.  You'd think that this would help the situation, but it actually didn't.  I mean, one of our two elevators was out of service the entire time we were there.  Between pressing the button to call for the elevator and getting off at whatever floor we wanted took literally about 8-10 minutes each time!!!  Holy crap, invest some money and get those things fixed.  Did I mention that each elevator can only hold 7-8 people WITHOUT luggage??? Ok, that said, there were just a couple other things that I would have liked different.  For example, they had a coffee maker in the room and gave us coffee packets but no sugar or cream, not even powdered.  The shower had absolutely no water pressure, so it took forever to wash the shampoo out of my hair.  And the hallways were really dismal and depressing looking.  There is also a huge gap between the room door and the hallway, so you might want to put a towel or something down to block out some of the voices, because you can hear every word spoken. I was also disappointed that there was no restaurant/bar in the lobby.  It is actually being renovated, but I knew that before we went on the trip by reading yelp reviews.  :)  They made up for it however, by rolling out a large cart (not as tacky as it sounds) and serving drinks in the lobby. We had a great time in Chicago, and like I said the location was great and we didn't spend much time in the room so the stay was bearable...",N
1605,"Reasonably priced hotel with great location right by the Chicago River and a block to Michigan Avenue's shopping haven. The rooms are spacious, we fit 5 girls to a room without anyone beating anyone up for space. Hotel 71 tries to display a modern and sleek look by choosing trendy and funky furniture and it works. Parking can be expensive, around $40 overnight parking. I would recommend parking across the street at the Prudential Plaza or Millennium Park Garage for $16-$20 24 hrs. parking.",N
5825,"We stayed in the motel because of it's convenient location.  Although it was a bit rundown, low lighting in the bathroom, no shampoo, low security on the windows (no screen when we opened it), it was OK the first night.  However, when we returned in the evening for the second night we discovered there was no parking space available.  We were told to double-park, and if the other person who owned the other car wanted to get out, we would be called to move our car regardless of the hour.  When we complained that we were never informed of that problem, we were verbally harassed and threatened.  We will never go back, will inform AAA personally.  Don't stay here folks.  Evanston is not that far, actually cheaper most night at the Best Western, and you'll be treated well.",Y
3831,I love this hotel!!! The corner room is the best to me! The beds are super comfy!,N
1795,"The company I was interviewing with at the time set up reservations and whatnot, so I cannot really comment on that.  The front desk was very nice and helpful about checking in.  I can't complain about the room.  Everything was comfortable and well decorated.  The view from the 5th floor was a brick wall, but that happens in Chicago.  I suppose my only complaint was the bathroom was pretty cramped, but it definitely wasn't a deal breaker.",N
2820,Nice hotel in a fantastic location. You are blocks away from all the action without getting too annoyed. I used to work at Papagus which now is Osteria van Stato so I'm very familiar with the hotel. The staff is friendly and the rooms are nice.,N
3791,"I've stayed here two times. The first time, I was extremely impressed with the hotel for the price. It's boutique-y in feel and they have a nice rain shower in the bathroom that has floor to ceiling glass that overlooks the sleeping and lounge area. The bed has plenty of pillows and is quite comfortable. The rooms are equipped with flat screens, and they have nice bath products. During my first trip, I was consistently having to have my key re-magnetized. Apparently cell phones and credit cards cause the key to malfunction. Unless I was wearing pants with pockets, and I could store the key separately in my pocket, there ws about a 60 percent chance that I'd have issues with it. The second time, I still happy with my stay, but the key issue really began to wear on me. If I weren't going in and out of my room more than once a day, maybe this wouldn't have pissed me off. About every 3 times I had to get my key re-magnetized. And I wasn't alone. Seemed to be quite a trend here. The worst was when you were in the elevator with a bunch of people who keyed the elevator so you could push your floor button, only to realize that your room key didn't work once again when you reach your room. On weekends, it's also a pain in the ass because the elevator is shared with the rooftop lounge and there are loads of drunk people you have to ride with, some who like to push all the buttons ""for fun"". (are we three?) The service is friendly and accomodating, the rooms nice, but the keys suckkkkkkk. And Friday night elevator riding does too.",N
1634,"Having spent plenty of time at downtown Chicago hotels, I cannot recommend Hotel 71. I stayed in the Executive Suite and was very disappointed by downtown Chicago standards. The hotel itself seemed as if it were under construction in some of the hallways; ceiling tiles pushed in with wires exposed, the door to the meter room on our floor was open and not secured. Walking the hallways you could hear conversations in every room that you walked by. The suite itself was way below standard, it contained four closets, no of them were in the bedroom, seating for guests around the table in the sitting room was limited because there were only two chairs for the table, there were two televisions, but of the were both tube televisions. The bathroom was sub par and must have been inspired by a motel. There was nothing high class about this suite. I suggest if you want to experience a true hotel suite experience you go somewhere else. Hotel 71 is overpricing what they offer in their suites, you can find better for their price.",N
2519,"Although I've never stayed in any of the rooms I've decided to write a recommendation based on the amazing main lobby, the grand ballroom, and the quaint Irish Bar. This is another hotel that is like a museum. The views are amazing!",N
4114,"This Hotel Sucks. It is so crowded and crazy in here and not in a ""Whooo what a party"" way. It's more like ""There are 500 kids running all over the place and I want to die"" kind of way. Outside of the completly cheap and cheesy lobby, the rooms are totally meh. The wireless internet costs $15 a day and is SO SLOW. Don't even bother getting it, you are better off checking your email on your cell phone. If you have a choice don't stay here, there are many other better hotels around the same price that are on or near Michigan AVE (Raffello for example).",N
1780,Loved this place! Went for a couple nights with some girls weekends! Enjoyed the comfy rooms with lots of space! Staff is super attentive! Such a fun place and interesting stay!,N
1025,"This was the spot i went to religiously. Stayed a couple nights every month for over a year until I decided to branch out and hit some other properties. Great location just north of the river. Walking distance to all manner of activities. Nice lobby , always a friendly staff from the doorman to the guy that works the happy hour.Rooms are standard size and beds are comfy. Get a corner room if you can its got a different layout and seems to be quieter than a regular room. Corner suite was rocken like dokken. This place also has a free happy hour from 5:30 to 7 every nite except i think Sunday. Nothing brings people out like free food and booze. Get there early and watch people descend like locusts. I once saw someone have their wedding reception at the free happy hour. Crazy! No restaurant on site but Keefer's and Harry Carey's , great steakhouse-see my review on that , are down the block. Dozens of restaurants within a couple blocks too. No pool either but that doesn't bother me Its a sweet hotel and I recomend it to anyone going to Chicago",N
28,"I can't imagine paying full price to stay here. We got a deal from a travel site, which made it worthwhile because the location is terrific. The photos on yelp seem to be professionally lit, and very misleading. If I had paid full price, I would have been pissed. But, if you're the sort of person who can deal with a youth hostel, then you'll love it here! The lobby is clean and inviting, but the charm disappears after that. Our room was small, dingey, with blistering walls, painted on crown molding, and worn drapes. No refrigerator or anything, so don't bring home any leftovers. But, on the bright site, the bed and sheets were very clean. The mattress seemed quite new--I'm a mattress inspector the instant I walk into any hotel room. The shower had AWESOME water pressure and got quite hot quite fast, and the AC could pump a lot of cold air in fast. I imagine this place was quite the jewel like 30 years ago. We did bring some leftovers into our room that got a little smelly (before we realized there wasn't a fridge) and my husband took the bag of food (from Frontera, so sad we couldn't keep it!!!) to the concierge and explained he wanted to throw it away. The guy gave my husband directions to the dumpster out back!!! OMG. Even a Ramada concierge would say, ""Oh, let me take that for you sir."" So, anyhow, if you're looking for a place to sleep, take a hot shower, and have zero expectations beyond a clean, safe place to sleep, this is your spot. It is withing walking distance of a LOT of awesome stuff. But PLEASE go find a deal somewhere on line!! If you're looking for romance, indulgence, pampering: run away!",N
1235,"This is a perfect hotel to go to if you're in town for business.   That's exactly what took me there...  I was attending a convention, right @ the McCormick Convention Center. Staying at this hotel was perfect.  No need for a cab or even walk outside, just down the elevator, walk a couple of hallways and there I was.   View from the suite was the beautiful Chicago skyline.  Everything is just a cab ride away (Michigan Ave. & Millennium Park were only 10 minutes away).   According to one of my coworkers, the hotel gym is awesome!   To eat (right at the hotel, other than room service), there's Forno, a small cafe, and there's also M/X restaurant & bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/...). Rooms are big, comfy big beds, my only complaint would be the super small fridge for a 2 bedroom suite.  We were obviously holding meetings there, we needed supplies (water, drinks, etc) to entertain our clients...  But we made it work.  Service was really good, but I do recommend you order room service with time, it takes about half an hour more than they say it will. They obviously have wireless service, shipping service, screens at their lobby with flight information, and computers to print boarding passes. Like I said, it's a great place to stay for business.",N
1955,"I stayed at the W City Center for a girls weekend.  The lobby is fabulous and sexy, but somewhat disorienting because it is soooo dark and then you sign your bill at a glowing desk - it caused a bit of stumbling around (and that was before drinks at WE).  The rooms were a bit of a disappointment - incredibly small, with little room for much else besides sleeping.  The appointments were standard, good, but nothing above average.  The mini bar was really overpriced.  The bathroom was of good size with a great shower and the Bliss bath products were the one ""extra"" of the room and greatly appreciated. We had dinner and drinks at ristorante we and the food was yummy but uninspired.  A real after-work crowd on week nights. Overall, I would recommend the W City Center if you aren't planning on spending much time in your room, or if you are by yourself.  Hanging out in the lobby and at ristorante we is a must, but that's something you can do without renting a shoebox of a room.",N
2213,"Stayed there this weekend for a wedding we were going to. Wedding and reception were in the building! We did not vallet - we had family in town that took our car for the night.... 54 bucks for a day is obnoxious. When we checked in, we had a King Suite reserved.  We were traveling with an infant & two baby sitters in tow.  The room was nice, but there was no seperation between the sitting room and bed room, eventhough it appeared so on the website.  They also said there were two bathrooms... while this room had one.  My husband called the front desk, and they told him that nothing else was available.  Boo... but we would survive.  I also had read somewhere that there was a fridge available in each room.  One more call to the front desk reveiled the fact, that only the mini bar is available.  I was informed though by the room service man, that if I opened the bar, removed items, but left them with the bar, we would not be charged, because it was not one of those lame pressure sensitive ones.  Yay!   So, my husband went to check in with some friends about the quickly impending wedding (1 hr away) and on his way back to the room he checked at the desk and was able to get us the room that we were looking for!   TIP - after booking we joined the frequent guest club... so when they asked my hubbie if he belonged they gave us the upgrade. The new room had a bedroom with french doors separating and two bathrooms.  The only downside - it was on the smoking floor.  The floor was not bad though, air cleaners in the hallways and in the room(as long as they are on)... so i was not feared for my 6 month olds lungs, and my smoking baby sitters could smoke in their bathroom - with the fan on. The room was very nice.  No complaints - with the comment that the shower head's back was missing. Huge bathroom off the bedroom.... smaller one off the sitting room! Five huge pillows on the bed.  Super comfy bed.  Big TVs.  Late check out available (We needed it after the great wedding that their wedding co-ordinaters throw together!)",N
2453,"Older, but classy and opulent decor transported me back in time to the 20's.   Laced with marble, and faux gold flourishes, the lobby and registration area is impressive, especially if you're wearing heels.   With a priceline booking, I was placed on the 22nd floor, which meant I had to take the Executive Floor elevator bank...making me feel far more important than I am.   Room had spa music playing when I entered and an LCD computer featuring their new Hilton Navigator...so long guest services 3-ring binder! Typical 4 star accommodations, but it has many antique/old world furnishings that differentiate it from most other Hilton's in the states. One bitchy desk clerk too many though. Want to give it 5, but it smells old.",N
2645,"Love the James!  The rooms are spacious, the beds are so comfy, and I thought the design touches (like all the lights are on dimmers) make the rooms feel pretty special.  My room was on the top floor and at the end of the hall, so it was very quiet.  I was able to check in (very) early, 11 am, which was great.  Check out time is quite late, 2 pm, which was also great. Turndown service was unexpected and such a nice surprise!  I had heard that there were Khiels toiletries, but there weren't... oh well.  The room was very clean, and the service from everyone was great. I got a pretty low rate ($137) by booking through an Expedia blind deal.  This is the main reason why I am giving 5 stars, because for that price I really doubt you can find anything better. There's a Starbucks and a Trader Joe's right across the street.  Great location in general.  There are many self-park garages very very close by too if you don't want to pay for valet (although I'm not sure how much money you'd be saving...)",N
5481,"I had an excellent stay here last week.  The staff was friendly and accommodating (pun intended).  The hotel itself is very well appointed, the beds are super comfy and they get points for supplying both squishy and firm pillows.  Mark the concierge was incredibly helpful as was Louis the doorman and driver of the complimentary sedan.  Yes folks a sedan service in the mornings is included.  Heh - i was treated like a Queen and will definitely stay here again when I am in the city.  You can't beat the location either - posh shopping, close to the subway and the beach on Lake Michigan.",N
5052,"This is the worse hotel we have ever had to deal with.  Our friends received a special rate which was half the special rate that we received.  The corporate office told us that the representatives at their 800 number do not know all the deals that are offered.  So, our friends were lucky enough to get a representative that knew about the rate.  We called the day before and the rates were already in their system.  It is a joke.  The people were rude and did not care about losing our business!  I do not recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the Chicago area!",Y
3632,"3.7 really.  The hotel is pretty and luxurious, but... For a hotel that charges as much as it does, I'm amazed at the way the Drake nickels and dimes their guests for everything!  My parents stayed here while I was finishing my MA, and while the place is beautiful, seeing my dad have to constantly open his wallet made me feel generally underwhelmed about the whole place.",N
1210,"One word: ""eh"".   Having stayed closer to the center of town, this place seemed really really really far away from everything.  Oh, did i mention it's like, really far away?? Ok, to be fair, they shuttle you into downtown, but ha!  guess what?  NO shuttle back!  [sucka!]   Negatives: The room was average, we had a two bed room.  I didn't like that the bathroom was open, (ie: no door to the sink area) b/c then that means if you get up earlier or in the middle of the night, the other person can hear you.   The deco was ok, very modern feel, but lacked since there wasn't a microwave.   Positives: Did like that the shower was separate, had decent toiletries.  The floors were updated with granite, but average counter tops. Next door to some sort of rail system but is not the ""el"" as Chicagoans call the subway. FIVE STAR aspect: GREAT GYM.  Really new and updated equipment.  Free water, towels and headsets.   hmm, i just basically said that ""if you are a work out fanatic and plan on staying indoors during your whole stay, then THIS PLACE IS FOR YOU my friend!""   Overall, i don't think i would stay here again unless i had to; and had an expense account for the taxi rides...",N
1738,"Yukon XL with a full tank of gas?  Check.  ""In the Heights"" tickets for the Cadillac theatre RIGHT next door?  Check.  Your teenage daughter and a whole group of your girlfriends?  CHECK! We stayed here at the Hotel Allegro due to its close proximity to the theatre. We drove from Madison WI to take in a show, go salsa dancing and treat ourselves to an over nighter in the Windy city. While we thought we left in plenty of time we were still stuck on the Kennedy at 7:15 while curtain was said to go up at 7:45 that evening.  Crap! No worries; I got off on Cumberland and took the streets into downtown.  We pulled up to the Hotel at 7:38PM.  Yeah - I know right?  The doorman and bell person were ON POINT.  We simply hopped out, opened the trucks hatch, they took my last name and our bags, gave us 2 tickets; one for the valet and one to pick up out luggage upon check in.   Nice! We walked 7 seconds to the show next door with NO worries. Upon arriving back at the hotel to check in; we were given double bed rooms on a high floor as requested; small rooms but hell it was efficient.  We ordered room service, laughed loudly with no repercussions from the neighbors or the front desk, and when we went out dancing it didn't take forever for them to bring the wheels around. We all had a great time and would return.",N

3415,"Prologue: So this is a belated YELP post, because I have only recently grown to know & love the YELP community.  It was during this trip in April, that I first discovered YELP. I was solo, and YELP was my travel companion! I therefore felt compelled to copy & paste my April post from another community forum so that my fellow yeeps could benefit..... Having stayed here previously in a very small room, I was sure to ask for a larger room with 2 beds when I made the reservation although I was a solo traveler. I had room 1618 and it was very good. Their website reservations are very clear about the square footage of each room - so pay attention when you book so you don't end up an unhappy traveler. There are some rooms that are TINY, TINY.  Dollhouse-like! Location: Excellent, excellent. In the middle of the Mag Mile. Need I say more? Rooms: No tub in mine - only a shower. Counter space was very limited - just a shelf below the mirror. Room had 2 flat screen tvs, sofa, chair, coffee table and desk. Free internet. Mini bar, but no refrigerator or coffee maker that you can use in room. Full length mirror and in room safe. Lobby: Elevators are quite small, but there are 3 available. Check in is on the 2nd floor. One computer on 2nd floor you can use to print your boarding passes. Service: I had very limited contact with any staff - so I can't venture an opinion. Food: I was so close to dozens of restaurants that I did not eat at the hotel. I would definitely stay here again, BUT will surely ask for a big room again",N
4187,"I had a freebie night to use up at a Hyatt location that expired at the end of February. So I booked the Hyatt Chicago and also requested some upgrades. I got the upgrades, which were the Regency Club and an Executive Suite. The suite was very nice (2 plasma TV's and a nice sofa and chairs). The roll-away bed was delivered promptly. The suite was very clean and nicely decorated. Checkin was very smooth. The Regency Club was a really great deal. For $20, we got a continental breakfast, appetizers during the afternoon, all the espresso I could drink and pop that the boys could drink. It was well worth it. I'll be coming back.",N
4194,"A monster of a hotel; not the place to go for an intimate experience.  It's kind of like staying in a hotel room located at the mall just between The Sharper Image and Spencer's Gifts.

500,"Good reasonably priced hotel, rooms are clean, bed is very comfortable, 5 pillows - love that.  rooms are suites so very large for one or even 2 couples. Very close to all the Downtown action.

4763,"We have never stayed there but my wife loves the lobby scene and they pour one helluva drink in the lobby bar, so we just go and hang there, have drinks and enjoy the feeling of a past century. I took my boys in there once and they spent a long time going up and down the escalators. Eventually we were very politely asked to stop the game. They were so nice about it my youngest remarked on how if I yelled at him like that Security guy, he'd listen to me better. It probably helped that the guy was six six and never unfolded his arms, kind of reminded me of the jolly green giant, except darker...",Y
1964,"A friend of mine and her family stayed here while they were attending a wedding a couple blocks away. They asked me to meet them to watch their little boy. They were promised a pool. I found it odd that this particular one had a pool but it was promised. There is no pool.  OK, small oversight.  As I got settled in, I ordered room service for myself and their child. After being put on hold for 5 minutes, I asked for a chicken sandwich (seriously, this was the cheapest thing on the menu and it was $14) and a peanut butter sandwich for the little guy. I specified 3 times to not put jelly on this sandwich.   I also ordered a glass of milk and a diet pepsi. The bill total was $44.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME??  I know that hotels way overcharge for room service but you can get some decent food...this was crap.  The sandwich was way over seasoned and mushy and the fries were stuck together and, again, way over seasoned.  The peanut butter sandwich came WITH JELLY on hard bread.  It did not get eaten. Now on to the pros... great rooms, great lobby, hip and very cool interior, comfy pillows, Bliss products, huge bathroom and cool decor in the rooms.  Oh and HUGE tv. Overall, if you're in town on business, this place is super convenient... if you're in town on pleasure, stay at the W on Lake Shore Drive. It's larger and much better.  Oh, and no matter what, leave the hotel and check out some of Chicago's excellent restaurants. Don't eat here under ANY circumstances.",N
4734,"Don't go this hotel. This hotel is never worth 4 stars.First, room size is super small. It recalled me a $200/month efficiency room of my first univ year.Furthermore, because of its abnormal floor plan, you can see some other rooms' inside at night. I never intended this, but when I looked outside through the window, ooops... I could see other rooms' bed.You may be watched. Don't go there.",Y
3793,"Went to the launch party of this hotel last night. It's very cool. It's a mix of Asian fusion. They have a sushi bar with delicious selections of different maki rolls or nigiri. The tuna sashimi was very fresh and delish. The rooms although small are cozy and luxurious. Flat screen tvs and feather beds are a plus, while the bathroom leaves a little to be desired on the layout. The only thing blocking the shower or toilet from sight of the rest of the room is a curtain that opens from the OUTSIDE. (Make sure you aren't here with any pranksters, or you could be in for a very embarrassing moment!) Also, the only way to close the bathroom door is to slide open the clost, which I find very intrusive and impractical. Not a great design. Some of the rooms have a small balcony, and they all seem to have an unfinished concrete ceiling which is clever and though not my taste, is original. There is a spa with several different treatment packages, and I do look forward to taking advantage of it. The staff seems friendly and do not at all have your typical snootiness in a downtown hotel. There is a steakhouse, but I only tried a sampling of mediocre beef. I can't pass judgement on that. All in all this is sure to be another overpriced hotel that will be a great place to ""be seen"" if you're into that sort of thing. Luckily, I'm not.",N
5095,"Stopped by this place yesterday to pick something up quickly. The hotel is indeed nice, however, one staff member I interacted with was pretty rude. When heading southbound on Michigan Ave, the hotel will be on your right side. There are a whole bunch of cabs lines up there, followed some space for drop offs central to the lobby opening. Right after that there is an area for deliveries or for standing up to 15 minutes. The sign said to put on your flashing lights if you leave your vehicle. Well I did that, ran inside, got what I came to pick up from an associate, and went back to my car. The guy assisting with getting peoples cabs was pretty aggressive saying I can't park there. I don't like when people raise their voice on me so I told him in a stern voice that I followed the directions of what the sign said and was on my way. I was in the hotel for maybe 10-12 minutes maximum.",Y
4871,"I had the worst hotel experience ever in the Congress Plaza Hotel. Despite of all the inconvenience I experienced during my stay, including the strike was going on, the toilet was not working and there was no wireless internet access, I was not planning to write a yelp review until The Congress Plaza Hotel Security lied to me:11:45am on Dec 22, 2011, 45 minutes after we checked the hotel, my daughter found out she left her retainer on nightstand in the hotel room. I called the front desk and I was transferred to Hotel Security. The gentleman on the phone took down my information and asked me to call back one hour later. I called the Security at 12:45pm, the person on the phone told me that they could not find my daughter's retainer. I asked if housing keeping had cleaned the room, the person emphasized that the house keeping was in the room while the security checked out the retainer for me. The person even said that the security also checked house keeping's garbage bag to make sure no retainer was there.My daughter was very sure that she left her retainer in the hotel, so we decided to go back the hotel to check out the room ourselves (around 3:00pm). We found out the room was not even been cleaned yet, and surely my daughter's retainer was still on the nightstand.As a frequent traveler, I left stuffs in hotel many times. The hotel staff and the house keeping were always very helpful. I could not believe that the Congress Plaza Hotel could not hold up the basic hotel standard to help it's customers to locate stuff they left in their hotel room. This instance is a reflection of poor hotel management which leads bad customer experience.",Y
842,"I really enjoyed my stay here. The hotel decor has a touch of elegance without being pretenious. We had a room facing the inner courtyard, so noise from the L was not a problem. The room was huge with a bathroom that was twice the size of a college dorm room. It even had a jacuzzi bath tub seperate from the shower. The location is perfect for traveling by train. It is a short walk from Union Station. It is also a short walk to the art institute, Grant Park, shopping, theaters, and restaurants. Ada's (the restaruant on the ground floor of the hotel) provides a quick and easy choice for breakfast or lunch. There is an L station around the corner, making it easy to get around the city day or night. I only have two complaints, both of which would not prevent me from returning. First, the room was a little warm our first day and night there. The rooms have an automatic system which turns off 30 minutes after leaving the room. I think we figured out a way to make it stay on just until the room temperature was better. Second, we wanted to watch a movie and relax but were deterred by the $14,95 charge for the movies. I might have paid 7-10, but $15 for a movie was a little unreasonable. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel, although I like the http://hotels.com price for much better than their standard room rates.",N
2675,what a lovely place. it's very modern yet eco-friendly...which I totally loved. I enjoyed that place two nights in a row...first night was in a suite for my sister's last night before her wedding. It was such a cute suite. however the seating was very uncomfortable. :( The second night was the night of the wedding and the bride and groom decided to have an afterparty at their presidential suite (they were upgraded as a surprise from the hotel)...which was amazing...I swear P-Diddy or Puff Daddy would have showed up! this place was insane...the bathroom itself seemed like a whole 'nother world...hot tub...stalls for the toilets...huge counter spaces...this suite was very sexy and modern just like the bride and groom...eventually the bride and groom kicked us out to enjoy themselves. :),N
699,"This is not the average Courtyard. The rooms are pretty typical in terms of layout, cleanliness and quality. The location is in downtown Chicago, so you can get to a ton of restaurants and theaters easily. They do have a full service restaurant and bar, which you normally don't get at the Courtyard. Because they have a restaurant on-site, room service is available. They also have the usual courtyard market and a mini Starbucks.   They also have a doorman.  I really don't like this because I have to tip the guy $1-2 bucks every time I get in or out. He hails a cab for me, but this is downtown Chicago. You walk outside and put out your arm, three taxis show up; pretty much any time of the day.",N
955,"We used this as the cheap hotel option for our guests for our wedding. I think we had a rate of $89 a night the weekend we had it, which was great for those that didnt want to spend too much. No complaints on the rooms from anyone that I heard of. It is a little bit of an older hotel and not too many amenities, but they have updated some things and for the price it was great. One guest got turned away because he arrived late, which is something that should not happen for a group. I never followed up on it, so I'm not sure what happened exactly but thats what I heard. Either way they should have made some arrangment to get them situated. We also had some problems with guests getting rooms in our block, people saying that the block was full when it really wasn't. So it was extra work involved on our part to get that figured out, which having extra stress when planning a wedding isn't so much fun.",N

If you're looking for a great view from your room go somewhere else, all you'll see are the buildings next door or across the street.  Room was clean, bed was fine.  Only real downside was we could hear EVERYTHING in the hallways.  Every ding of the elevator was clear as a bell and heard every person on our floor coming and going.  Didn't sleep well due to noise but everything else was pretty decent.",N

4452,"At first  glance, the Palmer exudes luxury. It has a gorgeous lobby (as is depicted in the photos on the website and the reviews here), and an art deco charm when you first walk in. It is clearly a hub of events from weddings to meetings with the corporate meeting rooms and the 1000+ rooms to accommodate everyone. However, in the realm of hotels I have experienced as a pleasure and business traveler, I have to admit Palmer House gets an ""eh"" when it comes to the room. My room was a double (to be shared with my sister and mom) while we were attending my cousin's wedding this past weekend. The room itself was spacious and had 2 full (but super super small with no ventilation) bathrooms which were awesome and a blessing in disguise when you have 3 women getting ready in the mornings. But that's pretty much it. The TV was super old school, and sits on one of those old hutches  that are awkward to get around and was about 24 inches max. No coffee maker or mini fridge, thereby forcing you to go to their restaurant  for coffee or waters (although there is an in house Starbucks on the lowest level which is only open until about 8 I think). The restaurant and bar also close super early so we were forced to look elsewhere at 12 am on a Saturday night for late night food and drinks. It is not a hotel I would return to to relax in tranquility as I could hear my neighbors above and next door talk loudly at ALL hours. I give it 1 star for the area in which is sits--super close to State street which has shopping which came in handy on a sweltering 90 degree day, as well as being close to Millennium Park and some good food. A couple of train lines and taxis abound. 3 stars for the AMAZING security team who helped my mom get around by bringing the wheelchair in a timely fashion multiple times a day when requested. Seriously, I don't know how I would have done it without them! Its a big hotel and really hard to get around if you are disabled and need help. Minus 1 star for the quality of the room overall and the lack of some amenities I would expect from a metropolitan hotel. I think if you are looking for a place to crash in while enjoying everything the city of Chicago has to offer, the Palmer will suffice. But if you are looking for something more relaxing and luxurious I would say you may have better luck somewhere else with more modern and updated  amenities.",N
3038,"Its ok. I like the City Center property much better. My gay husband was in Chicago for a week, and we caused some trouble here. His room was pretty typical for a W Hotel... it acually reminds me of the W Times Square. Trying a little to hard to be South Beach. The upstairs lounge... is awful. We came back late after dinner for a few drinks. There was a man about my father's age who invited me to do the electric slide with him on the dance floor... I wish I was joking. I'd stick to City Center.",N
4161,"I gave this hotel 3 stars because once you get over the impressive size and plethora of shops it really is just average. The rooms are clean and modestly appointed but adequate. The water pressure left plenty to be desired though, along with the air conditioning. I stayed in the east wing, its my understanding the west wing is newer and perhaps a bit better. I stayed 5 days due to a conference for work and overall its livable but definitely not a 5 star hotel. The one major thing it has going for it is location. It is in the heart of it all. Close to downtown and navy pier.",N
2325,The location of the hotel is the major selling point for this hotel (which gets a plus one star) Located right on Michigan Ave which has a lot of restaurants and shopping. It also is several blocks away from the Chicago Art Institute (I walk fast so if you walk slow or don't like walking take a cab). The staff is very friendly and courteous. The views from your room on the top floors are pretty cool (request that if you are staying). The lobby has a bar right there which serve excellent strawberry mojito ($15). They have a lot of elevators but can still be an issue during peak times (7:30 AM and 5:30 PM) with it running slow or filled with people. The rooms are not as large as most standard Marriotts but that is usually expected for hotels within a city. They had water issues where they didn't have very hot water or if you are taking a shower the water would get cold then when you turn it up suddenly it's gets scalding. Despite some annoyances it's a nice stay.,N
2084,"All of the staff who made my wedding day happen were wonderful! Barbara Martin, the onsite wedding coordinator, is extraordinary. She is the utmost professional, responded to all of our questions in a very timely and clear manner, and was there to make sure our rehearsal and ceremony went off as planned (with helpful suggestions for how the day should flow). The reservations staff shared updates about our room blocks in a timely manner when we requested updates. The catering staff was so attentive throughout the cocktail hour and the sit down meal.  All of our guests received the courses in a timely fashion, and the food was delicious. If you go for the mid-level wedding package, the steak for each guest is huge and very well prepared. At one point, my husband stepped away from the table during dinner, and a staff member took his plate to make sure it was warm when he returned. Thank you to everyone! These are among the reasons we choose the Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza as our ceremony and reception location: - Barbara Martin is great. - Affordable with lots of perks including comped rooms and parking for us and our parents the night of the wedding along with free breakfast the following morning. - The LaSalle room was just the right size for our 100 guests (plus dance floor) and the view of the Chicago is great (and makes any decisions about decorating or coming up with a theme so easy -- Theme: Chicago, Decorations: Look out the window). - Close to public transit for our out-of-town and city-residing guests. - Reduced parking rates were available to our driving guests. - We were able to have a block of rooms for Friday and Saturday night available to our guests at a reduced cost without having to make a financial guarantee that we would fill the rooms.",N
3911,"I attended a conference here this summer, and while the conference facilities were fine, having to cross the picket line each day was not. This strike has been going on for YEARS. That is NOT OKAY. Based on what I knew of the strike, I decided to stay at the Hilton down the street. From what I heard, it was the better choice as other people at the conference staying at the Congress reported that their electricity kept going out, and their bathrooms were having issues. Also, some of the girls thought the rooms were haunted and after a night there, decided to stay elsewhere. Yeah, even at the conference rate of $99/night, no thanks!",N
2188,"My sweetie and I spent a night here to celebrate our anniversary after scoring a deal on Hotwire for $99.  Great hotel: wonderfully helpful staff, prompt room service for that toothpaste I forgot, beautiful decor, a room on the 32nd floor in the famous historic tower that had a great view of a city and overlooked the Magnificent Mile.  The bath products are great (gotta love creamy, lightly-scented body lotions that are made in France) as was the bathroom itself, with a spacious glass shower and a separate bathtub to boot.  The location is hard to beat: we really appreciated being able to wander Michigan Avenue, stop in at the Apple store to play with the new iPad and buy some stuff at Watertower. I would say that Hotwire/Groupon are the way to go for this place.  I think single rooms with a King-sized bed usually go for around $300, and that simply is too much for what you get.  The room was rather small, and as a result the furniture was awkwardly placed, with the TV oriented perpendicularly to the bed and difficult to watch from the bed.  But for $99, with access to a gym and a pool (neither of which we used--it was a laaaazy weekend)?  Definitely a deal.",N
5736,"We've stayed here before with a less than stellar stay but gave it another chance this past weekend and was much more pleased.. This Crowne Plaza is in Greektown so if you love Greek food.. you will LOVE walking down the street and having your pick of a number of Greek restaurants.. I also like how there's a 24-hour supermarket (Dominick's) a block away and a Walgreen's the opposite way, a block away. The rooms are cozy. The sliding door to the bathroom is a bit bothersome. There's a number of amenities of which borrowing an umbrella is one, is available. Room service till 11pm. I also like how you need a room card to use the elevators.. it adds a safety factor. During our last stay, we had problems with other guests harassing us with no help from the staff. The shower didn't drain and maintenance said they fixed it but for the entire weekend we showered in standing water.. This stay was much better.. the only thing that we can say anything about is housekeeping. After having our room cleaned, they never replaced the glasses or sundries and the towels were folded and messily placed on the shelf. Other than that, everything was fine. And! lastly, valet was great in getting us cabs and even a limo for us one night.. (crucial for us with none of our own transportation)",N
1658,"From first glance you can see that this is an old building, but the insides are very modern. The decor is very nice, especially the oversized Christmas ornaments. The lobby is equipped with modern leather couches that are comforting and stylish. The service is exceptional, everyone was extremely friendly. Was here for a corporate Christmas party and had a blast. The cocktail hour included a never ending open bar. The area that the cocktail hour was held felt a bit crammed, but it was cozy. Since people were not sitting on the couches, they were just getting in the way. If possible I would suggest for them to move the couches around a little for the cocktail hour so there is more standing room and less of moving through a maze.... The dinner served was mouth watering. The steaks were tender and the tilapia was soft and flavorful. *** the steak is cooked medium rear, so if you like it more cooked, get the tilapia. The dessert was not good, at all, maybe only the chocolate covered strawberries but it's hard to mess that up. The cakes and pasties were just not appetizing, the texture, the contents and flavor were all off. The rooms are ""small"" but I've seen smaller rooms in Europe. In my opinion how much room does a person actually need in a hotel room. A bed, a desk, and maybe a tv..check, check and check. The pillows and the actually bed were soft and comfy. I am always in the lookout for a better pillow, I might actually email the hotel and ask what brand pillows they have so I can purchase some for my home! They provided validated self-parking for $25, ooooor you can do what we did and park less than a block away in the outside self-parking area that has a $14 weekend speacial :) The rooms run about $160 a night on average, and I think that for the location in downtown Chicago and quality if hotel that is a great price. Also, if you are an out of towner, this hotel's location is superb :)",N
5767,"It was party central on Friday and Saturday nights but Sunday night was (apparently) back to the norm of reasonably calm and quiet.  The owner changed my friend's room when told of the super noisy air conditioner.  The room was clean and neat, pleasant because the ""no smoking"" ban was for real.  Average-adequate furnishings include TV but no frills.  Good for out of town guests looking for a nearby place to stay.  Main drawback is parking space; on a full-house night it's doubled up parking with just enough space to turn around at the far end.  The Continental breakfast is typical for this genre motel - cold cereal, instant oatmeal, doughnuts and coffee.  Reasonable price.",N
1716,"We stayed here 3 nights on our first trip to Chicago, not really knowing the neighborhoods or preferred locales. To our surprise the hotel is in a great location, walking distance to a lot of restaurants. If you need to go further out, a $5 cab ride will get you there. Encore Liquid Lounge was a perfect spot for us to unwind that first night, as well as a good starting point every night thereafter. This is a renovated hotel, so you need to come with proper expectations. You can tell this is a very old building, with rooms that are very small compared to newer hotels. But that's the way it was back then and I've experienced the same in similar hotels in other cities. Given all that, they've done an excellent job on the renovation. The rooms are clean and up-to-date. The bathrooms are beautiful. The lobby is done really well and makes a great place for the nightly wine-hour. The standout for us was the staff. From the front desk to the cleaning staff, everyone was incredibly considerate and polite. We always ask everyone besides the concierge on what to do and where to go. Julio gave us great recommendations and presented genuine thoughtfulness. Definitely seek this gentleman out. We would and have recommended this hotel to others with proper expectations in mind. For the price, this is a great value. *I've seen other reviews with complaints about the thin walls and noisy hallways. Luckily for us, we didn't experience any of that. I know we had neighbors on both sides, but other than a door closing, didn't hear a peep.",N
4327,"Three dollar signs is right! Historic building right smack in downtown Chicago? Yup, you get what you pay for. Swaaaaaaaan-ky! Luckily the university program I was with helped with costs, and even then, G-W-0-W! But all that aside, if you decide to treat yourself, definitely do Palmer House. Millenium Park, Chicago Institue of Art, Michigan Avenue, metro stops, & yummy eateries are ALL within walking distance. The hotel rooms are nice and cozy, the light up mirror in the bathroom help you see every pore on your face --perfect for tweezing eyebrows & perfecting your make-up, the bath towels are super soft, the hallways are covered with old photographs, the lobby is beautifully & elegantly decorated and the staff are super helpful.",N
3919,"I'm giving the Congress Plaza Hotel three stars because it was the only place in Chicago that had a suite that could fit 16 people. Mind you it technically on slept 6 but we shoved 16 people into this two room plus foyer and bathroom with one king and two double bed suite!  And after the 16 of us divided up the cost of the suite I think it was only $35 a person.  Not bad for a night in Chicago! Plus I believe the management caught on to our little charade but they never said a word.  Not to mention we all slept comfy on air mattresses, the floor and the beds!  If you are looking for a cheap way to stay in Chicago this would be the way to go.  I just suggest getting along with everyone that you are staying with! The hotel itself is okay but does need some up keep especially the bathroom.  It's an older hotel and I would suggest dusting but I can't complain we got a great deal!",N
4449,"This place is exceptional, a true Chicago landmark, I had not been in the property for two year - or since the renovation was completed. It has been restored to one of the finest properties in the entire world. The outside remains the same, but when you get into the lobby it is fantastic. Especially when decorated for Christmas. We are using the family picture shot in front of the tree for our card this year, and it was almost non-stop picture taking from everyone who walked by the tree. After we checked in (more on that in a minute) we had to go have a drink in the lobby. The bar is cozy and is in/out of the restaurant, and there are plenty of tables and chairs to sit in the lobby itself. It was awesome just to take in the view and enjoy a drink....we almost stayed for another but had to head out for dinner. With the location of the property (State Street in the theatre district/a block from Millennium Park) this is a MUST STAY while in Chicago. As for the room, the general manager Dean Lane really took care of my family. He put us in the best room I have ever stayed in (The Daley Suite) right on the parade route/State Street, and had a bottle of wine and cookies and milk for the kids in the room. Nicest gesture of the year based on all the nights I have spent in hotel rooms this year. Even without this special treatment I would stay here every time downtown!!!!!",N
2416,"For starters - we got a great deal on this hotel from Hotwire. The location is ideal - close to Grant & Millenium Parks, 2 blocks from Dunkin Donuts, close to shopping and a short cab ride to Rush Street. The hotel itself is beautiful, although the rooms are dated. The biggest blow, though, was parking. $55 for valet and $45 for self. At that point I made a mental note to never complain about parking in LA ever again, and then went down the street and parked for 24 hours for about $20. What made me absolutely the happiest about our room was the fact that it had TWO bathrooms. We had a room with two double beds and TWO bathrooms. Be still, my beating heart. Also, all the hotel staff were helpful and accommodating (except with late checkout they said they'd have to charge if it were past noon.) Also, I had some sort of an allergy attack and benadryl at the gift shop was $17. Yes. $17. So I walked the half a mile to Jewel-Osco and it was all good.",N
1569,"First thing I noticed when I entered the room was how large it was. Not a typical downtown, cramped room. Great location. Helpful friendly staff, nice small ""mini bar"" downstairs. Meeting space upstairs is wide open, full of glass and unique. Also told it was ""Batman's Bedroom"" in the Dark Knight.",N
5078,"Do not ever host an event there!   Rude management, no professionalism, not very customer service friendly at all.   Attended a fundraising event there and the little ""worker"" or  whomever he was literally told everyone to stop what they were doing and get out., no tact whatsoever. I guess they wanted to be ready for their regular rowdy crowd in.  They're not accustomed to servicing a higher class of people but I'm sure they don't care, as long as they get these poor unsuspecting fools money.  Thumbs down.",Y
1260,"If you are vacationing near the ""Loop"" or around the Field Museum/Shedd Aquarium, Best Western is located in the perfect area. BW also offers the least expensive Valet parking which we had to utilize for our rent a car. Check-in is not until 3pm, knowing we where going to be in the area early, I called the day prior and requested early check in which they honored at 11am as well as provided a complimentarily room upgrade to Lake view, Sweet! Our room was small, but who cares, it's vacation so we didn't stay in it much anyway. Attached to BW is a coffee/asian restaurant which they utilize for their room service food. Customer service was awesome, no complaints what-so-ever. We would stay here again anytime **Also, Lou Malnati's is walking distance so if you like deep dish, your set. .",N
3814,I had a fantastic massage with Jenny.  I was happy that she was able to work the knots out of my lower back.  The spa itself is in a great space.  The relaxation room is lovely.  The lockers in the locker room are stocked with any of the toiletries you could need.,N
2049,"Wife and I had our Wedding here in November and the Holiday Inn staff were the greatest to work with.  Barbara Martin, their catering director, was the utmost professional and nicest person we could have wished to work with.  She was very attentive to us with all our needs, and always calm and collective in such a hectic, fast-paced industry.  We booked the Wolf Point Ballroom, on the 15th floor, which has a very nice view in the cocktail area, and the ballroom which has views towards the Sears Tower to the south and to the east towards the lake...both great views!  The food was above average when it comes to hotel wedding food.  You can't expect much since you know the food is sitting their in warmers ready to be served, but our Strip Steak and Chicken Picatta were both good and tasty with big portions.  We also had a vegetarian or vegan option which was liked by those who chose them. In summary, if looking for a reception place for your wedding with a great view, good food, and a wonderful person to work with, the Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza is a great place to consider!",N
1775,"i can't attest to the sleeping rooms, but i can as far as meeting planning goes!   we held a corporate meeting for about 350 in their ballroom today, and minus a few AV hiccups (our own fault), it went without a hitch.  their meeting space is nicely updated, affordable and convenient for loop offices via a short walk.   AV and catering sales staff were very responsive, friendly and attentive.  i'll definitely use them again if i can!",N
2676,"James Hotel is a metrosexual's dream! It feels like it's designed specially for trendy jet-setters. The decor is gorgeous - very modern and tasteful with a masculine edge (lots of dark wood, bold patterns, leather and stainless steel). My company held a meeting at James in one of their private meeting rooms yesterday. But it wasn't a traditional ""conference room""...I felt like I was in someone's apartment. It had all the comforts of home...a really nice home. There were even cushy throw pillows and bookshelves stocked with art books and knick knacks. There was plenty of room for 20-30 people The couches and chairs were super comfy and gave our meeting a nice-laid-back vibe.The food was great and the staff was attentive and friendly. If the bedrooms are as comfortable as their meeting space, I will definitely be back to stay a night.",N

134,"My girlfriend and I stayed at the Whitehall Hotel for our Spring Break trip to Chicago (4 nights, 5 days). We'd checked out a BUNCH of hotels on Expedia and Yelped a bunch as well, and we settled at the Whitehall. We also got a great deal on our hotel + flight combo through Expedia, and we're glad we booked here. The hotel is in an EXCELLENT location in Chicago. It's in the downtown area, and MINUTES away from any and all transportation you'd need to get where you've gotta be. It's a block away from the major buses you'd need, and only 3 blocks away from the L line. The decor of the place is nice -- it's a good mix of old-fashioned ideas with a modern touch. The people who work the desks are extremely helpful, and knew we were out of towners -- gave us some recommendations immediately for places to eat and even drew out how to get there...always a plus. The room itself: completely and absolutely perfect for what we needed it for. We weren't here to soak in bed all day, we were gonna be out exploring what Chicago had to offer. So the Whitehall delivered -- a BEAUTIFUL room (HUGE bed), with a nice bathroom and desk to plan things out. It was cleaned the same time each day, and the staff left it looking terrific. If we ordered anything to the room (such as towels, extra toothpaste, etc), they brought it up within 2-3 minutes, which is also a plus. The negatives: the real estate isn't great. Rooms are a bit on the smaller size, but again, it had everything we wanted and it had it done well. The other odd thing was the curtains...they weren't able to be closed. They were in a fixed open position, but luckily, there was a FIRST LAYER of blind to close the window off but allow SOME light in. Just an odd sort of characteristic. Overall, the Whitehall, for it's location and price, really can't be beat in my mind. Although it's got it's odd shortcomings, so does every hotel, and my girlfriend and i had an EXTREMELY pleasant stay here.",N
3235,This review is just for the bar area. One star for fast service. One star for a great dirty vodka martini. Minus three stars for being super cheesy. This bar reminds me of the bar at W Lakeshore. It's awful.,N
2047,"This is a weird place.  First of all, you walk into what looks to be an office lobby and wander around until you figure out that you have to take an elevator up eight floors to the real hotel lobby.  But once you leave the cold, sterile feel of the office building-ish entrance and standard elevator car, be prepared to be transported to the warm, exotic environment of....florida.  Yes people, this is a Holiday Inn, so you will be surrounded by shades of pink, purple, and turquoise, and other colors and patterns that only a guy wearing a straw hat, hawaiian shirt, black socks, and sandles could love.  Despite its really cool location, this is a holiday inn and feels old and worn down throughout its interior.  Not going into details, but not a good value for its price. I'm giving this one a slightly below average rating because on one hand its tucked into a nice spot on a bend of a river so if you just so happen to get a corner suite you can look down the river west and watch the trains go in and out of the Oglivie transportation center, or you could look north as the happy northsiders go about their business.  On the other side it remains a standard issue Holiday Inn. Pros: * nice location on the cusp of the loop * river views * set away from busy streets and no real low floors Cons: * outdated interior * ugly interior * holiday inn interior Bottom line is that there's a lot of potential here, but for the price they charge, it doesn't deliver.",N
280,"*Updated* I was moved to a new renovated room, but I have to remove the second star because the TV does not get NBC at all and I really want to watch the Olympics.  Ridiculous. I hosted my wedding party here during the big weekend, and I thought it was fine then, but my subsequent stay has dashed those initial impressions.  My list: Pro - The Internet actually works decently, although still not terribly fast - Location is great, just off the north end of Michigan Avenue, in a quiet area Con - You MUST ask for a renovated room or else it will be horrible - My bed was U-shaped - TV was grainy and about 18 years old - Build-in kitchen was not very functional, and the refridge was very loud - Headboard moved all over the place at the slightest touch - Sheets were thin - Bottom sheet was not fitted and moved all over the place - Pillows were thin - One of the lamps initially did not have a bulb",N
3198,W sucked. Our room smelled like smoke and one of the rooms next to our non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor was like chimney.  Nice view but what's the point if it smells like an ashtray?,N
1538,"There are some renovations going on right now, so I'd say the experience could be hit or miss.  My recent 5 night stay was a pleasant one overall, but I can definitely see how it can potentially be much better... On the positive side: *  great location - walk to the corner, make a left, cross the canal, and you're in the heart of Michigan avenue with upscale shops and restaurants.  Also close to the El and walking distance to theaters, etc. * nice view (if you're on the right side of the building) - I had a corner unit so I could see the Marina Towers, the Tribune building, the Trump tower (under construction), and up Wacker Drive along the river.  Plus, there was plenty of light so the room felt a little bigger than it was. * good service - got some extra pillows, a loaner umbrella, and a tv fix * surprisingly decent exercise facility and business center - clean, modern equipment with good views.  Both were completely empty all 3 nights I used them. * room amenities - comfortable bed, handy chaise, and Bath+Body Works soap/shampoo/lotion (more of a plus for my wife, but I can appreciate the nice touch too) On the negative side: * room was a bit small and cramped * tv was ancient and didn't work properly * doors slam loudly (I woke up several times at night when neighbors were in and out) * elevators don't give you good feelings * towels were not the cleanest (I'm a little picky on this subject, but consistently found towels that had traces of stains or looked really worn - you can always ask for more) So overall, not bad - I got a great deal on my stay - otherwise I might have given it 3 stars.  Should be better once the renovations are complete.  I'd recommend checking it out after that's done, unless you can get a really good rate.",N
5171,"Looks great...but:No closet, or anyplace to put your clothes in our room. The bathroom  was so tight I couldn't sit on the toilet seat unless I was leaning forward as the sink and wall were too close for almost anyone to fit, on and it was nearly impossible to flush said toilet seeing that it was pushed so close to the wall. You had to reach behind and come in that way to get it to work. The heating/cooling box banged every 30 mins starting at around 6:30 am. Oh and the parking for 1 night for guests was $51. Almost half of what we paid for the room. This was the first one we've stayed at so we're hoping that it was just the City Center version of the W.",Y

2852,"Mixed feelings about the Sheraton. First of all, the bed and bedding was VERY COMFORTABLE. I slept like a baby swaddled up and happy. The towels were not crunchy or hard as hotel towels can so easily be. The view from the 14th floor was great and I enjoyed waking up to the view of a bustling downtown sprawl, without the noise. The luggage check and valet staff were great - very efficient and courteous. The downside to the Sheraton is that beyond coffee in your room, NOTHING is included in the $259/night price tag. That's one expensive bed, pillow, and morning coffee. You want Internet? That'll be $12.99/day. You have a third party payer who paid your stay in full? Be prepared to remind them of that, because they will ask for your credit card. You attend a conference? Be prepared for burnt coffee and stale bagels. I wouldn't voluntarily stay at the Sheraton again...unless my company gave me no choice. :-\",N
504,"This hotel has a good location close to the lakefront, Navy Pier, and Michigan Avenue; all are less than a 10 minute walk. away. There is a large supermarket right across the street, so for an extended stay you can get drinks or snacks to keep in your room. Extensive and high quality breakfast buffet included in the room price. Internet access is costly ($15/day); it should be included. The only complaints I can muster are (1) accessing the street requires using two elevators and a short walk; the guest elevators reach a ""sky lobby"" at 4th floor level and then you then have to go to another elevator to get to the street and (2) it's not near public transit; taxi fare from Midway is about $30 and from O'Hare about $45, or you could take the trains to Union Station and then a taxi for about $10.",N
2661,"Five star service at a four star facility and an even better price.   The James Hotel is just a block off of the Magnificent Mile on Michigan Avenue.  You can easily walk to the major sites in the Loop and River North areas, so think twice about the rental car.  The hotel reminds you of the W Hotel style, but they deliver the product better than the W's that I have stayed at.  The lobby is cool.  The restaurant is cool.  The hallways are cool.  The rooms are cool. My room was interior facing.  This was not an issue frankly because in this neighborhood a 16 story  building is going to have a view of... well other buildings.  So nothing missed out on with the view and I had a room that was quite spacious.  The bed was uber-comfortable and the bath carried forward the hotel's modern style.   The service from the staff from the front desk to the bellmen was excellent.  Whether it was directions, restaurant tips, getting me to Wrigley Field, not only did they take care of me, but the followed up afterwards.  Great staff! Last tip, I scored a great deal on the room through American Express.  I was going to use points and money to pay, but the rate was so good, I saved the points and just paid for room.",N
653,"Yes, the cookies at check-in are nice. The hotel is nice. I thought the room decor was actually better than the W Lakeshore which we had stayed at the week before. Clean. Employees were really friendly and helpful. It sucks that so many hotels make their guest pay for wifi, it's not very hospitable. It is available in the bar area though which is weirdly placed in the lobby. For a decent price I would stay here again and I guess that is all that matters.",N
5357,"I honestly would have expected more from the Hilton Family of hotels. Again the living areas in the Embassy Suites seem to be lacking in updated furniture, but again the bedroom was emmaculate. The managers reception was a little overcrowded, as was the breakfast in the morning. All together a well maintained hotel with a great location and spectacular views from one side of the building. A great place to go if you're looking to stay a weekend in downtown, not pay incredible Chicago hotel prices, and still have a semi-upscale hotel stay.",Y
4942,"Brought our grandaughter here for her 15th birthday from Michigan. We ususally stay at the Hyatt on Wacker and will be going back there. First off, the hotel looks NOTHING LIKE THE ONLINE PICTURE and it tooks us 3 trips around the block to find the place because there was a small sign above the door. The valet was inside; no one to help us with our luggage. The desk clerk was about as friendly as a rock. We were on the 24th floor with a view of buildings-I had asked for a nice view for my grandaughter; couldn't change us. Cold air was pouring in the windows and the furnace never stopped blowing hot/cold air. The bathroom was a small joke; no fan and one plug. They didn't change the towels either and I had put them in the tub dirty. Very dark in the room and very few channels on the tv and 2 plugs for stuff. The rest were behind the bed and the dresser. The water was lukewarm with no pressure in the shower. Breakfast the next morning at the Sky Lounge was a huge expensive mistake. No postings, a small buffet with warm, dry food, a toaster that didn't work, no tables for more than 2 people so we had to sit on the couch and chair and balance food on our laps. My grandaughter had spiderwebs in her blueberries. I was charged for a juice I did not order. So we had eggs, meat, 2 thin slices of melon, 2 ordered juices (3) and  they gave us the bill -it was over $59- and we about fainted.The next morning we ate at the pub downstairs for about $20. The food was much better and the waiter at least smiled. When I complained I got the 'I'll tell the cook' which means 'whatever lady'. When we check out, again no valet around, he couldn't understand that we wanted our car; he kept trying to get us a cab. He finally told us the car was ready. Again no luggage help and it was at their garage around the corner that we had to walk to dragging all of our luggage. At least the attendant there helped us put it in the car. I've had better luck at the Holiday Inn. Yes I tried to complain but either no one was at the desk or they were so busy talking to one another they completely ignored us and other guests. I'm going back to the Hyatt. We spent $444- 2 nights with 2 queen beds, 2 nights parking at $48 per night and the breakfast. We took a 'shellacking' as Obama said.",Y
1107,"The lobby is great, but the rooms on the 29th floor are cold !!!  They have a huge draft flowing into my room from the hallway...I tucked a blanket by the door to keep the room warm...",N
1544,"The elevators here are the worst.  Is it too much to ask for a semi-intelligent algorithm that knows at least whether you've hit the up or down button? The fitness room is totally sketchy.  The front desk employees tell you which floor it's on, and when you arrive on that floor, there's absolutely no signage.  Not helpful, when the facility is on a floor surrounded by other hotel rooms.  The inside of the room is a labyrinth of randomly placed machines, all pointed in different directions.  The only treadmill is at the very end of the room, facing the window that looks out on the river.  It's a nice view, but I was totally creeped out by the fact that I couldn't tell if anyone was sneaking up behind me while I was on my run. The rooms are a very generous size, but the bathroom was awful.  The water wasn't hot enough for my shower, and I feel that as a 5'3"" woman, I should *not* be able to look out over the top of the shower curtain. All in all, I think I'd actually prefer to stay at the Red Roof Inn next time.  At least they have free breakfast.",N
1853,"This place is really refined & has some great finishing touches. Expect a sleek modern design in the bedrooms but you can forget about open space. The room is like a typical nyc bedroom & I got a view of a parking garage!! Took a 2 hour trip plus 30 minute train ride to feel right at home......But the amenities were better than expected nice flat screen TV, nice layout for the bathroom. What was useful though was the refrigerator, we took out all the expensive water, beer, & chocolates they would have overcharged us for & made it our own getaway fridge. On weekends they have a bar/lounge which provided some entertainment & interesting characters. Location is great though the red, blue, & all those other trains line were right around the corner. Oh & if your famished a McDonald's next door son!!!!",N
351,"Hubby and I arrived by Greyhound and had 8 hours before we had to be at the airport. We decided that a shower and a nap would be the ideal way to spend those 8 hours. The Holiday Inn Express was closed so we were directed to the Travelodge. It was going to cost us $120 to stay there for a total of 6 hours. When we were told the amount, we actually left and checked out the two nearest youth hostels to see if they had any availability. Sadly, they were all booked up and we were running on zero hours of sleep and the vicious flashbacks of whining babies on the Greyhound. We actually returned to this place and paid. The next two weeks we spent backpacking in Europe (Germany & Czech Republic) and every single night we stayed in hostels that were LARGER, CLEANER, NEWER, and CHEAPER. This is taking into the account our incredibly weak dollar in the face of the euro. I still cant believe we caved in.  :(",N
4600,"The pros:  Very good location to get nearly anywhere via CTA or walking. Free WiFi throughout the hotel... nice touch. Staff, down to a single person, were all fantastic.  Every single one. The bed was very comfortable, the linens were nice. The cons: Quite possibly the smallest hotel room I have every stayed in.  The bed was practically shoehorned into the room.  No place to store luggage if it's bigger than a carry-on.",N
643,"Service - Superb.  They even allowed us to check in at noon and gave us amazing chocolate chip cookies!  Kudos to the front desk, cleaning crew and bell boys.  Everyone was really friendly and had a great attitude. Location - Unbeatable location and price!  A block from the heart of Magnificient Mile for a low promotional price. Ambiance - Swanky and busy.  Fireplace at the bar although I never saw it open for business. Rooms - Pros - Spacious, great view, Crabtree and Evelyn products, safe, trash can has a recyclable container, looks just like photos. Cons - Lump beds, super soft pillows, no one answered the front desk for twenty minutes when I called at 1 am.",N
1140,Beautiful hotel in a great part of Chicago.,N
4465,"I think this hotel is gorgeous, and the reason it got three stars (instead of two) is its location. I spent a few nights here with my mom for her birthday and we left our car at the hotel, easily walking around the best parts of Chicago and seeing the city the best way. However, I do think the rooms are on the small and simple side for the money you're paying.",N
3055,This is a nice hotel for an event or if you are staying by yourself but... I find the bathrooms here insanely laughable. I guess it's edgy and cool for some people to have a window and door in a bathroom that make you feel like you'll be exposed any second doing your private business. Seriously...I think a lot of people had to approve this idea and I have to wonder what they were thinking or if they were at all. It wouldn't be the first hotel I'd recommend to friends.,N
208,"great price, excellent location, rooms were ideal given the cost and comparable rooms at local hiltons... didn't have time to check out the gym",N
3105,"Oh how I love the W. Have stayed here numerous times and have enjoyed every moment. Yes the rooms are small. But have you seen the view? We have been lucky enough to always get a lake view and it is just amazing. I have rearranged my schedule just so I could have a ""hang out in the room"" time in order to enjoy the bed. The sheets, the pillows...perfection. All but cured my sleeping problem. For that weekend anyway. I have frequented the bar in the lobby a few times, usually when I'm not staying there. It is sort of hit or miss. The drinks are always spot on, and it depends on the crowd. Sometimes there are the usual shiny guys in striped shirts and very tanned girls in tiny black tube dresses. Each to their own. Overall its usually a fun wind-down type of place. Oh and in nice weather, do check out the chairs outside. At night, with good friends, the Lake, a nice cocktail. Beautiful.",N
5683,The Talbott is an amazing gem in the sea of hotels in downtown Chicago. I have never seen a hotel property and clean and pristine. For a hotel built in the early 20th century you wouldn't be able to tell by all of it's upgraded features. Not to be forgotten is that the hotel is locally owned and operated by a great and knowledgeable staff. A must stay for business or pleasure just a few blocks away from Michigan Avenue and great sights and restaurants.,N
1288,"Not my favorite.  This hotel is old and is starting to show its age.   Minus one star because it doesn't feel completely clean to me, though I can't quite describe why. Minus another star because there's no coffee in the lobby in the mornings and the walk to Michigan Avenue, though only half a block, feels really long for some reason. Picky, I know, but I just don't see why one would stay here when the Four Seasons on Delaware is so much better.",N
250,"I found this place online while looking for a good rate for a bachelorette party for my girlfriend.  We loved it.  The colors are bright and cheery, the beds were SUPER comfy and the staff was really nice.  It was also ridiculously convenient (literally half a block) to the Gold Coast bar scene, which is where we were headed for the party.  We wanted local Chinese takeout and the staff was really nice about giving us menus and recommending somewhere local.  We called and asked for more towels (there were plenty for two, but not for the four of us) and they were brought up immediately. Parking was $39, which is pretty reasonable fr 24 hours downtown. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to a friend.  I'm not sure why people complained about the ""beach theme"" - I liked it and I think it would be welcome in the bleak Chicago winters especially!",N
1209,"The Hyatt at McCormick Place was the second hotel that I stayed at during my recent visit to Chicago.  I was unsatisfied with my previous location and was in a rush to check into the Hyatt.  Although the regular check in time is at 3pm, I explained my situation to a front desk girl at 8am and she quickly found a great room for me.  I settled into my room shortly thereafter.   The corner room that I was given had all of the regular Hyatt Regency features like the cushy bed, pillows, textured wall treatments, stone bathroom floors, etc.  These features were on par with the  two previous stays that I've had across the country this past summer with HR so I can say that HR is of consistently decent quality.  The main difference that I found at this Hyatt was that there was no concierge present during the whole duration of my visit.  Rather, the guest services helped us out and were our de facto concierges.  Our concierges were helpful with recommendations because there are no nearby eateries unless you count the Connie's Pizza and McDonalds located deep in the belly of the McCormick Center.   Taking a cab is essential to get a good impression of the city no matter what hotel you use.  Although the HR has a free one way shuttle (leaves on the top of each hour), it only makes three stops: the museum campus, water tower and Navy pier.  All of these stops are great taxi pickup spots, you can get closer to your intended destinations. Thankfully I ended my stay in Chicago with the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place.  I've learned that I can depend on them for great amenities and customer service.  I'll look forward to staying at another one in the future.",N
3192,"i love spg. i love W. i love THIS W hotel!!! at first i was a bit disappointed that i was not staying at the W hotel downtown and had to settle for the W hotel lakeshore. i've stayed at the one downtown near the sears tower but i think i would actually chose this location instead. if you're into walking, you can walk from one to the other but it is a bit far. the lakeshore location is near the navy pier which you can see from your hotel room. it is also close to the magnificent mile for shopping! for the rooms there are two options: lake view room and city view rooms (self explanatory). the set up for the two is the same essentially, just your view is different. im not in the hotel room long enough to really care. the rooms are spacious. i got a double bed room and the two of us had plenty of room. i love the bliss brand shampoo, conditioner, face wash, bar soap, and lotion they give you! the design of the room almost seemed like you were living in a cabana. there were two door wooden shutters from the bathroom that you can look out into the room. wierd at first b/c you can look into the bathroom but then convenient when you had people in your room and you can socialize while getting ready in the bathroom. this W like all W's are beautiful and modern. it's like you're entering a club 24/7. i stayed over the weekend (fri-sun) and the lobby was busy both nights. when you check-in, they offer you a free drink ticket at that bar!! there were 4 of us in our mid-20s and we wanted to go out and had NO idea were to go.. so one of us asked the concierge where to go and he gave us some suggestion and his card. at first we were hesitant to go b/c we werent sure if they were just selling the place b/c they were getting a commission or if this place was actually good. we first went to a jazz bar which was cool b/c they were playing live music. we didnt stay too long but it was a good experience b/c chicago has such a lively music scene. we then took a taxi to Y club and got in line. the bouncer said the club was closed only to people on the guestline or cover was $20/person. then my friend said that our concierge from the W gave us his card and said we could get in for free. and the bouncer was like ''oooh you're with the W.. go on in"" same thing happened at crescendo! both pretty high scale lounge/clubs. we saved $40/person just by talking to our concierge. if you dont' call that service, i dont konw what is!! also while i was waiting in the lobby for a taxi, a couple walks in with 3 dogs, one about 70lbs the other two about 10lbs. and i spoke to them a bit and they said the westin has a really good dog policy. theres no extra charge, just a deposit in case of any damage. don't know how true that is but if you want to bring your dog along with you, W's are the place to go! anyway, highly recommended. there was a good mix of younger people, as well as families. a little bit of everything for anyone.",N
4627,"*** woo-hoo, back in Chicago for one last vacation nite. *** so i decided to check out this spot since the location is cool (River North), price was right ($110/nt) and it's new (opened 3wks ago) ... besides i generally prefer boutique-style hotels. i think this place is perfect for those who wanna go clubbing. this area is club central.  there are about a dozen clubs within walking distance.  i'm thinking of selling off my kid as i'm typing this so i can go out tonite ... haha, j/k ... i think i will keep him, lol. anyways, Hotel Felix is charming.   it's only 12 stories high and the rooms are the size of a shoebox, but it's perfect to rest your head - free wifi, continental breakfast comp'd, fitness ctr and bar is tight. barring any unforeseen events, i'd definitely ret'n for a solo stay. *** overnite valet is $42 but plenty of street prkg.  got quarters? ***",N
1921,"I love these hotels, comfy soft bouncy beds... lol. Very Clean Very Spacious Rooms, Huge Bathrooms... Great service. Every each one is very elegant and they go from old fashioned to modern interiors. Price is always resonable and it's always in a nice location, always close to best entertainment spots in the city. All my friends stay at ""The W""  when  they come to Chicago. I highly recommend it.",N
1393,"They just renovated, so the rooms are pretty swanky, particularly the bathrooms.  I love the roomy showers.  The decor is very Westin-esque and I'm a fan of their free shampoo and conditioner (the brand is Gilchrist and Soames). The restaurant downstairs leaves much to be desired.  The decor is horrendous and the food was so-so (I had the shrimp scampi farfalle).   If you want a decent drink and good company (particularly after you've left your laptop in a cab, but I digress), go to the bar.  I had a manhattan and the knickerburger (verdict? delicious and fairly priced) and enjoyed good conversation with David, the bartender. Overall, the stay has been good - but spend your money somewhere else on food.",N
1603,Just stayed here Last weekend and had the best view I've ever had in a hotel! Good service: When we checked out they let us check our bags at the front desk so we could take a boat tour. Great location. The bathroom was great 2 sinks and the overhead shower rocks. The only strange thing (which is not a huge deal) was that ice was only available on one floor and it was not our floor. So it was a bit inconvenient. I would definitely stay again.,N
5424,"I stayed here b/c my friend was getting married nearby and was nice enough to keep us close to the activities...at first, I wasn't sure if I should just commute to the wedding but after checking in, I'm sure glad I decided to stay here! The rooms were large, clean, and had the coziest beds! I wanted to forget about the wedding and take a nap! And the hospitality was superb!",Y
40,"Another Travelzoo deal at an awesome price of $99 per night.  The Tremont is located just a few blocks off the Magnificent Mile on Chestnut, right next to Ditka's.  The lobby is narrow and have some seating in cozy groups with little candy dishes scattered around.  My first impression upon checking in was that customer service is not their high suit. More to come on this in a moment. I get my key, some maps and a reminder about the free internet and breakfast in the morning served next door at Ditkas for $5 (free with my package but I pass so I can't speak to this).  I get up to my room and open the door.  The room itself is spacious for what it is.  There's a separate sink vanity and spacious closet and roomy bathroom with shower over tub.  The plumbing hardware was a bit off and needed a serious update because they were circa 1960s (think Edward Scissorhands ).  The bed was very firm and the fitted sheets were shallow on the corners so if you were making cupcakes, they'd totally flip off (see picture).  Another sign of this hotel's age was that the window coverings were old mini blinds.  And another pet peeve for me is the linens.  These were of inferior quality with a funky Motel 6-ish comforter/quilt and not a down comforter embraced in a high TC duvet.  Yes, I have been spoiled with my Calvin Klein linens. Back to the service...  Upon departure and asking for a copy of my statement for expense reimbursement, service was of 'eh quality.  The response I got was my stay was prepaid (i.e. ""I'm not going to waste my time printing one for you"").  I then explained I needed a copy anyway for reimbursement, then silence and no eye contact (i.e. ""I'm going to ignore your request"").  So, annoyed, I then walk out but oddly get my back yelled at in a very loud tone (i.e. ""Ma'am!"" ""Ma'am!!""), 3 times, until I make it out the front door, keep in mind, there are 2 other guests in the lobby watching this unfold..  Unprofessional methinks. Hmmm.... Overall, for the price and the fact that I only had to spend 7 hours in the room, it was good enough.",N

The only problem was that the heat could be turned off!  We had to open the windows and put the ac on!!!!  I should have called down and had them check on it, but was too tired...we muddled through.  told mgmt about ii in the morning and they were very nice and apologetic, I should have called!!!",N
4069,"I forgot to review the hotel we stayed at recently (October 2007) during our trip to Chicago for a conference. I remembered to review our horrible dining experience at one of the restaurants here (see http://www.yelp.com/biz/...) -- but neglected to review our stay in one of the rooms. We stayed for a few nights - check in was fine. The lady was training someone, but everything was fast and efficient. The only negative was that we reserved a king size bed, but the only room left with one was one equipped for wheelchairs. She asked if that would be OK, and in my haste, I said sure. I shouldn't have. The room was horrible. The negatives piled up. First of all, the shower. That was the worst aspect of the room. The showerhead was ""removable"", attached to a bar where it could slide up and down - to adjust height I suppose. The problem here is that it would slide down on it's own... so if I wanted to clean my lower half and not my upper half it would have been great. Or if I was three feet tall. So I was constantly readjusting the shower. Not to mention the shower never felt that clean (paint peeling and water damage... and a few bugs). Oh, and it was like a tub with no sides. Secondly, there was no counter in the bathroom - so there was nowhere to put any of your stuff. At all. I actually took a luggage rack, placed towels over the straps, and put my bathroom bag on it. Ridiculous.   Another annoying factor was the door - it was configured so when you opened it, it stayed open... for way too long. It would have been fine if there was an optional button to operate the door (for a wheelchair), but it was sort of power operated so no matter what it stayed open for at least 10 or 15 seconds after you enter. So the entire floor can essentially see in your room for that long. So you kind of stand there awkwardly and wait for the door to close before proceeding. The positive for the room was the bed. It was wonderful. One of the only hotel room beds where I wake up not aching. OK, perhaps the only one I can remember where I didn't wake up aching. So that's a big plus. I guess the location was too, but it was awfully far away from the convention center.  Lobby was meh and the food options not great (especially if you want to eat healthy), room service or anything like renting a movie was grossly expensive (even for a hotel). Probably wouldn't stay there again, but hey - bed was nice and the corporation paid - can't beat that.",N
3897,"I really liked it! It's a beautiful old piece of Chicago history. I stayed there just this week for the fist time ever, and was immediately glad I didn't spend the extra money for a boutique version of a national chain hotel. Our room was clean and inviting, the staff was incredibly helpful and friendly and the location at the price is excellent. Call me a nerd, but if you research a bit of it's back story, it's really a neat destination. It is an 1893 building that has hosted numerous celebrities, notorious historical figures, and presidents. Complete with interesting, outdated (yet well-made and likely very expensive at it's time) decor, it is a must. You can hardly walk through it without picturing yourself in a completely different era, and not many places can boast that.",N
188,"Formally a DoubleTree Suites, the hotel has graduated to Hilton status.  That said, to me it still feels more like a doubletree than the big H.  You know, a tiny convenience stand located in a small lobby. Decent but not fine furniture and interior.   That said, still a fine, clean and well maintained hotel.   Keep in mind, the locale is very central...close to many ChiTown sites, but also in a sterile neighborhood, lacking character.",N
1682,"This hotel was extremely nice for it being downtown. The prices are great and the staff is very friendly. Though this is a pet friendly facility, no pets ever got in our way or were too loud. There's a restaurant called ""321"" hooked up in the hotel. The food is pretty good and the waiters are almost too ridiculously funny and nice. Then there's the Encore bar..which I'm pretty sure only tourists hang out there, so if you're into annoying tourists..I say this is where it's at. OH AND TOURISTS ARE SO RUDE. UNGRATEFUL, AND ANNOYING. I couldn't believe Chicago was filled with such snotty middle class white people in the summer. ANYWAYS...The lobby is really cool! They serve coffee in the mornings, water and ice tea in the afternoon, and wine at night, for free! It's also a cool place to hang out since the rooms are so small. However small the rooms may be, it was a nice room. Most hotel rooms you'll find in ANY city will be that small. Especially at such a good price. I would come here again.",N
799,"it's just that it's crowded. i think that's really it the rooms aren't bad, though a little smaller. but it's a downtown hotel, at maximum capacity, all the time. as long as you don't need any servicing for anything, it's fine. but if you want anything (fix the shower), be prepared to wait an hour, or (i need deoderant) it may not come at all",N
3323,"Gorgeous Carbide & Carbon building.  Exceptionally decorated throughout.  The service is wonderful and the rooms are stocked, even the beds are super cozy.

LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION and a one night stay was reasonably priced.",N
5257,"I know some of the workers at this hotel.  They were treated so badly, they filed a class action lawsuit against the management.  Instead of resolving the situation, the management fired all 25!  They were told they could get their same jobs back if they went through a temp agency... for less pay and no benefits of course.  I urge you to look for a hotel that respects workers rights.  Unfortunately Best Western is not one of them.",Y
4038,"It seems I always have a problems with elevators. This time, HEARING them. Constantly. That, combined with the airplane noise, made me wonder why they didn't spend some renovation money on better soundproofing the rooms. In fact, if you stand long enough in the bathroom, you can actually HEAR conversations from within the elevator. So, note: if you receive a room near the elevator lobby, I suggest you change it. As for that airplane noise, I stayed in the hotel next door last year, and didn't hear a thing from the outdoors. Moving on, we were given a room in the newly renovated tower, which still had that ""new carpet"" scent. The room was huge and spacious, with a nice view of the city. The beds at the Hyatt are ALWAYS comfortable -- I love them so much, I want to buy one. But the pillows? Suck hard core. Every Hyatt now seems to stock these tiny, almost square head pillows. If I'm in a King bed, I kind of want matching King pillows, you know what I'm saying? The people who work here are amazing -- everyone from the luggage guy to the concierge to the check-in/out staff, and even the guy who hails the cabs for you. I like that the hotel has a mini store on the lower level, where I was able to purchase coffee, milk and cereal, a banana and a variety of other snacks for the room. That said, you know it costs like 3x more than if you bought it in a store yourself ($8 for said bowl of cereal, big chug milk & banana). Oh, the sake of convenience, right? Also, we had ""no smoking"" signs in our room, which made me believe that some rooms DO allow smoking, which I smelled quite frequently throughout our weekend stay. I'd stay at the Hyatt Regency again simply because of its location and value for the room price.",N
5639,"Awesome hotel!!  Stayed this last weekend with my fiance and couldn't have asked for anything better.  As per priceline's 4 star rating, it had everything I could have wished for and the beds were amazing (I slept so well)! Perfect location also...right by the best restaurant in Chicago, Frontera Grill!",N
3473,"It's a classic old brick hotel that's been refurbished into a pleasant boutique lodging for those on a budget.  Given its age the rooms (and hallways, and elevators -- dragging luggage is not always a perfectly smooth operation) are small, but all the room interiors have been comfortably refreshed. The location is great, right on the Mile with excellent views from the higher floors.  Their lounge is modern (but again, small), but a nice quiet spot for a drink.   In the morning, there's complimentary Intelligentsia coffee to start your day. I'd definitely stay there again when business takes me into the second city proper.",N
3065,"The W spoils you.  Favorite part is the room itself and that is what counts.  Well designed, plasma screen, understated colors, a nice place to relax after some tough business days in Chicgo. The downsides, not enough elevators!  On Saturday night becuase of the club on 33rd floor we could not get back to room for 15 minutes. Service while good just feels false, almost too good.  Did not appreciate being charged to have packages delivered to the room, seemed cheap for a hotel in this price range. I know that I am not the target age group for their marketing, but plenty of people my age visit this hotel and I would love them to first turn down the elevator music and then have someone ease off on the bass and drum beats early in the morning. Nice gym and great place to stay.",N
4779,"Positives for the Palmer House include the incredible lobby and a wonderful location - a block from Michigan Avenue, the Art Institute and Millennium Park.  Kudos to the concierge staff, all were friendly and helpful.Negatives - well our rooms sure didn't look like the rooms touted in their marketing material.  Peeling wallpaper and scuffed up paint, low ceilings in the halls that a 6'5"" person would find daunting.  No coffee service in the room.  For $13 extra, they'll provide you with a coffee maker and 4 packs of coffee.  They'll provide additional coffee at a considerable upcharge, and they won't clean up around the coffee maker.  And no matter what time of day it was, the room service attendants were blocking the hallways with service carts.  Weird service all around.Lockwood's, the hotel restaurant was very expensive for both breakfast and dinner.  Breakfast was mediocre as was the service.  We'd been comped breakfast in exchange for an awful dinner the night before, other wise we'd never have gone back.  Dinner was extremely expensive and the service was abysmal.  I'd thought that maybe our waiter wasn't feeling well because he kept wiping his forehead, and he seemed completely disinterested in his work.  We'd tried to ask questions about the menu and the wines, but he mumbled so, that even upon asking him again, we still couldn't understand him.  The menu was ambitious, with claims of using local farms for meats and produce.  I give them credit for that.  But, that's it.  The flavors were completely nondescript.  If you want to spend $165 for dinner for two, there are much better alternatives.",Y
4321,"I have been to motels in small towns in India that offer more emenities. Seriously. This hotel was one of the worst I have stayed at in terms of convenience. Big giant old tv in the room. NO fridge. Tiny room for over $200/night. I was here for a corporate event, and even the customers who came to visit during the day were complaining about the confusing layout of the hotel. Its ornate and beautiful, but that's about it. There are two places to eat at the hotel, that's it. One is closed during the day. So, one place to eat. ""Good luck getting breakfast"" the lady at the front counter joked no too long ago. She was actually very nice, and it was kind of funny, but... I was hungry and it's raining outside :P So now I'm at the corner street bakery. Kind of a shame, because there is so much history behind the hotel. Made as a gift for Palmer's wife in September 1871 it burnt down 13 days later in the great Chicago fire. Only to be rebuilt in plush opulent style and setting by 1873. It was the world's first fireproof hotel. It also boatsted telephone and electricity in every room, and something called an 'elevator'. They promoted it by saying it's a train between floors connected by pulley & rope. Palmer took out a $1.7 M loan, at the time to rebuild it, the largest loan for somethig like this. (I think that number is correct). In 1925 it was rebuilt again, this time going from 7 stories to 25 stories. At the time, the largest hotel in the world. In 1943 Conrad Hilton bought it for $20 million. And so, began it slow descent to wired wifi and big booty television sets. The Internet- you have to be plugged in to your room for the wifi to work!!! THAT'S NOT WIFI!!!! Or, you can get ""wifi"" in the hotel lobby, for $8/Hr. $20/night to be plugged in. And the cable is so short you kind of have to sit at the uncomfy desk, no laying in bed surfing the web action. I asked if I can check out an hour later. There is no one after me staying in the room, but, apparently it is hotel policy to Charge $50 if you check out at 1pm. This place is a joke. DO NOT STAY HERE. Instead, check out an air bnb, that's what I'm doing for the rest of my trip here :) Oh, also... This place is haunted... Heard multiple people say they heard whispers ;) PS: Paris Hilton sucks too. There.",N
2927,"Had a nice stay at the Sheraton.  We booked this hotel last minute on priceline on the way in to Chicago and ended up with a great room overlooking the river.  Perfect location for walking to Navy Pier, Mag Mile, Mil Park (bean), etc.   Only one small problem during the stay... the beds were WAY too soft.  I usually like a nice soft bed but you sink so far in that you have to wiggle just to get up out of the creases!!   Otherwise it was a great hotel.  I would def stay here again!",N
981,"My experience with the Amalfi was great! I stayed there last year when I came to the city to look for housing for when I moved. We got a great deal booking online and were extremely happen we decided to stay there. The location is perfect. It is around anything you need and restaurants galore. The free cocktail hour was a very pleasant suprise. They had an extremely nice spread of food and drinks for this cocktail hour (including their house made ""Amalfitini""). They have fresh mozarella and proscuitto among many other things. When we went to the concierge to get a dinner recommendation, not only did she recommend something to us, but she knew someone at the restaurant and was able to get us 25% off our entire bill plus free dessert. That was a great perk! Other than that, the hotel is very nice and is a more modern looking style. I highly recommend this hotel.",N
1597,"This was my hotel for NYE.  I had a comp room, due to a previous issue and them having to ""walk"" me to another hotel.  Overall, it was OK, but only after they moved us to a suite after initially wanting to put us in a room that hadn't been renovated.  When I explained that we had the free stay due to an earlier problem, the desk guy upgraded us to the suite (much to the dismay of the guy who was checking in next to me-  he was told that even though he had reserved a suite on Expedia, there were none currently available.  The suite had a spacious living room, with a large TV, desk and sitting area.  There was a non-working refrigerator in the ""hospitality"" area and a microwave.  There was no ice machine nearby (not good for that bottle of vodka which was getting lonely), so I called room service to order two double vodkas, a can of mixer and a bucket of ice.  I was told that the ice machine was on the floor below and they couldn't bring ice.  After checking three floors, I finally found the ice machine.  Returning to my floor, I was greeted by a funky smell. I thought that it was a dead animal.   Walking down the hallway, it struck me that the dead animal smell was actually some of the most pungent marijuana that I've ever experienced (and I've experienced A LOT of marijuana!).  After catching the hallway buzz, I relaxed in the room and was quickly delivered my cocktails, though without the mixer- full glasses of straight Absolut.  The full effect of the complimentary weed had now permeated both the hallway and my room.  The entire floor reeked! In any event, the room was fine.  I would have liked a bar, restaurant, faster elevators and newer towels, but overall an OK place to stay.  If I get another free suite and another free contact high, I'll definitely do back.",N
1281,"My mother and sister in law attended afternoon tea here last weekend.  We had done it before 2 years prior and found it to be one of the better teas offered in the city.  Unfortunately, they've changes some things around and we experienced terrible service. Last time when there was an afternoon tea we were in the section underneath/surround by all the windows with city views.  This time, we were told our reservation for tea was in their itty bitty, open and uncharismatic restaurant.  Points lost for change of scene and seeing the city.  Then, there was no harpist or carolers or anything that represented this quaint holiday tradition.  Instead it just sounded like we were in a field house.   All that aside, the service was terrible.  Especially considering it's the Ritz...I would think they'd have people kissing your ass left and right.  We were 10 mins early for our 4pm reservation, and yet weren't sat until 4:20.  This is only after we witnessed the entire 'lobby' (by the fountain) clear out and everyone else sat that had come after us....I actually went up to the host and pointed this out to which he brought us to a table that wasn't set.   The wait staff was horrific throughout the entire experience.  We spoke to about 4 different servers, each bringing something different.  Our original server that took our order, never came back to get our wine order.  We had to flag him down.  No one ever came by to check in on us, or worse, refill our wine glasses.  We grabbed a bus boy to do so.  Then when the check came, it sat for 20 minutes and when still no one had come by to pick it up, we had to flag down yet another waiter to run the card. Never again Ritz.",N
5562,"I recently stayed here on a Monday (of all days). The La Quinta opened earlier this year in a former office building. Unlike the roadside properties of this chain, this La Quinta is in the western edge of the Loop (Franklin + Madison) so it is convenient for business folk and for leisure travelers visiting the nearby Sears/Willis Tower. My room was pleasant enough, with carpeting in one half of the room and wood flooring in the other. There was a microwave, empty mini-fridge, and coffeemaker. My view overlooked Madison, and it was fun to watch the workers in the building across the street and those rushing to the nearby CTA and Metra stations. True, the closet is a bit small and the toiletries are limited, but they have very nice rates for a downtown property. The breakfast buffet is included, and I made my own waffle to go along with my filling meal (sausage, bacon, muffins, fruit, cereal, yogurt, juice etc.). The staff seemed busy, but most of the time they did take an extra second to greet me like a real guest. They have an indoor pool with a tiny Jacuzzi, which I enjoyed immensely after a long day of errands.",N

5839,"I stayed here last Sunday (April 26) with my friends while we were visiting Chicago and I was not impressed one bit. Our experience started off over the phone where my friend called to see if we can get an early check-in. The front desk clerk who took answered the call was quite unprofessional and sounded like she dumb founded, so my friend hung up. The check-in seemed to be fine until we actually went to our room. The bellman helped us to our original room (1423) and was very courteous and informative. When we finally opened the door to our room, immediately we smelled a stench of either vomit or rotten milk. *uGh* GROSS. We questioned the bellman to see if he can smell the odor and he said no and proceeded to call the house keeping. I did not like the fact that the bellman sounded a bit rude when he stated over the phone ""the guests in 1423 thinks there's an odor in here, but I don't smell anything and I am highly sensitive of any stench."" I'm sorry, but if there was really no odor, would you really think I'd waste my time fussing over the room when I could be around town. After the call was made, the bellman told us if there was anything wrong he was sure they would be able to accommodate us and still refused that there was an odor in our room and said all the rooms smelled like that. The bellman left and house keeping came in with his spray bottle in his hand. Of course, right away he smelled the odor and we pretty much told him that won't help. So we called the front desk to make arrangements for a new room. Little did we know that we were going to get moved to the 10th floor which had the stench of cigarettes throughout the floor. *uGh* gross. We pay the suppose ""4-star"" price at a non-smoking hotel for a reason and I felt like we stayed at a 2 or 3 star MOTEL because of the service and uncleanliness of the hotel. I honestly wished we would of just booked two nights at the Wyndham.",Y
5186,"Allegro has a great wine reception every evening and the lobby is very cool.  I think the rooms are a bit small, and not as nice as I would have expected for the price $$$.  Room service food was really tasty but a bit overpriced, and they tack on an addtional $2.00 delivery fee, plus 18% tip.  And BEWARE - the hotel is haunted!",Y
1392,"Location location location.  That is the key.  It's across from the Drake.  It's near the 900 Shops.   My friend got married here and the staff was very knowledgeable and helpful.

3803,"****FOR EVENT AND MEETING PLANNERS**** We chose the Dana Hotel and Spa for a business meeting last month and it went off without a hitch.  If you are looking for a place that will help you plan a flawless event, please choose the Dana.  Sandi and Maureen in their events office are fabulous to work with and are punctual, flexible, and creative.  The food was very good and we recieved ample compliments from our attendees.",N
1484,I went here for a wedding and I was so impressed. The food was great and the banquet hall was gorgeous. Everything was so beautifully decorated and arranged and the service was great.  This is really a wonderful place to have a wedding reception!,N
3287,"I really enjoyed the ambiance. Plus, they even allowed dogs in here! You get a free list of songs (like a CD) on itunes as well. I would stay here again. It was enjoyable. I even forgot some toiletries and they brought some up to my room which was free of charge.",N
3922,"This place is only a couple of blocks from my project site, so we often go here for drinks at the bar.  We just recently spent quite a bit on a holiday party that I was a tad underwhelmed by. The service was good and things were set up well, if we were 5. The tables and chairs belonged in a pre-school classroom. We had ""tall boys"" too, but those were just for standing.  After 5 hours in heels I wanted to sit and enjoy my drink in peace.  But I felt like a 5 year old sitting at the table while all of the grown-ups walked by.   Side note... they don't decorate except for some white tablecloths, a table votive and red napkins.  It's all DIY, which was ok, but would have been nice if they did something for the holidays. Anyway... The food was only ok.  The chips tasted like stale poo (not that I officially know what that tastes like), but everything else was decent. It's close and convenient, but it might tell you something that they were available for a holiday party 2 weeks before the event.  3 stars because the servers were really really nice and they allowed us to extend our party for 2 hours, which means that they're also pretty flexible. Overall things were pretty good - from a work holiday party perspective.  I have no idea what the rooms look like, but hopefully they have furniture made for adults.",N
5680,"I stayed here a few times while I was looking for a place.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  The rooms were always large and clean. (I think I was in a suite) Mine always had a desk  that faced the large flat screen television, a couch and had tons of room.  I think the location would be excellent for any out of town visitor as it is close to Miracle Mile and the train. I did not experience the bar or the restaurant so no comment.   There is a nice carryout place across the street on the corner.  Having otherwise stayed at The James (way overrated) in Chicago I would choose the Talbott for any family in town, sensible couple or business person.  There seems to be plenty of cool exciting places to see and be scene in Chicago and if your room does not need to be one of them stay here.  The Talbott is a welcoming comfortable place to stay.",N
763,"5 star location!!!! 3 star accomodations -rooms need to be updated and not everything was working in my room on this visit. I always base part of my experience on whether the room really calls to me to stay in and relax...this place doesnt do that. BUT the location of the hotel is stellar. Theres no better location in terms of being 1/2 block away from Michigan ave and close to all the shops. So, you pay for the location which will keep you out of the room so you wont mind the room if thats the case.  ;)",N
4437,"It is a 3-4. It was hard to decide which.  Here are some pros and cons: CONS: -I would have written this review when I was actually there, but the internet situation is terrible.  The rooms only have wired and they charge you PER computer. That means that you have to pay to use the one plug and then hand it over to the other person in the room and pay again, even though only ONE computer is online at a time. If you are going to do that, at least have free wireless for guests in the lobby!  But, no, you pay for that too! -The phone reception in the lobby is 0. -The people who work there are not super friendly. -The rooms are small -The place doesn't have the best smell PROS: -The place is old and very charming.  The lobby is beautiful.   -The rooms were nicely decorated in the modern meets classic kind of way.",N
5288,"I agree, five stars. The staff was very friendly, professional and quick. They had the perfect recommendations for sightseeing, dining and drinking. Hangover cure breakfast @ 1 pm - the Temple Cafe was the right suggestion. The room was modern and sleek, with the most comfortable bed out of any hotel I have stayed at (and I travel for work plenty). Continental breakfast on every floor - thus allowing the guests to sneak out in pjamas, grab delicious fluffy croissants, and run away back to the room. The location was perfect - minutes from the CTA, right next to the river, and walking distance to many sights, Mag Mile, dinning and boozing. Yay Amalfi...thanks for the wonderful time.",Y
3377,"Dear General Manager, I stayed at the Essex in June on a business trip. I ordered room service quite a bit and it came to my attention that the busboys were not getting the 16% gratuity charged to me. I find this abhorrent, dishonest to the guests, and exploitative to the staff. It also puts the guests in an uncomfortable situation as  the busboys are looking / expecting a tip that is advertised as inclusive in the menu. Please immediately look into this situation and make sure that this practice is stopped as soon as possible. I'm posting this information on yelp, so other visitors to Chicago do not inadvertently get taken advantage of, or contribute to the exploitation of people who work in the service industry.",N
2301,"Agreed. Location is great.  But there are also a lot of other hotels in the same area.  I stayed at this location for a convention being held at the venue.  If I had a choice I would have stayed elsewhere...for the following reasons: - Rooms are tiny.  They have updated the decor but doesn't make up for the closet feeling room. - Separate charge for internet service.  If some motels can provide free wifi why can't you when I pay 3x as much for a stay here? - Split elevators.  They have separate elevators for floors 1-28 and another set of elevators for the higher floors.  Confusing if it's your first day there or you switched your room several times like I did. - Broken ac/heater functions.   - Foul smell bathrooms.  Like they used a dirty cloth and no cleaning solvents to wipe down the inside of the bathrooms.  Ewwww On a positive note, the staff was wonderful and really accomodating.  If only the building and amenities reflected the cost and service - I would be a happy camper.",N
4092,"Every time I spotted a hotel employee, they were always smiling. It's clear that they enjoy making their guests happy. Check-in was easy and quick. It seems as though they don't treat their Priceline customers different than any of their other customers (which is a good thing!) Being on the North end of the loop, the location was great. It was steps away from Michigan Avenue, and a couple of blocks away from State Street. The view from the room was grand, facing the Wrigley Building and Tribune Tower. The bed was very comfortable. There was actually a bathtub in the bathroom, which comes in handy after a long day of walking around. The lobby was both busy and beautiful. There was a great selection of food inside the hotel. It's reminiscent of a Vegas hotel (sans casino). I will definitely stay here again when I visit Chicago. At their price range, Hyantt Regency definitely goes above and beyond of what's expected from them.",N
3375,"This hotel is contained in a modern glassy box, in contrast to the old-fashioned Hilton and Congress Plaza along the way. They have a shuttle bus to take you to nearby areas.",N
922,"Stayed here a few nights in the Spring of 2007, very enjoyable.  Beautiful lobby, friendly staff, unusual 1920's-office-building decor (nicely renovated).  Only complaint: noise from construction across the street, but that's certainly not their fault.",N
4102,"I stayed here last weekend for TBOX. The price was great for downtown Chicago. My room was really small and the room had an extra bed in it (my reservation was for one). I spotted a stain on the sheets on one of the beds, so I ended up sleeping in the other. My view was of a roof, boo. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive though. I thought internet access was free in this day and age, but this place charges a pretty hefty fee. Very disappointing. Channel choices on the TV were also very limited without paying more. I'd consider staying here again, but it wouldn't be my first choice.",N
317,"Loved how close this hotel was to where we needed to be, but holy crap was that one of the worst night's sleep I've ever had. There is absolutely no soundproofing to prevent you from hearing the L, its announcements, and its chimes all night long. The AC was a window unit, so it was like having an open window and all the noise coming right in. I really wanted to like it here, and maybe it's not so bad in different rooms, but I'll never stay here again. They should consider adding earplugs to their basket of things to buy in the room, I'd gladly have paid big bucks for them during my sleepless night.",N
3059,"I have in fact stayed at some great W Hotels...this is NOT one of them. I may be from Hollywood, but save the game of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde for someone else...thanks but NO thanks! Let me start off by saying that this is my first ever Yelp review (first of many to come)...the sad part is that such a horrible experience is provoking my first motivation to actually critique a hotel establishment. I'll keep it short and sweet. I travel on a weekly basis for work and pleasure, have stayed in both fantastic and terrible hotels around the world. No story is necessary...when I fly across the country from LA on a weekly basis, I would like to arrive with first class treatment late on a Friday evening after a long work week, especially at $400 per night. Customer service is most important, and non-existent at this establishment (as pointed out by previous Yelpers). Even when I had a ""good"" stay in weeks prior, service was mediocre, room service blah, bar service...yikes. Oh, and hotel staff at the front should probably know a little something about the surrounding area, restaurants, etc...despite the fact that visitors can see the shadows of Navy Pier from their windows between the lake fog and the windy rain, a little ""local knowledge"" may go a long way here. Save yourself the $$, there are too many other options in the city of Chicago...when weather permits, you can walk to the lake from many other better options!",N
2546,"I wish I could give a place zero stars.   First off let me start off by saying I hate clubs.  My very good friend wanted to celebrate a milestone birthday but didn't want to go to a bar because she wanted us all to get dressed up. So last minute she decided to set up a party here. We get there and get to skip the line. We were suppose to have a table reserved because bottles were being bought. We get there someone else is in our spot. We end up having to get another bottle to get seated somewhere else. Super shady.   We get seated by the super busy main area. With a party of 20+ that didn't work out so well. So they had to move us to the back.  Whatever. Good times were had. Until I go to bar to get a drink because I wanted something else.  The bartender was being a scumbag after someone took my friends drink and I told her. She was being such a douche about it and I wasn't even asking for another one free.  I had to explain to her so many times to give my friend his card back and we'll pay cash. She refused a few times. Saying we haven't met the limit. Which we had. She really gave us a hard time. But finally gave it back.   Then at the end of the night while my girl was paying for the bottle they bring her the slip to sign but tell her they had just lost her card!  They just had it and lost it in 5 minutes?! What the?! My girl refused to sign until she got her card back. This went on for twenty minutes.  The birthday girl happened to know one of te bouncers, she told him what was going on. He comes back in five minutes WITH her card!!!!!!  What the hell is that? She was so mad, they did nothing to apologize or take a little of the bill for the hassle.   Do not give these people your credit cards. I know there is something fishy about this place...",N
3469,Ditto on what everyone else said.  Rooms are tiny but nice and modern.  Location is excellent - right on Michigan Ave. near tons of shopping. I wouldn't stay here again though.  I prefer larger rooms.,N
1898,"Rooms here are actually much nicer than the lakeshore location. Rooms seemed larger, BUT you have no views...but you are in the heart of the financial district. So it all depends on what you want. I like the rooms better. I will say SERVICE WAS SLOW EVERYWHERE. RESTARAUNT WAS HORRID SLOW, TOOK 40 MINUTES TO GET SCRAMBLED EGGS AND ANOTHER 10 MINUTES FOR KETCHUP. I think this can be a swank place, good location for theatre etc..but the service here is way below par and please expect to wait for everything here.",N

They have a bar on the 40th floor that gives great views of Chicago.  Food is artfully presented, staff is very friendly.  Oh and I LOVE the zebra chairs.I'll be back to the Avenue hotel on my next trip to Chicago for sure.",Y

2599,"I went here for the first time when it first opened and I liked it.  Then I went again, and again, and it deteriorated every time, resulting in a HORRIBLE experience last Saturday night.  I have had bottle service there and many other places before so I know the drill - there are minimums and things get hectic on Saturday nights.  I called well in advance to make the reservation; there was no mention of a minimum # of bottles, although I knew in the past that with large parties, places require minimums.  Since nothing was mentioned, and since we only had 4 girls, (this is typical - 4 people per bottle) I assumed that 1 bottle was enough.  Not only was this never mentioned, after we ordered 1 $100 bottle of Veuve champagne, we were not permitted to order the $50 bottle - we were forced to order another bottle of Veuve for $100 and it was not done in a polite manner.   This in itself was not terrible, but coupled with the fact that we were seated in the worst table imaginable, it was too much to handle.  Not only were we seated in the corner (with everyone standing around us), in which we were literally everyone's garbage can that finished their drinks and set them down on our table, but the wait staff seemed to make up the rules as they went along.  TIMOTHY rudely told me that there was a $200 minimum and the 2 bottle rule was for liquor bottles.  And to get a better table you had to buy liquor bottles.  Hmmm - that wasn't in the fine print.   Last time I went I said I would never go again, due to the rude people (hey, just like the people that kept setting their drinks down on our table), but after this experience, I will definitely never spend that kind of money again to be treated like this.  Places like this and Reserve that force you to buy bottles but still sit you in the middle of the crowds certainly do not know how to treat people.  The only reason this got 2 stars is due to the decor which is very cool and going there during the week is OK.  I am taking a leave of absence from Victor Hotel and if you do not want to leave broke and incredibly annoyed, you should do the same.  Fulton Lounge is just around the corner and a much better time.",N
1432,"My elderly parents needed an ADA compliant room with two double beds. The room was elegant and accommodated them easily. The room was clean, quiet and the beds were ""fresh"" and luxurious. The door men were always ready to help them in and out of the car. Also, when they did not answer their phone the concierge personally went to their room to make them aware we were waiting for them. The restaurant serves breakfast and lunch only. You don't need dinner because of all the restaurants within walking distance you will want to try from the Cheesecake Factory to The Rosebud Steak House, etc. The breakfast menu is simple and delicious and fairly priced. We had breakfast for $80 with tip for four adults. The omelets were perfectly made and the contents fresh and perfectly sautéed. The oatmeal, my favorite, was made well and that means it was freshly made with attention to detail. The bacon was well cooked, but not burnt as I asked. One note, basic single rooms have one king sized bed in a smaller room. If you need two double beds or a larger room there will be an up charge of about $30 or more per night. Parking approaches $60 plus tips for the door man so it is not recommended you stay here if you have a car to park. I made the reservation on Priceline and I saw no difference in how we were treated because of the discounted rate. The sales staff also has excellent email communication skills so you can get exactly what you need and confirmation emails to set you mind at ease.",N
445,"Hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating.  The rooms are very nice size and clean.  The rooms all have oversize Jacuzzi tubs, without the jets, but still nice since they are large enough for those of us who may like the extra room.  The neighborhood seemed a little bit dumpy but I never felt threatened or afraid.  The parking lot is fenced in but not locked up or closed in and well lit.  It is away from the main stream of downtown Chicago, but close enough that you can easily get there in a taxi.  For those that are unfamiliar with taxi's, chicago is one of the cheapest places to use a taxi.  I took the taxi from the Hotel to a restaurant on the north end for under $12.  You just don't find that anywhere. Did I mention that the parking at the hotel is free as well.  If you have a large vehicle they do have some street parking behind the hotel.  With the hotel on State street you can easily catch a metro bus as well to downtown, quite frequently.",N
4176,"This hotel is in a great location for some good, touristy sight seeing. It is next to the Chicago River and walking distance to both the Navy Pier and Millennium Park. The rooms are very nice with large, comfy beds. The atmosphere is pretty upbeat. Only downside is the lack of free wifi and the tv gets bad reception. I mean, I did not go to Chicago to watch tv but on down time it is nice to sit and veg. The signal was in and out constantly. All in all, I would recommend this hotel.",N

The bedding would have been beautiful, except for the conspicuous stains on the throw pillows. One can only imagine... No coffee maker in the room! WTF? It was really loud as well. We asked for a room away from the elevator to avoid hearing people trekking in and out all night. But nonetheless, constant noise. And there was some mysterious whirring noise all night long that I think was an ice machine.  Luckily I brought ear plugs. The room looked nice, and the lobby was beautiful, but all-in-all, not a comfy stay at all.",N

5520,"I stayed there over a weekend while visiting Chicago. I waited till the last minute to book the room, so it wasn't particularly cheap (around $200 a night), but I wouldn't be surprised if you could get a cheaper rate by making plans in advance. Nevertheless I really enjoyed the place. The hotel is pretty small (and it looks like an old apartment building), but the rooms are nice: we had a standard room with a queen-size bed, and it was relatively large and very clean. The staff at the front desk was also very friendly and helpful, always saluting us when we came in or out, and always helping us with our questions. Not to forget: the location is top-notch if you want to hang out in Boystown: it's just one block from Halsted St where most of the gay bars are located... very convenient. They have free continental breakfast, but I didn't get a chance to try it, and they have an agreement with the parking garage next door, where you can park for $20 a day with in-and-out privileges. Nice little hotel... I'd definitely consider staying there again next time I'm in town if I can get a cheaper rate.",N
859,Awesome suite upgrade with yelp checkin!,N
3179,"I've now stayed here dozens of times and it seems to be a staple property for my team when we work in Chicago. Overall it's a great property, but the location is a bit inconvenient.  Aside from the proximite to Navy Pier, it's a bit out of the way from the downtown area, or the uptown nightlife. The bar area is very cool with tons of space for people to spread out on a variety of different chairs/couches. On each of the floors, there is a little telescope that allows you to view Navy Pier from an elevated view, which is a nice cool touch. The valet guys are very helpful- they'll waive down cabs that are lined up around the corner of Lakeshore drive.  However, the design of the drop-off/pick-up circle is very odd.  Sometimes you have traffic going in both directions, and in the busy mornings, it's not uncommon to get stuck between a few cars going in different directions. Note: I am on a personal mission to stay at every W Hotel in the USA (and then hopefully branch out to worldwide!)",N
4129,"Stayed at the Hyatt Regency for two nights and two days.  It was a nice hotel.   Pros: -The service was terrific here.  They went out of their way to serve us and provide whatever it was that we needed from directions to restaurant recommendations to hailing a cab for us.  The indoor atrium of the hotel is very large and very nice.  It had a great bar that was packed both nights that we stayed. - Amazing views of Chicago - VERY comfortable bed and pillows - Flat panel LCD TV - Excellent location in the heart of Chicago - Several restaurants in and nearby the hotel, including Giordano's Cons: - Our room was out dated - Dated bathroom - Breakfast Buffet $22.00 - this isn't the Trump hotel - If you have room service bring you a case of Bud Light, it will cost $128! - No light switches, you have to walk across the dark room in search of a tiny lamp switch The only reason the I didn't give Hyatt Regency four stars: the room was dated and the bathroom needed a remodel. http://www.chicagoregenc...",N
5296,"If you are looking for a good price, this is pretty much it, but spend a few extra dollars and get a nice room, say the Doubletree.  This particular Red Roof Inn needs to be totally gutted and renovated.  It is terrible.  It was the worst night I have ever spent at a hotel in my life and I have travelled quite a bit.  Even a little motel in the upper peninsula of Michigan is nicer and cleaner than this place!   I complained and got my money back, but it took 3 weeks.   The manager was very nice and said they were going to be putting in new floors, but it needs so much more work than this!  It is a shame, because it is in a great location, walking distance of the Magnificent Mile.",Y
2526,very comfty and relaxing. the maid service is really nice. they left a mint on my pillow and it was good! haha. i love hotels and this one i loved the most,N
1374,"Came here for an evening of downtown Chicago festivities and this was a great stay.   It certainly has that European feel, which to some, can just mean plain small.  We got a basic room but you can upgrade for more space for a small fee of about $15-20.  Learn your square footage for bookings these days so you know what questions to ask! Anyway, I don't mind small, especially since it way only overnight. There were drawers for your stuff and a decent closet so you can get a lot of stuff out of the way if you want.  If I was staying for a week or something, I'd get the bigger room. Doors are pocket doors so they don't get in the way. With that said, there's an awkward gap on the bathroom door that if the person in the room is sitting at just the right angle, they can see a bit of your reflection in the bathroom mirror, even though the door is closed.  Hard to explain, but just be aware that if you do ""private"" things in the bathroom you wouldn't want others to see, keep this caveat in mind. Super quiet sleeping, very nice linens, huge TV, stocked mini-fridge.  I felt their customer service was fantastic.  Front desk was professional and very quick, and the doorman was kind enough the brush the snow of my dirty filthy car while we retrieved our bags.   One problem:  for late night snacks, there's not much around. The only place open within a block was Cheesecake Factory, and I wasn't going there.  Ended up going to Tempo, where there was a nice mix of people out late at night for a variety of reasons that I always find myself wondering....",N
2697,"Stayed here with friends over the weekend and was very pleased with the location and attentive staff. The rooms were a pretty good size, but despite being on the 9th floor, there was a lot of exterior noise. The only complaint about the room is that is really isn't designed to be shared (especially by 2 women): the bathroom is long and narrow with limited counter space and no lighting or outlets by the full-length mirror and no mirror at all in the bedroom, which makes concurrent getting ready very difficult. They have a nightly turn-down service and give you a little treat from the restaurant downstairs (e.g. a small cookie), which is a nice touch. Valet parking is very expensive ($48/day), but it does give you in & out privileges. The concierge was very helpful when we asked for bar/club recommendations and gave us front-of-the-line/no cover passes for our entire group to some near-by trendy places (think the cover at one of those places was actually like $20, so definitely worth asking for!).",N
2589,"I came here for a private party which was a plus since we were able to get a table and they had free drinks.  It's a little odd that the free drink was Hypnotiq but hey, it tastes like Kool-Aid, so I couldn't complain about that.  The decor was cool, but I just know this is the kind of place I would never come on my own.  This is more the kind of place where I'd lurk around making snotty comments under my breath Ghost World style.",N
709,"Think ""upscale Courtyard Marriott"" is an oxymoron? You won't if you stay here. My stay here felt similar to my stays at hotels in Chicago with reputations for being more higher-end. Beds were plush and very comfortable, staff was super friendly and very accomodating, and the lobby was warm and inviting - complete with a fireplace, a giant jar of cookies, a bowl of crisp apples and a dispenser of apple cider. Very convenient location, just a short block off Michigan Avenue. (Though if you are watching your calories, be warned: Getting to Michigan Avenue from this hotel requires passing Garrett's Popcorn; be prepared to be very tempted by the waff of hot caramel!)",N
3019,Pros - View of Lake Michigan - Food was solid combined with outdoor seating - Location - great location - close to Navy Pier & Michigan Ave Cons -Rooms/bathroom are small (even with upgrade) -Air-conditioning obscenely loud (according to the wife) -Rooms look dated but they tried hard to update them (Used to be an old Days Inn) -Wife thought the room smelled (1st room was smoky and we got switched; second room has carpet cleaner overkill) -Service was poor - specifically bell desk shuttling us a new key that never happened and I ultimately headed down there. Conrad & Blackstone are still my go-to properties in Chi-town. Still figuring out the best SPG option.,N
2709,"This hotel was pretty much everything I wanted when I booked it. I Booked a 4-night stay from a travel discount site (Orbitz, Travelocity, etc) and got a rate around 130/ night. The bed was REALLY comfortable! The bath products were Khiel's and added that special touch. All around a modern, clean, QUIET hotel. Their club the J bar (detached but just around the corner) had great cocktails and funky house music (gotta love Chicago house music). There were some misunderstandings when I booked a massage in the Aveda spa but the front desk manager worked hard to make it right and my massage was fabulous (and at a discounted price). In fact, the entire staff was VERY friendly and eager to help however they could...I even received suggestions on some cool nightspots from the person who delivered my shot espresso. They get bonus points for all of the doormen being sexy! I didn't give the hotel 5 stars because I was less than pleased with the room service. One night I had to refuse the food for being cold. On the plus side, they offered a nice selection of fresh squeezed fruit and vegetable juices. The other reason they didn't get 5 stars, my bill at checkout time was incorrect. Located within a block radius is Starbucks, Trader Joes, a decent Mexican restaurant and Grand Lux Cafe (yummy spot operated by The Cheesecake Kitchen). Overall a great location and a hotel I would definitely revisit.",N
497,"I really like this place.  I went here with 11 of my friends last weekend and we reserved three rooms.  These rooms are suites so they are much bigger than  regular hotel room!  Pluses included that there was a sitting area (plus a pull out bed in case), plenty of sinks (one in the bedroom, one in the sitting room, and one in the bathroom), fridge, good breakfast, and free drinks in the evening.  And we also hd a party in one of the rooms after we came back from going out...and it fit everybody. The location is also pretty good.. two blocks from Navy Pier and two blocks from Michigan Avenue.  And it's much bigger than the other Embassy Suites in downtown. The biggest thing I didn't like was the check out time was 11 am.  Way too early in my opinion.  Also, the check in time was 4 pm.. a little too late.  But they have a great concierge service to leave your luggage with them.",N
1127,"This is an okay Fairmont,  however not my favorite.  The location is pretty good, close to  Michigan Ave. and walking distance to a lot of good bars/restaurants.  The concierge was very good and I used him daily (Tim, btw).  The rooms weren't that big and the bathroom didn't have a separate shower stall from bathtub.  The closet space was very minimal and the clothes drawers were almost non-existent.  The espresso machine was a nice touch, however I spent 5 days there and couldn't figure out how to  use it (probably says more about me than the machine).  The cleaning staff was good except for today when they knocked on the door at 8 am.  I probably wouldn't stay here again.  There are better options for a lower cost blocks away.",N
4345,"If you don't stay here, do walk in and see the lobby. Stay for lunch or just a glass of wine. It is one of those amazing grand old hotel lobbies. Plus the food is good and the service great. Second, if you want a hotel with a great gym, this place gets $10 more from you but it is a great big gym with tons of stuff. Plus the space is cool- they covered a section of roof amongst the towers, so it has a dramatic feel. And great gear and a lot of it, In addition to hitting you up for the gym, they also get $9.95/day for the Internet- and it is a wire. I had to work so plugged in laptop and played Netflix on the iPad at my desk, versus the usual sprawl on the bed in front of tv (and their tv's are old). Room-service service good, food OK. Comfy bed. Pretty deep tub that is bath worthy if you have such an inclination. Quiet.   The rooms aren't luxe but are nice. It is a great location. Orange line drops right across the street if you fly and train in from Midway.",N
4715,"When I checked In initially, I was greeted with a warm and friendly welcome by David, the innkeeper and Virginia, one of the proprietors of the Old Chicago Inn. The room I was staying in with my boyfriend was 3A and it was a gorgeous room (I love the exposed brick wall.) The room was huge and well heated (We came in late February.) We were so close to SOOOOO much. We visited Wrigleyville which was really close about 3 or 4 blocks I believe, walked to boystown which is right down the block almost which is so much fun with all its shops and everything, and went to downtown Chicago on the Red Line. Which is so cool, cause the Inn is about half a block from it and its not noisy at all! Oh and David's homemade cakes for breakfast are delicious! I would definitely stay here again the next time I come to Chicago.",Y
2674,"I've stayed here twice.  First, my fiance (at the time) decided to celebrate our ""half way through our engagement aka half way of living like a college student because weddings cost a small fortune"" weekend.  We stayed at the James for free as part of a promo package for Gen Art.  It was wonderful!  We both had a fantastic time. 5 months later, my lovely bridesmaids decide to rent a double room for my bachelorette party!  It was SO MUCH FUN.   Before the festivities began, I hung out with my 3 maids in the room and we all got ready together.  Then, the rest of the girls arrived for a private shower.  Since there were only a dozen girls, we were comfy.  I wouldn't put any more in the room though- they are a little right. Do you know why I know that my bridesmaids love me? They let me take the Kiehl's tolietry samples home.",N
3358,"Just because it's cheap doesn't mean it has to be crap, which it is.  The rooms are teeny tiny, so if you want to be comfortable you will need two rooms if you have more than two people, which will make it just as expensive as anywhere else.  The parking is valet only and crazy expensive ($40/day).  The daytime staff were jerks, including the valet guys and front desk guys.  We kept getting dirty towels when we asked for clean ones.  One appeared to have blood on it.   There were some pros.  All the rooms have LCD HD TVs, which is nice. There is a pool.  It does have a great location in the South Loop area.  And yes, it is very affordable. Also, the late night front desk clerk was awesome.  He was extremely friendly and helpful and had been at this place since the late '80s.  He probably hasn't been rewarded enough if he is still working that shift.   Also, the adjacent restaurant/bar isn't terrible.  It's no classy joint, but the bartenders were talkative, the food was as good as expected and it appeared to have a decent amount of regulars.",N
1245,"The view was great, the room is clean while being in the middle of ""no where"" in Chicago besides the convention that it sit next to.  This hotel deserves 4 stars for the hospitality of their staff and excellent concierge.  The free shuttle to nearby shopping was most welcome since parking in Chicago is a pain!  The $20 internet killed the deal; this is one of the few Hyatt that still charges for this modern day necessity. -- Especially when they catering to business people by their strategic location.",N
1619,"Hotel 71 was a decent hotel.  Rooms were nice and large and we had a great river view.  The hotel was in a great central location as well.  Could have used a few more amenities in the room such as a fridge (since, come on, what are you supposed to do with your leftovers!!).  Also, room service would come in VERY late, which we thought was very odd...we had a DND on the door and had come back to the room at 5pm and left again at 6pm.  when we left, we did not put the DND back on the door since it was so late, well, when we returned late that night, room service had been in...odd they were there so late.  The doorman was very pleasant and so was the staff.  Oh and I do have to say, the beds were not very comfortable, very stiff and the pillows were too big and awkward. And the WiFi, while free, was S-L-O-W!   I probably will not stay here again unless we get an awesome deal or something.",N

3506,"I stayed here with some friends for 4 nights (Fri-Tues) and had an amazing time. Sure, there were some glitches here and there, but nothing too bad that would make me not want to come back. Before we left, we tried to call to confirm our reservations but the phone rang continuously with no answer. Found that weird. We had 2 rooms. I stayed in a ""standard"" room with 2 other girls. We had two full size beds. The rooms were pretty small, but I expected it from all the reviews I read, so it wasn't a big deal for us. Our other 2 friends stayed in a ""petite"" room with one bed and that room was TINY! On our second night, we encountered a rather disturbing issue with our room.  We left a window open to ""air out"" while we were out touring the city. When we came back, we noticed that there were tiny bugs flying on the ceiling. The service guy came to spray the room and suggested we switch rooms due to the smell of bug spray and dead bugs that fell on our sheets and carpet. I called management but the hotel was all sold out. He offered to re-clean our room, change the sheets, etc while we were out for the night and he would comp the room for the night and switch us to a suite the next day. Since that was our only option, and since it was our fault for leaving the window open after a storm, we accepted. What bothered me was when the housekeeping manager called the room, she was so rude and told me that her department was leaving for the night and would not be able to clean our room if we were not out in the next few minutes. I told her that when housekeeping came to our room, I asked if it was ok if we called when we left in about 30 minutes and housekeeping kindly said that it was not a problem. The housekeeping manager rudely said, ""that's not true.""  How is SHE going to tell ME about what was said in a conversation between me and another housekeeper??!!  RUDE. All she had to do was tell me that her department closes in 45 minutes and we need to be out so they can clean the room. Period. We would've been happy to leave to accomodate them. My friends and I gathered our stuff to our other friend's tiny room to finish getting ready so that housekeeping could clean our room. The next day we were upgraded to a really beautiful suite. All in all, the hotel was clean and in a great location. The elevators were somewhat slow but not a big deal. I think the longest we waited was 5 minutes. Majority of the staff was friendly and helpful. Checking in (late) and checking out were quick and easy. Complimentary coffee in the lounge area was delicious. Price was reasonable; we got a great deal online and my other friend got great tips on how to get a cheaper deal when she called to reserve a room for herself and her boyfriend. Come with expectations that this is an older hotel so rooms are generally small.",N
5239,"Had all the basics but don't expect anything amazing.

Best western gets the basic job done",Y
2819,"This is one of two Embassy Suites in downtown. This blocky red brick building contains rooms surrounding a central atrium. Guests enjoy a widespread breakfast buffet that is included in your room rate, plus there is a free cocktail hour in the evening.

5635,"IT'S TRUE..       TWO HEADS ARE BETTER THAN ONE.... Just like people, some Westins are uglier than others. Luckily, this Westin was of the pretty varietal. Smack dab in the middle of Downtown, it was close to everything. As 'Preferred Guests', we were greeted and instantly upgraded to a corner room with a sick view on the 12th floor. We overlooked the Chicago River with the sun beaming into our room.The room had a king Heavenly bed (which can be had for $1695 w/ boxspring..tempting!), chaise by the bow window, these light green leaf soaps, and girly smelling shampoo/conditioner. Artwork with its own artist light dresses the room's walls. A sport bottle of water comes complimentary, as does Starbucks grounds.  An LG 32"" LCD is placed smack middle in front of the bed. The highlight for me? A Speakman DUAL SHOWER HEAD. The cool feature is that not only do you get a greater surface area, but you can turn off one head by pushing a back valve on the left showerhead. There was great water pressure and I never ran out of hot water. Service was friendly and professional. We were even given an umbrella for usage during a rainy day. $49/day for parking is a tad ridiculous though, don'tcha think?

The room they gave us smell like old people, had a tv from the 70s, holes in the ceiling, paint flaking off, and carpet that I wouldn't walk barefoot on!  I requested my money back and had to stay one night.  They upgraded me to another room that at least had a modern tv.  Don't stay here!!!!!",N
283,"When I choose a hotel, I look for value, cleanliness and location. The Seneca Hotel offers all three points.  For the location (a block off Michigan Av), other hotels in the area could not match the price of a room for the week-end I needed for my visiting relatives. The room, however outdated and somewhat dark, was clean and had a small kitchenette. The staff was friendly, the bellman very helpful. There are a few parking garages close by if you do not choose to use the hotel parking overnight (saving some money).",N
4610,"I'm glad I discovered this little gem nestled in the heart of River North. Hands down the location is amazing... and if you're able to land a deal via an app like ""hotel tonight"" or any travelocity-type site you'll be set. I would rate the service 4 or 5 stars, but the rooms are extremely small, contain a nook in the wall that is called a ""closet,"" and extremely shallow sinks and showers in the bathroom. If you're on the hunt for a staycation this would be perfect, just travel light. Your bags will have to be stored in visible sight and the space is TIGHT!! Also, the decor is very nice and I wish I spent time in the lobby and bar. The free wi-fi is an added bonus.",N
629,"Please put in some fans in the bathrooms! Why do most of the hotels I stay in these days forgo the wonder of a fan? Water gets on the ceiling, the mirror is foggy, and well, you know, sometimes you need one for other unmentionables. The rooftop pool was not as awesome as the photos would lead you to believe - not really a surprise, though. Check in and out was easy - also easy to sneak extra people into a room as the lobby is always packed and has folks milling around constantly. Our room was cleaned even though we hung out a ""do not disturb"" sign, which was kind of annoying.... We pricelined the hotel and got a great deal for two nights, so it was worth the money.  The hotel restaurant/bar is actually pretty decent as well! We enjoyed a late night 20% off bottle of wine...yummy wine.",N

I feel like a King. Ridiculously spacious. Chic and modern, but not comfortable, tasteful, and cozy. Love the blue color theme and music prints and photographs. Two TVs? Why not. Full bathroom including a tub with jets? Yes, please. The service - from the valet to the front desk - is fantastic. And the small details: the swanky zebra print bathrobes, the fast and free internet, the extensive in-room dining menu. Within 5 minutes of entertaining the room, the decision was made: not gonna bother leaving the room. It's that nice and comfortable. Next time I'm in Chicago, I'd look here in a heartbeat. (I'm so stoked about not leaving room, I forgot to the mention the fantastic location: near anything you need - restaurants, theater, museums, and parks.) *****, no hesitation.",N
5766,"My family recently came to visit and I wanted to put them in a place that was close and inexpensive.  I walked down to the hotel checked it out and booked 2 rooms about 2 months in advance.  Unfortunately, I had to cancel one of the rooms about 3 weeks in advance of my family's arrival.  When my parents checked in at the hotel the staff was extremely rude to them about canceling the 1 room.  I really didn't appreciate the attitude of the people at the front desk and found them to be rude each encounter I had with both the male and female attendants.  If you are looking for a cheap place to stay, I wouldn't count it out since it was clean and somewhat well kept; however if you are looking for a hotel that will treat you like they actually respect your business, I would look somewhere else.",N

The staff was cold and indifferent and said there was nothing they could do.  We ended up getting a small king room, tucked in a corner and at no discount at that.  Very sad moment for us.",N
343,"This was the worst hotel i have ever stayed it. PERIOD. Coming from Minneapolis to Chicago, my flight was delayed, so I called ahead to make sure they wouldn't give away my room. They said no problem. So I arrive at the hotel around 11:30pm and check it. I reserved a 2 bed room. I get a room with one bed. I call down to the front desk. They have no more 2 bed rooms. Can we have a cot/rollaway? They don't do roll aways. Can you just sleep on the couch. NO, I CANNOT JUST SLEEP ON THE COUCH. I'm paying you $150. Finnally, they decide they can get me a second 1 bed room for my companion... ok fine. Second room is the size of a closet and smells like cigarettes (despite the fact the entire hotel is ""non smoking"" ).  Not only that, but the window is painted shut, so I cannot get any real fresh air. I turn on the air conditioner full blast and it lasts about 3 minutes and then just turns off. I try to turn on a lamp at this point but nothing happens. The alarm clock is also dead. THE AC TRIPPED THE CIRCUIT BREAKER. WTF. Not only that, but the vent in the bathroom looked like someone punched a whole in the wall and then tried to put a grate over it. The next day around 9am I try to go complain to the manager. ""He isn't in today."" Huh? Not in today? What do you mean. He's the fricken manager. Needless to say I checked out early. Horrible experience. Maybe the worst ever.",N
1453,"Oh, Omni, I expected more from you.  I stayed here for 5 nights and was satisfied with most of what I saw, but not wowed.  The bed was one of the more comfortable beds I've ever had the pleasure of sleeping on in a hotel.  What staff I interacted with were very polite and friendly.  Plenty of channels on the TV.  Valets were prompt and helpful, but parking was a little more expensive ($49/day) than most of the other hotels I researched in planning this trip.  Location is great, close to plenty of shops and restaurants as well as an El stop (red line).  And they take the government rate, which is always a plus in my book. However.  Two major problems: 1) Internet service is a must in any hotel nicer than a pay-by-the-hour motel.  Omni has wi-fi, and it's free if you join their free loyalty program.  If you don't join the program, you can pay, and that's fine.  However, about half the time I was at the Omni I couldn't connect.  I called their internet service line, and the guy told me that their servers were full and to ""keep trying.""  I usually had to ""keep trying"" until the next day.  To effectively not have internet available is not acceptable, especially in a hotel that gets so many business travelers. 2) Weird smell in the bathroom accompanied by a toilet that wouldn't completely flush.  I'll spare you the details, but somehow there were always, uh, ""leftovers,"" no matter what I was flushing.  As for the smell, it was not overpowering but kind of reminded me of the poor plumbing you find in Europe. The internet thing bars me from staying here again if I ever come back to Chicago for business.  If I ever come back to Chicago not for business I will probably not stay here either, knowing that there are better, cheaper hotels in the area.",N
3842,"So I got pretty lucky and won a Time Out weekly prize - I got a free night at the Dana, and a free ""couple's spa package"" for my boyfriend and myself! The concierge was extremely friendly and accommodating.  For some reason, when I had selected my room type, I had chosen a room with two double beds even though I was staying with my boyfriend.  it was a lapse in judgment.  Fortunately, the woman at the desk noticed and was like ""Why would a couple have a room with two double beds?"" and updated us to a corner king room!  She really was interested in making our stay the best it could be, and that did not go unnoticed. I thought the room was beautiful.  The bed was cozy and overflowing with pillows.  Two walls were made entirely of windows, but the shades that pull down are very effective at blocking early-morning sunshine.  It was nice to have a view down State Street.  I don't think the people on the ground can see us up on the 6th floor, but I felt a bit weird changing my clothes in full, broad daylight next to a window, but nobody seemed to look up.  Hopefully! The bathroom was pretty awesome as well - the one downside was the sliding door.  Lots of boutique hotels seem to have these, and I hate them.  they don't block sound, and you just feel like whoever you're sharing the room with can hear all your business.  Uncool.  Also our sliding door had some trouble staying shut, which made it even worse....  BUT I loved the shower!  It was like being in a rain forest!  Once we figured out how to work out, it was divine - one of the shower heads is directly overhead so it pours down on you like rain, and the other has a detachable head and strong water pressure.  There was no shower curtain or door, which was kinda weird, but also kind of hot.  It gives you a direct view of yourself (and your shower buddy, if you have one) in the mirror, so shy people may feel a bit awkward.  I loved it.  It was very luxurious. The one weird thing about the room was that the ceiling and one pillar looked sort of....unfinished.  They were just that gray stone/cement color, with what looked like water spots and paint splatters.  It looked like somebody forgot to finish painting the room.  If it was meant to be part of the aesthetic, it was lost on me.  However, when we turned the lights off, the light coming from the street peeked through the cracks in the window shades, and made this amazing light pattern on the ceiling.  I can't tell if it was intentional or not, but it was pretty lovely.  There were lots of other nice things about the room - the huge mirror, the modern coffeemaker, and the general decor were all nice touches. Morning room service was prompt - the price is what you'd expect, but the food was surprisingly tasty.  For some reason, the room service menu in our room was apparently ""outdated,"" so the items we ordered were no longer on the breakfast menu.  Still, the guy on the phone told us to describe the items and the kitchen would be happy to make them anyway.  I dig that. We also spent several hours at the spa getting our couple's package!  Massages were first, and they were great.  The couples massage entailed my boyfriend and I lying in separate beds while two women worked on us.  The room was dim, and there were candles and soft music.  The women were professional and talented - I'd recommend it to anybody who doesn't mind letting another woman put her hands on their man.  Ha.  Facials were next - I'd only had one before in my life, so I don't have much to judge it against.  It felt good - the bed was heated and the woman explained everything to me as she went along.  She gave me some advice on how to better care for my skin - and I know I don't do much for it, so I needed the help. She did some extractions using her hands, which surprised me, but I didn't mind.  As long as it works!  My skin did feel soft and glowing afterwards, maybe now I'll start taking better care of it to keep it that way.  The mani/pedi was next.  I loved the woman who did it - her name was Joyce - but the setting was odd.  She didn't really have her own room - just a little back area in a corridor behind the spa desk.  It was a little cramped, and it wasn't really a room, so we could hear all the chatter up at the spa desk the whole time.  The nail polish selection was good colorwise, but I think it was cheap polish - I prefer something like OPI for this kind of thing.  Regardless, Joyce was lovely and totally hilarious.  She moved back and forth between my boyfriend and I, and we really enjoyed her personality.  I have certainly had more luxurious mani/pedis in my life, but she still did a very nice job.  I think she could've done more with sloughing off dry skin - this was my first pedi since winter ended and I wanted some more intensive work!  The other nice thing was the ""relaxation room"" they put us in between treatments.  It's dim and quiet, with ice water to drink and lots of soft chairs and daybeds to lounge on.",N
2938,"Wow, for $250 a night (conference rate, thank you) I would expect so much more. This place is old. Period. And it feels it's age around every corner outside of the lobby. My first room had a lovely view of the gravel convention center roof and within the first 15 minutes of my being there a maintenance worker walked by my window and looked in. I'm out of there. My next room had a gorgeous view of the Chicago River and Trump Tower from the 26th floor. Unfortunately it had a bathroom light that never turned on despite calling maintenance 3 times to fix it. It also featured a bare metal ""spoke"" where the knob for the heat/air should have been and cracked plastic surrounding that. Nice touch. To top it off, the ""wifi"" was $12.95 per 24-hour period and in my 72 hours there I was charged 6 times. Not to mention that the wifi didn't work anywhere in the 2 floors of conference areas or in the lobby so basically the only place wifi was available was in my room. Thanks. Perhaps I should also mention that I paided $27 for a breakfast (not room service) in the hotel restaurant that consisted of orange juice (no refill) and eggs benedict. Yes, I know this is downtown Chicago but please...",N
3915,"This review refers to the Congress Lounge hotel bar. Our bartender was visibly sloshed. Flies were circling the bar. We asked for B-52s. He didn't know how to make them, so I explained it to him (I'm a former bartender). HE CHARGED US $14 PER DRINK. THe justification was there was three kinds of liqueur in it. EXCUSE ME? I can get a top shelf cocktail mixed by an expert at the Violet Hour for $11, and this incompetent douchewad charges us $14 for a drink he didn't even know how to make. If this wasn't bad enough, filthy glasses and empty bottles littered almost every table in the bar. It's nothing short of a miracle that they have customers in here. I don't normally go out of my way to give scathing reviews but I highly suggest you save your money and avoid this dump at any cost.",N
2134,"Is it possible to give a zero star? After emailing Priority Club about the issues I had during my stay, I got a bunch of automated messages saying how they care. I asked them one simple question, but they kept repeating the same automated answer. It is frustrating that they don't care enough about their guests to even take the time to read their complaint email. Save yourself and stay some place else. I have NEVER said anything like this to ANY other businesses, but the experience I had was just god-awful. Worst Hotel Experience ever, and this is supposed to be a 4-star hotel. There are many world-class hotels in Chicago. Why would you settle for something this bad? Don't just read this review. Go do some research and read other reviews on tripadvisor. You will see comments about how god-awful the service is and how small the rooms are.",N
807,"expensive. pretty. fun. the bed is amazing. the rooms are nice. but the shower and toilet sucked big time. the front desk is slow at picking up and not very polite. they need to do something about this. anyways, i love it that the 11th floor has a bowl full of apples everyday in the hallway for people to enjoy.",N
4667,"Got a deal on Hautelook for this hotel for my best friend and I who were having a girls weekend in Chicago.  The hotel is cute and the location is great if you want to be near Michigan Ave.  Rooms are on the small side, like other reviewers have said, but they were still fine, not like oh my god I'm staying in a closet. The staff wasn't too attentive to problems: we mentioned twice that the phone in our room didn't work (we had wanted to buzz down for late check out and wake up calls) and nobody ever did anything about it, even though they said they would.  Things we didn't mention that still didn't work were the ipod dock, and the AC system woke me up numerous times throughout the night.  That sucker was LOUD.  Would I pay full price to stay here again?  No, but for the deal I got, it was more than adequate.",N
2961,"Terrible, just terrible... just came back from a conference there.. and it was literally two days of hell.. I mean bad enough i had to be in a meeting for 2 days, after the meetings i have to come back to my nasty little room. Well let me back up for a moment here and give you a little background. I registered for a Deluxe ..something room at $160+ a night.. when i checked in they didn't have any of those available so i got a little room. Since i didn't have a lot of choice and was hard-pressed for time i though well how bad can a little room be? and i took it.. thinking they will adjust prices accordingly. Well it turned out that by ""basic"" room they really do mean basic. When i finally got up to the room there was numerous issues with the room one of which was that the refrigerator was open and stuff missing from it and it made some awful noise. I asked them to take care of it and they did not so i had to deal with them taking off all the charges from my account for all the boose that i didnt' drink... then lights were not working in the bathroom and stuff like that... I would love to go on for more but i dont have much time. So in short don't stay here!!! I made this mistake once and i will not do it again. Stay in Westin across the street or something.. this place is bad!!!! !!!!",N
1409,"Pros: -Reasonably priced nightly rates -Modern, clean furnishings -Spacious rooms (at least our's was!) Cons: -$53/day + tip to park!! (tip: Drake Parking Garage across the street is $35/day, or there's a self-park garage a block past the hotel at 200 E. Walton that's $29/day) -Internet isn't complimentary ($10/day!! In this day and age where all hotels offer free WiFi, this just seems absurd!) -Horrible rain head in shower made it impossible to get soap out of thick hair! -Unfriendly front desk staff seemed like we were inconveniencing them to check in or ask a question Bottom line: Hotel is nice enough, but the 'hidden fees,' coupled with moody service, make it way overpriced for what you get.",N
509,"The rooms were okay. Honestly, the bedrooms were probably smaller than the living room area. It wasn't the nicest hotel I've stayed at, but it definitely wasn't bad. I like that this place has a free breakfast buffet, free drinks at the bar from 5:30p-7p, and location.",N
2750,"I stayed at The James for 4 nights - 2 nights work and 2 nights play! This was the perfect place to stay. The first night I went to the bar for a bite and a drink. The bartender was very friendly and even made me a concotion based on my likings. I got the Kobe Corndogs which were very good. You can tell that they use quality ingredients. The next morning I realized that I needed to make colored copies on my way since I had to make some changes to my presentation. Of course I am running late too, so the manager helped me out and printed out everything I needed. He went the extra mile and was really nice and quick. During our stay, we also happened to wander into J Bar on Friday and Saturday night. This lounge was small, but a perfect size for the amount of people they accomodate on a normal day. The drinks were a bit pricey but stout - so well worth it. And the music was ideal for a lounge - all the latest hits. We also ordered in breakfast one morning. The entree was huge, filling, and tasty - quality ingredients once again. Room service usually lets me down, but not  at The James! The rooms were always clean. My boyfriend and I were a mess and the maid always seemed to be able to put things away where they belonged. My sister, who was staying next door thinks she cleaned up too much and that it was weird. But being there for 4 days... I appreciated it! The beds were comfortable, mini bar well stocked, and Kiehl's products!!! Turn down service every night with little mini cookies. The only downfall about this place is the street noise, but the hotel isn't to blame. I give them 5 stars for a perfect hotel experience 4 days in a row.",N
2901,"I stayed here with my Husband while he was attending a conference. The hotel is quite large and rightfully has plenty of quick elevators and a few escalators. There are a few bars, one of which has a great view and is decorated with a subdued elegance.  The other is quite funky and boasts bright colors and a more retro vibe. The rooms are large and the bed was super comfortable. The location is great, off the beaten path enough to be quiet but right next to the ""Magnificent Mile"" and the Pier. We had an issue with a phantom phone that, for no reason that I can find, turned itself on to speaker mode and blasted the dial tone in the middle of the night.  Three times.  The manager stared at me blankly and apologized.  Um, care to offer us another phone or perhaps send up a repair man? The gym fee is not included in the price of your hotel stay, which is a pretty big turn off for us.  Luckily, the weather was nice enough for a run outdoors and that run was much more enjoyable and memorable than a hotel treadmill could ever be.  So if you keep up with your workouts while on the road, consider the additional gym fee. Overall, the hotel is in great shape and I can deal with a freaky phone but the gym fee is downright nasty.",N
3010,What a beautiful hotel! Check in was fast and simple. The room was clean and the decor was pretty. Our room had a view of the Navy Pier which was cool. I'd for sure stay here again.,N
118,"Rooms were decent but abit small.  Nice complimentary hot breakfast, free wifi, and coffee available throughout the day.  Self parking was $32 and no re-entry, which was inconvenient.  The other option is valet for $40.",N
136,"Famous stars such as John Travolta, Katharine Hepburn, and a few select others (which they pride themselves on serving once or twice; the full list can be found outside the building and inside near the check-in station) have chosen this hotel to stay at, and I get it. It's quaint, it's timely--it looks right out of what 1970's luxury class hotel should look like. We stayed on the 16th floor and had a nice view of a construction site, the Hancock building, and the American Girl doll shop. But for some reason, I can't get too into this place. I'm not sure if it's the fact that it lacked a decent screen on the 16th floor windows, paying $10/day for internet access (when I've had it free at plenty of others), the creepily trembling elevators, or that the staff were rude, but I just can't give this place five stars. However, despite those short comings, it was incredibly clean, the hotel is in a safe part of town, the beds are comfortable, and the drinks at the downstairs bar were fantastic. There are certainly good things to this place, and the $150/night (when it could probably and easily be much more in this town) wasn't bad either. The one thing I would like to know is, why were there three phones in our room? And one in the bathroom, nonetheless?",N
3191,"Tried to get away for a night with the wife for a nice relaxing night away from things on a ""stay-cation"".  Not so much.  This place is like a club.  Loud techno music, we could hear the bar patrons until 2 am.  The lobby is packed with coked up clubers.  The double door that leads into the room next to us had no sound proofing so we heard the guy in the room next to us screaming on the phone at 8 in the morning.  Then, house keeping woke us up at 9:15 wanting to clean our room.  When we complained to the front desk upon check out, the reply was ""sorry, thats how we are.""  Not to mention...the heated pool was freezing.  Very disappointed on our wasted night at this place.",N
2152,"The best characteristic about this hotel is it's location.  It also has beautiful classic architecture, and the hotel lobby is lovely.  It's funny... I can always distinguish Kimpton hotels from the decor.  Very eclectic and modern, but still has that institutional feel to it.  I think it's a good value for the money, and wold recommend it to visiting friends and tourists.   The bathroom was pretty decent in size... I'm all about nice bathrooms!",N
5836,"This boutique hotel has a very personal approach to your stay here. The bellman, Perry, was so helpful and asked questions not just to ask them, but he truly carried on a conversation about where I was from, how my flight was,and took such great care fo make me feel welcome. I love the staff because they have such a warm, friendly approach, not stiff and uptight. The apartment I rented across from Talbot had such a horrible dirty place when I showed up, and came back to Talbott after discovering my apartment had mold( yes, 25 E. Delaware) and the stove in kitchen leaked gas. I had no help from my apartment people at the condition of my apartment. When i came back to Talbott to stay, they came across the street to this place I was staying and brought my bags over, put me in the same room I had before I went to the apartment from hell, and were so kind and understanding. I ate dinner in the bar that evening,and George gave very excellent service,and this hotel feels like home... I have stayed many other places..five star hotels,and there was always some crotchety person that made it not so great. But Talbott...with their huge bath towels,turn down service, timely room service, excellent concuerge, fabulous front desk girls make this Chicago hotel my number one choice, hands down!! Love it.,,love it...will be back very soon.",Y
3593,"************* REVIEW 156 **************** I've been staying here a few times & the service has always been wonderful, especially the door men, always notice how many outfits I change in a day & compliments my shoes! Got to love that! What can I say about this hotel - the REAL CHICAGO - that hasn't been written before? This historical landmark hotel was the home of many royals, celebs, & in the known people from the Queen to princess Dianna, from many of our former presidents to celebs. So if it was good for them, it's plenty good for small people like me. What I love about this hotel was the perfect location, a few steps to the beach, a short walk to the Oak Street shops, & to the Magnificent Mile. Plenty of restaurants inside the hotel, especially the afternoon high tea,  offer plenty of sandwiches, scones, breads, and desserts. Did I mention the insanely gorgeous Chanel Boutique that I drool each time I stay here. Not to forget the beautiful flowers shop with the cutest dog ever looks just like my late dog. & how can I forget the crystal chandeliers & fresh flowers through out the hotels, simply classic elegant real Chicago landmark. P.S. I also earn points with Hilton Honors too!",N
3147,"While I have not spent the night here, I have had a few glasses of wine here and the service was excellent and the bar is very comfy.  Bit pricey but you cant complain on that when you are downtown off LSD!",N
4368,"If you're looking to spend a lot of time in your room, you probably won't like the Palmer House. The rooms are fairly small, though certainly clean and well appointed. I stayed in a single room -- which is to say it had one double bed -- and it probably wasn't much bigger than your bedroom at home. Depends on your home, of course. And it's hard to judge, since in addition to the bed, there was a desk with a chair, a no-longer-in-service minibar, a side table, and an armoire with a TV. More furniture than would fit in my bedroom. But I digress. I've seen single rooms with king sized beds that were larger than this, and the double rooms are quite a bit larger. But if you're staying in downtown Chicago, what are you doing staying in your room? So what if it's small -- it's within walking distance of everything. Get out! Also, the Palmer House has an honest to goodness lobby, where you can sit and relax and have a drink and even eat, depending on the time of day. And it's a huge and beautiful lobby. So if your room is small, but you don't want to leave the hotel, and you aren't completely afraid of other people, hang out in the lobby. The Palmer House was built at a time when people socialized. They enjoyed it, even! Socialize. The registration area is surprisingly tiny, and the hotel is undergoing renovations, so only one entrance is available (on Monroe) and some areas are blocked off. The hotel is a destination spot for proms and business meetings/conventions/seminars, so be prepared for some congestion. And elevators are slow. But these are minor quibbles in a grand old hotel. Don't expect the latest Vegas luxury resort, and you'll be fine. An historical side note: the chef at the Palmer House invented the brownie, more than 100 years ago. The Palmer House still sells their signature brownies. At 10 bucks a pop. I passed.",N
545,"My (new to me) SUV, 2008 Iron Man Explorer now has a crappy crack and the cover of my hitch is pulled away from the bumper. I'm disappointed, the response from management was to be expected - they will not be responsible. I drove away this morning since I left at 6.30am, and just looked at it when I arrived home in Michigan. I absolutely know that my vehicle was only parked in the garage at the Hampton Inn during my stay. The rest of my visit, someone was in the truck at all times. Right before I left home to visit Chicago, I worked with the hitch for the trailer I am about to purchase to ensure I saw how everything should be connected. At that time, (two days earlier) there were no scratches, no cracks and the bumper was flush with the hitch cover. I paid $42 per day for parking and the care of my vehicle was crap. Do not park at this hotel. Additionally, my room was noisy (I heard every conversation down the hall at all times) although the hotel staff was mostly pleasant. Altogether this was an extremely disappointing visit.  Park across the street if you stay here.  I lived in Chi Town for 2 years so I'm used to the fire engines/ambulances everywhere but cannot stomach the horrible care of my vehicle.",N

515,"We stayed here last weekend. Loved it. Great rooms for groups. When you enter the room there is living room area with a couch, chair, and table with two or three more chairs. Across from the bathroom was a kitchenette with sink, microwave, coffee maker, and mini fridge. Bedroom was a good size with two beds, sink, and mirror. The alarm clock comes with a plug to hook up your ipod. The beds are really comfortable, I slept like a rock. Our room was on the 12th floor and the view was amazing. It is also worth mentioning the elevators are made of glass so the view from them is pretty good too. We did not have any of the made to order breakfast so I can't comment, but the other stuff was well put out and no lines. We do the managers reception (did see long lines) either. The lobby was crazy Sunday morning, mostly because people were checking out, long waits for the busy elevators. Pj Clarks is just off the lobby, great for drinks and late night eats. There is also a pretty cool bowling alley and sports bar, and an AMC movie theater right next door.",N
4975,"Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible.  If you only read one part of my post, read this:  DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL.I stayed at the Allerton for a few nights over new years as a getaway with my fiancé, who was very ill at the time.  The opportunity to get away was much needed for the both of us.  We decided to book the Allerton because it seemed like a nice hotel, and more importantly, it was smoke free (as my fiancé could not be around ANY smoke).When we arrived at the hotel, the room was very nice, a little small, but that's OK.  It has a nice location.  Checking in was easy and I have no complaints about the service we received up until the final night we were there.  The last night we were getting ready to sleep; when cigarette smoke starting billowing out of the bathroom vent (which I presume was from the guest next door).  We immediately telephoned the front desk to have our room moved.This is when THE MESS that is The Allerton Hotel began...Moving our room was quite a process.  The front desk said that I needed to go down to the lobby in order to get the new keys for the new room.  I went down to get the new keys and the attendant did not even offer an apology, even though I made it abundantly clear how much of a big deal--A HEALTH ISSUE--it was that there was smoking in the room.  We also received no help with taking our baggage from our old room, to the new room.As if that was not frustrating enough...the story continues...The next day, after needing to switch rooms, and trying to sleep after my fiancé felt awful from being around the cigarette smoke, I once again went to the front desk upon checkout to let them know how thoroughly disappointed I was in the situation.  The front desk attendant was mildly helpful and apologized and offered to refund me about $100.  I thought that this was the LEAST that they could do considering the situation.About a week goes by and I hear nothing from the hotel, and no refund is granted on my credit card.  I called The Allerton and once again they reassured me that the refund would be coming and that they just needed to let ""accounting"" know.Fast forward two months...Still nothing from the hotel and at this point I have spoken to:The front desk attendant the night of the incidentThe front desk attendant the morning of the checkoutSomeone in accountingTwo different managersThis began the process of calling the Allerton and having them call me back, apologizing of the inconvenience about not giving me my refund.  I even wrote a letter to the hotel, which they received and called me once they read it.  Again, a refund was promised, but never given.It is now August 2010 (MORE THAN TWO YEARS AFTER THIS HAPPENED)...and still...NO REFUND.I will never, never, never, never, never, never stay this hotel...I suggest that you do not either.",Y
3755,"The only thing missing is a pool. There was a roof top with a cheezy bar that was sparsely populated. OK, that's the bad part. Amazing room design.

The staff was very attentive and helpful. We did not even bother with a car the whole time as it was not needed.",N
5369,"I booked the Hilton Garden Inn online prior to my first-ever trip to Chicago.  I wasn't really sure what I would get.  I'll break it down on what I liked and what I disliked.Likes:  Great location!  Walking distance to the subway, loads of shopping, dining and bars.  Very comfy beds with an adjustment switch for softer or firmer.  Spacious rooms.  Nice price.  Super friendly valets and bellman.  Text to valet service.  Soda machines on every floor.  Excellent city views.Dislikes:  Awful construction immediately outside the hotel.  Rude concierges.  Pricey ""Pavillion Pantry.""  Outrageous parking costs.  $39 a day for self-park or $45 a day for valet.  The rental car was almost not even worth it.  No free shuttle services.I loved the valets.  If you text down to them 5 minutes before leaving, more often than not your car was there waiting for you.  Also, they didn't creepily stand around begging for a tip.  Spending $45 a day for valet PLUS tipping EACH time would have just been too much.  I tipped the final day.  If you needed a cab, the bellman would hail it for you.If I came back, I would probably stay at the Hilton Garden Inn again; however, I think I was expecting just a ""little bit more"" because it had the name Hilton.",Y
4742,Not a place i would be staying again .. when i come back to visit chicago.. Employees seem to be miserable and hate there jobs .. rooms the size of a closet room service doesnt meet standards for the price .. ammenties are good.. valet parking 45 a night but can park in the garage down the block for 25 a night  .. also found ants in the drawers under the bed.. so had to be moved ..,Y

Yes it was old. Yes the room was dated. But everything was clean, we had a decent view and the staff we encountered were all friendly. This is not a 5 star hotel and you don't pay for a 5 star hotel so don't expect that. If you expect a clean room, good service and a great location I don't think you'll be disappointed.",Y

The room looked a little worn and tired, though the bed was comfortable.  Beware - simply opening one of the food drawers and closing it triggered a charge that we had to have taken off at the end of the visit.  The day concierge was friendly and helpful when we were looking for breakfast.  The night concierge was a different guy and, truthfully, was sort of stuck up when we asked if he'd heard of a specific burger joint (Moe's).",N

I am not a Hilton fan and this hotel was definitely a breath of fresh air. Will definitely stay here again on next visit if i get the same deal again,N
4793,"This review is solely for the rooftop bar, not the hotel. So I finally made it out to this bar. I feel like I've heard so much hype about the place, maybe I had too high of an expectation. But when I finally went this weekend, I was pretty disappointed. 1) The crowd was mixed in terms of race and age, which I like. But the quality of the crowd was not so good in terms of looks. And I'm not trying to sound snobby or anything like that. Maybe it was just an off night, but it was a Saturday night, so I was hoping it was poppin' with some beautiful people. If you truly want to see some good looking people, go check out Y-Bar or Enclave. 2) So there was a good sized line, but we greased the bouncer some money to get in for our party (9 people: 5 girls, 4 guys). One of the bouncers flat out lied to our face saying there's cover so we need to pay him more. But when we asked the other bouncer, he was perplexed saying there is no cover for entrance. Oh, so I guess that's one of the positives. There's no cover. 3) When we finally got into the bar, we didn't feel it was that crowded. At least the line outside should have been moving a lot faster, but I guess that's how all bars/clubs work, trying to look like they're super busy. So I won't knock any points for that. 4) The outdoor bar section was pretty sharp. The flat screen tvs, and the fire pits, and the chic decor made it feel like I was in that Barcardi mojito commercial. The view was good, but not fantastic.  5) Nothing much to say about the drinks or prices. It was as expected. So overall, it was just OK. Definitely over-hyped from what I've heard. It doesn't compare to Pure in Vegas or even some of the rooftop bars in NYC.",Y
2153,"For what we paid, I'm a fan (MAJOR haircut with P----line). Tiny room (again, see above and also an older property), but very nice - the couch against the windows (which open!) was a neat touch.  Great view of the lake that really made it special. Down side(s): the light blocking shades...didn't. Bed was a little uncomfortable. Internet situation just irks me; if I didn't have my handy dandy aircard, I'd be torqued. Food was okay though it was a United Nations-esque exercise to explain what ""Please send me hot chocolate with Kahlua"" meant. Positives: front staff trained well; they were a pleasure. Massive Starbucks in the lobby - a good launching pad. Location, location, location - we were right in the middle of everything. Neat building.",N

2174,"The hotel has an amazing location, right on the Magnificent Mile and within walking distance to lots of shopping, restaurants, bars, and entertainment.  However, I was expecting something a little more.  Our room wasn't ready when my colleague showed up at 9pm.  They did give us coupons for drinks at the bar and for breakfast but really? The room wasn't ready at 9pm?  The remote control didn't work, one of the bedside lights didn't work and there wasn't a lot of lighting to begin with.  I suspect that the rooms in the older hotel tower are much larger and nicer.     The hotel bar was great for drinks and for people-watching.  If you do have breakfast at Zest, order off the menu and avoid the $27 breakfast buffet, it's not worth it.  Other than that, the hotel is stunning to look at and it has about the fastest elevator that I have ever been in.  However, I think if I am ever in Chicago again I will try staying somewhere else.",N
4346,"Oh my God.  This place is SWANK.  And not trashy swank like Vegas, but I'm-from-old-money-so-suck-my-balls swank.  And that's definitely a good thing.  We felt like such hobos with our non-designer suitcases and 3 duffel bags full of beer.  I mean, valet parking alone was $60.  They mean business! I don't know how she did it, but one of my fellow bridesmaids got us a room for $95 a night.  Holy bajeezus, man.  Nothing skews your sense of power more than a high class hotel room for that little money.  I wanted to freak out and just start breaking things, rock star style. ANYWAY.  My only gripe with the room is that there's no mini fridge.  Wtf?  How's a girl supposed to keep her liquor chilled?  We made do with a bathtub full of ice.  Incidentally, we also couldn't get the drain to stay plugged, so I guess fun sexy bath time is a no-no.  On the plus side, the closet is huge.  So big, in fact, that we made our guy friend sleep in there.  He loved it, haha.",N
5287,"The room I stayed in was extremely tidy, yet cozy. It had all the common items/appliances you would see in a hotel room -- hair dryer, TV, towels, small refrigerator. It was nice, nothing over the top. It was just a well kept room with a bed.The staff was very approachable. I would stay there again.",Y
5713,"If you want a clean, well-located, efficient hotel with all the essentials of modern life (i.e. complementary wireless, printing and fitness center), this is your place. I don't care about the small size of the rooms, as long as they are affordable. The liberty office chairs are very comfortable. Two suggestions: Everything that I needed was in the room except a cork opener. The hotel should provide a better body wash. The soap leaves your skin very dry.",N
4415,"The Palmer House was my go-to hotel in Chicago for several years. I'm not so hot about it anymore. Here are the goods and bads: THE GOOD: Great location in the loop. 1-2 blocks from all El lines. Walk to clients, restaurants, theaters, museums, etc. Old school decor and charm with a beautiful lobby. Many rooms are reasonably large (though if you scrounge for the cheapest rate it's on one of the tiny ones). Good prices at times. Stayed 3 nights around New Year's Eve for about 300 all-in. THE BAD: ""Old school decor"" also means poor room lighting and tiny bathrooms. Deteriorating service for Hilton HHonors members. Staff takes an attitude of, ""We've provided the minimum guaranteed benefits, and that's all you're going to get."" It's a shame because they used to go the extra mile.  Prices are often high (200+/night) at which point there are usually better values elsewhere downtown.",N
5047,"Unfortunately I was quite disappointed from the first impression...front desk didn't have our reservation (even though I proved it with an email), weren't friendly to help and seemed it was inconvenient for them.  For the price paid...there are definitely better and I won't be returning.",Y
701,"Excellent choice of hotel in Chicago with courteous staff, spacious rooms, great location, and free wifi and business center (as it should be!) I lived in Chicago for four years and was thrilled with the location.  It is just north of the river - 10 minute walk to Navy Pier, Mag Mile Shopping, and most importantly Gino's East, Frontera, Giordanos, and other great dining spots.  It is walkable down to Millennium Park/ Art Institute  but allow for a good 20 - 30 minutes. The staff was courteous but not in a robotic manner.  Very approachable and if they didn't know the answer, they were happy to look it up.  They also demonstrated empathy.  Came in on a red eye on a very busy weekend (35K people in Chicago for a conference) and they gave us a room right away at 7am without any fuss.   The rooms were standard for any hotel chain - comfy beds, good tv channel selection, etc.  We were fortunate and got a top floor room overlooking the lake and skyscrapers.  If there was one thing I would have liked, it would have been complimentary bottle water to take on the road or to make coffee with in the morning - only because Chicago tap water has a slightly chlorinated taste to it.  Also, the bottles of conditioner and shampoo were on the smaller side - enough for me but my wife needed more. I LOVED the fact they didn't charge for WiFi nor for use of the business center to print boarding tickets, maps, etc. On another occasion, I ate at Viand and it isn't bad - seems to be a popular function spot.  (At the same time though, there are plenty of other great restaurants within close walking distance).   In summary, the courtyard has the best of all worlds: good location, free useful amenities, approachable staff, AND one can actually earn points for a stay.",N
2518,"Amazing views, staff, and location.",N
4460,"Three stars for the pretty architecture, lobby and nice staff. However....I must have stayed in one of the rooms that was waiting to be remodeled...I had no wi-fi, the room was tiny and ugly as hell... While room service was fast, the food was not good and WAY overpriced. And I'm pretty sure the sheets here gave me an itchy rash because one suddenly popped up on me and gradually went away after I left. I hope next time my company makes me stay here, I get a better experience.",N
1999,"Love. love, LOVE this hotel!  Attentive staff, beautiful decor, incredibly comfortable beds.  All at a very affordable price, especially for this area of the city.  The room was beautiful (we had the Mansion Room with the dark wood), shower pressure, which usually stinks at most hotels, was fantastic. I look forward to returning very soon!",N
2952,"My mom stayed here when she was in town to visit.  I have no idea whether she liked it or not, but when I met her there they had some delicious cookies in the lobby/lounge.  I mean... good god, they were great.  The 5 stars are based purely on how much I enjoyed that shit.",N
3688,"It's the Drake, and it is as good as it's reputation.  The service was excellent and it was very clean.  I agree with some of the other comments that it does need a little updating, and of course as an older hotel the bathrooms are small.  But if you have the opportunity to stay at this famous property you should.",N
3438,"Normally I stay at the Westin on Michigan Ave. when in town, but I could not resist trying the Allerton, just a couple blocks away, when I secured a $75/night rate.  Yes you read that right- I kid you not.  I just had to see if this was too good to be true. Double bed, yes, and room cozy but not too small.  Bathroom much larger than expected with nice variegated tile.  Wireless internet in room $10 for a ""lite"" option that provides quite speedy service, though not hardy enough to stream Netflix.  You can upgrade for $5 or $10 additional. Even if you get the fastest option, the total bill for this location ($75 room + $10 internet + $11 tax = $94) on Michigan Avenue is quite a bargain in my book. Solid wood bedroom door to the hallway still permitted me to hear conversations as people walked by, but I was close to the elevator and for the most part my stay was very quiet until my second night's neighbors arrived.  I could hear a decent amount of conversing through the shared wall. Elevators are numerous and very fast.  Five blocks from the Chicago/State stop on the blue line, so you are merely a 45 minute, $2.50 train ride from O'Hare. Exercise room is huge and adequate. Very nice pre-cor elliptical machines and several treadmills-- all equipped with personal TVs.  No pool, but for less than $100 a night, Westin Workout, eat your heart out! I really felt like I was getting away with something every time I strolled out into Michigan Avenue.  I found the staff very pleasant.  I was very pleasantly surprised and glad I took this chance, and would happily stay here again.  Obviously not a luxury hotel, but it not a budget hotel either.  It is more than adequate.  The value combined with the facilities easily affords a 3 out of 5 recommendation and I'm inclined to give it 4.",N
4532,"The lobby is absolutely gorgeous and the remodeled rooms are decorated nicely but... rooms are also teeny-tiny and kinda oddly laid out (we had two front doors on a really small room - I can't imagine it used to be 2 micro rooms but maybe so?).  What really ruined it for me was the paper thin walls, or maybe the other guests were just REALLY loud the weekend we stayed there? I could barely sleep thanks to all of the noise from other rooms, the hall, oh and the el rumbling below our window.",N
1306,"I had my engagement party here and the staff was nothing short of amazing. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended if you are thinking about having an event. The restaurant here is now closed and used as event space. It is SO grand. Wood paneling, chandeliers everywhere, and  does not feel banquety at all. The food was incredible, everyone said it was the best they'd had at a party at a hotel. They also gave us a really great rate for all of our out of town guests which is unusual for pretty much any hotel where you are just having an event and not using a huge block of rooms. We hired the Bandoleros who are also great for parties, they sound a lot like the Gypsy Kings. All in all it was a spectacular event and wouldn't have been quite so fabulous without the help of the magical team of the RCH.",N
3862,"Just got back from a weekend at the Dana. The place was firing on all cylinders and didn't miss a beat. Early check in, check. Late check out, check. A doorman, TJ who was on top of everything and didn't hesitate to give me the perfect recommendation. The Dana was great. Room size was perfect, bathroom perfect - okay a door in the shower would be nice but that doesn't seem to be the current fashion. Mini bar reasonably priced but there is a Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and Walgreens within two blocks. Free wired and wireless high speed internet. Great locations, everything is close by. Perfect is all I can say - but you still aren't getting 5 stars. :D",N
2593,"You know when you get ready to go out and you catch your reflection in the mirror and say ""damn, i'm hot tonight""? Don't waste that night on any place other than Victor Hotel. It's perfect. Its big and small. Its bright and intimate. It's sexy and industrial. I've no idea how they did it. But they made opposites fuse and the amalgamation is hot. (not to mention the crowd)",N
3635,"High Tea at the Drake is quite an experience.  Certainly the most expensive tea and finger sandwiches you'll ever eat, but you pay for the experience.  It is sort of like playing pretend.   It is way better during the Christmas season, but I'd make reservations in advance if that is your plan.  The hotel is always decorated well and feels festive.  This is a nice place for a group of girlfriends and could be a neat yearly tradition to start.  You don't need to go more than once a year but I'd try it for fun.",N
5757,"I was hesitant to go with the three star vote because frankly, there isn't much to get excited about but Heart O' Chicago Motel fills a niche as a budget friendly motel in the city of Chicago - something there is a huge shortage of. Our experience was positive overall.  Here were the pros and cons. PROS Relatively inexpensive when compared to city hotel prices.  Our room that had two double beds was $92 plus taxes. Our room was clean and in the morning I saw several housekeeping employees starting on the rooms so that told me they have adequate staff to keep the motel looking its best. It's on the city's north side, not far from Andersonville.  The Clark and Ridge location puts you convenient to many popular north side eateries, shops and of course, Wrigley Field. CONS It can be a bit noisy, especially if you're not used to ""city noise"". Parking.  While they do have a private lot, there is an equal number of spots per room, which means if two cars of customers are staying in one room, two spaces are used.  We saw cars blocked in (ours included) in the morning due to this. The bathroom is pretty small and the shower curtain was a bi-fold style, made of hard plastic that, when closed, made the small shower area even more cramped. The Four Seasons it isn't but then again, it's about a quarter of the price too.  It's a budget motel in an expensive city.  If you're budget conscious, you might want to check it out.",N
2729,"I've been to most every hotel in Chicago, and the James is my favorite.  Our room was very large (and I believe it was just a standard room) and had a completely usable sitting/reading area. Everything was beautifully appointed, the bed was fantastic, and the TV was huge too. I'd say it compares to the Mercer in New York, except for 1/4 of the price and without the pretense. The James is the best boutique hotel in Chicago, and if you can stay there for less than $150 as I did, you'll feel that you got a great deal.",N
1079,"I went here for an annual work function because I'm a winner, and Fairmont in Chicago did NOT disappoint!  The entrance is beautiful, lush and modern.  The staff is friendly, not above-and-beyond greatness but ""good"".  There is a nice little wine bar in the middle of the entrance and it's a great place to park yourself and people watch.  My room was beautiful, clean and modern.  Had all the regular amenities with wifi and flatscreen tv.   There is a nice spa in the hotel where I got a Swedish massage by a nice Russian lady.  Kinda expensive, but that is pretty typical of a 4 star hotel.  They also had a nice women's area with a sitting area, steam room, showers and lockers. My favorite part was hanging out at the Sushi restaurant (don't remember the name) with the bartender who reminded me of Balki from Perfect Strangers.  I stopped to ask him if there were any cool lounges to hang out at nearby and he gave me a couple of tips but we ended up hanging out at the hotel anyway.  I had a glass of Riesling and he let me taste a few other new liquor items (Creme Yvette!! yum!) while we chatted.   All in all we had a great stay and I would definitely recommend this hotel.",N
2980,"We stayed here in July 2010 for a conference.  My young daughter and I tagged along with my husband and had a little vacation.  Our experience while there and after trying to contact someone about it was mixed.   The maid staff was horrible and I never had the door held for me in all of the in and outs despite pushing a stroller.  The location is terrific and the pool was nice, but I would highly recommend the Chicago Hilton or the Allerton if you want good service and a comfortable stay in Chicago.",N
3109,Somebody pass me some Grey Goose Vodka or Remy Martin VSOP. I need a cognac to chill is this lobby because it so laxed and trendy . I have stayed here about 4 times . And I don't have anything negative to say about it . The rooms remind me of my own bedroom but the beds are much fluffier and cozy ....it's like sleeping on a cloud! The IPod dock was the best because I never leave home without the music. Loved the shower which was like raindrops.....sexxxy- Basically the whole setting makes you want to get close with the one you love to love  which is why me and my hunny are repeat offenders ....actually going this month,N
1733,"Booked this hotel at a GREAT rate through hotwire.   The hotel seemed to be in a good location. About 20 minutes from Midway. The welcome was wonderful! My first visit to Chicago and the front desk people were very helpful with how I could get around the city and some great places to see while I was there.  Over the next four days they showed that they remembered me specifically. The room was perfect. Not too big, not too small. Well equipped and very comfortable! The only downside is that they seem to rent out what should be common areas to groups. I had arranged to meet a friend that I hadn't seen since we were children in the lobby on evening. When I arrived back at the hotel to find her... she was lost in a sea of conventioneers.  We did find each other of course... we were the two people looking confused. I would recommend it to anyone. :)",N
3949,"In a desperate situation to secure downtown Chicago hotel room for a recent work conference I was thrilled to land a 'lake view king' accommodation at the Congress Hotel. Due to the late nature of my reservation and the time frame I needed to be in Chicago, I don't think I would have found an alternative to the Congress Hotel even if I had read the Yelp warnings about this place. Let me start by saying that the one star rating is low for the location; located right on Michigan Avenue, across from Grant Park you are in a great spot for sightseeing, shopping and restaurants. That said, the one star rating is much too high for the Congress Hotel itself. Upon pulling up to the hotel we had to dodge a picket line and were essentially verbally assaulted by a rude valet who only said to ""immediately unload our car"" so he could ""get it out of the way"". Nice. Check in went smooth and the view from our room was incredible. Unfortunately that view would only be ours until we realized the toilet did not work at all, unless you call flooding the bathroom and room entrance working. Our first call to the front desk to request a move to a new room was met with, ""we will send up someone to repair and clean."" Repair and clean translated into a guy with a plunger and a woman with a bucket, spray bottle and paper towels. Not acceptable. Our second call, with some stronger language, resulted in a move to a double bed special with a brick wall view. So much for the view. It was in that room that we noticed the cheap furniture which was essentially broken, gouged and dusty. Nice. As far as the food goes, just stay away, the Gazebo restaurant for breakfast at was terrible as was the service. All this for the price of approximately $260 per night...what a deal! It is a shame to see what the current owners have done to this once grand hotel. It is clear that the place must have been a spectacular place to stay back in its day. One can only hope a reputable organization buys this property out of bankruptcy (which I am guessing is in the near future) and really does something outstanding with it.",N
3951,"The Congress Plaza was one of the finest hotels in Chicago, about a hundred years ago. It is not far from the Buckingham Fountain, but if you have the money there are plenty of better and newer hotels to stay at. The rooms are adequate, and may be desirable for backpackers who prefer not to stay at the nearby youth hostel. Hotel employees have been on a picket line at the front entrance for over two years, a very sad sight to see.",N

1456,"The Omni is spectacular. My husband and I had our wedding ceremony, reception, and post-wedding breakfast here, and couldn't have been happier. Rooms are very elegant and cozy but are ""suites"" (tiny sitting room) which seems very posh. More importantly, the service here is impeccable. Claire, our wedding coordinator at the Omni, did such a great job. One great thing about the Omni, as compared to other hotels in the area, is that the lobby is on the second level so there's not as much traffic from tourists.",N

1019,"This is a cute little boutique hotel right in the heart of River North that is a wonderful value for the price.  I would not say that it should get five stars, because it is certainly not on the caliber with a Peninsula, or another 5 star hotel, but for the cost it is a great value. I enjoy staying at boutique hotels because they offer unique extras: although the Amalfi doesn't have its own bar, they have a complimentary happy hour on weekend nights with wine, limoncello martinis, and bar nibbles.  They have cd players with complimentary jazz and world music, cool decor, and a nice sized bathroom.  We found our room on expedia for about $150 a night; unbelievably cheap considering the value you receive.  It's also right in the middle of many great bars and restaurants.  Great place for a fun getaway in the city; it's a nice 3.5 to 4 star hotel for a great price.",N

2854,"This is a good hotel.  We got a good deal, so we enjoyed the comfy beds and comfy lobby seating.  As well I should, since my friend neglected to put my name on the room list, as I waited in the lobby for a return call from him.  The hotel staff was strict in not letting me in.   As I waited  in the hallway for my travel mate I heard an intense love making session that got my blood pumping; spankings and anguished moans? I'm in. Inside our room though, I couldn't hear a sound. Expensive food options but you are in such a good location just make a walk to the EL - less than a mile, and you'll be good to go in Chicago. Ask for a river view room. Close to everything if you arn't afraid of some brisk but simple Chicago native foot action.",N
1463,"I stayed at the Omni Hotel and had a problem.  Why the 5 star review?  Read on.   I chose to stay at the Omni Hotel on an overnight layover after returning from a month in Europe.  I chose this location so I could take my teenage son out for some Chicago style pizza because, unlike me, he had never been before.  The check in process and staff were awesome, we were greeted with a smile and they made sure to take very good care of us right down to leaving chocolate chip cookies and milk outside the door for my son,complimentary water, etc.  Great start!  Our suite was well appointed and very comfortable.   In keeping with our ""plan"" we picked up a pizza and stored it in the refrigerator to take back to the west coast the next day.  The following morning we left our room for a little sightseeing before we left.  Upon return to our room we discovered the housekeeping staff had thrown out our pizza.  I contacted the front desk and they apologized and offered a credit at their on site restaurant but we had already had reservations at another restaurant and this didn't really replace the item that was disposed of.  We left a little disappointed and I wondered why they didn't just replace the pizza as the pizza place (Giordano's) was literally just around the corner.  I arrive home and within a day or two I receive an email survey from Omni hotels.  In the survey I describe the situation.  Within 2 days I get another email from the Omni hotel with their apologies and an offer to ship a replacement out to me in California via FedEx overnight for the Giordano's pizza that was thrown out! That is great customer service!   Every business should be run this way, when there is a problem they fix it.  They have definitely earned my future business!",N
3418,"The hotel was centrally located near all food and shopping areas. Even though it was an old building, they did a great job on the up-keeping. For a two full size room, it was kind of small and didn't have much room to move around. Their customer service was okay, it was so hard to get anyone during the late hours. I requested for more towels and it never arrived. For about $200 a night, I think there are other hotels around. Overall not too bad.",N
4876,"For a recent trip to Chicago, I made the grave error of booking my hotel stay at The Congress Plaza Hotel....Here's where a typical hotel reservation turned into the worst hotel experience ever!In transit to Chicago, I realized I left my wallet at home. I had my passport & $300 cash so I figured I'd be fine for the weekend. When checkinginto The Congress, I was told by the  clerk that my online reservation was for only 1 night. I apologized & explained that I left my wallet (with CCs) at home.I offered several options for me to pay for the remaining 2 nights: Paypal, wire transfer, or calling a friend who can pay for the room with their CC. The clerk said  ""I have to talk with my manager."" The manager comes out & tells the clerk that I have to check out tomorrow. The manager didn't discuss the issue with me. Basically, he didn't try to find an acceptable solution . In the Morning :Called a friend to make an online payment on hotel website. Payment accepted. I feel the matter is resolved. I left my hotel room for  breakfast. Returning to my room, I discover that my room card is deactivated. I go to the front desk & was told that the hotel canceled the online payment because it wasn't paid with my  CC.ME: You got to be kidding me?!MANAGER: We can't accept payment if we don't have the CC holder info.ME: The payment was accepted and then you canceled it?  How would you like me to pay for the room?MANAGER: You can call your friend & ask him to fax a copy of the back/front of his CC, driver license & letter stating  he authorizes the payment.ME: Fine.Call to friend:  I explained what the manager is requesting.FRIEND: OMG...I have my kids  I can't do that right now.ME: Okay, don't worry; I'll call someone else.I  reach another friend, explain the situation, and ask him for help. He  has to drive to his office for a fax machine. After 45 minutes, my friend calls me & says that all the  docs have been faxed to the hotel.ME: Did you receive fax from my friend?MANAGER: Yes.I called my friend to thank him, so he leaves the office.  5 minutes later the manager returns & tells me he needs another faxed copy of the CC, because the back of the CC is not signed & a CC authorization form has to be completed.  I'm now frustrated & say ""You couldn't tell me that the first time? My friend left his office.I called my friend back, ""Sorry my man! ...FRIEND: I left the office!  @#* &*!!!!!!!!!. Why didn't they tell you this before..?ME : I'm sorry but they're threatening to kick me out of the hotel, I don't have my wallet, my cash is running out...I truly need your help.FRIEND: OkMANAGER: I received the letter but it didn't note the precise amount for full payment of the hotel stay & it doesn't have the signature on the fax. ME TO MY FRIEND: The clerk says she doesn't have the fax with your signature.FRIEND: I sent it. The clerk was misspoke about not receiving the letter with my friend's signature. The manager comes out & says ""I have it, but the signature on the CC & on the letter isn't the same. At this point, I lose my temper & started to scream. I said to the manager ""Put yourself in my situation.  I've proposed several different payment options, none of which you accepted; I have contacted 2 friends, both of whom made payment for this reservation but you canceled both payments...and you expect me be calm?!
