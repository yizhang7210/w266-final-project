6,"This hotel came up on Hotwire for $108 a night.  We wanted to stay in this area so we took it.  The Tremont is an older hotel updated to boutique style.  I'm rather amazed by some of the other snarky reviews -- if you want rooms like the Drake or the Four Seasons, book yourselves there and pay the price!   In fact, our room (910) was fine.  It's a bit small, but large enough to hold a rather monumental king size bed with a giant headboard.  Perfectly comfortable.  There's decent free WiFi and plenty of outlets.  The bathroom has a slightly odd layout but is a bit larger than at the Inn of Chicago, where we stayed the first two nights we were in town. You also can't beat the location -- half a block west of Michigan Ave. at the Water Tower.  So there's no end of shopping and dining facilities.  You're a couple of blocks walk to Oak Street Beach and the El station.   It's true that there's only one elevator, so be prepared for it to be slow, especially when it's check-out time.  But this is a small quibble.  Haven't tried the continental breakfast at Ditka's yet.  But we did notice a cafeÃÅ in the plaza at the John Hancock building across Michigan Ave. that offers breakfast, coffees, etc. that probably should be decent.  There's also a Starbucks right across the street from the hotel.  Also the hotel has only 20 TV channels and doesn't carry MSNBC, to which I'm kind of addicted.   In short, no real complaints.  The Tremont more than meets our needs at a great price!",N
7,"Good location, really run down. I am surprised SPG lends their reputation to this property.",N
8,"Beautiful lobby. The rest is a dump. The elevator should be in an amusement park. The rooms are nice, if you like lumpy beds, peeling wallpaper, caked on dust on the air vents, disgusting bathrooms, and zero customer service. If they were a hostel, I'd be more understanding. But this place purports to be a classy old hotel.   If you're a hobo looking for a flophouse, this might be for you. There are plenty of dumpsters nearby for any biscuit-spearing you might have on your itinerary.  By all means, catch a cannonball to chi-town but mind the bone polishers. If you are a non-hobo, look elsewhere.",N
9,"Stayed here when I went to Chicago for a wedding.  The hotel had an old world charm that my husband and I liked and made us choose this over something more modern.  Yes, the hotel only had 1 small elevator which made it a little inconvenient when there were multiple groups (with luggage) at the same time, which reminded me of a hotel in Europe.  The rooms were modest, the bathroom was fine, everything was clean... not luxurious, but what do you expect.  The location itself is conveniently located just off the main street.  I think we ended up paying $160 per night (after taxes were added) during the weekend in July, which was cheap for that area when we looked.  Overall, fairly comfortable and affordable, a decent option.",N
10,"I bleed SPG loyalty blood to the point where I will walk or drive an extra 15-20 minutes to stay at a Starwood property just to get the points, but if the Westins downtown are booked again...I think that I may have to reconsider my tactics, because The Tremont is a dump.   This property is an embarrassment to the brand. Three things come to mind. 1)  The room's wallpaper and paint were perhaps current when leisure suits were legitimately fashionable. 2)  The hotel doesn't have a gym or a restaurant. 3)  I called down to the front desk because someone literally stole the cord off the back of the television and I wanted to watch the news, but there was no answer.  What kind of @!#$%!@#$ hotel doesn't answer at the front desk?  I ended up calling six times and never got through to the front desk, so I finally just took the one (yes, one) elevator down there.  I couldn't find a single person who works for the hotel. Stay classy, Tremont.  I won't be back.",N
12,"Pros: fantastic location at a good price, stately building, big comfortable bed Cons: slightly smelly room, horrible hot water pressure, no on-command movie TV system, front desk usually unoccupied Overall: would use again, but first would try other comparably-priced hotels in same neighborhood.",N
13,"I stayed here a couple of times in 2011, as this was the hotel-of-choice for my sister's wedding last summer.  It definitely had a lot of charm, but it was quite outdated and a bit run down (peeling wallpaper, for example).  The elevator was INCREDIBLY SLOOOOOW - and just one passenger elevator for 16 floors meant lots of waiting around.  (There was a service elevator that some used instead, but it was equally as slow.)  For the location and the price, though, it's a pretty good place to stay.",N
14,"let us begin with the seven min wait for the one elevator.  we get to the room and the key card will not work.  the new one works after 4 or5 swipes.  the a/c works great after eight hrs.  if one person wishes to take a shower and the other a bath you are in luck because the tub does not drain.  also if you are not sure if you should be green and use only one towel, the tremont makes this easy! They only give you one towel per person.  I must say it really is in a great location and the people that work there are really nice, This place just needs lots of work.",N
15,"This is an older property, so the decor is dated. This is not up to par with other SPG properties. No gym. A sparse continental breakfast of desserts and cereal is provided in the adjacent Ditka's restaurant. My bf is an SPG platinum elite member. Daniel upgraded us to the penthouse suite three days before our reservation. However when we arrived, it was unavailable due to construction. We were transferred to a suite in which one shower did not function, and the bathroom reeked of urine. We complained to the manager, who stated she did not smell anything unusual. With the help of our SPG representative, we switched to a different hotel.",N
17,"Small Rooms....one elevator that takes forever to come down to the first floor.  Had a second elevator or service elevator, but it did not work at all.  The elevator that worked could only hold 5 people at a time.  One plus is the location.   Ditkas was Awesome and right next door.",N
34,"Great location for walking to any part of downtown Chicago you could want.  The hotel was old, but not in any way that caused any kind of problem.  The lobby was very nice; I understand it had recently been renovated.  The room and other areas were clean, the staff was friendly and helpful.  The water in the room was hot and had good pressure!  My only complaint was that the walls were a little thin, so I could hear my next door neighbor.  Luckily he seemed to be a Japanese business man who didn't do anything other than talk on the phone and watch TV, but a different neighbor could have been a different situation!  Overall, the hotel was a great value for the location, and very clean and comfortable.  I would stay there again!",N
51,"Well..... I don't know where to begin.... Do I start with the room with no blinds.... or maybe that the TV didn't work... OH I know... the fact that the A/C didn't work!   A/C not working... We rented 2 rooms for 2 nights...135/night during NATO weekend, so we werent expecting a whole lot and thats exactly what we got. Only in 50% of the rooms the A/C worked. it would go on for about an hour and then just hummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm the rest of the night. We had corner rooms so there was plenty of light, 2 HUGE windows on 2 walls... the only problem was that 50% of the rooms didn't have freakin blinds!!!!! One of the walls faced West so, hello sun at 6:15am. Not a good thing when we were there for a bachelor party.   So being the lacrosse fan we are, we wanted to watch a little NCAA lax before heading out... only one problem, 50% of the 46 inch flat screens didn't work!   Couldnt find the "" Free High Speed"" WIFI. I will give credit where is it due... the bathroom was nice and large and the beds werent the worse I have slept on. The building was perfect placement for us.. close to Wrigleyville and Down Town. We brought all items to attention of the front desk... many a times it was ""its my first day sorry"" or ""I'll look into it"" with no result. When leaving we explained to them the issues again and we got ""wow your rate was only 135/night we are charging 250/night for this weekend, you should feel pretty lucky"" WTF who says that, fix the A/C!!!",N
52,"The card key never worked.  I even got an extra one from the front desk and it stopped working.   The room is big enough to stand up, turn around and thats it. big closet though, odd!  The bed felt like a combination of springs and plywood. I think I could've slept better on the floor.   The heating in the building is odd.  Its the old cast iron standing system which is controlled by a boiler int he basement.  Walking into the room it was probably upper 80's even leaving the window open didn't help much.  the knobs on the contraption didn't work.   Do not, and I repeat, DO NOT allow anyone to flush the toilet while you're in the shower.  I thought this was something of the past.  Oh wait, this place is in the past.  Well anyway, im pretty sure second degree burns will happen.  I was able to hit the shower head out of the way after the initial scalding. The location is ok, if you like a college town scenario, that college kids are screaming in the hallways between 2-4 am.   Thanks, but.... no thanks.",N
53,"I really liked the location and the building is super cute and rustic but that's about it as far as the positives go. Each and every single time my boyfriend and I left the room, we could not get back in using our keys. We know not to keep them near cell phones, etc. so something is amiss with their key/lock systems. It was quite annoying having to go all the way up our 4th floor room only to have to go back down to get another key, EVERY SINGLE TIME. I'm not exaggerating. Also, the furnace or whatever it was (sorry, I'm a FL girl so I have no idea what it's called)  seemed to work only when it wanted and it got extremely hot in the room at times. Each night we had to leave the the window open so the temperature was tolerable, but even opening the window didn't work very well.  After alerting the front desk to our issues, they simply shrugged it off and said it should be working. This place wasn't expensive, but I've stayed in equally inexpensive places and never had these issues.  I think I will pick somewhere else when staying in Lincoln Park.",N
54,"I won't go into details but basically employees at this hotel enforce policies in different ways. If one tells you something is okay to do, but the next person working disagrees....it will coat you the customer for there disorganization. When I asked if they expected me to check with every employee on how and which policies they enforced, they simply said yes. That is a burden no customer should bear and no customer should pay for employee disorganization.",N
69,"Aside from the slow elevators and slow internet  I enjoyed my stay here even though it was under crappy circumstances (displaced by fire in my apartment building). Luckily the owner of my apartment building (right up the street) owns this hotel so we got a free room for two nights and a few other perks I wont mention. I was surprised to find a room with two sinks in the bathroom and a small room with a fridge, microwave, sink and a coffee maker. The bathroom was better than the bathroom in my apartment and not at all with a generic hotel look. If I ever move away from Oak Park and come back needing a hotel, this is the place I will stay!",N
70,"Stayed in the motel part of the hotel, but attended a marriage ceremony and reception in the main building. The motel is a real throwback, with multiple versions of patterned wallpaper, bright colored bedspreads, and drapes all mixed in with a combination of carpet and contrasting tile. It's a good thing I could give a s**t about decorating. The bed was comfortable and clean, and overall, the place is very nicely kept. Bathroom is tight for two (really, it's tight for one), but a nice, hot shower. The accommodations for the marriage ceremony and reception were top notch, and everything from the bartenders to the hors d'ouevres were excellent. And the dinner was incredible -- not sure I've ever seen a kitchen send out this much food -- and complicated food (beef wellington), no less -- and have it come out hot, crispy and delicious. Kudos to all for being spot on! TIP: Don't forget to ask for the WiFi password when checking in -- and the WiFi password expires in the middle of the night, so don't waste too much time trying to figure out why your network connection is gone in the morning...",N
71,"I'd love to give this 2.5 stars if I could. I decided to come here because the overall reviews looked good and the price was great. (I was there for business, didn't want to stay at the airport and downtown Chicago didn't make sense) Its true it looks recently renovated, the lobby area is pretty ritzy looking, and the restaurant seemed to have a lot of business. I stayed in the motor inn section. The sheets & towels were worn & tired. The place just didn't look sparkling. There was a towel in the bathroom hung like maybe the maid had not seen it from the last guest. The tile was a bit scuffed. The bathroom could have used a fan, a new door, and a light in the shower. This will do since this is a business trip, but I kind of wish I were somewhere else... http://www.carletonhotel...",N
72,"A good neighborhood hotel.  El stop not far.  My small room was in the fun, kitschy motor inn.  The bathroom is super-cramped.  The walls are thin, which means I could hear the conversations of my next-door neighbor (which means they could hear mine).  Yet somehow I didn't mind these negatives.  Good access to other points of Chicagoland.   Don't come here looking for luxury.  But it's clean, safe, and quirky. There is a decent amount of free parking, too.",N
73,"We stayed at the Motel part of the Clarleton. This is a separate area not in the hotel. It had allot of + the price was under 100 bucks, was on a single floor close to the parking. The room was small but the decoration was very nice kind of 60's inspired. The town was within walking distance. Oak Park has allot of shops. (we went on the 4th almost all were closed that day). The green line train was a block away if you want to go downtown. Take a visit to the Frank Lloyd Wright former home and walk or drive to the dozen or so homes he built very cool.",N
74,"Remember in Home Alone, that concierge at the hotel who was a total crab and wanted to bust Macaulay Culkin's ass? I think his dopplegangler works the front desk at Carleton. We had a group # for our wedding guests, but somehow a handful of their reservations disappeared. Maybe it was user error or maybe it wasn't, but when working in a hotel, you need to just drop the 'tude and satisfy your paying customers. You don't act like you're doing us a favor by letting us stay at your crusty hotel. Anyhow, besides all that drama, the hotel was fine. The cleaning ladies I ran into were super sweet. The rooms were clean and spacious. Their choice of fabric patterns for the curtains were unfortunate. The entrance was really weird. What hotel doesn't have automatic doors? Getting your stuff into the hotel is like an obstacle course. First you push through two sets of doors (no button for handicapped people to access), then you have some steps to make it through. To get to the right wing, you have to go up some more steps before making it to an elevator. Someone didn't think this through very well.",N
75,"I really wanted to like / love this hotel BUT! It reminds me of one of those places that are trying to hard to be something that they will never be. We went here for brunch. The food was luke warm and not too tasty. The guy that they had fixing the omeletts didn't understand English (what part of the plan was that ? ) the server came only 1 time to bring us drinks and of course due to mothers day brunch, the Tip Added to her ticket was a whopping 20% gratuity when we didn't see her. For almost $200 for 4.. one 12 yrs of age..I think I will do as I always do, spend a little more and head to the Ritz Carlton or the Drake hotel..",N
76,"We picked this hotel for a weekend away from the city because we thought Oak Park would be a nice place to unwind. The lobby had an old-world charm that lent the hotel a boutique feel. We splurged on a hot tub suite, and the tub was indeed the highlight of the experience. The bathroom was huge and seems to have been recently remodeled. The rest of the suite was immaculate, the front desk staff attentive, and the wi-fi as high-speed as advertised. For those that might be directionally-challenged, this hotel is off the beaten path and a bit difficult to locate. It is within walking distance from downtown Oak Park, though, so it is very convenient for those who would prefer to leave their car and spend the weekend on foot. I think the Carleton would benefit from the services of an interior decorator for the rooms. Much of the furniture seemed very traditional mid-price hotel style and boring. Not nearly as classy as the lobby might suggest. That was a bit disappointing. We did enjoy our stay, though the hotel was not amazing enough for us to feel an urgent need to book a second stay.",N
78,"I got a room for my parents in the motel section of the Carleton and I was so pleased with the rooms! They are used to Holiday Inns but I wanted them closer to me in Oak Park. The rooms were cute, very Mad-Men-60's, but adorable! They were clean and nicely sized for a motel, they had a little kitchenette and a nice clean bathroom. I told my folks that if they didn't want to stay there, I would and they could have my apartment! They were very comfortable and pleased with the location, they said next time they come to town they will surely stay there!",N
79,"Stayed in the ""Motor Inn"" section of the hotel.  While the appointments were nice and everything was clean there were a few issues with the room, which should be addressed by the management.   First... the walls are like cardboard.  I could hear everything my neighbors were saying, even though they were speaking at normal level.  Fixing this would require sound insulation in the walls, during your next remodel. Second... there was a constant roaring sound coming from the bathroom vent, presumably from a fan.  While the noise might not be that noticeable during the day, at night when everything is quiet, it becomes very noticeable and very annoying.  Just get a new, quieter fan.  I've read other reviews that complained about this as well. Third... get firmer mattresses.  The mattress was a very cheap, weak mattress.  The kind that squishes down to about 30% of its initial height. This makes for a very uncomfortable night sleep and a sore back the next day. With the above changes, this hotel could go from being second rate, to a real first class establishment.",N
94,"We had both our wedding ceremony and reception at the Carleton in May 2011.  It was the first vendor we booked, and we have absolutely no regrets. Annie, the banquet manager, is organized, professional, and always quick to respond to any emails or questions. I found their policies regarding weddings much more flexible than other places.  The hotel itself is beautiful and provides an entire section for your wedding, including a gorgeous bar area with sitting rooms for cocktail hour.   The ballroom is a smaller and more intimate than many hotel ballrooms which I preferred for our 100 person wedding.  In addition, the prices and catering minimums are much more reasonable than any place I looked at in Chicago.   The food is catered by Barclays located in the hotel and was delicious, and we received many compliments on it and the hotel as a whole.",N
100,"Hmm. I have to say quite a pleasant experience! We changed hotels after reading the positive reviews of this one. Stayed for a few days. Very nice front desk staff during morning and late evening hours. This was more like a smaller boutique hotel in a GREAT area, Wabash and Erie, 2 blocks or less from everything including Michigan Avenue. Safe, clean, well landscaped lush area. Property also clean, well maintained and fresh smelling. Sure, rooms are small but why would you stay in your room in this great city. I didn't find them terribly small. There was a small hallway that went past the bathroom to an area with a desk, queen bed and flat screen. Modern decor and colors. Small dresser in closet with ironing board and safe. Bathroom larger than I expected after reading the other reviews. FREE WiFi and breakfast buffet which had yogurt, cereal, hot cinnamon rolls, an egg product, sausage, etc. Hot beverages were always available throughout the day. Clean dining area just off lobby. Clean, comfortable beds, updated fixtures, comfy bed, clean, bright linens. I did not have too many issues with noise overall. Good water pressure, hot water, clean towels. Partial view of street, room not totally blocked in. Again, you're not here to look out the window. You are here to eat and shop. (Don't kid yourself). You don't need a car here in the city so save your efforts with that. Close to trains, buses, etc. Easy walkable city. Trader Joe's is across the street, Grand Lux, Bloomingdale's Home, Dues Pizza around corner, Michigan Avenue two blocks away, quick walk. All the restaurants/shops any visitor would want. Save yourself the bloated overhead of some of the other more crowded Magnificent Mile hotels and stay here. Nothing bugs me more when the common areas, lobbies, etc. are just crammed with tourists. Good for single travelers, families, etc. Good for YOU!",N
101,"Location is excellent.  Right near the Magnificent Mile and Pizzeria Uno and Pizzeria Due.  There's even a Starbucks and a Trader Joe's across the street. Rooms are small.  Beds are small, more like a Full rather than a Queen.  Bathrooms are small and smelled kinda weird.  Walls are thin. Breakfast was pretty awful.  No waffle bar. Price is kinda expensive but location is great!",N
102,"I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights while visiting Chicago. The hotel in on Wabash and Erie, two blocks from Michigan Avenue (known for shopping) and the CTA Redline. The hotel is around a busy and safe area. I walked around the area at 11pm at night and I had no issues. There were not a lot of people out at night but I felt safer than other parts of Chicago I visited during the daytime (southside of chicago). They have a friendly front desk who will answer your questions and accomodate your needs (extra soap, problems with the room). The rooms are small but that is fine because when you visit chicago, you are only at your hotel to sleep for a few hours. The bathroom is about the size of your room. They have FREE WiFi and breakfast buffet which had eggs with cheese, sausages, make your own pancakes, cereal, fruit and etc. Hot coffee and teas as well as ice cold water were always available throughout the day. They have a nice, clean, big dining room by the lobby. I like the hotel. The only problem is the ventiliation kept making a sound at night and kept waking me up. I asked the hotel staff to fix it two nights in a row. It stopped for a few hours and the sound came back again. I would definitely go back to this hotel again as it is convenient and not too expensive.",N
103,"THe rooms are nice with a retro feel, kinda small but that didn't matter to much it was just a place to sleep. I was upset that the maid didn't do a cleaning on the third night we were there.  In addition, upon checkout the staff did not say a word. He just asked my room number and said bye. A small "" how was your stay would have been nice."" Although, I admit the service men that helped with luggage and taxi were very welcoming and they actual asked how the stay was. The location is the best part of this hotel .",N
104,"I'm no frills, so this was easily likable for me. About $80 w tax/service charge on http://hotels.com. I got a queen accessible, I think. Cheapest place I found that was 3 stars, no bed bug reports (as of Jan '12 - no bug reports is always something I check now with travelling!) and near Magnificent Mile, so it was excellent.  Expected smaller but upon getting to the room, I was happy. totally enough room to move around. A cute lil mini-sofa seat in the corner. Chic wallpaper in the bathroom. Not a place you'd come to for luxury or for the style, it's draw is that it covers the basics and has lil contemporary charm touches (love the chicken photos in the foyer)..Friendly front desk. The doors are pretty industrial looking metal and closet appears to be a janitor's closet before opening, but whatever, there's hangers and a small safe and that meets the needs. You can see some ppl also reviewed under Hotel Cass (formerly)  - http://www.yelp.com/biz/.... Happy face =] because: - Low price - Adequate enough size for basic needs - Great location - Free internet wifi, and decent speed - 2 comps in the business ctr with free printing - Free breakfast (not perfect but free is key - and  Trader Joes and Jewel Osco are nearby to cover more options). Bfast is like 6-930, so I had to force myself awake to get it, but glad it was there. - Clean enough (a couple markings on the slightly dusty curtains and I think some stain on the wallpaper, but oh well) - My bf was happy that the flat screen TV had HBO - Good view outside the room to see the tops of some churches Improvements would be: - I wish there was a mini fridge (it was 23 degrees when I visited, so I put water near the window and that worked OK). - I wish there was a microwave (tho there is one downstairs in the breakfast room - I wish there was a luggage rack (eh,I put luggage on the sofa) - Not much bathroom counter space (I just cleared the towels off the top towel rack to put a few things there or I could have brought the mini white table over next to the door if needed) - Thicker walls (one night was quiet, the next morn had neighbor moans - ah well, it's just one of those amusing touches when you stay at a hotel haha) I would def stay again and recommend to others.",N
108,"Tiny rooms, no fridges in rooms.  Got a staph infection there, that has been a problem off and on for a year now.  No contact from hotel even though I tried twice to contact them about the issue.   Too bad since I travel a decent amount for work and now avoid Holiday Inns'. Nothing here was better than any other similarly priced hotel, no in room fridge and tiny rooms would have already dragged this to a 3.  Staph infection and no communication makes it a 1.",N
109,"Will definitely stay here again ! One of the cleanest holiday inn hotels I have ever stayed in! These employees I encountered had wonderful customer service and personality ! Always a plus! I didn't feel like I was staying in a chain hotel when I checked in. They gave me all info I needed at check in. Some hotels i have to call the front desk when I get to my room because they didn't give me the wireless internet access. I booked a 2double bed room.. Rooms are on the small side, but that is because the building was built in the 1930s hence the small rooms compared to other hotels. Loved my room.  Bed was comfortable and warm in the Chicago winter. The window does have a bit of a cold draft, but with the heater on 75 at night and under the blankets I was super warm. Bathrooms. The cleanest bathroom I felt comfortable putting my bare tush on the toilet, and my bare feet in the tub. The shower tub had a mat on the tub floor which means they can remove it and sanitize for the next person ! I love how cute and chic the whole hotel felt. I will definitely stay here again, I'm looking forward to it. Con Jus checked out. Valet parking took forever to bring the car around ! We called before we left the room, checked out, and waited. And waited like fifteen minutes. It took valet a total of half hour to bring the car around. Valet ls $40. Self park at the same garage for overnight is $39. Next time id rather save a dollar +tip and park my own Damn car. Valet was not economically savvy after waiting forever to get my car it was not rush hour. The time I waited I could have gotten my own car and loaded up my luggage and been on my way to my flight !! The valet guy was not even apologetic for taking Soo long. The valet Is not apart of hi express its a different company but make it clear u would rather park your own car then deal with that shit. I'm on vacation. I want to enjoy what little time I have instead kg waiting around !",N
110,"This was my very first trip away from home with my two-year-old son.  The pictures online, convenient location and cheaper price if you book in advance were all positives even before we arrived.  We had a rough taxi ride from the airport, and just upon arrival, my son vomited in the taxi....not the best start to our trip.  The gentleman at the front desk (I think his name was Todd) was sympathetic and very kind.  We were hours early for check-in, but were able to take advantage of the lobby and breakfast, and we cleaned up the best we could in the lobby washroom.  Todd and another woman at the front desk were helpful with directions to nearby attractions.  Our room was ready after a few hours exploring the city, which worked out nicely (still earlier than check in time).  The room  was exactly as pictured on the website.  Small, but not too small (still had a dresser inside the closet and closet space), updated, modern and very clean.  As a mother, these were all very important to me.  Wi-fi was free, which was appreciated.  We had a very pleasant stay and enjoyed breakfast everyday.  Some days it was very busy, but we were lucky enough to have a table each day.  The staff (including breakfast staff) was incredibly friendly and courteous!  That alone would bring us back for another stay.  Todd remembered my name after our first encounter and every doorman would greet my son and me enthusiastically every time!  There are a few steps at the entrance from the front door to the hotel lobby, which worried me with an enormous suitcase and a stroller, but the doorman would help us every single time.   They held our luggage both the day we arrived and the day we left, which was a relief.  There is a Trader Joe's practically right across the street, and restaurants, Magnificent Mile shopping and Water Tower shopping all within walking distance.  Navy Pier is a longer walk, but manageable.  I liked that the hotel seemed smaller and personal, was updated and still was an historical building.  We would absolutely stay here again!  I am grateful for such a positive traveling experience!",N
119,"I stayed here with friends for a concert for two nights and have to say for the price, location and quality, the Whitehall Hotel is tough to beat! It markets itself as boutique hotel and it is indeed just that, so you can expect great 1:1 service but it's not going to be a systematic as your neighborhood Hilton. Maybe it's because I live in NY, but the room were much bigger than I anticipated and we had a great view of Chicago's Gold Coast. The beds were insanely comfortable and I found the bathroom to be clean (and also spacious). As I had last been to Chicago when I was a kid, I wasn't too familiar with what to do but found everyone at the front desk and concierge to be very helpful in recommending places to go visit/eat. I was initially unsure on how near/far the hotel was relative to other things in Chicago but quickly found its location to be very ideal. It's right off Michigan Ave so you have all the shopping/Maginificent Mile right there and only a few blocks away from the water. In fact, the only time we used a cab was to get to/from the airport and then coming back from going out at night. They do not have an ice machine on each floor so you have to call the front desk to order some which is fine with me but when we did call, we had to do so twice before it finally came up. A light bulb was out in our room and we also had to call twice before someone came. I am not sure if getting to the ice machine/mechanic just took that much time but that was only some significant ""complaint"" I had. Also, the TV was severaly outdated (think late 90's) and was angled to the left of our bed (opposed to in front) which was a little strange. Overall, an excellent hotel - highly recommend.",N
120,"For the price I have to give a solid three stars. The place was under construction and the air conditioning was off in the lobby for the three days I was there. they could have made arrangements considering the temperature was over 95 and humid every day. Also, the doormen were very inconsistent, usually hanging out at the curb chatting up the valet attendant. The rooms were nice and clean, beds comfortable and the aire in the room blew ice cold. All in all, I would stay here again as long as I was able to get the reduced rate with AMEX. If you are looking for a hotel with dining, this place has a restaurant but it remained empty my whole stay. (But hey, this is Chicago and I am sure no one wants to eat at a hotel restaurant unless it is associated with a kick ass chef!)",N
121,"First off, this is supposed to be a 4 star hotel.  Not a chance, more like a 2 1/2 star.  We had to wait about 15 minutes to check in as there was one person working the front desk who was on the phone, this was at 2:45pm, check in is 3pm so we were a little early but I think you would have more staff on since it was a Friday.  But we got checked in and headed to the elevator, two of us fit with our one suitcase each, barely.  Not a big deal.   We get to the room and our room keys don't work.  Ok it happens, the maid was able to let us in.  We went to the desk and got new keys, which also didn't work.  At this point we're irritated.  So we call the front desk, who seems to think that not having a working room key isn't a big deal.  Wow.  I was not about to rely on them to let me in and out of the room.  I did pay to stay here.  So the maintenance man comes up tries to fix it, takes about 30-45 minutes and another set of keys but we're finally in business.   So lets talk about the room.  Two of the lamps bulbs were burnt out.  The doors on the cabinet for the tv were nearly falling off.  The vanity lamp in the bathroom falling off if you wanted to actually move it and use it.  Air conditioning didn't work properly.  It was either, no joke, 60 degrees or 85.  So that I was either freezing cold under a blanket or sweating.  And during the night, the air just wouldn't turn on at all so it got even hotter.  The walls are incredibly thin so you can here everything and everyone.   The toilets have the loudest sound when flushed.  So imagine sleeping at being startled awake by the person flushing their toilet next door.   The decor is old which is the style of the hotel.  The room itself wasn't in poor condition just a few things here and there. There was a random beark skin blanket on the bed? Not sure why since it didn't match the victorian decor at all.  The bed was comfy and the pillows.  Which is always a plus except when you can't get a good nights sleep because you're woken so much thru the night. The room wasn't huge, standard size room, but had a nice full length mirror on the closet doors.  Lighting wasn't the best, I can't imagine the two other lamps would have shed much more light.  The bathroom was fairly lit and decent in size. Parking is $48 for valet for one night or $40 for the garage right across the street.  So pretty average there. I wouldn't stay here again, there are other hotels in the same price range that are nicer.",N
122,"Got a deal from a coupon site and used it in the spring.  The room had not been updated in my opinion since 1970.  The bed, nightstands and chairs were dusty and stained.  Even though it is close to Michigan Ave we had a beautiful view of a brick wall. They also have old fashioned TVs in the room!",N
123,"I stayed at the Whitehall hotel in April and overall had a great experience. The hotel itself is old and even though it went through a renovation not to long ago, it still felt old. The beds and rooms were very spacious and comfortable, but the elevators were very cozy (maximum 5 people, 4 with luggage). The staff are extremely nice, and has a small, but clean entrance/lobby. LOCATION: FANTASTIC! In the heart of the magnificent mile and never really needed a taxi! I'd stay here again for the price, comfortable beds, and the convenient location.",N
124,"I stayed here for two nights, May 23rd to May 25th.  I was upgraded to the Pinnacle Suite, room 1312 which was nice.  The hotel is definately showing some age with the elevators, electronics and furniture but it also provides some character to the hotel.  The bathroom was clean, the towels were clean, the amenities were nice. The only negatives I have for this place is that my bed was lumpy and when I was checking out, it took the bellman about 30 minutes to help me with my luggage.  The bellman said that they are in the process of upgrading the hotel and the individual units with new furniture so that should help this hotel in the future. In general, I got a good deal on the two nights I stayed, was upgraded to a suite and the staff was friendly.",N
125,"Hotel is well priced and has a good location if you're wanting to frequent the Magnificent Mile.  Its a small hotel, so the amenities are limited.  The beds were very comfortable and the a/c worked great.  The rooms are a little cramped.  Staff was friendly and were there to assist.  All in all, the Whitehall is a solid choice for your stay if you are just wanting place to get a good night sleep for a decent price.",N
126,"My husband and I live in downtown Seattle and went to Chicago for our 1 year wedding anniversary (and to visit family in the area). We stayed at the Whitehall and LOVED it. It was perfect. We stayed in a nice room that had been recently renovated. We bought the room through alaska airlines and it was a very good deal. This place was cozy, unique, fun & the staff were friendly. We also enjoyed the lounge downstairs. We'd stay here again for sure.",N
127,"I kept in mind that this hotel is old, and has alot of history, but it wasn't enough to make me ever go back. Upon arriving there was no clerk. Finally after 5 mins she shows up, and doesn't have our reservation on the computer so we have to sit and wait. Again. For 15 mins. Here she comes, we go to the room. It was a hard, lumpy FULL size bed. The tvs are old. The furniture is old. There was an old stained faux fur blanket on the old bed. You can hear your neighbors loud and clear. WORST PART 7am everyone is so loud in the hotel and outside. The windows in the room are right to the street where a cross walk guy was blowing a whistle at 7am for people and cars. The house keepers were talking loudly in the hall and I hardly slept a wink. also Internet was $10. This hotel had 4 stars On Hotwire and I don't understand that. I'm sleeping in the Marriott tonight which only has 2 stars and it's 100% better. All in all, don't waste your time or money on the Whitehall.",N
138,"Was in Chicago for a convention and had a limited budget. Found the Whitehall fit into that budget and was in a perfect location. I was concerned about some of the reviews on yelp and tripadvisor but, I thought I would give it a chance. Yes, it's old and small. Yes, it could use a makeover. But, for the price it's awesome. I did see the strings hanging of the chair in my room that someone photographed. Maybe I got the same room. But, come on, who cares. I wasn't hosting a social event. The place is clean. Things are worn but, not warn out. The bed is comfortable and they give you lots of fluffy pillows. I felt very comfortable leaving my personal items out on the bed or bathroom counter. The staff was extremely friendly and helped me quickly. The air conditioning was noisy and I had to use ear plugs. However I don't think it was any different then any other hotel in the area. The Four Seasons is directly across the street and at $500 per night they provide ear plugs for you. My friend stayed there for the same convention. The shower at the Whitehall gave me a warm shower everyday and the safe was large enough to hold my laptop. Bottom line if you want to pampered in a luxury hotel, go to a luxury hotel. If you want a great value go to the Whitehall.",N
144,"Ok, so I read a lot of reviews on yelp and another site before writing my review.  I agree with everyone that said the beds are wonderful, they truly are.  On our king size bed we had at least 5 pillows and there was one in the closet.  I love having plenty of pillows! ELEVATORS The elevators are small, very small.  Not a negative, since they move quickly.  I was very cramped when I was in there with 2 guys , a mom, her mom, and her kid.  Yikes, I was afraid the cables wouldn't hold.   CHECK IN/OUT The lobby is small, but the staff was very pleasant and welcoming!  I was pleased that we were able to check in early and check out late.  We checked in at noon and out at 1:00, huge plus!  They also kept our bags until we caught the train home later that day at 6.   STAFF Everyone that we had contact with was sweet and polite.  The consierge (sp???) was great!  Super helpful. RESTAURANT ON LOCATION Unless you got the Groupon that we did skip Mei Fornetto, it's not worth it for breakfast.  Pretty expensive.  We didn't eat there for any other meal.  The food we had was really good, though. ROOM Our room had a horrible view, but whatever, I could really care less.  I prefer to walk in it instead of just looking at it!  We had no issue with the shower at all.  We had no issue with hearing anyone around us.  The room was a little on the dark side.  The TV is in an odd location for watching TV in bed...until my husband figured out you can slide the doors in and pull the TV out.  Again, the beds totally rock.  Everything was clean.  I'm pretty leary about taking a bath in a hotel, but I did-several times and didn't worry about it at all.  I didn't like how we didn't have a coffee maker in the room.  I get up earlier than my husband and the first thing I like to do is have some coffee in my jammies.  I couldn't, unless I wanted to brave the lobby that way.  It also really pissed me off when they took the coffee away before 11 AM!!!  It's supposed to be out until then, but was taken away by 10:40 one of the mornings, grrr.  Don't mess with my coffee.  The coffee situation is the only reason they didn't get 5 stars from me.  The internet was included with our Groupon.  Had I paid for it I wouldn't have been to pleased, it was pretty sketchy. SUGGESTIONS We ate at Nuevo Leon in Little Village (we are in the Detroit area, and here it's called Mexicantown).  The food was great!  Cash only and out of the way, but we were kid free for a few days and it was not a big deal.  We took the 151 to State/Lake and then got on the pink line to 18th, walked a few blocks and were there. Get a Metra pass for the time you are there, it's so much easier and the locals are very helpful for which bus you need.  We got ours at Union Station when our Amtrak came in, it was $14pp for 3 days-totally worth it!",N
145,"My boyfriend and I got a Groupon to stay here for New Years Eve. Our Groupon was expired but they ended up honoring it anyway. The customer service was great. They were able to squueze us in for a late dinner. But when we got to the dining room, it was pretty empty; I'm pretty sure they could have put us in earlier time slot. And then the staff rushed us out really quickly. It was understandable becuase it was 10pm on NYE, but their boss should've just put us in earlier. However, the food was awesome! Overall, we had a great stay!",N
160,"I have to say that this is the worst place I have ever stayed at. Reserving a room was a hassle because I had to wait for the concierge to call me back...3 hours later. When we arrived the door man was pleasant and polite. The staff at the front...wasn't even present. We had to stand there for about 10 minutes before the doorman went back to look for the guy. Then front desk staff guy said they ""upgraded"" our room. We were okay to hear this. When we got to our room...disappointed. The elevators are ghetto and old looking. The hallway to our room is dark and shabby looking. The cups in our room had finger prints all over them. The shower had mold in the caulk and in the corners. The caulking at the base of the tub and the floor was cracked and stained looking. The toilet was dirty looking. They do not have ice machines or a vending machine for snacks or a small hotel store. We needed some ice for drinks we bought to the room and they sent up a guy with an ice bucket. This guy was not professional at all. He came in with regular street clothes and he actually welcomed himself in the room without my okay for him to come in. The ice is from the chinese restaurant downstairs. There is nothing luxurious or hotel like about this place. It is as creepy as a run down motel. Checking out took us 15 minutes before the front desk guy even came to the front. He was very rude. We were only staying at this hotel because we had a certificate given to us. I did not like this place. Do not spend your money on this place!",N
163,"Great hotel. I was impressed by the location and friendly staff. Rose, our saturday bartender,  was one of the best I have encountered.",N
176,"Awesome location and at a great value. Very clean and loved the mini kitchen in our suite microwave and refrigerator. Friendly staff and comfy mattress, what more can a girl ask for? How 'bout fantastic bathroom products.",N
177,"A very good hotel from a service and comfort perspective.  Even for Chicago, they took you for a ride on the parking ($55 per night) and I will never understand ""internet charges"".  Really, I a mean come on .. after all the fees and inflated parking the hotel decides to stick one last knife in you and charge you for the internet service.  Just skip it and go to McDonalds.. ride the wi-fi for free. Other than that, the room was extremely nice and comfortable and would clearly stay here again.",N
178,"Room Robbed!!! While my parents danced at my wedding, their room was being robbed.  They came back to find a laptop, iPad and camera gone.  My parents' keys were accounted for, and there was no sign of a ""break in"" which means whoever stole their electronics had their own key to my parents' room. The police and hotel are investigating and I hope that the hotel beefs up their security as a result. I am completely devestated that this robbery happened and tainted what should have been one of the happiest nights of mine and my parents lives. My parents have travelled the world extensively and have stayed in hundreds of hotels, they never expected this to happen at a Hilton in Chicago. I felt compelled to warn others to avoid having anyone else go through this experience.",N
209,"I loved this location... It was prime.  I always love being in Chicago, but the smaller hotels are usually easier accessible to the busy spots. The decor was beachy, very non-urban, but I liked it as it gave me ideas for my Miami condo which I'm redecorating! (go figure, get the idea from chicago) The poorest possible thing was the front desk.... One guy, sweet but not quick at all was manning a manic line of check ins... There was a sign for IHG Elite members but nobody was there to work it... I liked my place there, especially the awesome upgrade to a suite, made a huge difference... Loved the chic Indigo vibe... Pricing was average.",N
210,"The good and the bad.... Pros -Hotel is in a good location. Residential area. I felt safe walking alone outside the hotel. -The beachy/nautical decor is cute! Felt like i was at a beach house w/o the beach.. -Room was clean and the bed was VERY comfy! Couldnt get out of the bed in the a.m. LOVED my room on the 10th floor. -On the 10th floor, the shutters opened to a view of downtown -Most of the staff was really nice! -Lobby/Bar area is really cute -FREE Wi-fi   Cons -My friend didnt specify a preference and ended up on a smoking (4th) floor. The hotel was completely booked so she couldnt change. As soon as the elevator opened on her floor it reeked of smoke. Im not a smoker so it was completely suffocating for me when i visited her room for 5mins. She stayed 3nights and was completely miserable. (MAKE SURE YOU SPECIFY) -The lady w/ the long dark hair was rude. -Ordered room service (the croissant sandwich) for bfast and it was absolutely horrible. Bacon tasted like rubber..Couldnt finish it.. -Cabs rarely come in front of the hotel so you'll need to walk down the block to Division (not far.. just inconvenient) to catch one. -Several bars, a Starbucks, & Walgreens in the area but not many good food choices... we cabbed it to other areas.",N
211,"Man, this place is really mixed. I'm giving 4 stars purely on value, bed comfort, cleanliness, and nice staff. If this place were a $1 more expensive, it would easily fall to 3 stars. OH, now the front entrance will make you FEEL like you are at a Hotel Indigo, but once you enter the elevator, it gos downhill from there. For a Hotel Indigo, lets get this straight, the decor is disgusting and flat out OLD. The floors are old, the paint and carpets are old. The showers also do a pathetic job of keeping water off of the shower floor (There's a very small amount of glass coming from the wall an the curtain will not help you cover the gap). You will be using extra towels to mop up the water spraying out. The bed was Hotel Indigo standard. Lush, comfortable, sheik, and of course covered with some of the most heavenly pillows around. The place is CLEAN. The staff here is also pretty amazing.  If someone could just remove the staff and beds, and then blow up the decor with something new (WITH new flooring) and the place would be legit. Still, for $155 including vallet parking with unlimited 24 hour entry/exit, the deal is pretty hard to beat. You can get great deals if you call the Hotel Indigo reservations squad directly as opposed to going thorugh an online broker. When calling in, ask for any room/parking special rates.",N
212,"I don't usually result to Yelp but after attempting to contact the manager of Indigo and not receiving a return phone call, I am actually taking the time to write this in an effort to save others from this uncomfortable and somewhat bizarre experience.   I happen to be a physician as are my siblings who were also staying at indigo.  I'm only mentioning this because I feel like the cost of wouldn't be such an issue for me if it didn't seem like highway robbery.  One of the nights cost 200$.   The reason it feels like I was taken for a fool was because the staff was so rude.  It almost seemed like a joke.  I kept looking over my shoulder to see if there was a camera crew.  When I would go to the front desk to ask a question, the woman working made it seem like I was bothering her.  At first I thought maybe she was having a bad day until the same cold shoulder attended to me when I had the misfortune of requiring front desk services.  When I tried to relay an issue I was having with parking, she requested that i sign a valet parking receipt that didn't have my name on it .  The next day,  I brought to her attention the fact that she had charged me for 2 more days than I had utilized. She still seemed bothered and definitely did not apologize.   Did I mention it was over 100 degrees and only one elevator worked. not for one day. or two.  It didn't work for 3 days.  I understand things happen, It seems that in the business world there is some sort of compensation.  or at least an apology. Speaking of apology.  The valet driver allowed me and my sisters to get into a car that was not ours.  Sure it was the same make and model, but when we finally realized that the car wasn't ours,  we quickly exited the car, informed the attendant who responded, 'I know.""   Aside from that",N
213,"This was a last minute weekend to downtown Chicago, I prefer boutique hotels over large big box hotels. I found a great rate on Expedia $180 per night and their website looked like a place I would like so I booked it. I was pleased when I arrived, my room was ready, staff was friendly and the entire hotel was clean. I loved the beachy decor, made me think I was out in California by the ocean. About my only complaint was the laminate flooring in the rooms, it was a little warped and looked cheap, otherwise the furnishings, bedding and other amenities were nice and upscale. I will keep this hotel on my short list for future trips downtown.",N
215,"I booked the room through priceline which was an excellent deal for what I received. This is definitely a boutique hotel with chic nautical charm... not what you would expect to find in chicago's Gold Coast. They have a restaurant and in room dining after 5pm... pricey but the salmon was great. My room had a stand up shower with no tub so if you need a bath tub, I recommend asking for one. They offer both smoking and non smoking rooms. The non smoking room I was in dId not smell like smoke at all. They have free wifi and cute rooms but have out dated television sets. They carry Aveda bath products, keurig coffe in the room and the beds are pretty comfy. Don't drink the bottled water in the room, that will run you $4 a pop (what!?) But chicago boasts some of this nation's cleanest water straight from the tap. They also have a fitness and buisness center. The staff is wonderful which is why all the stars. I feel the staff really makes a place feel more like home away from home. If you need a cab to come get you use American united taxi... (773) 248-7600",N
233,"I LOVE staying at this hotel! The beds are always amazing and the staff is wonderful. Tom checked me in on my last trip--super nice guy who offered me a room even though it was prior to check in.  He said if I didn't like the room I could wait for something else. Room was spacious and beautiful, but no view...and when I'm in Chicago, I need my view. Tom got me into a smaller room with great views of the Sears tower. Totally happy. Internet was included--yay--and if I have any complaint, it's that the parking is tough in that area and valet is too rich for my blood.  I go here because it's cozy and friendly and makes me feel at home...i do not go there because the rooms are big. Its one of the best boutique hotels around and the location is second to none. Forgot to say...the above and beyond part was the fact that I was STARVING after traveling all day and could have eaten my shoe, I was so hungry. When Tom saw me eyeballing a plate of cookies and cakes (a staff reward for their high accolades on TripAdvisor) he kindly offered his cupcake to me. How nice was that!",N
253,I loved it. The staff was friendly and helpful. One of the highlights is the pool on the roof. Great view of the Sears (willis) tower. Restaurant in the lobby sucks so stay away. Not a 4 star hotel but I came for work and the 179 a night was the cheapest in the area and it was very nice for that price,N
254,"I recently came to the city to do House Hunting for work and because nothing was preferred with my company in the area, I chose the Holiday Inn as I have always been happy with their service; however, there is a first time for everything. I will start out with the good: - Beds are super soft - Wireless was fast and had a good connection - Close to Clinton Blue line Now the bad: Before taking a shower, I noticed that there was shampoo, and two bottles of lotion. My companion called the front desk to get some conditioner thinking the maid just mixed up the bottles because they look similar. Within minutes (good) a man was at our delivering four bottles. However, upon inspection we saw that it was two shampoos and two lotions. We were a bit mystified and wondering if you could use lotion for conditioner all rational thought says no, so we called the front desk again proposing the question. Her response was rather rude as she stated lotion was lotion not conditioner.   Next, the walls are thin. We could hear everything going on in the hallway as well as the neighbors coming back in their drunken stupor at 4 am. Not to mention because the hotel is located close to the interstate and subway, there is a lot of noise at night. The hotel parking is not free. There is a $35/day charge but you can get it for $25 if you sign up for something for free. There is a parking lot located below that you can pay per day but it was very sketchy. As we were walking to the subway, three men were hanging in the area and yelled very rude comments and six hours later when we returned they were still there. I am glad I was not alone as I did not feel safe. No complementary breakfast Finally, there was no refrigerator or microwave so I could not heat up my amazing leftovers from Artisan catering!   Final Review: This place is not worth it",N
255,"Booked a two bed standard room only to arrive and find they only had a single bed bedroom available (wish I'd known this before I booked the room for $200 bucks!).  Manager told us that they would inform our third party booking site (Expedia) that they wouldn't charge us since they didn't have the kind of room we wanted.  Instead they informed the site that we stayed in the room for 2 hours (instead of 5 minutes) and that they will not refund our money (wish they would have told us that before we left!).  All we wanted to do was stay in the room with TWO beds that we booked.  Be careful when making reservations, as what's advertised is not necessarily what's available.",N
256,"Traveling with kids!  Loved the rooftop pool, rooms were a little small but clean and beautiful with very comfortable beds, close to plenty of attractions, lots of public transportation.  Great staff",N
264,"Excellent price, great location (right next to John Hancock building), very nice and spacious room, free internet, and excellent service - this is the place to go if you don't want to go broke while staying in Chicago hotels. I recommend it to my friends who plan to stay downtown and will most definitely return any time I have business in the Loop.",N
274,"I stayed here during the summer of '11! It was a fantastic hotel. The restaurants included were also delicious. Although, the breakfast staff were a little rude. However, the staff at the front desk were amazing and so helpful! This hotel was right in the heart of Chicago. Lots to do and lots to eat in walking distance. Very clean!!!",N
295,"We stayed at The City Suites Hotel in Chicago this past weekend.  The hotel is an older building but the hotel is actually quite nice. We had the suite with a king bed and in the other room a pull out sofa. We had 2 LCD TV's, a table with 4 chairs, small frig, microwave, and a fully stocked bar. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was very clean (and I mean CLEAN) and the bath had everything you needed. The staff were very nice from the person who took our reservation, the desk staff, and the housekeeping staff. All of the employees made sure we were treated well. There is even a continental breakfast that is free--not many offer this in today's economy. Across the street is a diner that is open all night long if you feel the urge to eat. the hotel is on the Brown Line which will take you to the Orange Line (in the loop) then to Midway. It takes 1 hr from the hotel to get to Midway. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. RM",N
296,"City Suites is a fairly small, but affordable, boutique hotel. That said, I think boutique is just fancy speak for old. It's not that things are run down per se, it's just definitely not modern and has some quirks as a result. My room was spacious enough, had two mini fridges (one empty, and one filled with reasonably priced beverages and snacks), two LCD TV's and a comfortable bed. However, it also had uneven floors, older furniture, noisy steam heating and certainly didn't do a lot to absorb outside noise. Overall, friendly staff, free continental breakfast (though pretty bare bones), somewhat slow Wi-Fi, and a great location - coupled with affordable rates, it's not a bad place to stay.",N
297,"Just returned from an over-night stay with my husband.  The location is great.  Right near good food and entertainment.  That is probably the only upside to this hotel. The hotel itself is old and outdated.  We could actually feel holes in the floor boards through the carpeting.  The bed was super uncomfortable.  Not old, just bad.  The TV in the bedroom only had intermittent reception.  One draw back to the location is that it is right next to the Belmont stop of the EL.  All night and especially in the morning we were awoken by the train rumbling by and the voice ""This is the Belmont stop, the next stop will be..."". Lastly, even though I made my reservation well in advance and had requested a king bed they had none available and we were forced into a double bed.  While I love my husband I was looking forward to just a bit more space.",N
328,"I knew when I booked this place I was not getting someplace fancy, so my review is based on that knowledge going in. I paid rather more then I would for a room like this anyplace else, but it was still the cheapest place in downtown Chicago for the night I was in town. The lobby is very pretty and well taken care of. The upstairs floors are dark and rather worn, but still fairly well cared for. The room was small but it was just me and my suitcase so I didn't care. You could hear the trains from the room, but they weren't disruptively loud. The biggest complaint I have about the room is that despite it being a non-smoking room starting about 10pm the room started to smell very strongly of stale smoke. Running the fan/AC didn't help and the windows were painted shut so there was no way to get fresh air in the room. It only got stronger as the night went along to the point where I started to get a migraine from it - needless to say did not actually get much sleep. It was a fantastic location for me to go out and wander from though, and they have a secured and guarded parking garage across the street for those that drive in. Alo free and surprisingly good internet service! Staff for the most part was friendly, except I was looked at like I was from another planet when I asked about the possibility of early check-in. Overall though a decent budget place if you just want a place to crash for the night.",N
329,"Budget budget budget. The horrible isn't the worst I've stayed in but for the price it was pretty weak. I was here this past wknd and much to my surprise, this joint was $135 a night. Now for the location alone, being one block from Millennium Park and walking distance to Magnificent Mile, I could put up with the price. But this place just seemed dirty and out of date. The staff that I dealt with was nice, friendly and helped with directions but service alone doesn't make up for the lack of aesthetics of this place. The elevators took forever and make questionable noises, the hallway to the room reminded me of something from The Shining and the room was not nice. Thank god we were only staying there for one night because I don't think I could've done longer. The bed needed to be replaced, along with the pillows and itchy comforters (blue light what??), the curtains on the window weren't even long enough to cover the window so we couldn't get total darkness when we wanted to take a nap. The shower was decent but the window to the curtain in the bathroom ended up falling down and it looked as if someone put it up there with bubble gum to fix it previously. Plus, you could open the window with no screen from the 11th floor. Thank god I was in a right state of mind the time I was there! The L runs right across the street so that may bother some but it really didn't bother me too much. Good location and nice staff but they really need to do something about the hotel itself if they want to get more than two stars which seems to be the majority vote here on Yelp. PS-Free wifi!",N
330,"I have mixed feelings about this place. It is the cheapest place on that area of downtown, but it is in very sad shape. The lobby is not nice but is a LOT nicer than the room. This is the only Travelodge location I have ever seen that does not include a free breakfast. The elevators are really, really slow... up to a ten minute wait at busy times. But the front desk staff was excellent. The carpet in the room needs replacing badly. There were iron burns on it and it was filthy. The room was very noisy as we were on the same level as the elevated train, which corners by every 6 minutes. The room was large but most of the space was wasted due to a terrible layout that put one of the beds blocking the entry to the bathroom. The bathroom was nice but there was literally no surface space other than the floor to put anything. They put the tissues on the desk because there is nowhere to fit it in the bathroom. Strangely, the bathroom is quite large and would have plenty of space for shelves. If you are looking for a bargain, this is your place, but if you have the money, I would recommend staying somewhere else.",N
331,"Very old hotel. Decor is aged and is in need of repair/replacement. Our AC was missing the whole front of the unit & it was filthy, the carpet was worn bare, and the walls had about 20 coats of paint on it. Very dirty rooms (could write my name in the dust). The hallways stink horribly, so does the lobby. The employees were friendly for the most part, and there is a good/simple diner attached to the hotel. I would not stay at this hotel again, I would find another option.",N
332,"Guys, this is totally a four star hotel for being a Travelodge. I'm a total fan. I stayed here three nights while scouting out Chicago for the first time for a potential future conference. The rates are reasonable (you don't need to pay for parking at $35/night; just take the ridiculously easy and affordable public transit everywhere), the staff is friendly (enough) and the neighborhood is super convenient to anywhere and everywhere you want to go. I didn't see, or miss, a continental breakfast, a gym, a sauna, a doorman or fancy flat screen tv's. Three of us shared a double room and did get: 2 beds, 1 refrigerator, 1 microwave, 2 closets, 1 tv, 1 clean bathroom, a great view of the city and plenty of space. Like I mentioned, it's close to public transit--the red line is wicked close, and the blue, purple, brown, pink and green lines are all within 4 blocks. If you want to bus anywhere, there's tons of buses that come ALL THE TIME, and if you want to walk, well, bundle up if it's January. Doable, though. More often than not, a hotel room is just a place where you crash when visiting a city. For that purpose, the Travelodge gets a super firm thumbs up from me.",N
335,"I loved this place!! Amazing location right in the middle of the city. Very inexpensive. Super friendly staff and free wifi. Rooms were small but clean, AC worked well, and bathroom was clean and we had plenty of towels and toiletries. I would definitely recommend it and would stay again.",N
342,"You get what you paid for. One roll of toilet paper and if you need more call and request it, phone not working, room service cleans your room around 4-7 pm so you have to wait for them to clean your room and get clean towels, elevators extremely slow, the beds mattresses are really flat and uncomfortable as well as the pillows ( you only get two pillows per bed), free Internet, close to downtown and conveniently closed to train, fair prices for being close to downtown, okay lobby, staff were also just okay, could have better customer service, AC worked, and you can not open the windows, no bathroom vents so it gets stuffy.",N
371,"The Congress is very near and dear to my heart. This was the hotel I stayed at when I came to Chicago and stayed by myself for the first time. It had since then become my go to hotel if I ever need a room on short notice. The hotel is very old but not in a musty, gross, dilapidated, scary way. You can tell that it must have been such a grand and luxurious place back when it originally opened. The lobby is so beautiful with its mosaic work. No it has not been update or renovated very recently but it has been very well maintained. In fact I actually like the way the rooms are just as they are now. I find the Congress very charming, warm and comfortable. It's very clean and all of the staff have always been accommodating and courteous. That being said I do think they must have some sort of deal worked out with Exchequer because both times I asked the concierge/door guy/bellhop he suggested I go there and gave me a voucher for 15 percent off my meal. And this place has terrible service! So I can't imagine they would suggest you dine there unless there was something in it for them But that's another story. Congress also has a pretty decent location on top of everything. Maybe I'm just biased by the sentimental attachment I have to it but I think it's a wonderful hotel and would definitely recommend it. :)",N
372,"You know what? It's been almost a year since I stayed in this hotel, and as time has gone by, I realize I miss it. I was sent to Chicago for a week for work and this hotel was recommended for being relatively centrally located and cheap...and it is indeed both of these things. The style of the hotel could be called ""tired"" by some, but I would call it American Traditional. Wood is dark, ceilings vaulted, etc. I've stayed in the ""Ice Room"" in the W in Hollywood, but I actually enjoyed coming back to the Congress every evening more than I enjoyed the modern ultra-hip vibe. There was something cozy about it, and that's important to me because I travel for work fairly frequently, and often on my own too. The only con was the service. Workers aren't very friendly or helpful, and the room service food is overpriced and downright bad. I went to Panera for breakfast every morning as it is located around the corner. Also, the fact that you had to pay for internet was annoying. You pay by the 24 hours and they are consecutive, meaning if you use it for 10 minutes and then use it for 10 minutes 25 hours later, you pay twice.",N
373,Not a bad place.  Not fancy.  Rooms are old and worn.  But everything worked.  We were comfortable and things were pretty clean.  Great great location.  Was a perfect place for our family to gather.,N
374,"I stayed here several years ago and was not impressed by anything but the location, which is on Michigan avenue and its cheap(er) price.  It was New Year's Day and we were happy and surprised to have found the room.  Though it is far from the main tourist drag up north, it is next to two art museums: the Art Institute and the Museum of Contemporary Photography. It's also close to State Street, and a few blocks from the lake.  Thus the two stars. More recently I went here for a wedding.  Must have been a great cheap deal. I must have stayed here a long time ago, because this place has really gone down from even the basic quality I remembered. The first thing you get to see is a bunch of strikers picketing.  A few people at the reception were grumbling about having to cross that line, and I heard later that was because they were union themselves.  I was told that to cross a picket line is an insult against the strikers and makes a particular political statement. Despite the strike, which apparently has been going for a while (their strike signs looked worn)  the place is operating, but not fully.  There was an escalator going up to the hall that did not work.  There were toilets that did not work and were covered with plastic.  You could tell these items had been not functioning a while.  The place could have been cleaner, maybe it just needed some paint.  The food at the reception was ok, but even in the dimmed lights you could see that even the mashed potatoes had been made carelessly: they were dark and oxidized.   Just a small careless error, a detail, but it was another piece in the puzzle. They could have tried harder. Congress neglects  their building the details and apparently their employees too. Overall, I'd describe the place as worn and depressing.   Someone should buy this place and fix it up; take advantage of its location.  Has potential.  As they say in real estate ""fixer upper"".  Needs some TLC.",N
378,Great location and service!! Freshly baked cookies at check in.,N
379,"Great hotel at the center of Chicago. Easy access to many of the key sites in Chicago. So ideal location. The hotel is relatively inexpensive considering the location. The beds have varying sleep number dials so whatever is your preference in madras, you got it. The rooms are fairly roomy and many of them have good views. The internet is free :-) The breakfast is not included. You can get it at the next door Weber Grill. The breakfast is mediocre and maybe not the highlight of this venue. The hotel is modern and overall very efficient. My only complaint. We tried the valet parking ($49 / night - ouch) and the service is slow and not dependable. I would recommend parking in the parking structure next door. Cheaper and more reliable. Otherwise a really nice hotel.",N
380,"One of the best locations in Chicago, walking distance to many things, and right outside the red line. After being spoiled by 5 star places in the last year, I was not expecting much from a Hilton Garden Inn, but I was pleasantly surprised. The lobby was nicely done, and the front desk was speedy, friendly, and efficient. The rooms were nice sized, with very comfy beds, and clean modern updated bathrooms. They even had a mini fridge and microwave. Our air-conditioning vent was directed right at my face the first night and kept waking me up, but after arranging the curtains and blocking it with a pillow the second night, it was much better. Parking was valet only and was around $40 a night, which is in line with everything else in the area. For the room price, you can't get better, and I would definitely choose to stay here again.",N
381,"I came here with a group of people for a birthday weekend away. We found a deal where we got rooms here for about 150/night which is pretty good for a downtown hotel on a weekend. The rooms were comfortable and clean. The bed was pretty comfy, although I did have to adjust the mattress a bit. I didn't have a great view but my friends had an amazing view from their room. And the staff were super-friendly and very helpful. The location is really what sweetens this hotel. You can walk pretty much anywhere downtown from here (and I did) but the red line is right outside the front door of the hotel so you can get just about anywhere in town. I will definitely stay here again. ETA: I completely forgot! We had a gigantic bathroom in our room which totally makes up for the ""kinda"" city view.",N
382,"Stayed here on a recent trip to Chicago and the location is excellent.  The hotel is right in front of the Red Line, a short hop from the Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier, and Millennium Park.  I actually never used public transit once during my trip and walked everywhere instead. I checked out the gym and it's quite small, but there are a fair number of treadmills there.  The swimming pool was also small, so don't expect to swim laps.  Overall, the facilities aren't bad and much better than nothing. The room I stayed in had 2 queen sized beds and was quite roomy.  Some small complaints that I have are that there is no safe in the room, and there is no bathroom fan. The service was wonderful!  Upon arriving, we used the parking valet and as the bellhop helped us into the lobby, I realized that I had left my wallet in the car.  The bellhop ran outside and chased down the valet, and I had my wallet back within a minute.  I don't normally use valet parking, so this was a very good experience for my first time. If I'm in the Chicago area again in the future, I'll definitely stay here.",N
383,"No rooms at the inn, The Conrad that is. We have a Thursday night benefit (less glamorous than it sounds, it was at the FOP) and the dental show is in town...ugh. So I begin searching for the best deal in town.   Low and behold, here is the Hilton Garden Inn, inches from the Conrad. Great location, awesome service, clean rooms and a comfy bed. No Michigan Avenue views but  nice views from our room. Definitely a great choice right in the mix of things. One negative, thin doors. Be aware if you are a light sleeper.",N
384,"I've stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn at Times Sq and I kinda liked it, so when I came into town with the giant Peepster, I booked this hotel. Great, great location. It was about 4 blocks away from the Rock n Roll McDonalds, which had a lot adjacent that was guarded 24/7 and only costs 35 a day and could take oversized vehicles. There was food everywhere, plus the room had a microwave and fridge [jackpot! ramen night!] I didn't really like the beds, at all, though I don't remember what the beds were like at the one in NYC but these had really uncomfortable duvet covers that were all scratchy, and the beds were weirdly soft, even when I adjusted it to firm. I'm pretty out of touch with my body so it's hard to tell exactly what about it I didn't like, just a kind of dull, all over ache that's probably about 25% the bed's fault and 75% my extremely labor intensive job's fault. Bath and Body works amenities! [I'm such an amenities whore.]",N
385,"These people went out of their way to make our stay great. We drove through the night from DC and arrived much earlier than expected. Mitchell and Hans (and the cleaning staff!) did everything they could and got us in our room by 10 am so we could get some rest before enjoying the city. The room was nice and clean. Great view, nice room amenities. The pool and hot tub looked great, although we didn't have time to use them. The restaurant attached to the hotel (Weber Grill) was fantastic, by far our best meal in Chicago! Hotel is in a fantastic location, within walking distance to almost everything we wanted to see. Parking, a bit pricey, but to be expected in the city.  Great stay for a reasonable price!",N
393,"I was expecting typical Garden Inn service when I stayed here on business, but I was pleasantly surprised. The staff is excellent. Everyone spoke to me and went out of their way to ensure a quality stay. I even got to experience the event staff, as my business was conducted in the hotel's meeting space. The Food & Beverage service is five-star, and the guest room accommodations are top knotch. I will definitely stay here when I return to Chicago. Great location, great property.",N
418,"We enjoyed the Chicago South Loop Hotel quite a bit.  It wasn't the greatest hotel ever, of course, but it wasn't the crap hole that many reviews suggest.  The location is great...yes, it's a little bit away from the main part of downtown but you can drive there in minutes or take a bus up State St.  It's really, really easy.  Plus you can take a 10-minute walk to the train from here.  You can also walk quite easily and quickly to Chinatown.  We were staying on the South Side to go to the White Sox game and it couldn't have been much easier to get around and the proximity to stuff we wanted to do was great.   The service at the hotel was somewhat indifferent but certainly not rude.  When my card did stop working (due to having it near other cards), it was fixed quickly.  The room was quite huge and even had a lounge area in it.  That was really nice.  The bathroom was utilitarian and perfectly fine.  The TV was newer, which was nice.  The room had AC, which helped due to the hot weather.  Overall the hotel is pretty solid; there's a little breakfast joint in there and some other stuff.  It was great not to have to pay for parking.  When we were there we didn't have any issues trying to find a spot.  I would certainly recommend the place.",N
419,"Wow. Worst hotel experience of my entire life. I arrived here around 9:45 on a Tuesday night. I had to be up early the next morning and was just looking for a place to grab dinner, store my stuff, and catch a good nights sleep before a long days of work. Upon arrival (at the self proclaimed 3 star hotel) I was disappointed to find that it was in a not-so-nice part of town. However, I quickly got over the fact because all I was looking for was a bed to sleep on. When I got to my room, changed, and left to grab food, I noticed the door to my hotel room would not lock from the outside. I called the front desk and asked to either be switched to another room or to have someone come fix it. Unfortunately, the handy man didn't arrive until 11:30... which meant I was sitting in my room, awake, foodless, waiting for him to arrive. After he came it took him an hour to fix my door. I wrote an angry letter to hotel management the next day and got the room comped for the night. However, I was pretty upset because I wasn't able to sleep very well, which definitely affected my performance at work the next day. Anyways... all things considered I will probably avoid the Chicago South Loop hotel the next time I'm around... and I recommend everyone else do the same.",N
420,"Dingy, dirty and very poor location... DON'T DO IT!  We chose this hotel b/c it was close to the convention ctr and the pictures looked nice.  Don't fall for it... you'll be seriously disappointed.  It's worth some extra bucks and a short taxi ride to choose another location. The service is non existent.  All the staff we encountered moved at a snail pace and had a serious ""I don't care"" attitude.  Our room key stopped working, we had to wait until the manager got out of a meeting to fix it.  The rest of the desk staff stood around chatting about stuff.  Hello, we're paying customers, interrupt the damn mtg and give us some service. The rooms are dumpy and dirty.  My co-worker checked in to her room to find that someone had urinated in the toilet and didn't flush.   Really?!  There were stains on my bathroom floor and I would call the decor ""contemporary dingy."" The location is ridiculous.  There are no restaurants or bars for blocks... w/ the exception of the sorry restaurant/bar in the hotel.  In both the bar (they call it a lounge... HA) and restaurant, it felt like a bunch of neighborhood friends were hanging out.  The bartenders were chummy with their buddies and didn't give us the time of day.  We ordered one cocktail and two beers.  The bartender brought the cocktail and forgot the beers for almost 20 min.  My co worker went to go ask only to find the bartender singing karaoke.  Good thing his buddies stopped by for some fun!!",N
421,A group of us from Iowa stayed here for our Hawk Game @ Soldier Field (which was perfect) and had no idea what to expect.  Being we were not familiar with Chicago and the price for the room was too good to be true (compared to most in the area).  After reading some of the reviews we were a little nervous. We arrived hours before check in hoping to find parking which was very limited (due to the event) but we lucked out in the parking lot which thankfully was FREE!! Check in went great and the room was as expected.  I am not sure why some of the reviews complained about that- you pay for what you get? If you want luxury and high class you pay for it right? I thought the staff was great...they helped us with directions and check out was super easy.  We would definitely stay here again. Thanks Again!   GO Hawks!,N
422,"Found this hotel online and was not far from where my son is going to school. For the money, this hotel rocks!!!! Beautiful lobby; staff was great and room was clean and very big. I am not a nit picky person so I did not find anything to nit pick about. Maybe if I was staying at a $200 a nite hotel, it would be different. But again, for the money, this hotel can't be beat. We drove from out of town, and the money we saved in parking alone is worth it. There is a bar/lounge, cafe and gift shop. They even have an free internet cafe with hot coffee 24/7.",N
423,"Just stayed up in this hotel for a national conference being held at the McCormick center, the hotel is within walking distance from the convention center and also very close to the 29 bus that leads all the way down to Navy Pier. The room was just OK, it wasn't the nicest room I have stayed in or the worst. Guest services were always nice to us. The room was clean and looked like they were recently updated, but they really need to get HD TV Channels, and for thirty minutes one day the Internet was down. The water pressure in the shower was lacking as was the air conditioning from the unit in the room. Very easy also to get a taxi from this hotel, the only other thing is the restaurants from here were a long walk or short cab ride. One more note- the Internet access is unsecured.",N
424,"This hotel is a solid 3 star SOUTH of everywhere you want to be in Chicago.  That being said, be prepared for transportation needs.  We took our bikes which was way fun and not too far from everywhere in Chicago that you DO want to be.  Service was quite friendly.  No check-ins before 3 pm.  But FREE parking!  Can't beat that downtown.  Rooms were large.  Satellite TV spotty due to weather.  Awesome deep, big bath tub, comfy for two, adding potential to the romantic flare.  Hotel lobby had orange flavored water as a nice touch.  Beds were comfortable.",N
425,"Good news: check in lady was polite, room appeared to be clean, big shower, accessible to downtown Bad news: check out guy was extremely rude, allergic to room, subway system next to window, elevator at front door, and furniture very dated",N
426,"The place was ok... room was huge and the bed was nice! The service was relative rude when we asked to check in earlier than 3 pm (we were there at 2 pm) and they said we had to wait... so we took a 1 hr car ride to come back for a 15 min waiting line for cheeking in... so we werent alone... The parking is free but no1 checks if people from the souring areas use it. We went for a late dinner downtown and went we got back we didnt have parking... I had to wait for 45 min for some random spot to open and I had to rush because they were other 3 cars looking for space!!!!! I went back took a shower watch a bit of TV and then look to the parking lot from the window and one of the cars was still waiting (~3am). We woke up early (I dont sleep much) and the parking lot was almost empty by 9 am.... I wasnt too happy about this... Otherwise, is cheaper than downtown...",N
450,"A very classy place to stay in Chicago.  Friendly staff and an amazing find!  I would definitely recommend this hotel.  Might be out of your price range, but worth checking out since the amenities more than make up for it and they offer some awesome packages.  Worth the splurge if you want to experience Chicago and leave relaxed.",N
451,"went yo farmers market and not worth the effort let alone an admission fee. Thought it was a Farmer's market, hope it is not an indication of there services",N
453,"The Wheeler Mansion is an amazing bed and breakfast and has been such a great asset to the South Loop.  I was truly surprised they would go out of their way to hold a free Farmer's Market every week on their grounds.  The vendors were great, the music was great and a lot of tasty things to eat and buy.  Can't wait to go back and support every week!!  What a wonderful market at a classy venue.",N
456,"The good: - The units are large. The living room was nice. The bed was comfortable. It was good to have a refrigerator and microwave. The bad: - Parking was outrageous (over $50 per night) - Poor water pressure - Although nice to have, the microwave and fridge were scuzzy Things that other people may find good, but I found terrible: - It was chaotic. There were kids running around everywhere and lots and lots of people milling about, mostly waiting in crazy long lines for free cheap alcohol. There must have been a pool, because there were a lot of dripping wet, scantily clad people everywhere. Kind of gross.",N
457,"When I looked for a hotel downtown near navy pier and michigan avenue, the Hilton Embassy Suites kept popping up with pretty good reviews.  I found a price that I could live with in a downtown hotel and it had a free breakfast.  I decided to take a chance. What I got was a corner suite with a lake view.  It was immaculately clean, spacious and away from the noise.  The king bed was so comfortable and I slept through the night for the first time in weeks.  The ""free"" breakfast was not just free, it was darned right awesome.  One line led to an omelet station and home-made egg orders, while another buffet line of eggs, bacon, and pancakes suited several fares.  Fruit, cereal, juices, fresh coffee, donuts and toast and more and it was all free.  THe manager said they served up to 1500 guests a day, so get there early.   BTW, the restaurant manager, Vadym, is fantastic.  He not only sets the tone for the friendliness his staff is known for, he sets the tempo for detail and work ethic.  His staff are constantly patrolling the seating area hoping to help by clearing dishes and whatever they can do to make your stay even better.   We highly recommend the Embassy Suites Lakefront for your next stay.  Keep in mind, there are two embassy suites downtown chicago and many different hotels with the Hilton connection.  But there is only one Hilton Embassy Suites Lakefront with the great breakfast, great staff and manager's reception that others have mentioned.   Truly a gem worth visiting.",N
458,"This review is for the Manager Reception:   Embassy Suites has the best deal in the hotel industry. It is the Manager's Reception. What the Manager's Reception is, is a 2-hour Happy Hour from 5:30-7:30 P.M. With a hotel key, hotel guests have unlimited alcohol beverages at no cost from 5:30-7:30 P.M. plus snacks. The alcohol drinks range from draft Budweiser to Bahama Mamas and Blue Hawaiins (my favorite). All drinks are served by personable bar tenders. And not only are there drinks, there are  snacks. My favorite is the tri-color tortilla chips with salsa (served on certain days).  I rate the Manager Reception 5 stars. If you are having a bad day, by two hours the Manager's Reception should change your bad day into a great night.",N
459,"Came here for a bachelorette party and it more than met our needs.  The rooms were well sized, especially in order to accommodate our entire party.  The biggest bonus areas for this hotel is the cocktail hour and breakfast served in the morning.  Though they give cards for both these times, in our experience none of the bartenders checked for them before serving the beverages, meaning we could get back in line again and again for a new, fun cocktail.  Fabulous!  The breakfast was similar.  It had a great amount of choice, from hot eggs, bacon, pancakes and potatoes, to cereal, breads, muffins, oatmeal and then made-to-order omelettes, as well as biscuits and gravy.  Though, it's important to take note that the made-to-order line can get extremely long, especially on weekends and later in the mornings.  If you don't want to wait, go early on stay during weekdays.   Only complaint here is the noise that can be heard from inside the hotel room.  Because the entire hotel is set up around a large atrium, any activity in the lobby, or any hallway can be heard from inside the rooms.  For a light sleeper, this can cause some issues, so sleepers beware. Otherwise, this hotel was a great deal for all of the perks they offer and somewhere I'd definitely stay again, especially for a girl's night or weekend.",N
460,"First off about my perspective in reviewing this hotel.  I love value and convenience.  I hate lines and crowds.  I am also a fan of Embassy Suites, so I am taking into consideration my stays at other E.S. properties. We stayed here for the final two nights of our family vacation trip, and I picked this hotel for its central location in downtown Chicago, the free breakfast, and the overall price / value compared to other nice hotels in the area. When we arrived it was a little confusing.  After parking in the public parking garage (E.S. does not have its own parking, although you can do valet), and taking the elevator to the Embassy Suites / street level.  Around the corner was the bell / valet counter, and then around the corner from that was another elevator to take up to the lobby level.  Although the atrium is huge, the front desk area is actual somewhat cramped when waiting in a long line to check-in.  Finally, 20-25 minutes after parking we were able to take the third elevator ride up to the room.   The room itself  was spacious and comfortable , with a set-up typical of an Embassy Suites.  It is a huge hotel with a vast atrium in the middle.  Overall this is a nice property.   One of my favorite things about Embassy Suites is the free, made to order breakfast, however, the first morning, going down to breakfast, I was frustrated to see a massive line for the made to order.  So I decided to forego it and just do the buffet.  There was a good selection and the food was fine, although finding a table was a challenge.  My oldest son did wait in line for a omelet -- took over 20 minutes.  The next morning I made it a point to get up early; the line was shorter, but still almost took 15 minutes.  Interesting, also, the helper asked about what sides you wanted, and put them on a plate before the omelet was started, so they were cold before the omelet was finished.  Along the same lines, we went down for the evening reception, and the line for drinks was just as bad as the omelet line  -- not worth it to me, considering the idea of having a drink is to relax -- waiting in line for 15 minutes is not relaxing.  Perhaps the hotel is too big for every thing Embassy Suites promises. A couple other things.  I will never understand why I can pay $59 at a Super 8 and get free wi-fi, but a $250 hotel needs to charge $15 / day -- not per room, but per device (we decided internet could wait).  Also, we heard voices from other rooms while in our room. Overall, the stay was fine, but for what we paid, I did not consider it a great value.",N
461,"I have stayed here a few times and my experience has been mixed. On the plus side, the hotel has a gorgeous lobby, with great views of the city around it.  It feels bright and open, much more so than most cookie cutter Embassy Suites. The rooms (suites) are nice and standard, and staff has been courteous and helpful on all occasions.  The pool that is right off the lobby is nice, as is the jacuzzi. On the minus side, the lines for breakfast can be atrocious, especially on weekend mornings when families stay at the hotel.  I am talking about 20 or 30 minutes buffet lines - forget about ordering a custom breakfast.  You really need to be there at 7 AM to avoid the lines, but that means you need to alter your schedule to account for the hotel's inability to handle a crowd.  The same is true of the evening reception - lines of 15, 20, 30 people to order a drink - frustrating. So I can recommend the hotel, but if the complimentary amenities are a reason for choosing this hotel, be prepared to dedicate extra time.",N
462,"The location for this hotel is perfect- I love staying here when I come to the city. The people who work here are friendly, and are very accomodating. The last time I stayed I arrived two hours before check in and they let me come in early with no fee. On another occasion they kept my luggage safe for me when I got there early and the room wasn't ready. The lobby and rooms are great- I've been here for a romantic getaway and also for a couple of girls trips and the rooms are great for both. The complimentary breakfast and open bar hours are also fabulous perks of this hotel. It is my favorite place to stay before a Bears Game!",N
463,"Going to Chicago on a weekday makes life better. We stayed here and no lines for drinks at the reception. The staff is friendly and the room clean. It is is your typical Embassy Suites and for the money,it works. If you want turn down and chocolates, go to a fancier place.",N
464,"Great visit to the Embassy Suites. The staff were incredibly friendly, the food was quite good, and the room was clean and comfortable. Location is fantastic to downtown as well as the CTA to get around town. Only downside was the ability to hear some noise between rooms. Not overly loud.",N
465,"We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The location was great. It was within walking distance to most everything: Navy Pier, the Magnificent Mile and Pizzeria Uno and Pizzeria Due. We had a beautiful view looking over toward the river and the Wrigley Building. I stay at Embassy Suites whenever I can and find them to be consistent in quality where ever they are. This location was no exception. The rooms were clean and well maintained. The complimentary breakfast was excellent. The hotel staff was helpful and attentive to our needs. We had a wonderful stay.",N
467,"Nice hotel with big comfortable rooms.  Parking is really expensive (~$44 per day to self-park w/o in-and-out priv., ~$53 to valet w/in-and-out priv.), but not out of the ordinary for the area.  The hotel begins on the 5th floor of the building, where the Sky Lobby is located.  Rooms go up onto the higher floors from there.  So, from the street, you should expect 2 elevator rides and a walk across the Sky Lobby no matter where your room is.  The location is very good, near the river, Navy Pier, the Magnificent Mile, Lake Shore Drive, Tribune Tower, NBC Tower, and the Chicago Loop.  They are well within walking distance to most of those places and plenty to do (plus, plenty of places to eat).  I did not take advantage of the bar, the manager's reception, or the breakfast.  However, the breakfast did look pretty busy, so keep that in mind as you read other reviews mentioning it. My only real complaint about the hotel is their keys.  If you insert and remove the key too fast or too slow, it won't work.  It's hard to gauge exactly how to do it right, consistently.  I heard others complain about this, too, on the elevator.  After a long day, when you're really tired, the last thing you want to have to do is fight with your room key.   Other than that, highly recommended.",N
468,"Four solid stars because of the price, customer service, the fact that every room is a suite, they provide free breakfast in the morning, they have free cocktail and snack hour at night and the hotel is in the heart of Chicago.",N
469,"I came here with a group of girls for a bachelorette party.  We met up at the Embassy Suites and hung out here for a while until everyone was ready to head out to the club.  The suite was nice and spacious.  I really liked how there is a covered area for cabs to drop you off and pick you up.  My only complaint about the hotel was that the bathroom in the bar area was closed for renovation which was a pretty big inconvenience.  Also, the smokers in the group were not very happy that they had to go down two sets of elevators to get outside for a cigarette.",N
472,"Good, not great. However, I'm a Hilton Honors member and their WiFi never did work.",N
473,"Very clean hotel, and the breakfast was excellent for a free buffet. However, you better hope that none of you have to stay in the front room right on the atrium.  It's like an echo chamber, and the hotel does not seem to care if people run and yell at all hours of the night.  I stayed Thurs-Sat night, and had to call and complain about the noise both Fri & Sat nights.   Also, on Sunday check out there was only one bellman working.",N
478,Nice place.  You get what you pay for.  Free booze from 6-730.  Free full buffet breakfast all morning long.,N
482,"Wonderful experience.  This is not the most luxury hotel out there, but you definitely get the best value .They offer free breakfast and happy hour drinks.  The interior view is very unique. Rooms are clean and nice.",N
487,"Just returned from a family vacation in Chicago. I have two active teenagers and this hotel served us extremely well.  Great location for a vacation, centrally located to most downtown activities.  The staff was helpfull and responsive to our needs.  Every employee seemed to enjoy thier job.  Breakfast was decent in quality and great in quantity.  Rooms were big and clean, great for a family.  The fold-out couch was just ok for a teenager but would have been very uncomfortable for an adult. The tv's were difficult to operate. Lots of families and lots youth soccer teams enjoyed the hotel so the noise level was high.  Not a place for a quite getaway but fit my needs of a family vacation.",N
501,"Good location, right near Navy Pier. Great view from our room facing the lake. However there was NOTHING fancy about the room, it was the exact one you get at a Country Inn & Suites suite for a lot less. It was weird to have to take an elevator to the lobby, then another to the room. There were kids everywhere. Too many kids, you would think there was a water park in it or something. I'm a Mom myself but this was a kid-free (our own at least) girls trip with 4 of my friends (we all fit in the room fine btw) and I wasn't in the mood to deal with apparently orphaned kids running amok, with parents nowhere in sight. A group of 4 or 5 kids decided to sit on the floor in the hallway  in front of their room 2 doors down from us and hang out. At 10:30 p.m. We went to use the Jacuzzi, it it was full of..you guessed it, kids. More like teenagers but still kids! Also at 10:30 p.m. I called the front desk, who said they would call security and make them leave since kids weren't supposed to be in there. Went back down and there they were. UGH! We never did get to use it, or the narrow tiny pool (also brat filled) Waited FOREVER to get a drink at the manager's reception (didn't mind though since we brought our own drinks from the room, and by the time we got to the front they had been drank.) The drinks were gross, my friends' apple martini was disgusting! And I have never been known to turn one down. I slept through breakfast but my friends said it was good. Nice building and location, but I wouldn't go back.",N
508,"We had a wonderful time here.  My husband, I and our almost two year old son took the train from Kansas City to Chicago.  This hotel was just what we needed to spend 4 days in Chicago.  The hotel itself is pretty.  The room was beautiful.  It had a separate bedroom that can be closed off.  It had a little fridge and a microwave which was perfect for milk and snacks for our little boy.  They also provided a crib.  In the morning, there's a build your own omelet breakfast.  It was really nice.  it's not your typical continental breakfast.  My favorite was the happy hour.  Every night from 5-7 or so, most of the drinks at the bar are free!  Yes! I said free.  You can just lounge around the bar/eating area sipping a cosmpolitan martini munching on some nuts or chips and salsa.  The best part was that this hotel is close to everything.  I mean walking distance to the The Miracle Mile, the Pier(which was awesome)Childrens museum... For the price we paid, we definitely got our moneys worth at this great hotel.  And, would recommend it to anyone staying in Chicgo.",N
518,"At one time or another I've stayed at nearly every major brand hotel in the Loop and this property would rate in the top 20% in terms of staff, value and location. The staff couldn't have been more pleasant, from the front desk to the bell and door folks, they were simply nice people to be around.  The property itself is a good value considering the great location.  The room was clean and nice, not extravagant, but I don't always need extravagant every trip.  Very happy the WiFi worked well, which is not often enough the case everywhere.  Free breakfast was... well free.  As is often the case the guests can descend like wild beasts when free food is involved, so no surprise with the feeding frenzy and it's not the staff's fault it can get crazy in the dining room. (Hint: Rick Bayless's XOCO is one block away if you want a phenomenal breakfast) In short, you're unlikely to find better lodging at this pricepoint downtown.  I'm quite sure I'll make a return visit.",N
519,"I am not *quite* sure how to write this review yet.  My friend had booked us a block of rooms for a GTG we all were having.  There were about 8 rooms used, and I guess they were all supposed to be suites, there were supposed to be refrigerators in the rooms, and there were supposed to be microwaves.  I personally, just got a double room, and I guess nobody else had a suite, either.   And my friend got the paperwork in on time while going through the worst time in her life.  So Hampton Inn and Suites, PLEASE get your act together. All of that being said, there were a lot of great things about the hotel.  The complementary breakfast was comprehensive and wasn't lacking anything.  The rooms were comfortable (slightly small).  It was in a good location.  And when I called down and asked for a fridge for my leftover pizza, they waived the $10 charge for it. I wish I could give a better review because the service was outstanding, but they just didn't earn it on their end for the lack of customer service in the room-booking department.  They needed to hold up their end of the deal.",N
520,"Clean, nice hotel.  Way more than I expect from a Hampton Inn.  But beware, IT IS SO LOUD!!!.  They even give ear-plugs in the hallways to help with the noise. There is a police/fire-station nearby and the sirens blare all night long.  I couldn't take the noise and had to use the ear-plugs.  Other than that, the experience was great.",N
523,"Very clean, comfortable spacious rooms. The hotel has a great small gym which I took advantage of and also a pool that looks very nice although I didn't have an opportunity to go swimming. The best part is that breakfast is included with your stay and you can get a hot beverage any time of day. I will definitely stay here again on my next business trip to Chicago.",N
525,"I recently threw a Bachelorette party here renting a king suite and a joining double room. The suite was perfect for the preparty doing gifts and things. I had about 16 people there and there was plenty of room. The staff was great, very accomodating. The location was awesome and the hotel offers free wireless AND free breakfast. The breakfast was much more then continential.",N
530,Location Location Location and very clean. I love being close to it all and this is about as perfect as you can get. The price was great for the suite we had - great place to stay!,N
546,"Ian!! Congrats you did it again. Total home run, great space, great ambiance and total class act. From the bar to the pump room to the overall atmosphere...favorite new hotel--period. Couple of observations: reminds me of the Gramercy but in white and a little more homey.... . The rooms while awesome (caveat---I was in a suite), do have some of the original features of the Ambassador so the bathrooms are a tad small and there are a few other quirky nuisances.  But a small price to pay for a bad ass experience.",N
547,"** Updated Review ** I wrote a previous review on Trip Advisor about an item of mine that went missing at my stay at Public Hotel. Since then, the hotel has followed up and I thought it was only fair to update my review as well. Mary Beth was kind enough to call me the following day to apologize and make sure that my item was promptly replaced. It was a hugely generous offer and even though it was an unfortunate incident, I'm happy to say that the customer service at least, gets my vote of confidence.",N
548,"We were part of a wedding block.  Let's put it this way, I wouldn't pay full-freight for this place. Pros: 1. Great service.  Guest services responded promptly to all requests. 2. Free Wifi.  I wish every hotel had this. 3. Drinks in the bar were good and we had some small plates which weren't bad. Cons: 1. Place needs like two more elevators.  At least. 2. Walls are paper thin. 3. Everything in the room is a bit ""off"".  One of the lights in the bathroom (not a lot of light to begin with) went out.  Twice.  The bathroom door kept sticking.  They gutted this building and they couldn't replace the bathroom door knobs/hinges? 4. Also (and this may sound strange), but they include a body lotion tube but not a shower gel?  I feel like shower gels are the norm these days so I was surprised to see a bar of soap in the shower. 5. Did I mention they need more elevators? Just an FYI, as noted in the other reviews, the whole lobby basically turns into a club at night on Friday/Saturday.",N

551,Recently traveled to Chicago and decided to stay at this hotel opposed to the Fairmont which is my usual choice. The hotel is recently remodeled and looks wonderful.  The rooms are average size and tastefully decorated.  The hotel staff was prompt and responsive to all my needs. This hotel is located in a great little neighborhood and there were many places within walking distance. I love the restaurant and the food was excellent.  This hotel will definitely be at the top of my list of choices for my next visit to Chicago.,N
552,"3.5 stars for this hotel. I'm rounding to 3. Let me start off by saying I am in love with decor in the lobby and surrounding areas. The all white gives a very clean appearance and looks fantastic with the black accents. If it weren't for that, I'd give the hotel 3 stars. Our hotel room mirrored that, but was a lot more basic (and I mean-A LOT). The bed was comfortable and we had no problems with the TV or air. Our bathtub would not drain which was no good but other than that, very satisfied with our stay.",N
553,"Honestly, public has always been my favorite hotel in Chicago area, I stayed at this place couple times. But this time, I have to give them 1 star, and if I could, I would give them a 0. And I will never stay there again. Here is my story: Me and my boyfriend stayed at public on Tuesday and we checked out on Wednesday and went back to Indiana. When I was home, I found I left my jacket in the room. And we called the hotel, they said nothing was found in my room. But my boyfriend and I both clearly remember we left the jacket on the hanger in the closet! We are pretty sure about this. I was so sad because this is a rare find Chanel jacket which I just purchased in Miami two weeks again and hasn't worn once! And it still has price tag in it, which says 5000 dollars! I don't want to assume the housekeeping people stolen my jacket, but there's no other way I can think of it! And we drove four hours to Chicago that night just want to make sure if we can find back my coat, but the front desk people said they never found it. I guess I just lost it forever. I was so disappointed about that, and this is the worst hotel experience in my whole life. I don't think a decent hotel should expect this kind of things happen. So if you want to stay at this place. Make sure you take care of your belongings. Otherwise, it is gonna disappear forever!",N
554,"I'm just wrapping up a two night stay at Public and I can't say enough great things about this hotel - however I'll try to sum it up below. The Pros: - Amazing Staff. Everyone from the doormen, to the people at the front desk, to the folks delivery room service. They are super nice and super helpful. - The decor is beautiful. I would love for my house to look like this. It modern, tasteful, and looks like something you'd see in the most upscale NY Hotel. - The beds are super comfortable. - The water pressure in the shower is excellent. (Nothing is worse than discovering a hotel with low flow shower heads!) - The happy hour and night life is great. (And this was on a Tue and Wed - The weekends are probably even better.) - You can walk to lots of great restaurants and shopping. - They have bikes that you can borrow - FOR FREE! - Wifi is free and easy to access. The Cons: - None, Zero, Zilch I will definitely be coming back to this hotel.",N
555,"Beautiful hotel with fantastic rooms. However, the TV didn't work the entire three days we were there. Air conditioning was also very flakey (coming in and out for no reason) on the hottest weekend of the year. The morning of check-out, two separate people came to the room before 10 am to ask what time we would be checking out (not to mention the maid coming twice to see if we were out of the room). After telling the two different people that we would be out of the room by 1pm, the manager then called *again to make sure we would be checking out. After paying full price for two nights at the hotel, plus drinks at the bar, plus dinner at the restaurant, we thought we'd earned the right to enjoy our last few hours in the room. Instead, we felt hurried out. When I expressed this to Emilia, the director of the front office, she responded that she was sorry, and had expressed our frustration with her colleagues. No offer for a discount on future stays with them, or even to take the $15 minibar charge off our bill. In a city with a lot of other hotel options, you'd think they'd take every opportunity to build customer loyalty. They definitely fell short, here.",N
556,"I REALLY wanted to write a bad review for this place. Why? Because I would love to go back. Confused? Let me explain. The staff at PUBLIC cares a lot about their guests. It shows in everything they do from check in to check out. One example of this care can be seen while scouring other yelp reviews. They have a staff member who replies to negative reviews and offers to be contacted to talk it over and, I only assume, offer something in the way of compensation with a free stay. This is business 101--please the people who have not been pleased--but is something you rarely see anymore these days. So I was really hoping to have bad things to say in this review so that I could receive such contact and get to go back to PUBLIC for another night. Sadly, my experience was superb all the way through. I booked hotel PUBLIC with my Visa Signature, since it's part of their Signature Luxury Hotel Collection. This was a great idea if you're able, because it means a 2 night stay will come with $100 food/drink credit, complimentary valet parking, breakfast and a late check-out. This will help you go even further in enjoying what PUBLIC has available. Their restaurant, The Pumproom, is a slight revamp of the Chicago classic. Photos in the lower level show the hundreds of powerful people from Chicago's history who would sit down there at ""booth 1"" where they could take calls at the resident phone. Prices were hi, as expected, but food was superb in flavor and presentation and they threw in a couple shotglass sized samples of their gazpacho soup, which was a highlight. They also have ""the library,"" which sports a changing coffee shop/bar, depending on the time of day you make it there. We brought a friend with us to enjoy cocktails there on our second evening and everyone was very pleased. Everyone working there is very kind and seems very sincere. They are able to work in what is obviously a high class environment without being snobby or snooty. Swell folks. The room was comfortable, nice lighting options, great water pressure, considerate housekeeping (even plugged my laptop in for me when they were in there). I hope to go back some day on my own dime, because the PUBLIC hotel is totally worth it.",N
557,"White, White, White!! Love the decor Great staff Great night life in this hotel Good size rooms I agree... The water pressure is excellent. Everything is white and clean You get what you paid for :) However, we had an issue with the air conditioning... But, we just turn it off  and on and done! TV didn't work properly. Will stay here again.",N
558,"Nice swank hotel especially if you can get at a discount. I came to Chicago for one night and got a great deal on Public from Jetsetter.  Located in the middle of everything, within walking distance to Rush Street, shopping, bars, restaurants, and many good things in Chicago.  Cool lobby bar with great drink options in a pimp setting.   The room itself is nice - spacious, decent view, comfy bed albeit on the floor.  It's an older building that was upgraded to make this hotel, but with a nice staff, sexy young bar in the lobby and good enough rooms this does the job quite well.  Plus a quick walk and you're in the heart of good Chicago.",N
559,"There was this big event during the weekend of my stay so the place was packed. The staff was friendly and nice. The restaurant downstairs had great food and divine desserts, and very good coffee.  There was a bar that was quite full the whole period of my stay and a decent selection of wine. I love the room decor and I had a nice view out my window as well. The bathroom was teeny tiny but it was adequate for one person. The room itself was spacious enough and uncluttered, just the way I like it. I think the location is wonderful, the general area was pretty safe. I'd say that the main negative for me was the noise level from outside the room during the day (while cleaning? not sure) but it was fairly quiet at night.",N
560,"The Public is by all accounts an Ian Schrager hotel.  Which is lovely....if you enjoy your bed on the floor and your  bathroom miniscule.  I don't.  So I'm not the perfect Schrager-stayer so to speak. The bed feels like a futon, but the sheets were nice and soft.  Decent TV and an ipod dock.  NO ALARM CLOCK.  Which is annoying.  I want an alarm clock in my room please.  Desk was not very user friendly and definitely not comfortable.  Bathroom was teenie tiny and I ran out of hot water the first day at 7:30am.  Apparently they had water heater issues that day, but they failed to let us know. On the plus side the little coffee bar is fabulous.  Very good lattes.  And the bar is cool and hip and has decent wine.   Overall, I like a little more comfort when I stay away from home.  So I can't say that I loved the Public.",N
561,"Public is a stunning hotel in the best neighborhood in Chicago. The decor is to die for. The hotel was previously The Ambassador hotel and it's face lift to Public was well worth the effort. I stayed over the weekend and received excellent customer service. There are many spaces in the hotel to sit and relax with food, cocktails or coffee, each space more fabulous than the last. On the weekends the place was packed with people going to the restaurant and bars, definitely a see and be seen kind of place. I can't wait to come back and stay again.",N
562,"We stayed in one of the suites for my friends' weddings so that they could have someplace for people to hang out if there wasn't room elsewhere.  The room was nice enough.  The staff was awkward and aloof, maybe a little bit rude, but maybe they were just having a bad moment....The air conditioning was really loud.  There were cords all over the place because the hotel is old and rather than *actually* renovate the hotel, they painted it white.  I rarely interacted with any hotel staff.... Except for the valet attendants... and that is where things got really bad for us.  We parked our car there both at an hourly rate and overnight over the two days that we stayed there (the first night I drove home to the suburbs to be with our baby)s....  I paid for the valet, tipped the attendants who had parked my car waaaay off to the side (of course!) and got home after our stay to find that my brand new car was damaged noticeably in two places--the fender and the bumper.  Mind you, this isn't the 'I didn't notice' kind of damage.  Rather, someone tapped (rather hard) against a wall or another car, and another car skinned my car's rear bumper.  And so begins my conversion from lukewarm guest to horribly dissatisfied guest.   The hotel gave me the number of the valet company and told me not to call that day because the owner, with whom I would need to speak, would be out of the office.  I called the next morning and spoke with Kathy from GP parking who said she would call me back.  Three days later, still no return call, I call Kathy, ask to speak to Tom, the owner, she says that she is actually the person I should talk to and 'why did I wait so long to say anything--and why didn't I say something when I picked the car up from the attendants--and not to say that you would, but you could have had an incident on the way home that caused this damage but you want to blame it on us so that we pay for it.....'  She continued like that, accusing me of lying and being overall incredibly rude, disinterested and insulting about the whole thing.   So I called the hotel.  The ladies at the hotel (first Emelia, then MaryBeth) were nice as pie to me and supposedly did get in touch with their valet company.  By their accounts the valet company conducted a thorough (impartial????) investigation and will not take any responsibility for my vehicle's damage.   I am, absolutely, without a doubt, 100% certain that they did, in fact, damage my car.  And I PAID THEM TO DO IT!  I EVEN TIPPED THEM!!!!!   My friends' Most Expensive Wedding I Ever Paid For As An Attendee/Maid of Honor continues to suck my wallet dry.  The damage most certainly exceeds the cost of my hotel room (and I mentioned we stayed in a suite, right?).  Of course, Public Chicago is not responsible because the hotel hired the horribly rude folk from GP parking to do their valet for them, but they do charge for the valet directly through the hotel.  They didn't even, as a simple gesture, offer to refund the valet fee.  Or any portion of my hotel stay.  Or agree to fire their valet service, which frankly would have been a slightly satisfactory response.....  If they had just told me then and there that they had damaged my car, I would have been okay with it--and I really would have appreciated their honesty.  But they didn't have the decency to do so, and now I hemorrhage more money.  And, did I mention, I absolutely DETEST the institution they call the Public Hotel Chicago????  I do.  I am horribly dissappointed and insulted by the way I was treated.",N
563,"I love staying in new ""concept"" hotels so when Public opened last year, I wanted to check it out. We stayed for two nights and really enjoyed it but it didn't make as big as an impression on us like the Conrad and Palomar did. This is the former Ambassador hotel and Public plays with a lot of the Ambassador style.  This was not a total renovation. Public simply added a few modern touches. Rooms are minimal in style but effective and comfortable. Our room had a very narrow entryway in which a room service tray could barely fit through.  Doors on the closet and bathroom are the originals left over from the Ambassador so they are old and don't close very well.  I love the placement of quirky photos around the room. My biggest complaint with the rooms would have to be the fairly thin walls. If the person in the next room talks slightly above a normal speaking voice be prepared to hear everything. Bathroom was small but had nice clean lines. The bathtub walls were really high for some reason. We ordered their room service, Public Express, for dinner and breakfast. While the dinner was exceptional, breakfast was just okay. Better than Burger King but I've had better at other hotels. The rest of the hotel looks great and the lobby and restaurant are packed on the weekends. Fitness center is very well equipped. But as other people have noted on here, the hallways and especially the elevators are too dark. You can't see which button to push to get to your floor.  Location is nice since it's close to Michigan Avenue but not directly on the busy street.  All the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. So why don't I love it? Like I said, Hotel Palomar and the Conrad ""wow"" me with their style and service. I think Public is going more for an ""understated"" vibe which is good. I guess I like my automatic upgrades for being a Hilton Diamond member @ Conrad. Or I look forward to my wine hour and zebra print robes @ Palomar. It's a hotel. I kind of prefer ""fancy"" not ""understated"".",N
564,"The aesthetics at PUBLIC are great, but I don't think enough (or anything at all) was done to upgrade the infrastructure of the aging building. The under-window air conditioner/heater was noisy: the fan rattled and the compressor made a distinct rumble that carried through the floor to my head on the pillow. It wasn't bad enough that I think it was broken; I think it was just poorly made. The bed and linens were fantastic, and I slept soundly after I turned off the heater. (Luckily the room remained a comfortable temperature anyway.) I was awoken in the morning, though, by a loud sound that I first thought was static from the TV or iPod dock. It turned out to be just the water rushing through the pipes as my neighbor took a shower. My own shower was just above lukewarm, even with the faucet open to full hot. The walls and floors must be pretty thin, as I heard plenty of coughing and footsteps from above and next door. I would normally cover these sounds with the steady white noise of the fan, but the rattly fan was worse in this case. I loved the design of the place, but the fact that they didn't do more to mitigate the age of the building and the resulting flaws would probably keep me from coming back.",N
565,"I walked through the front door of Public (which is actually on Goethe, not on State) and immediately felt like I was in the middle of someone else's wedding or charity ball.  The entire main floor was hopping with hundreds of well-dressed people socializing, drinking and lounging.  Normally, this type of scene at a hotel is represented by a demographic in their mid to late 20s.  Not at Public.  Here, the social club is comprised of many people who are 40+, but still have it going on.  This is clearly the ""it"" place to see and be seen by the non-clubbing club. I checked in at the front desk and the service was very friendly and polite.  The elevator took me to my room where I spent a couple of minutes looking for the card reader slot.  I then realized that there is no slot, you simply have to flash your card in front of the plate on your door and it opens.  That's pretty cool.   Once inside the room, I took a quick look around and was immediately reminded of hotel stays I've had in other locations.  I saw flashes of the Mondrian (Los Angeles) with all the white on white on white hues.  There were hints of The W hotel chain with all the modernistic furniture and black & white photo/art accents.  As many people have said, the aesthetics of this hotel are incredibly appealing, mixing classic old school charm with very contemporary flair. As for the functionality of the rooms, we were less impressed.  We quickly learned that beauty doesn't necessarily mean as much when you realize that the shower is so narrow you can hardly turn around inside of it.  Once you get out of the shower, there are no robes, either.  The bathrooms also have no exhaust fans (or as some refer to them ""privacy fans"").   I needed to iron a shirt and pulled the ironing board out of the closet with the iron.  I then spent the next 7 minutes trying to figure out where to plug-in the iron in a space large enough to accommodate the ironing board.  The places where outlets existed did not afford enough space for the board.  I ended up pulling the ironing board into the bathroom and pressing my shirt next to the toilet.  Yes.  I did this. At one point, my wife and I decided to check out the Library bar next to the lobby.  This is a beautiful lounge with comfy furniture, a blazing fireplace and pretty people everywhere.  The waitresses were all wearing these super skin-tight black dresses with one bright silver zipper down their backs.  While they all looked sexy as hell, I began to feel sorry for them the longer I watched them having to lean in and bend over repeatedly in those very tight and slightly revealing uniforms.   Need ice?  You're in luck if you happen to be on the 8th or 17th floors.  Otherwise, you're getting dressed and going for an elevator ride like I had to do. Granted, it was the middle of January and very dry, but our room was incredibly full of static.  Everything we touched gave us a shock, including our bed linens.  We resorted to turning on the shower in an effort to steam out the static at one point. Later, we realized that because our room was on the 3rd floor and immediately above the main entrance, it gets quite loud.  As cabs pull in and out of the valet and drunken hordes of partygoers are coming and going at all hours of the night  several honking horns and ""whoohoo"" noises easily came into our room after we had fallen asleep.   We decided to order the room service breakfast the next morning and it was delivered quickly in nice brown bags with the Public's branding all over them.  Unfortunately, the delivery guy didn't bring us a slip to sign, so I couldn't add a tip for him.  I was forced to pull out a $20 bill and ask him for change...of course, he only had $7 on him, so he got a 50% tip on delivery.   Don't get me wrong.  This is a very nice hotel worthy of many accolades.  Service is top notch.  They spared no expense making everything beautiful to the eye.  However,  we experienced a few minor inconveniences in our stay that were worth noting here.  I think we'd definitely consider staying here again sometime, especially considering the great rate we received $125/night to be in the Gold Coast and Old Town.",N
566,"Customer service here was exceptional! From the moment we got out the cab, everyone was on their toes ensuring that our stay was comfy and stress free. The white plain but modern rooms were trendy and unique. Although it was close to nothing but white, the furniture around the room made the difference. The bed was so soft and comfy that I didn't want to get up - also because it was 12 degrees outside haha. This hotel looks like it aims for the 25+ young professional crowd, it reminds me of the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas. This is like a mini version in the Windy City and without the casino and bright lights. Love it!",N
567,"I love this hotel!  I'm here for business and found a great deal on their webpage.  It's really nice, without being too fancy.  My room is pretty big and free wi-fi is nice.  The lobby has a really fun vibe and the staff are all really nice, and really helpful - even over the phone; is so refreshing.  For the price, this place is way more fun and easy going then some of the other business hotels in the same price range.  I feel like I'm on vacation, I'm so happy I stumbled upon the PUBLIC Chicago.",N
568,"The Schrager crowd all grown up!  happy to see a more cosmopolitan crowd and less dancing twenty-somethings in the lobby and  hallways upstairs.   Room service from The Pump Room by Jean-Georges is the best room service one can hope for from a hotel. All in all it was a pleasant experience, I enjoyed the residential location as well as the decor and the fact that there is a Jean-Georges outpost on site. Somewhere the tag line ""At PUBLIC, service matters most."" doesn't quite translate successfully.  The staff, although attentive, is not quite there in terms of anticipating a guest's needs.  A birthday cake was delivered without silverware or plates to eat it with.  A quick call to the front desk solved the problem in less than 10 minutes.   I requested said cake too late in the afternoon the day before my arrival so the hotel was not able to accommodate my request.  The concierge was at a loss as well.  I had to suggest to her to see if there were any bakeries near by which could come thru.  I was able to arrange for the cake from 35,000 feet in the air.  I would think that a good concierge would have been able to manage it from less than  1/2 mile away. If the hotel were not to bill itself as a new breed focused on service then I would have given them all 5 stars.  But when they are so focused on selling themselves as a service institution and then come short, I simply cannot be an 100% fan.",N
569,"I really wanted to like this hotel-great location, cool-hip vibe (love Ian Schrager), earnest staff (meaning they TRY), and great rates.  However, number of problems.  First, it's VERY loud-as in very little soundproofing.  Second, you can't order a meal at the bar.  Well, technically you can, but it's a ridiculously limited menu.  When I'm traveling on business by myself, I do NOT want to sit in the dining room and I like the convenience of eating at the hotel if I'm particularly busy.  And it's too bad-I would have easily eaten there every night of my four night stay (as I have been known to do at times) if the food was good, but I never got a chance to try it.  Third, they charge you 18% service for oatmeal to go in their cafe (really???).  Fourth, room service comes in ""to-go"".  That's fine, but don't charge me 18% service for that-at least put it on china.  Or just tell me to go downstairs and pick it up.  Oh yeah, they charge you 18% there too.  I agree with some of the other comments, the staff here is really nice.  But some of the management policies are silly.  And not sure I could overcome the noise issue.  Probably will not stay here again.",N
570,"Public was recommended to me by a couple of friends who recently moved from Chicago.  I was intrigued by the idea of a new Ian Schrager hotel.  They made a great suggestion. Travel Date:  July 2-8, 2012 We were greeted at our car by an eager bellboy.  He quickly packed the luggage cart with the aid of our Echo Limousine driver (recommended).  The common spaces are lovely and well appointed.  At check-in my partner and I were promptly assisted.  The desk clerk noticed I had booked a smokin' hot special online for a regular queen room.  When she saw the height of my partner, 6'3"", she said, ""let's see if we can find something a little bigger.""  She upgraded our room, at no additional cost, to a corner King Deluxe.  We had three large windows, a full walk-in closet and plenty of room for our week long stay.   The building is two blocks from the Lake and in a beautiful Near North neighborhood.  Just a few blocks south is the Rush St and Division St scene.  Good nightlife, restaurants, music and cocktails.  A taxi was always waiting and if you prefer public transportation the Red Line has a station at State/Division.  If you like car service, UBER has fantastic coverage in the downtown area and is never more than a couple of minutes from Public. Pump Room provided a fantastic Fourth of July Dinner for 11 guests at a moment's notice.  They even comped a selection of flatbreads.   Our stay was not without hiccups...  We experienced Chicago's hottest July Fourth in over 100 years.  This caused the satellite receivers to overheat and we lost TV reception for two partial days and one full day.  Upon inquiring about the loss of signal, several options were provided, free movie tickets, free bike rentals or assistance booking other entertainment, spa services & tours.  Our shower head had a leak that sprayed water backwards directly on the wall and ceiling.  It didn't bother me but I figured I'd let them know to avoid future damage to the walls.  They sent a repairman after we left the room for the day and when we returned we had a voice-mail from guest services notifying us of the repair and apologizing for the (nonexistent) inconvenience.   Everyone we encountered was fantastic; great service in Pump Room, fantastic mixologists in both bars, quick room service and helpful guest relations.   The only thing missing is a day spa, of course I knew this when I booked the room.  They partner with a place just down the street but I feel that a Hotel of this caliber should have an in-house facility. I will gladly stay here again.",N
576,"Wow. If zero stars was an option thats what I would have.  I really cant say one good thing about this place except that their food is ok.  If you're looking for a hotel and not just a good restaurant do not stay here.  Being from New York and knowing what Ian Schrager is capable of is clearly not a good thing.  Our expectations were high and this place didnt even come close. The 24 year old staff was completely unhelpful.  In all honestly, you could get a better bathroom at a Holiday Inn.  There are a lot of great hotels in Chicago, don't let a reputation like Schragers lead you away from them.  This hotel was a waste, felt unfinished and was an overall lazy effort.",N
580,"My fianceÃÅ and I have stayed in several Ian Schrager hotels in San Francisco and New York. I thought it'd be hard for any hotel to knock the Clift in SF off thentopmof the charts, but Public does! Great staff, nice big clean rooms makes for a great weekend getaway. My fianceÃÅ and I had a great time here! Having the Pump Room downstairs helps too!",N
581,"From the minute we pulled into the entrance to the time we pulled out, we experienced incredible customer service. Our room was beautiful, unique, white, cool, crisp, hip, trendy, minimalist, soft, and stocked. The sheets and bed were so comfortable that we slept til 10 each day...among other things ;-) Very cool hotel. They really remade this into an instant classic.",N
583,"Trendy hotel, the rooms are pretty no frills they are pushing the minimalist thing here. The Pump Room is the place to be seen at lot of ""beautiful people"". Would stay here again when I am in town, got the room for free with my miles.",N
584,"Room and facilities were fine. Nice area to sit and have coffee in the morning, with good coffee and free WiFi (throughout the hotel, as all hotels should have). But we stayed on a Saturday night, and the whole lobby level is basically a nightclub. Plus, lots of noisy, boozing guests, guests with TVs blaring, etc. If you're a 20-something looking to party and aren't worried a good night's sleep, this place is fine. If you want, as I usually do, a peaceful place to relax and sleep, this ain't it.",N
585,"Well, if there was a rating for less than 1 star, that's what I'd be handing out.  The only redeeming quality seems to be the new bar in the Pump Room. I live one block from the hotel and have used the hotel (when it was the Ambassador) as my 'guest room'.  Well, this time I stayed at the hotel and allowed my guests to use my condo.  OH MY GOD!!!!  I'm so glad I did not let my guests stay at the hotel.  I would have been mortified.  I've not stayed at the hotel since it switched from the Ambassador.  I now can say 'I remember this place when it was a good hotel"".  Other than some cool lighting, the rooms are nothing more than cheap IKEA furniture.  There are no coffee makers in the room.  If you want coffee before 0630, you will be rudely told by the front desk young lady that you can walk over to Starbucks.  It's just over two blocks away.  A very easy walk however who the hell wants to do that at 0500???????  The staff is rude.  In general, one is made to feel that staff is being bothered by one's presence.  In fact, I think they thought they're doing me a favor by staying at their hotel. Public has managed to take what was a magnificent hotel with great customer service and turn it into nothing more that a cool looking Day Inn Motel or Hotel 6.",N
586,Their Greek Yogurt is to-die-for. I'm craving it already. And the ambiance is truly fabulous.,N
588,"Wow.  We stayed here last summer while it was under renovation and were pretty disappointed.  What a difference a year makes.  Now the combination of the great location, great staff and great new look make this a place to come back to.",N
592,Absolutely love Public Chicago...BTW the best morning coffee ever...Stayed 3x in the last 2 months...excellent service,N
593,"I was initially excited about this hotel, but after staying here a couple of nights, I was disappointed. We had a 2 room suite, and while the rooms were large, the bathroom  was tiny for the size of the suite, but it had two walk-in closets. Who needs that? Go figure. Also, if you drink coffee, there is no coffee maker in the room, forcing you to order room service at $7-9 dollars a pot. No hair  dryer in the room, and minimal toiletries. They didn't even replace them the next day. We had requested a room early on the highest floor and they gave us one on the 6th. It has 17 stories, I believe. Also there is not even any complimentary coffee in the lobby. I went to the bar area to buy some. $3.50 a cup! I just went and got some down the street at Starbucks. Also, no exhaust fans in the rooms. On, the positive side, the lobby and Pump Room were renovated well, and full of trendy people on Friday and Saturday night. The staff was nice and efficient, good customer service for the most part. The drink prices are on the high side, even for Chicago. Would I stay here again? No, there are much better places in Chicago.",N
595,"Upon entering the hotel, I knew that I'd found my home away from home. It wins the prize for best lobby- you'll actually want to hang out there and with rooms decorated in creams and whites, I easily conjured heavenly and celestial images. The express lunch offerings are genius- I recommend the beef brisket sandwich. My husband declared that the morning coffee offered in the library is the best he's ever tasted. The freshly baked pastries, specifically the blueberry muffin, is a must for getting your day started. The gym, though small, is well-appointed and had everything I  needed.  The staff is warm, friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a great location nestled in a pristine residential area but close to the beach, and in walking distance to the Magnificent Mile, Millennium Park and the action on State Street. If you're looking for a fun yet relaxing place to stay where you'll feel comfortable but not miss any of the Chicago's energy, stay at the Public Chicago. Wins the prize for best lobby- you'll actually want to hang out in it.",N
596,I come up to Chicago about once a month to see my girlfriend and tend to stay at a different hotel everytime i visit. So when it came to NYE I thought why not pick a new hotel and decided on Public Chicago. My gf and I were enamored with the place from the minute we got out of our cab. The  guys working outside to the clerks working the check in were very hospitable and friendly. We both loved the decor of our room. What's also nice is the hotel is near rush and division and not that far from Michigan Ave. Next time I'm in Chicago I will definitely stay here again.,N
598,"Many positives to this hotel.  The service was great here, the rooms large, nice fitness room, great location, views, safe area to walk around at night (woman travelling alone, so very important).   The room was modern and took a bit getting used to with the very low bed and more austere deck chair, but ended up being pretty comfortable. While quite spacious as far as square footage, the area for clothing was tight, so would have been difficult with more than one person.   As often happens in the older hotels, the bathroom also was tight, small shower and very little counter space for hair drying make up application, etc.  Net is I would definitely stay here again as a single, but would look for something with more clothing and bath space if travelling with my husband.",N
600,"This was a great hotel.  They let me check in at 6am and they even upgraded my room.  I stayed here for 4 days and I got cookies every morning and they have all the amenities you need.  It is close to public transit and is nearby shops, restaurants and everything else in downtown.  They have a nice somewhat-rooftop deck with a pool (massive spiders on the rails on the steps up)  I would of given them a few stars off for the spiders but the hospitality here was next to none.  I will stay here again! BTW parking is $33 a day",N
601,"So I live just 12 miles North of here in Evanston, but decided to stay at a hotel off Magnificent Mile so I could be close to a conference a few blocks away. Pros: * Location (a few blocks from Ohio St. Beach; a few blocks from Michigan Ave.) * Relatively cheap for a brand name hotel close to Magnificent Mile * Good quality pillows * Cute (gimmick-y) chocolate chip cookie upon arrival Cons: * Unreliable elevators. At any given time, only 2 out of the 5 elevators will be functioning (sometimes only 1 at a time!). I've seen people waiting for 15+ minutes on the ground floor waiting for the elevator. I waited 5 minutes to catch the elevator from the 6th floor going down. This is unacceptable. * Spotty wi-fi. I paid to get wi-fi and not some trash that loses connectivity every few hours even though all my devices still say 'connected'. * Under-stocked hotel bar in lobby. It was my birthday and a colleague of mine wanted to buy me a drink--just about everything I wanted seemed out of reach given the supply here. TL;DR - Cheap given its location, but I wouldn't come back.",N
602,"If I am ever in Chicago again, I definitely will stay here. Our room was clean, comfortable and inviting. Every staff member was professional. Carolyn on the cleaning staff let us use the staff elevator when we mentioned that there were 3 full elevators that stopped on our floor and we had been waiting for about 10 minutes! I thought that was superb customer service. The location is very close to Michigan Ave and certainly within walking distance to Mag Mile.",N
603,"I would give this hotel a 3.5. Having visited Chicago many times and having stayed in several similar hotels, this offered a larger room than we usually have in Chicago. The location is near pretty much everything downtown and has two bus stops within a block. My complaint would be that they came by to service the room at 8:45 am. Naturally, being on a trip for leisure, we were not out of the room at this time, but didnt have the do not disturb on the door because we were planning to be out by 10. Unfortunately because we were not ready for the room to be serviced at 8:45, it was not cleaned! This happened two days in a row. It just seems senseless to me to not plan to clean rooms that will remain occupied for a few more days later than 8:45. I didnt have any of the issues with the televisions (big flat screen in our room) or elevators (fast and always available). I would definitely stay here again, but would have had a better experience if the room cleaning had been different.",N
604,"Parking: totally sucks! self-parking overnight is $45. The elevator/garage area is not very clean and is obvious that it's not been attended to.. No A/C, paint chipping, not a good look! Check-in: Staff was very pleasant and it was very easy and quick. Room: Very small! There is a small closet door that kept getting stuck- and with it stuck, you can't open the front door, so it was very frustrating.  Room was clean overall, but bathroom can use some updating. Also, the A/C / heater unit is extremely loud.. I kept waking up through the night when it turned on. Lounge: there's no lounge here. Business center: You can take the stairs down to the business center from the  lobby. OR you can take the elevator down, then take the stairs up to the business center. For someone traveling with a suitcase, I find it annoying that it's not on a floor where it has ready-elevator access on the same floor.  Not to mention that it costs to use the computer and to print; and the printer-on software wasn't functioning. Breakfast: It's one of the better breakfasts I've had! Eggs, potatoes, AWESOME sausages, fresh fruit, coffee, the usual. But the quality is much better than many other hotel breakfast buffets. I will not likely stay here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to avoid it either.",N
605,"Nice hotel for a conference. We stay there every summer.  They've updated the rooms and lobby over the past couple of years.  It's in a great location, central to anything you might want to see and do in your free time.  And the cookies are good :-) Staff is really great too!",N
606,"I did this place last week as a little overnight get away. I also did not know that they damn restaurant show was in town as well and half the show was booked in that hotel. Anyways, it's in a fantastic location and everyone I dealt with at the hotel was extrememly nice and helpful. It was a horribly rainy day when we arrived, but the lobby was spotless and fresh smelling. We were checked in quickly and got our free cookies... WOOHOO!! (Got one later too!) The room was spotless with a great view. Extememly quiet and the bed was like a cloud. So much that I took an quick hour nap and forgot who I was... or was that the Jameson...  Up, out and on the town to the Cubs game for an awesome night and wrapped it up with a free breakfast in the hotel the following morning. Again, good tasting, clean, plenty of staff and friendly!",N
607,"Good price in a great location (set back from Michigan Ave with easy access to it) with cookies when you check in. Not a whole lot else a gal could ask for! Room was spacious and tidy, and the bed was comfortable. The shower was also great and service was helpful when needed. Hotel has also recently been remodeled which is nice. The lobby has ample seating and a cozy feel. Breakfast is not included(no surprises here) but there is an Einstein's in the lobby if you need to grab a quick bagel or a coffee (though there is a coffee maker in the room as well).",N
608,"The Doubletree Magnificent Mile is exceptional! Our room was comfortable with a great view. We were within walking distance to Navy Pier, Michigan Ave, Millenium Park, lots of places to eat & drink...  The staff was extremely friendly and efficient, our son is a big fan on Pablo. Only drawback, free wifi in lobby only, slow elevators and front driveway construction was a bit of a nuisance. Highly recommend!",N
609,Nice hotel in the right location. They are currently doing some renovations but I didn't feel like it got in my way at all. Try Timothy O'Toole's Irish Pub across the street for some really good bar food.,N
610,"A friend and I stayed here on a recent vacation to Chicago.  As it was our first time in the city, we were most concerned with finding a hotel centrally located to many of the Chicago tourist attractions, as we were not renting a car. Not only is the Doubletree in a great location, but the staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and the rooms were nearly everything we could have hoped for.  The only thing missing in the room was a fridge (what is one to do with all that left over deep dish pizza?!?!).   The hotel is a 5 minute walk to Michigan Ave (shopping, restaurants, etc) and a 10 minute walk to the train station.  Also within walking distance (bring your walking shoes) are the Chicago River, Millennium Park, Grant Park, The Art Institute & Willis Tower. Although check in is at 3pm, we were allowed to check in at 1:45pm and were given some delicious chocolate chip cookies!   The room was cleaned nicely every day and when I requested a firmer pillow, the maid service brought not 1, but 2 pillows.  The concierge staff was helpful when it came time for dining and public transit recommendations. If I ever happen to visit Chicago in the future, I will definitely consider staying at the Doubletree Magnificent Mile.",N
611,"Fresh Cookies Daily!!! I am surprisingly satisfied with the Double Tree... Yes, its an older hotel and its not the fanciest nor is it the cutest little boutique hotel, but its functional and clean. - Check in and Check out... done with ease - Fresh and warm cookies every day! (you just have to ask for them at the check in desk) - Comfy and clean bed - Clean Room - Crabtree & Evelyn Toiletries (One of my faves!) - About 4 short walking blocks to Michigan Avenue - Hotel towncar ($45 to airport), which was cheaper than the $55 flat cab rate - Super friendly staff. Always had smiles.",N
612,"My best friend hates to fly...She even hates it more when the flight lasts more than two hours. A flight to Chicago for us was about 4. She decided to go around this by booking us on a red-eye out, hoping she could pass out and wake up refreshed in Chicago....Perfect plan, except..... Our plane touched down in Chicago at 5:45am...Most hotels don't let you check in until 3pm. This was going to be interesting. We arrived at Doubletree shortly after and were greeted by the front desk person...Or maybe ""greeted"" is too generous. I'm pretty sure he kinda just nodded. Hmmm. We asked if there was anyway to check in early but he explained that they were completely booked solid and he didn't have anything available. I asked if we could get a room once people started checking out and he told me, ""I don't know, you're going to have to get with the first shift about that"" Huh? I don't speak hotel lingo, but I'm no idiot. He basically said, ""I don't care, it's not my problem but the next shift might care and want to fix your problem"" Whatever. We checked our bags and hit the pavement. Great location....comfy beds....and cookies....Einstein Bagels downstairs with my favorite coffee.....Pluses! I couldn't 4 star this joint because of the busted elevator, or maybe it wasn't busted but there was only one that worked at any given time....took forever.....sardine can style every ride no matter what time of day or night... And of course the douchey night audit guy we met our first morning there...what a miserable little person. If you can avoid this d-bag and get lucky with the elevator, I would recommend this property.",N
613,"Overall its a decent hotel. The advantages are great Hilton family services, very comfy beds, free DT cookies, and the hotel restaurant was very good. The disadvantages are they charge for WiFi, bad HVAC system, funny smell in the hallways and really slow elevators. I also found it to be a loud hotel since they didn't have thick enough walls or good enough windows.",N
614,"As others have mentioned, warm chocolate cookies upon check-in were delicious! A great treat after a long flight from the west coast to Chicago. Great location. Walking distance to Navy Pier and to Magnificent Mile. I got a good deal from priceline but unfortunately, we got a room on the 3rd floor with basically no view. Beds and pillows were very comfortable! Room was cleaned everyday with no issues. Sucks there is no free wifi in the rooms but there is AT&T wifi available as well as free wifi down in the lounge. Didn't use the gym but the equipment looked new. Overall a pleasant stay for our trip to Chicago.",N
616,"Stayed for a week for biz and pleasure.  As others have said, it couldn't be better located, within walking distance to shopping, sites, and restaurants. Housekeeping staff were fantastic, and always had my room cleaned and enjoyable to return to after sightseeing.   Check-in/out was easy, though they did accidentally give me somebody else's bill under the door along with my own.  Initially reading it I was thinking I'd been doubled charged for a couple days of my stay, but then realized it was under another name.  Front desk quickly resolved it when I walked it down.   Front desk staff were very personable and professional. The rooms are well-appointed.   I would only ask for two considerations: 1) wi-fi shouldn't be based ""per device.""  I signed up on my iphone to access email while on my bed, and then when I went to use my laptop to complete some work I became aware that I had to repurchase wi-fi for that, and, if I chose to, again for my IPad.  That would be $30 for the same person.  I'm sure there are some couples out there, too, that wouldn't want to have to pay twice to obtain their emails on different phones.  You could charge a room rate, and let it go at that.  Also, as another reviewer said -- what to do with leftovers from the fantastic restaurants, including the hotel's own?  The pressure sensitive mini-bar essentially eliminates the option of taking a soda or snacks out of the mini-bar to put something in (leftover pizza, dessert, my own bottled water, whatever).   I also had a problem with my room phone sometime after day 2 -- no dial tone and couldn't be used.  I ended up needing to call the front desk for something and had to use my own phone.  Told them while I spoke about the other issue that my room phone wasn't making calls, but they didn't send anybody.  A night later, I had to call the main desk via my cell to get connected to room service, and I mentioned again I was calling because my room phone wasn't letting me make calls; no action. One other disappointment: the fitness center.  Several pieces of cardio but only 1 leg option and a multi-function piece.  If somebody else was doing their workout when you came in (as happened several times), you're stuck with cardio.  I actually found a gym a couple blocks away that had more equipment and offered a 6 session pass so that I could get in the sessions I needed.  One plus though, the Doubletree fitness center is open 24 hours -- many hotels arbitrarily close at 10 or 11p.  Still, if a good workout is important during your stay, consider other locations. That said, it was affordable, even inclusive of a holiday weekend.  My stay averaged $160.  I had considered the Intercontinental two blocks away, but that was $75 per night more...may have been somewhat better appointed according to a couple biz colleagues, but why pay so much more if you can have an overall good experience for significantly less?  And cookies, too. =)",N
618,"Stayed here for a small/mid-sized professional conference.  Our room rate was secured at $99 with discounted parking and free wifi.  For the price and location, you couldn't beat it.  I ended up driving to the city and the hotel was easy to find, parking was convenient.  Bed was comfy, pillows were good, concierge was very helpful.  The room temp was easy to control (but the a/c was loud).  Walkable for many attractions and train.",N
632,"Very nice hotel! Friendly people, an extremely comfortable bed and yes, the pillows were awesome! Supposedly they have free internet in the lobby???I wasn't there for business, so I didn't need it. Very nice work out room. Awesome restaurants nearby (check out the Armenian one and the bakery on Illinois near navy pier). Great price, 75/night! Concierge was very helpful and the coffee in the room was very good! No complaints, we will be back!",N
645,"I've never actually stayed in this hotel. However, I stayed at a Doubletree before in Austin, and really liked their cookies. So when I see a Doubletree in the Chi i decide to ask if I could get some cookies, and they were super nice. They gave us one for each of us (3) no charge. So 5 stars for that cuz those cookies are fucking incredible.",N
664,"I am not kidding...every single person that we encountered at this hotel that worked there from the front desk, to maintenance to housekeeping were so friendly and greeted us with a smile!  That alone to me deserves 5 stars! I am all about great service and this hotel went above and beyond with it for sure! My hubby and I and another couple stayed here for a night on the town visit and we enjoyed our stay for sure!  Our room was clean and well kept!  The location is great.  We usually take the El to the city, and its about a mile from the Clark/Lake blue line station...I suggest you just walk it!  Right by the wonderful shopping on State street and the best part....GARRETTS POPCORN!  They have a flippin' vent to blow out their delicious popcorn smells to lure you in...sneak sneaky..but it works!   The hotel has a decent sized pool...not sure if they have a whirlpool, we did not see one.  The fitness center is nicely sized as well.  The location is right by several restauarants and a short walk/cab ride to even more! Downstairs their is the Viand Restaurant/Bar and there is a Starbucks and a little market for juice, snacks, sodas, etc. If you want to be in a great location with excellent service then this is the hotel for you!",N
665,"So...for this review I decided to wait and see if I was less irritated and my memories of a wonderful night were more blurred by time. Not going to happen apparently. This review should begin with me finding a great deal at this hotel, one within walking distance of an L stop, Navy Pier, and super close to my dinner date destination. I made reservations, gave a credit card number and everything. In preparation for my romantic weekend, I called the hotel to ask about parking and other random questions. I got all the answers I needed from a super helpful desk attendant and gave a rave YELP tip accordingly. Fast forward to the actual weekend. We parked in the adjoining parking garage, no breaks on price even though you're staying with the connected hotel, at 9AM and started our day around town. After trekking our butts around all day, we finally got to the hotel and started to check in. Since this was a surprise for the bf, I was in charge. Let me take this chance to say they checked me in as the wrong person. They took my name, double checked that with my ID and charged my card. They said they'd put a ""hold"" on my card until the next morning when the bill was settled, but online banking and handy text alerts let me know they charged my card 2 minutes after checking me into my room. The odd check-in procedure where they welcomed me back (I'd never stayed there before), tried to have a reservation for one (when there were clearly two of us; I said we were celebrating a late Valentine's for God sake) and looked down right confused when I said I'd only be staying for one night, should have tipped me off, but I was ready to take off my boots and sit the f*ck down. The person it should have tipped off was the desk attendant checking me in. Regardless, they produced two keys for an amazing room. The satisfaction on my bf's face alone was worth the hassle, so far. We got ready for dinner, the concierge called us a cab and we were out for the night. Fast forward to 1AM. The bf and I return from the best steak dinner and drinks we've had in forever, we're a little tipsy and ready to pass out, snuggle style. This hotel uses keys to operate the elevator, safety first, hell ya. So we use our keys and get to our floor. (Note: the keys work). We get to our room and try my key. Doesn't work. Maybe I'm more intoxicated than I thought. Try my bf's. Also doesn't work. Flabbergasted and quickly sobering up, riding down to the lobby. After a bit of chatting with the attendants, we find out there was a mistake and they checked me in as the wrong person so they'd have to CHECK MY ID to give me new keys to the room. Security is one thing, but YOU let me into your hotel, charged MY card and have ALL of my things in your room, which I can't access because of YOUR mistake. A few weird looks from the staff and two new keys later, we were back in our room. They slipped the bill under the door sometime in the morning and apparently that meant we were checked out. Though that was not apparent to me, so I spent 10 minutes waiting in line to check out, only to have them look at me like I had five heads. The bottom line: parking is super expensive (9am Friday to 2pm Sat = $146) and super convenient for the hotel. The hotel is beautiful and has a decent location,  but the customer service leaves something to be desired.",N
666,"Stayed here on my anniversary.  Got a room with a king sized bed on the 17th??? floor. Love the close proximity to the Mag-Mile.  Love the free wi-fi as opposed to the Hilton, which charges you on a timer.   Super clean... control your own A.C.  Modern and with flat screen tv's.  Pull out couch was clean.  Spacious.   This place didn't have a personalized kiosk like other hotels, but it didn't matter because sometimes those kiosks aren't all that helpful anyway.   The only downside was something kind of funny.  The bathrooms don't have a fan.  Haha.   Tell the wifey, to wait it out if you drop a deuce...",N
667,We love our hotel neighbors! The staff is always friendly and great. Come visit Viand and the Courtyard!,N
668,"This is my default hotel property when I visit Chicago.  One block from the Northwestern University Med Center office I do business with, this property works great for me as a business traveler. Around the corner are several good restaurants:  my personal fave for an early dinner, Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBq (3-6 p.m. food and bev happy hour.  Check it out.)  For breakfast, West Egg is just down the street (the huevos rancheros...real live chorizo.  Yum).  Three blocks away is the Purple Pig wine and tapas bar. BUT WAIT... This Courtyard has what no other Courtyard has, in my extensive experience.  Their restaurant, Viand, is really...really...good.  The first time I tried it (out of necessity...sorry Jerry), I was knocked out.  Food was great.  Nicely outfitted beer and wine selection.  Quiet.  Sports playing on the tube.  DUDE!  Breakfast is great too.  The coffee is bold, unlike most ""institutional"" blends.  Last visit, I had the eggs benedict.  Hollandaise was a little citrus-y but didn't detract. This is a great value in my experience.  Plus, the manager, Jerry, writes follow-up emails.  Dig that.",N
669,"First time I have stayed at this location and would return in a heart beat.  The service and the room quality was outstanding.  Neal, the concierge, recommended and great breakfast spot.  A Starbuck's is attached to the location and an Argo Tea shop is right around the corner. Centrally located to all the shopping on Michigan Ave.  Great location.",N
670,"why do i give it five stars, its not a five star hotel but the service, clean comfortable rooms and the location was perfect for me and my family. my room was more like a suite, kids room was smaller. the staff are extremely polite and friendly great place to stay.",N
671,"We picked this place for our one-year wedding anniversary, mainly because we're cheap and wanted to use my husband's points and Gold status to our advantage. I noted in the reservations what we were celebrating because I'm a glutton for free stuff- I can't help it! Everyone loves an anniversary...! Our check-in was smooth and they could not have been friendlier. I wish I remembered the names of the people we worked with, because they hooked us up with a room on the 23rd floor and a lake view, and when we got back from our night out on Friday, we found the front desk staff had sent up a really sweet card and piece of cake, congratulating us. So awesome! The attached Starbucks was super handy, the rooms were small but comfortable and we were central to everywhere we wanted to go- everything was a short walk away. One hiccup to our stay was housekeeping, we were gone Saturday from 10 am- 4:30 pm, and our room wasn't touched. They got us fresh towels as soon as we asked, and it's not like I make my bed at home, so this was a minor issue. Also, they had charged us for parking ($42 a day, W.T.F!!!!) even though we flew down. Whatevs, the cranky Sunday front desk woman eventually took care of the charge... she also messed up our late check out, but since I'm so kind and flexible, it wasn't an issue ;) This place is no frills and not cheap if you don't have points, but it seems reasonable enough for the location.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",N
672,"Extremely nice hotel with a great staff! The only drawback and the hotel cannot help this are the constant sirens. There is a hospital nearby so any hotel in the area will have the same problem. The rooms were not as big as I thought they would be but the view was gorgeous. The lobby was really small. For 220.00 a night you would hope for a huge bar, big restaurant and all of that but things were just a little smaller compared to the Marriott down the road. I would recommend the hotel but be weary of the sirens.",N
673,"Was in town for a week for a convention and decided to stay here primarily to build up my Marriot points.  I was very happy with my stay here.  It's very nice to be able to walk a block west and enjoy the Michigan Ave. shopping.  It's also a very short walk from one of my favorite places, Corner Bakery.  The rooms were very spacious (no different from any other big-city downtown Marriott) and the staff was incredibly helpful.  I bought a few groceries at the nearby Whole Foods and realized while I was there that my room did not have a refrigerator.  I called the front desk and they were able place one in my room before I walked back!  Even better, as soon as I walked into the lobby the concierge said, ""Mr. Etim, you'll find the refrigerator you requested next to the television.""  Take a bow. The attached restaurant, Viand, was okay - the eggs and sausage were a little pricy compared to other restaurants a few blocks away.  Will definitely consider this place for a possible vacation stay.",N
674,"Was here from Thursday - Sunday this past week and the service staff were outstanding.  They were very helpful in checking our baggage because we arrived early as well as checking them when we checked out early to travel the town without lugging everything around with us.  Wish we could've had a room that wasn't directly across from the elevator, but that's how things go sometimes, definitely not worth taking a star away.  The hotel was very clean and what little time we did spend in there, it was very comfortable and relaxing.  Great location as well.  Would definitely stay there again.",N
675,"Jerry K. wrote and offered apologies for my bad time at the Marriott. I have great respect for that!  That's class, Jerry!  Thank you for taking the time.",N
676,"We treated ourselves (for a change) to a centrally located hotel in Chicago this past weekend.  We chose the Courtyard Marriott because it is relatively affordable for Chicago and it's known brand name.  They offered a military discount which was great.  We paid for parking (pretty common in the big cities) and chose to self-park, which was entertaining as the garage was extremely tiny! The staff was very nice and helpful.  The room was big and very clean and comfortable.  We had a nice view as we were up pretty high.  It wasn't noisy in the hotel and the beds were heavenly.  Plus, they get an A+ for having curtains that actually close all the way over the windows! My only complaint was that there was no mini fridge, which was a bummer since we had a lot of leftovers we wanted to eat for lunch the next day. All in all, this was a great hotel and in a really perfect location.  A short walk over to Rush, Navy Pier, the river, downtown, and the Red Line.",N
677,I'm a big fan of Courtyard properties for providing top-notch service without being as pricey as say a full service Marriott.  This one ups the ante thanks to their position just off the Magnificent Mile.  Rooms have been recently renovated and they're nice and comfy.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  And free Wi-Fi!,N
678,"Great location for our New Years Eve stay (2 days). Michigan Avenue a 15 second walk away. Navy Pier 3 blocks away. Garrett Popcorn right next door. I even noted a Saki bar across the street. The pool (10th floor) is one of those ""why even have a pool if it is this size""? A Starbucks in the lobby...but I recommend better coffee at half the price at the Dunkin Donuts across the street. Not much of a view in our room (could see a slice of Michigan Avenue). Went with the larger size suite...which worked out well as we had 7 (2 were the grandkids) in the room.",N
679,"Excellent location! And when I mean good I mean good. It is 2 doors down from the very famous very addicting Garrets Popcorn! Staff was very friendly. we stayed over New Years Eve weekend. I think the regular Valet/door man guy was on vacation. The service we got Saturday and Sunday, was not that great. Paid $42.00 dollars a day to park, and they would not go get our car to warm up early, and when we pulled up to the hotel, we never had anyone come out to get our car. But on Monday the day we left, Neil was there, and he was friendly and over eager to help us. So, I think he was on vacation. Hotel was clean, easy to get a round. I would stay there again.",N
680,"When I stayed there, I was surrounded by smoke. I couldn't leave the hotel without a line up of smokers blowing their smoke in my face. They set up a little cafe and the other guests light up next to the door, sitting down and puffing away. I tried to sneak out the starbucks side entrance, and that was next to their official smoking area and eqqually bad. I knew I had to worry about air quality in Chicago, I just didn't know it would be from my hotel!",N
690,"Good location with good amenities. Service was very attentitive. Restaurant menu for breakfast a bit boring. The room was nice, 24 th floor in the corner.",N
698,"Took step-daughter and her friends downtown for a night at Navy Pier, Willis Tower, etc.  Got them a room here adjoining ours - staff was friendly and accommodating.  They asked her name and age, sent up a nice piece of cake, card and drinks with their compliments!  That was very nice, not expected - everything exceeded our expectations, thank you!",N
714,"Pluses: * Flavored water and cookies in the lobby * The spa was on our floor (4th), just down the hall * A great, very firm mattress * Seriously light blocking shade plus drapes * Fluffy robes in the big closet * Starbucks coffee for the coffeemaker in the room * Recycling can and regular trash can NOTE: Spa Ritual was the BEST part of the pluses!!  Manis, pedis, facials, massages, waxing and more in the spa (or in your room!).  Ask for Lisa - the awesome esthetician! Minuses: * Small and lumpy pillows on the beds * No fridge * Low water pressure in the shower * Double shower head was stuck so it wouldn't adjust to just one on (and maybe have stronger pressure) This hotel is close to so many things, that even with the negatives it's a great place to stay!",N
715,"I had a pleasant, albeit short stay at this Westin.  Keeping up with trend of what appears to be a huge amount of hotels that sink money in the lobby but not the rooms, this Westin falls in line.  The lobby is nice - strangely rectangular - but in good condition.  The room was fine - in need of a facelift I think.  My in-room wifi did not work at all. The heavenly bed is reason enough to stay at a Westin.  The staff was very friendly here. For business purposes, I think the Westin Chicago River North is a more convenient location.  This Westin was in a great area though - near beautiful shops and restaurants - perfect for tourists.",N
716,"GREAT location and awesome service.  Close to the best shops and taxi cabs are plentiful. The bad: -rooms are a bit dated for the price I paid -I woke up in the early AM b/c the next room I was next to was partaking in adult activities.  Then I proceeded to listen to the conversation after wards, and not because I'm nosy, but b/c THE WALLS ARE PAPER THIN!",N
717,"First the Hotel's positive attributes: The location is second to none; it's across the street from the Hancock Tower on the northern periphery of the Magnificent Mile and the southern edge of the Gold Coast; it's in the city's shopping district and near landmark destinations; and it's a little over three blocks away from the picturesque western shore of Lake Michigan and has spectacular room views of Michigan Avenue. Where the hotel fails: they try to come across like a boutique hotel, but are really just a Marriott-type hotel in knock off polyester boutique clothing; the walls are tissue paper thin and everything said can be heard; the doors slam even when you try to close them gently; they play sucky pop country music over the sound system; we had problems with our room safe, there was no ""Do Not Disturb"" sign in our room; the shower head, a peculiar, bizarre, and intimidating two-headed device, had loose plumbing, the alarm clock was missing the backup battery, and other parts, our one room service order was screwed up, and a call to the front desk and concierge went unanswered. All of this for a premium price in the toney Gold Coast area. In this case, the positives do not out weigh the negatives, which is surprising since the Westin is part of the Starwood properties. Starwood markets their hotels as modern, urban, efficient, technologically advanced, and for some properties, edgy. The Westin on Michigan Ave is anything but, and that is why they are just okay with three stars.",N
718,"If you're in Chicago for a conference and someone is paying for your room, it's very hard to find things to complain about. If you're paying for this room by yourself, then I'm sure you'll find more to complain about.   As far as the room being bland and boring...it's a hotel room.  Most of them are.  If there were dancing monkeys in every hotel room throughout the world and one didn't have a dancing monkey, then I'd be disappointed.  (no monkeys were harmed in the writing of this review, by the way). I also chose the green option and do not see the points...so shame on them. Some staff was very friendly and helpful, while others didn't know which way was up.  This did not make my boss happy. I didn't get any other food but if you are expecting a full Starbucks in the lobby, you're going to be disappointed.  It is severely lacking in options as well as hours open, but it does have the choice of cold cereal with milk if you are looking after your carb consumption. For some reason, my room and/or alarm clock was haunted as it kept going off EVERY NIGHT at different times.  Don't they check that to make sure it's off when they turn over the room- especially since many people nowadays (such as myself) use their phones as their alarm clock? The location to the John Hancock building can't be beat.  Sadly, many other things can. Not bad, but not the best I've had.",N
719,I've stayed here two times.  First time I would give them a 5 star rating.  Second time I would give them a 1 star rating.  So I guess that averages out to 3???   I won't go into too many details about either trip.  Just know that the first time we went we were treated very well and made to feel welcomed.  The second time our needs were ignored and we didn't feel that warm feeling we did the first trip.   I've stayed at many Westins and I can say this place is inconsistant at best.  Good luck.,N
720,"Westin bed = darn fine Wait Staff = darn fine Nice location, room view was what one should expect: Of another building across the way. No problems with noise in the room like other reviewers. Else = Left something to be desired. The wifi wasn't too bad, but what REALLY got my goat?  No wired internet. Says there is but no.  There's a cable *on the desk* in the room, which I followed back (as an ex-IT guy I like to tinker) where it goes to a box and then nothing, nada, no other cable.  Lovely ruse, Starwood, thanks. Ha-ha! What a lark. I called the desk and the fellow a little too nonchalantly said ""Well have you tried the Wifi instead?"" Does something smell funny or is that the Chicago River? Stayed there for a medical conference of the g-friend's, she said her boss's boss professed they were very unhappy with the measly catering provided for what they thought was an exorbitant price. Room service charges were INSANE. $5 + 11% tax (ok, that's fine) plus 24% *service charge*!?  We had our meals paid for top to bottom, ate at some nicer places while down there, but even in a pinch we refused to pay such inflated rates. The prices at the bar downstairs were just plain over the top, too.  It cost me $19 for a beer and a shot, just a Goose Island 312 and a Ri rye. Never again. Not ever, ever, ever, ever. I would stay there again on someone else's tab or in a pinch, since it was comfy enough and we had a nice time, but the amenities and prices just didn't add up for us.",N
721,"We recently held an event here. The hotel is great, and the staff very helpful.There was a bit of a disconnect between the sales office and the front desk, but they figured it out quickly. If you every need an embarrassingly large, nicely appointed suite, get the presidential suite. I'd live in Chicago, if I could live in that suite.",N
726,"I stayed at this hotel for a conference this past weekend and was not impressed. In the interest of full disclosure, I just came back from a trip to Asia where I also stayed at three Starwood hotels (Sheraton Hong Kong, Sheraton Taipei, Le Meridien Taipei), all of which were far more superb, which may explain why I'm negatively biased in this case. First, the rooms are clean but BORING. White shower curtains, white sheets/comforter, and very bare walls. Two, there is a Starbucks downstairs which on their website says is open at 6AM, but no one was there when I went downstairs the first morning of my stay to grab coffee at 6:05AM. When I asked the concierge, he responded that it would be open shortly. A few minutes later, I see an employee hurry in preparing to open. When I asked her when they would be ready, she responded that they open at 7AM. WTF. Third, the hotel offers a ""green choice"" program where you receive either 500 Starwood points or a $5 voucher if you choose not to have your sheets/towels replaced for a day. I opted for this offer but didn't receiver EITHER points or a voucher when I checked out. Fourth, the room service charges are ABSURD:""$5 delivery charge, 24% service charge, and 11% sales tax."" Despite having the luxury to expense my meals during my stay, I refuse to pay for such a rip-off.",N
727,"This was the absolute worst hotel experience I have ever had in my entire life. I was in town with friends for a bachelorette party and arrived at the hotel at 1245pm. They said our room wouldn't be ready until 3 (completely understandable) so we asked if we could drop off our bags. The bellboy told us to ""drop our stuff and not touch it"" because he thought it was disorganized and didn't want us helping him put it up - okay, that's fine. We went and had lunch and came back at 3pm and were told the person in our room was staying until 5pm. I asked if another room was available and he said he would call my cell to get us one as soon as possible. At 6pm there was still NO ROOM and NO CALL. Eventually I tracked down a manager and she said she would get us a room soon. At 720pm I we were able to put our bags in the room, but were late to our 7pm dinner, not to mention unshowered after a 6 hour drive and had to change clothes in the soon-to-be bride's room since ours wasn't ready. We were given NO discount even though our room was 4+ hours late. It was a horrible experience, every person I talked to was unfriendly and was not able to help, and it put a damper on what was suppose to be a special night. I have not heard from management despite trying to contact them. I will NEVER stay in a Westin again and will alert all my friends and family to never stay there as well. Simply unacceptable for a huge pricetag.",N
729,"We stayed at the downtown Chicago Westin Hotel this weekend and had a great experience! The weekend price was very reasonable, rooms were average as far as decorating goes, but they had really great beds and bedding. My son needed emergency cleaning service on his suit and, voila! It was hanging in his room within a short time. The lobby is small but had plenty of seating-it gave the feel of a boutique hotel. Even though there was a coffee pot in the room with Starbucks coffee, we took advantage of the lobby Starbucks. The grill/bar had a warm old Chicago ambiance-great photos filled the walls and the light fixtures added to the flavor of the room.",N
733,"Overall rating - 3 stars Stayed over a long weekend Location - Excellent.  Easy walk to shops or public transit. Room - Clean, quiet.  We were on an upper floor with a lake view.  Standard hotel room setup.  Nothing fancy. Food - n/a",N
736,"We went to this hotel, primarily for it's locale...we were taking our daughter for a special birthday weekend, to the American Girl store (which is just 2 blocks down the street from the hotel) and then to Shedd Aquarium. Unfortunately, we didn't get to the Aquarium...:( In a nutshell, the room next to us was ""rented"" to a younger couple that used it for party central. In and out, people in and out, laughing, hollering, smoking in the room and in the hall . The smoke crept in, under the ajoining door and was quite strong smelling in our room. The worst of it was the ""relations"" that the couple were in engaged in. For over an hour, 1am-2:15am or so, we were regaled with the happy couple's ""fun"". We thought we were granted a reprieve after that...but no...THEN they were hungry and THEN they decided they wanted to make some calls on their respective cell phones...loudly. As other posters have said, the walls must have zippo for insulation, I could hear people opening a soda down the hall for goodness sake. Calls to the front desk and operator to complain went unanswered (did we catch someone on a break? was there a party? were they in the room next to ours, perhaps???). At 4am, with no hope of sleep and a strong thunderstorm overhead, we gave up....packed up and checked out. Only then were able to voice our frustration to someone at the hotel. He expressed sympathy and asked us if we wanted to speak to a manager. We said yes and then after a few minutes, with a manager a no-show, we opted to leave. They compted us our parking, which was helpful, but ya, in the grand scheme of things, it's a drop in the bucket. As the other Yelpers have mentioned, service charge for room service is whacka-doodle and we were to get free Wi-Fi for being ""preferred members"" which we did not. All in all, not something we'll want to re-visit.",N
738,"The hotel is very clean and the rooms are comfy. The best part is the location. You are in the heart of downtown and you have the Hancock building next door and the view from our room down Michigan Avenue was plain gorgeous. Also, you can walk to Rush Street to have some food and drinks. The bad part is that they don't have free parking, no free WIFI and the worst they don't have a swimming pool or a jacuzzi. This is a very expensive hotel so I cannot believe they don't have a pool.... I have been in way cheaper hotels that have those amenities so it doesn't make sense for such a nice hotel don't have it. Service on the front desk wasn't the best either. I was standing there for more than five minutes waiting to check in and then we went to check out their system were down so we couldn't get our receipt at that time. Overall, not what I was expecting from the Westin or for the room price.",N
746,"What an amazing location!  Wow!  This place is great, the staff is awesome.  I stay here every time I come to Chicago.  Walking distance to Due's!",N
796,"The hotel itself was nice, the rooms were clean and comfortable, and the location was convenient to shopping. If not for the following inconveniences and lack of service, I would probably give it 4 stars: Check-in was a huge hassle because I unwittingly used http://getaroom.com, when I thought I was calling the hotel directly.  Eventually, after waiting over 20 minutes, the people at the desk were willing to put a hold on my credit card while they waited for http://getaroom.com to get back to them about my reservation, which was already paid for.  But they could have done that from the start, rather than making me stand in the lobby for all of that time. Also, I was told internet would be free in my room.  It asked to charge me at log on, so I called to the front desk.  they told me to accept the charges, and assured me that I would not be charged.  At check-out, the charge was on my invoice.  The person at the counter printed me a new invoice, and assured me I would not be charged.  Two days later, I notice that my bank account has been charged $13 for internet usage.  I am now waiting for the hotel to refund it. In addition, very early on Sunday morning, the housekeeping attempted to open my door, because I forgot to put up a ""do not disturb"" sign. I thought that was rude and I am glad that I had latched the interior door lock, otherwise she would have walked right in. Also, be aware that parking is $60 per day and valet only. When I got my car, the window was rolled halfway down on the passenger side, which makes me believe it was probably left that way all night.   Overall, not the worst hotel I have stayed at, the room was clean and comfortable, and the location and price were ok, but the service really kind of sucked.",N
817,"We visited Chicago for a long weekend and found this hotel online.  We liked the idea of staying in a non-chain hotel, but location and price were also important considerations for us.  When we arrived, we were greeted at the front desk by Patty who set the tone for the entire weekend.  She was friendly, professional, and helpful.  We talked with her a couple of other times during our stay to ask for directions or restaurant recommendations and her hospitality was incredible and very much appreciated.  We didn't expect that in a big hotel in such a large city.  The rest of the staff -- from the housekeepers to the doormen -- were great, too. Our room was on the 9th floor and was surprisingly spacious for an older hotel.  We're also a little snobby when it comes to beds, bedding, and bathrooms and we had no complaints at all.  We could barely hear the el trains from our room and, when we did hear them, it sounded more like white noise and didn't interfere with our sleep or relaxation.   We definitely enjoyed our stay at the Silversmith and are hoping to stay there again during our next visit!",N
818,My friend stayed here with her fam when she was in town. seemed a little pricey for the accommodations and amenities.,N
819,"Location location location! This hotel is near everything - all the subway lines are within 3 blocks and Michican Ave and Millenium Park are only a few blocks away as well. I got this hotel on Hotwire (never done it before - makes me nervous not seeing the hotel first!) for about $140/night when everywhere else in the area was close to $200 plus so I was happy about that. Front desk was extremely friendly and helpful the entire time; used the Yelp check in to get a suite - having the extra room came in handy throughout the trip. The suite was ready when we checked in on the very early side of around 11AM. Loved the water infused with fresh fruit in the lobby. Gym was pretty OK - 1 elliptical, 2 treadmills, 1 stepper and a weight machine. Wish the room was bigger and they had dumbells but I have seen far worse hotel gyms. Rooms show a little wear and tear and decor is not to my taste but the bed was super comfy and the tub/shower were good so I really can't complain! The room was always spotless so that is another plus. I wouldn't hesitate to come back!",N
820,"We were able to get a room at this hotel on Hotwire for a great price.  When we arrived and checked in on yelp, we got a free room upgrade to a suite.  Yay!  We also were able to check in early. The staff is friendly and always ready to answer questions.  The location is great.   The hotel is a little older and some of the furnishings are outdated. But if you can look past that, it's a great little place.",N
821,"After a horrible night at the Drake (reviewed), this place was a surprisingly pleasant treat. Unpretentious and with a great central loop location, the hotel was perfect for my needs. INCREDIBLY friendly staff, HUGE bathroom, free vouchers for drinks and breakfast, low price. Not the most updated hotel (tvs are not flat screen, wood of armoire and bed headboards look a little dated, building is sort of narrow and old) but it's not that much better at any of the other fancy shmancy hotels I've been to. We stayed on third floor and I could hear the L go by, but it wasn't loud enough that it kept me awake or woke me up. I was bummed to see the free check-in upgrade offer, but our room was perfectly fine. Definitely recommend, definitely would come here again.",N
822,"Got this hotel through Hotwire at a very good price for the area and class. Based on reviews we figured we couldn't go too wrong and were not disappointed. From the start, everyone was pleasant, helpful, quick, eager to assist. The room was clean, comfortable,  and large enough for our family of four (we had wanted two doubles but were ""upgraded"" to a suite with a king and pull out. This worked out but was not truly an upgrade for us. Nice touches were free wireless internet (worked fine for us all weekend), free safe, whirlpool tub, separate shower, large rooms, close walking to many sites and eateries. Noise was only a problem one night when our neighbors were closing their door (letting it slam shut) continually at 2 in the morning. Most hotels have a lack of noise proofing around the door and this was no exception. That said, it really was only a problem once and briefly. Parking is what it is for downtown Chicago - you pay for it here but the Valet staff were great and will get your car whenever you need.",N
823,"I've stayed at the Silversmith twice and am planning on a third stay this autumn. The hotel staff was pleasant and helpful each time I entered the hotel. The rooms and bathrooms are large and clean. Each time I've reserved a room, I've requested to be placed away from the El train and have been accommodated.They upgraded their internet service sometime between my stays there in 2010 and 2011, and I had no trouble at all with the wi-fi. The hotel is in a GREAT location for visiting downtown Chicago. CTA trains that circle the Loop have a stop right at the intersection where the hotel is located. Millenium Park is just down the block, and the Magnificent Mile is approximately ten blocks away. There is plenty to do and plenty of places to eat within walking distance of the hotel, and for venturing further out, trains and cabs are easily accessible. I've stayed, and plan to stay, at the Silversmith during the Chicago Marathon. I'm sure the price is higher during this weekend, but when compared to other hotels in the area, even those officially partnered with the Marathon, the Silversmith was the best price and in a better location than most. The only reason I didn't give five stars, and I'm sure this doesn't matter to most, is that I feel they need to upgrade their TV's. I know, it's a minor thing, but if you're looking to keep the kids entertained or, like me, your looking to spend time in the room preparing for or recovering from a REALLY long run, the TV thing is important. I highly recommend the Silversmith, and I plan to continue staying there each time I visit Chicago.",N
824,"I liked this hotel for it's location to all the events that we attended like Chicago Symphony concerts, the art museum, as well as some good nearby restaurants.  It was next to the L but our room was located in a place that we really didn't hear it.  The staff was very courteous and friendly and there was always someone at the entrance greeting and welcoming you back.  Our only complaints were maintenance issues like a bathroom door and armoir door that didn't close properly.  The room rates were good considering how close it is to Millenium Park and Michigan Ave.",N
825,"Loved this hotel! It was in an amazing location considering we didn't have a car. We were close to many attractions, the train, and several bus stops! The staff was amazing... so nice and helpful! The train is right in front of the hotel and our room faced it but you could barely hear it. It never woke us up or anything. Very clean and would stay here again when in the area!",N
827,"Absolutely loved my two evennings in this downtown Chicago boutique hotel. Great price (Groupon), lovely rooms & conviently tastey restaurant.",N
828,I was pleasantly surprised with the Silversmith Hotel.  Our double bed room was very large compared to most downtown Chicago hotels I've stayed in.  The beds were very comfortable and the room/bathroom was clean and well maintained.  The front desk staff was very friendly as well.  Millennium Park was just a couple of blocks away & the hotel is located just steps from a subway line.  It made getting around town very convenient!  The price was excellent for staying in the heart of downtown Chicago for 3 nights!   I would definitely stay again!,N
829,Very friendly people!! My now fianceÃÅ had a birthday and we were also celebrating 4 years together and told them we had yelp and they upgraded us as a surprise. The staff is very friendly and the rooms are very clean and HUGE!!! I will deff stay here again.,N
833,Got a room for $89 and got an upgrade with my Yelp check-in. The suite was a great value. Had no problem with noise and the staff was super-friendly. Would go back in a heartbeat if I had to be in that area of Chicago.,N
834,"I give this hotel a 5-star FOR ITS CLASS (i.e., we are not talking the Four Seasons. However, it's easily above run-of-the-mill Hilton's and Marriot's in which I often stay). It was a combination of great price, extremely customer-focused service, nice decor, very comfortable room, etc. I chose this hotel for its proximity to a meeting I had. I read reviews in yelp, and was concerned that some guest rooms were near the subway line. I called in advance and asked for a room  far from the subway, and they assured me rooms on the other side of the hotel are quiet. When I arrived, they had put me in a king suite, at the same exceptionally low price as the regular rooms with queen-sized beds. About 30 minutes after I'd settled in, Elizabeth at the front desk called to see whether everything was to my liking. Nice touch. The women at the front desk were exceptionally courteous and customer-focused throughout my stay. Most of the bell men were also, with Louis, in particular, being wonderful (from the warm greeting at my initial arrival, to offering to wak my luggage to the subway [which was a better bet to the airport than a cab during rush hour] in quite cold temperature). The room itself was spacious, warm, comfortable. The metalwork art throughout much of the hotel (which I supposed represents silversmithery), and other artwork, were tasteful. Wifi was reliable (and also free). All in all, great value for the price. I'll look to stay agin on future trips to Chicago.",N
835,"Good price from the location, which is a five minute walk from millennium park, however the ""traditional"" theme they boast I saw as simply old and 90's looking. Good location, good price, bad decor and furniture.",N
837,"We stayed there over the Memorial Day weekend. I'll net it out. The location was fabulous, and the price was very reasonable. The staff was very friendly and professional. Our room was right over the El tracks. We could hear the trains go by, but it didn't keep us awake (although I would definitely be concerned about being on a lower floor -- we were on the 6th). The wallpaper was starting to peel off in a couple of spots, but nothing major. We were traveling with our teenager, and all wanted a little privacy, so we reserved a suite with a king sized bed and a fold out couch. The bed was quite comfortable, but the sofa bed was atrociously uncomfortable. The suite didn't have a door between the bedroom and the sleeping area, and no mention of that fact was made on the website when we reserved the room.",N
869,"I left a marvelous hotel to come here and I am overjoyed at the choice. A natural pick for architect buffs,it's on the tour! The staff is unreal in every way. Suze is a standout! U of m grad and rower loving the Midwest values. Apparently the manger is a Michigan guy as well but State oh we'll :) The rooms are perfect! Elegant,unique,comfortable,lovely. All the way down to the hand sewn blanket with velvet. They even have footies! Free Starbucks in the AM. This is where I will stay on all upcoming visits!  Pet friendly and interesting guests. It's a small place and private.",N
870,"This hotel has a special place in my heart as my now fianceÃÅ and I stayed here the weekend we got engaged.  I chose this hotel because I got the impression from other reviews that it was both classy and cozy with a great location.  We were fortunate enough to get a corner suite with a view of the Chicago theatre on one side and Millennium Park on the other.  The room was tastefully decorated in blue and gold tones (with a somewhat regal feel).  In terms of hospitality, the staff knocked it out of the park.  Among other things, the hand-written note and complimentary bottle of champagne were very nice. If I had to nitpick I would say the gym is limited and the lobby is a little cramped (although to be fair, it is relatively small hotel to begin with).  Also, I have slept on more comfortable beds.  However, the free papers (including the NYTimes) and coffee in the lobby made up for it.   If one wants to experience classic deÃÅcor such as marble stairwells and crown moldings with outstanding hospitality, then I highly recommend this hotel.",N
871,"This hotel was ideal for my stay -- great staff, beautiful rooms, and a great location.  And keys!  Real keys like the ones you have on your keychain!  I'm not sure why that had such a big impact on me, but it did.  Nice view of the Trump Tower from my room.  Great restaurants and Millennium Park within easy walking distance.  My room wasn't huge, but it didn't need to be -- great work Kimpton.",N
872,"I'm a sucker for old-world charm and was drawn to the Hotel Burnham after seeing photos online of the historic building and exquisite interior.  I booked a king lake view suite after reading reviews that the normal rooms were quite small, plus I really wanted a view, which is something that Chicago hotels know and will absolutely charge you for.  It was a bit more than I would have liked to pay but I kinda said ""screw it, I want to experience this place"" and I'm glad I did.  I knew I'd made the right choice when they handed me a REAL key not a stupid key card (which in my experience are faulty or need recoding 50% of the time). The picture windows are lovely; I was staying on the 12th floor with a view down state street out of one window and the park and lake out of the other.  Great for random people-watching too: I even caught a glimpse of a newly-married couple taking wedding photographs in the middle of the street down a few blocks in front of the Chicago theater! What made this stay particularly memorable was the exceptional service.  Staff members went out of their way to ensure I had a pleasant experience.  In the lobby there is a wine social hour in the evening and fresh-brewed coffee in the morning (which I didn't realize when I asked the hotel to bring me a coffee maker the night before - oops!)  Prior to my arrival, I got a personal email from Suze, who checked in with me to ask about my room preferences, if I wanted them to book me a dinner reservation anywhere, and inquire about if I was celebrating any special occasions or had additional requests.  I was in fact celebrating an acceptance into grad school, let them know this, and there was a little bouquet of flowers with a congratulatory card awaiting me in the room.  I was also traveling with my infant daughter who is one, and had asked for a crib in the room - it was already made up and waiting for me when I arrived.  Also worth noting is I showed up in the morning way before check-in time, but the room was all ready set up and ready to go, which was a  nice surprise.  I really appreciate that the staff connects with its guests before they arrive - so many places just send out an impersonal automated email generated by their bookings page, and it was nice to know an actual human was taking care of me. The pictures don't do this place justice.  The building, the lobby, the staircases, elevators, and my room were all just breathtaking.  I'd stay here again in a heartbeat if it weren't so expensive!",N
873,"Me: ""I stayed at a Kimpton Hotel"". Typical reaction: ""What is that? A Marriott, Hilton, Starwood Hotel?"" For those who don't know, Kimpton is chain of 100 boutique hotels that are located in most of the major metropolitan cities in America and no, they are not associated with any of the major hotel brands.   In the hypercompetitive hotel service industry, I really think that there are only a few things that a hotel can do to stand out.  One, the hotel creates a once in a lifetime experience by charging an astronomical price (say...overwater bungalows in Bora Bora) or goes the bargain/cheap route for the price conscientious customer.  For most, anything in-between seems to be an experience that is soon be forgotten unless you are tied into a loyalty/reward system that makes you go back to a hotel chain. So what makes Kimpton hotels stand out? Simple.  They provide 5* service at realistic price points for consumers.   FACT: They have the highest customer satisfaction scores and emotional attachment scores of all hotel chains operating in the United States. How so? Service: 1)  As I checked into my room, I had a hand written ""welcome back"" card that specifically stated that they hope I enjoy my second visit.  I visited Kimpton 4 months ago for the first time, and they pulled this info and prepared for my visit before I checked in. Amazing. 2)  They called 10 min after I got into my room to see if I needed anything. 3)  Three to four hours later, an employee brings me a complimentary bottle of Chianti.  Unfortunately I could not have this b/c I had some important things to do the following day so he asked if he could bring me anything else to drink like juice or lemonade.  In 5 minutes, he brought me complimentary ""fresh-squeezed"" lemonade.  Madness. Perks: 1) $10 bonus perk card for loyalty program members for every stay.  You can spend the $10 on anything in the fridge and in the snacks cabinet.  They have organic snacks, coke, beer, wine, chips, chocolate bars, you name it.  Although they are a bit overpriced, you can pick out 2-4 things without paying a dime.  Hey you can't complain b/c it's free :) 2) Rotating loss-leader specials.  For example, the Kimpton hotel chain is now offering 2 cocktails for $1 at the bar until the end of your stay.  Yeah.  Tell me a hotel chain that does that. 3) Complimentary starbucks coffee in the morning and wine and champagne in the afternoon (at the lobby). 4) Free wifi by being a loyalty program member.  This comes in handy in large metropolitan cities where all hotels charge for wifi. Add all these perks to a great bed that rivals the Westin's Heavenly Bed and fantastic decor to boot at around ~$110 a night.  It is almost impossible to find this kind of deal anywhere. The service and the quality of my stays has made me reconsider my priceline bidding strategies in the cities where Kimpton Hotels are located.  For a marginal difference of $20-$30, I am not so sure that the price difference warrants my risking landing an unproven hotel using priceline. As much as the service may not sound ""phenomenal"" for my review, my general feeling is that they would have gone completely out of their way and would have done outrageous things to make me happy.  I was sold.  Kimpton you won a loyal customer and a well-deserved 5* review!",N
874,"My wife and I spent a few days at the Burnham last week as part of our annual pre-Spring Break spring break.  We couldn't have enjoyed it more. With a location close to just about everything, friendly and accommodating staff, wonderful rooms (we stayed on the 11th floor where the view included just a bit of the lake between the buildings on Washington), not to mention the history surrounding the building, we had a thoroughly relaxing and restorative stay. Having the Atwood Cafe on site in the lobby was a definite plus as we had breakfast each day, cocktails and dinner on our last evening.  See my review elsewhere on Yelp.",N
875,Stayed here for the weekend when I went to visit a friend in Chicago for my birthday. The interior of the hotel is lovely. Wrought iron. Dark wood. Fabrics in blues and golds. I had a room on the 8th floor which had a great view of Chicago and felt like my own mini office away from my office. Kimptons service was excellent as usual--right down to the wine. Many thanks Hotel Burnham!,N
879,"Top notch, very fast and efficient customer service by the whole staff(except for the restaurant). By the time we put the phone down for a request there was a knock at the door accommodating our needs.  Staff was very eager to please. The room we had had maintenance problems. Shower adjuster fell off when I tried to turn it for some much needed water pressure. Phones did not work and the bathroom walls were in need of serious cleaning. Enjoyed the stay and felt that our business was appreciated.",N
880,"Fabulous stay. Very friendly staff, great views of downtown, centrally located.",N
882,"You can't do better than the Burnham for excellent service and accommodations.  From the moment you arrive, you're in for a treat as they literally make you feel relaxed, at home and without a care.  Emil, Suze, Darnell, Liz, Ben; nicest people you could know; Ray is a terrific bartender, and Vane excels at all he does. Coming back for the NATO Summit in May, should have made reservations by now.  But Jack Marvin, the Front Desk Manager, says, just email me, we'll take care of it. Can't get better than the Burnham!",N
883,"Stayed here for work via booking on http://Hotels.com.  Hotel is very cool, great staff like what seems like all Kimpton Hotels.  The room was tidy, loved that they had Aveda bath products.  Room was small, but had a really interesting view into the neighboring apartment building.  Check in and out was smooth.  I did not eat at the restaurant as iI was on the hunt for 3Floyds and they didn't have any there.  WiFi is free if you are a Kimpton rewards member, which is awesome.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",N
887,"When this hotel says they are pet friendly, it is such an understatement! We were travelling with my kitten and the staff could not have been more accommodating. Not only is there no pet fee here, but they actually have pet supplies if you are unable to travel with them. For my kitten, they supplied us with a litter box and pet bed and even watched her for us free of charge in the downstairs back office while we attended a business meeting! On top of being beautiful hotel in the center of EVERYTHING downtown Chicago has to offer, the rooms were classicly beautiful and the staff was beyond friendly. I would highly recommend it!",N
905,"Very pleased with our Saturday stay.  I had booked a king suite to celebrate Valentines Day and couldn't have been more pleased with the room or service.  We had a corner room with views East down Washington of the Pritzker Pavillion and North down State Street with views of the old Marshall Fields (I refuse to call it Macy's) and the Chicago theater.  The room had a seating area separate from the bedroom.  Both were very comfortable.  Typical Chicago street noise but certainly tolerable on the 7th floor.  The hotel, the former Reliance Building, is beautiful.  The historical details are everywhere you look.  Everything was spotless.  The only nits were someone had taken the cashews from the mini bar so we made sure to mention this when checking out.  Anyone that knows mini bar protocol is aware that surprise charges can appear later for items you never touched.  The front desk made note of the missing item.  And an errant room service charge had to be removed.  The concierge handled my bouquet and candy request (I know, cliche, but sometimes you gotta stick with tried-and-true basics) and both were waiting in the room when we checked in.  Charges for both were very reasonable.  Be sure to join the Kimpton loyalty program to take advantage of the free wifi and $10 mini bar voucher.  Location is close to Millenium Park and the theatre district.  I know we'll be back.",N
925,"I stayed at the Hotel Burnham for three nights right after Christmas.  The location is great for the Art Museum, Theatre District, restaurants and shopping.  I was excited to experience a Kimpton hotel because the reviews I had read about their boutique  hotels led me to believe that the Burnham would have a friendly and a cozier feel to it.  I was disappointed.  The room was lovely, but the bathroom was small and my showerhead had pressure problems.  The water was also lukewarm so I could not take a hot, relaxing shower.  The ""free"" hot chocolate that was offered in the lobby was somehow never available when I was in the lobby.  I ordered room service for breakfast all three mornings there.  Two of the three days, food or some item was not brought up on the first delivery forcing me to call room service and have the server bring up the missing food or item.  Not good when you have already poured milk on your cereal and realize the sugar packets are missing.  The down comforter was not in a duvet cover leaving me to wonder if I was sharing the uncovered comforter with the previous guest (s).  The person at the front desk assured me that the comforters are cleaned for each new guest(s), however, I did not feel confident in what he told me.  On the bright side, I loved the location of the hotel, and I loved the view from my room.  I was on the corner of State and Washington Streets, and I could see the Bean at Millenium Park.   I cannot say that my stay at the Hotel Burnham was unpleasant because I loved the sheer excitement of being in downtown Chicago, and some of the staff were very kind and helpful; notably Ben at the front desk, and one of the housekeepers whose name escapes me.  But on the whole, I would not stay at this hotel again, and possibly not at any of the Kimpton Hotels after this experience.",N
926,"This was my first trip to Chicago so I really loved this hotels downtown location. It was walking distance to all the famous shopping, the river, river taxi stops, the beach and Navy pier.   I also loved the comfy beds and quiet room. I thought it was rather expensive for the size of room you get but am told that Chicago is almost as pricey as NYC, so $150 a night wasn't a bad deal. The valet parking is $36 - which you have to get if you rolled into town in a car. However;  that I am told, isn't that expensive either. They don't serve a complimentary breakfast which is a bummer, but our room did have a bath-tub. One minus, one plus. All-n-all, we had a lovely stay.",N
927,"Oh Red Roof... thank you for providing a somewhat cheaper place for me to stay... But other than price, NOTHING about my experience was pleasing. Lured in by the cheaper than normal room rate, the pictures that I saw of the room actually weren't too bad! I reserved the room and noted that *some rooms had refrigerators and microwaves. Upon arrive, NOT the room pictured nor were there any appliances as were listed. Not only that, but the room LOOKED dirty. Even after it had been cleaned. The door to the bathroom wouldn't latch (crooked door frame), and the windows were bolted shut with the air conditioning non-functioning. Add to it the wifi here was slower than dial up, and I was one unhappy person. Lucky for me I didn't spend a ton of time IN the actual room, but seriously... Spend the extra $30 and get a room across the street at the Marriott.",N
928,"Absolutely acceptable for the type of property.  Wish the windows were more soundproof, but the room was clean, the halls smelled of fresh paint smell, and the hotel has been cleaning rugs and drapes in each room (warnings are posted).  near all kinds of good stuff.  free wifi that mostly seems to work.  ac works well (which is good because it's hot-n-sweaty season here in chicago).",N
929,"Came to Chicago on a trip with 2 of my friends and stayed here for 2 nights. We paid for a deluxe double room with A MAGNIFICENT MILE VIEW, paying extra for the view. I wish we could attach pictures to reviews, so I could post a picture of our ""view"" because all we could see was the unattractive building next to us, and the ugly roof and heating ducts of a shorter building below us. Our TV was broken, which wasn't the worst thing in the world because most of our trip was spent sightseeing, but it was kind of a bummer when we got back at night and wanted to put it on. The maid ASKED us if we wanted our room cleaned (YES!). The WiFi was free, but was so painfully slow I half expected to hear the hissing of a dial up connection. However, the location is fantastic, very close to the Navy Pier, walking distance to Millenium Park, nice area of the city, good restaurants nearby. The price was very reasonable (despite paying for a view we didn't have). The front desk staff was extremely nice and helpful, especially a woman named Nikita I believe. Overall, not an atrocious experience, but definitely nothing special.",N
931,"Unfortunately, perhaps the worst experience I've had at a hotel in the US (not the world). First, a few good things: -Location is superb -Can't beat the price -Desk staff was helpful and nice And now the litany of bad things: -Room smelled horrible (like sewage of sewer gases) -Made a NYC hotel room look huge. -Was not clean or cleaned very well. -Had a couple of roaches -AC didn't work in my room -Toilet wouldn't reliably flush -Shower water pressure was what I would describe as a dribble. -Room didn't have a Iron or ironing board in it (weird, but I did get one on request) -Room layout was not well done (i.e. no desk, just a bed, never seen this before) -No amenities of any kind besides really slow wifi, not even coffee and donuts in the AM. Bottom-line, you get what you pay for and this place is cheap. As others have said if you're not going to be in room and just out and about it's probably passable, but just. Incidentally, after two nights in a simply awful room I explained my plight to the manager and she promptly moved me without any fuss to a new room which was much better.",N
932,"Disgusting. Came with my friend just for a place to stay....horrible. They were doing renovations in the lobby made it look rundown. The hostess at the desk logged like she may not even have worked there because she had no Id badge. They head A big creepy guy for their valet service. E elevators are incredibly small and old. My bathroom towels had a curly black hair in it. Two,of my three pillows had long black hairs on them which almost made me throw up. The rooms suck. Very small. Weird smell. Rooms are freezing. Would never ever ever go back.",N
933,"Pros - So super cheap. Amazing location. Friendly staff. Comfortable pillows. Cons - It smells. Legit, like a strong bleach smell that makes you think people have died recently in the room. It is also dingy and claustrophobic. If you are spending no time in your room, it's perfect. If you like downtime in your hotel room, you might want to keep looking.",N
934,"This was place was alright.  I recently booked a room last minute. The rooms were somewhat small but had a safe, extra storage, and the hotel is dog friendly which is a rarity for a downtown ""cheap"" room. I would have given more stars if it was cleaner. The bathroom floors, walls and door were pretty ragged. Valet was $40, which I was sort of bummed about when we ended up waiting 20 mins to get our car even though we called ahead and explained we were in a hurry. $40 is standard for the location. Also there is no street parking at all. Other than that, the staff was really friendly, and the location is pretty cool. I highly reccomend this place if you are traveling with a dog and need a last minute place to chill in the city.",N
937,"Disgusting. Ants in the room everywhere, shower drain stopped up, dirty floors, stickiness on the floor, unattentive staff, and the worst experience I have had in a long time. Booked this for 4 days and checked out in one and refused to pay.",N
940,"This is without a doubt the filthiest, most disgusting hotels in the world. Don;t walk run from this place.",N
947,"Remember the cousin you had that was always loud, obnoxious, dirty, and drunk? The one that ruined every family gathering for all? You wouldn't wish this place on him.... that's how bad it is. There is a reason why it's half the price of other hotels in the area. As others have said, the staff IS very good. But they can't make up for the lack of eveything else. It's cold, dirty, run-down, and very, very noisy.",N
956,"Ah, the Amalfi Hotel. I love this place. It is bang smack in the center of Chicago, a stone's throw away from tons of great restaurants and the Magnificent Mile shopping area. We got married in Chicago in May and we worked with Dan Wheeler and Moji Akinde as we had about 50 rooms for our friends and family booked here. Dan and Moji were great to work with ... very flexible with our numerous requests and always willing to make this experience easier as, with any wedding, it is one of the 100 things that we had to sort out but this was one where I was happy to leave it to the experts. Thanks Dan and Moji. The hotel itself is great. It is a boutique hotel which was what we wanted rather then the blah-ness of the larger chains. The foyer is amazing (and great for wedding photos). The rooms were large and very modern. The gym has lots of equipment and was seldom busy. To top it off there is also a breakfast buffet on every floor which was great for the morning after the night before when my heart (and head) was not into going out for breakfast. There is also a happy hour which complimentary cocktail and appetizers ... my friends and family did not miss a night here and it helped to make the hotel even more affordable. In summary the hotel is great ... central location, very reasonable rates, friendly staff, clean and modern rooms, complimentary breakfast and happy hour, free WiFi. Highly recommended.",N
957,"young, modern, centrally located - those three words describe amalfi the best. The staff is quite young and ambitious, spending a comfortable atmosphere. The hotel has bewn built in 2004 and stays modern. The rooms are spacious, the beds, gosh, i wish i never have to leave it - extremly comfortable! And it is very well located. You are in everything's walking distance, north as much as south. Around the corner you fis a couple of nice steak houses, pubs n bars. The breakfast you got on the corridor with more than just the standard continental one. Further, you got free drinks in the late afternoon! I do recommend to stay here (will be #1 choice when i come back to chicago...)",N
958,"The three major deciding factors in choosing this hotel over others in the area were 1) free wifi 2) free continental breakfast and 3) proximity to all the popular Chicago sights. Wifi was spotty in some areas of my second floor room but I can't complain because other hotels in the same price range were charging $10-15/day. While many hotels that boast continental breakfast end up having meager offerings, Amalfi's breads, pastries, fruit, yogurt, and drinks were abundant and helped us jump start our days of sight seeing. This also helped us save a money instead of going out every day to buy breakfast. My boyfriend and I do not have any finicky requests when staying at hotels. All we need is a comfy bed to sleep in at night to recharge for the next days activities. If you're a tourist this will be the perfect hotel for you. All of the major sights are within walking distance. Magnificent Mile (5-10 min), Sears Tower (20 min), John Hancock (15-20 min), Millennium Park (15-20 min) - all VERY walkable (which you should do to walk off all that yummy Chicago food!). Also, Trader Joe's is a mere 5 minute walk away if you need to stock up on 17 cent water bottles to keep yourself hydrated as you explore Chicago. Walk south for about 5 minutes and you'll be at the Blue line which gets you to and from O'Hare in 45 minutes. The Red line is also very close by. Although we did not ask for much, the staff was very nice and helpful. We had an issue with one of our keys not working and they were apologetic and immediately helped resolve the problem. Very satisfied with my stay here!",N
959,"This place is a wonderful value in the middle of a city that rivals New York in cost. Amalfi is a small boutique hotel that was probably previously owned by a larger chain. I say that because there are a few features that scream ""generic chain"" namely the bathtub. Beautiful granite countertops greet you only to turn around and see a blah tub with a shower curtain that looks much like my Aunt Ethel's (well if I had an aunt Ethel I think it would look like that). Point being...it is a boutique hotel without 100% execution. Don't let that deter you though...there are plenty of positives. They offer an evening reception with an Italian spread. Fabulous cheeses, meats and olives line the buffet. There is an open bar with a wonderful selection. Try the Amalfitini. Even my non-girly drink consuming husband liked it. They also have a continental breakfast on each floor. I loved the fact that I didn't have to travel far to get my donuts and yogurt. The employees were hit or miss. The bell staff was incredibly friendly and helpful!!! Most of the front desk staff was very kind and outgoing. There were two women that were a bit on the snotty side but we didn't let that detract from our stay. The amenities were fabulous! Aveda bath products and they even offer body wash and not the standard bar soap cheaper hotels have gone too. I really liked that. Internet is fast and free! Parking is valet only but we were able to find self parking down the street a bit. Their valet rates however, were the cheapest I had found. Overall, this hotel was a wonderful Italian gem in the middle of the windy city. We will definitely be back! Oh,,,and if you are bringing your pooch they will welcome him (or her) with open arms!",N
960,"Nice hotel in a good location, very close to everything.   I liked that they provided free wi-fi and breakfast on every floor, there was a good variety of food and it was nice to not have to go far.  Staff was friendly although the lobby setup was weird, I liked that they provided free copies of Time Out Chicago, which was useful. The room was very large and spacious but Amalfi loses a star because the view out our window was just a brick wall.  Hey, at least we had privacy.",N
961,"I like this hotel. The staff very friendly, you will feel like in home. Great location, great hotel to spend the night :)",N
962,"Nice independent, boutique hotel. ROOM - spacious and clean - bed and bedding were comfortable - large rolling desk - large bathroom with lots of counter space -iPod alarm clock dock available STAFF - very friendly - fast and easy check-in and check-out - housekeeping did a great job each day - concierge/bell hop will hold your luggage the day you check-out AMENITIES - fast and free wifi (password given to you during check-in) - free breakfast daily on EACH floor! (juices, coffee, teas, bagels, pastries, yogurt, fresh fruit, cereal, etc) - free manager's reception daily which includes open bar and snacks - computer and printer available to check-in and print boarding passes - room amenities include AVEDA brand toiletries, hair dryer, sewing kit, shower cap, shoe mitt, vanity chair, small zoom vanity mirror, iron, ironing board, slippers, and robes - mini fridge in room OTHER - walkable to State/Lake and Clark/Lake 'L' station - walkable to many popular destinations - many bars and restaurants in the area Overall, convenient location with great amenities at an affordable price! Would definitely recommend to someone.",N
963,"Very nice boutique hotel in a great location. The room was very comfortable with a great bathroom. Good shower water pressure and lots of counter space. Plus a magnifying mirror and even a little stool that was a nice touch. Much more space than I expected for an urban boutique. Bed was comfortable and the linens were good quality. I like that they desk was a little lower so you could actually put your computer on it comfortably, and it rolled around so it was nice to position it where you wanted it. I could have used a few more outlets near the bed so I could plug my phone in, but overall, the room was very well put together. The checkin was efficient and the staff very helpful. The doormen were really friendly and didn't make me feel like their hand was constantly out for a tip. They do a breakfast buffet on every floor and it was MUCH better than I expected. It was great to just walk out and grab something. They have a cocktail hour that I never made it to - but will next time. I ordered room service from Harry Carreys across the street. This is a great idea since they don't mark up the food, and it's great. They do add an 18% gratuity and a $2.50 service charge, but that's totally reasonable. And it was very fast. I think more hotels should do this, everyone does what they are good at!",N
964,"The wife and I stayed here with another couple while we were visiting Chicago from Toronto. My friend booked this hotel from Toronto since he got a good deal per night from his work. We got there and during check in, we were told that the two rooms were not together but on different floors. My thing is, he booked this hotel a month or so in advance and asked that both rooms be together or at least on the same floor. You can call and put in REQUESTS. When he had requested it, the person on the phone checked and agreed. Yet, when we check in, we are told something different. As always, every hotel is completely booked whenever you need something regarding a room. What's new? So from the first moment, I wasn't happy. We get to the room and it's an okay size and clean. No complaints with that. The continental breakfast is a plus since it's on your floor so you can go in your pj's or whatever. All in all, I remember that this place wasn't pleasant. It's in a good location downtown close to everything you need. I remember the staff wasn't friendly or helpful. The lobby is quite small as well but then again, it's downtown so I guess the space was limited. An okay place to stay at.",N
965,"As far as I am concerned, I do not need to ever stay in any other hotel in the Chicago area.  Chicago is a great place to visit and, at least in the summer...those cold winds blowing off the lake in winter are not fun.  But summer is great and there is always something to do.  On a recent trip we stayed for the first time at the Amalfi Hotel...and this is now my favorite hotel ever.  It is very small and the staff is just fantastic.  They were ready to help at any time.  I almost wish we had a problem while we were there so that I could have seen how they handled it...but I never got the chance since the approximately one week stay there was just perfect.  The hotel has the perfect location on the near north side and everything of interest is either a walk or a short taxi ride away.  In the evening you can enjoy free cocktails and munchies up on the 5th floor...you have got to try their Amalfitini...I just had to go back every night for more, it was so good.  I guarantee that you will love this place...and, by the way, get there in the late afternoon and try the cookies at the registration desk...but no fair eating the whole platter full!",N
966,"The Amalfi Hotel is a fantastic choice when staying in Chicago.  There are a lot of options in this city, high end to more economical but what makes the Amalfi Hotel stand out are the people, convenience and little ""extras"" that make a hotel stay an experience.   1.  The people are beyond amazing.  So nice, helpful and always happy to see you. 2.  The rooms are well maintained, comfy, spacious 3.  LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION.  This hotel is in the center of it all. Located within a few blocks of the subway, this made the hotel easy to find and easy to leave when needing to get to the airport. In the theater district with the House of Blues right around the corner and the good old land mark of the Chicago Marquee Theater.  Restaurants abound, with Keefer attached to the hotel and Public House as you walk out the door.  Round the corner and you have a true taste of Chicago with some of the best best pizza, (Rossi's pizza by the slice) Mother Hubbard's local bar and etc. 4. There is a complimentary breakfast served each morning on each floor.   5. Happy Hour, open bar (definitely try the Amalfitini) and snacks (great selection of cheese, olives, finger foods, bread, cold cuts etc) ...this place is so wonderful, why the 4 stars?   While during our stay, we noticed there is a bar/club right next to the hotel that played music until 4:30a.m and we could hear the loud people and music ONLY on Saturday night.  All other nights it was quiet. Also, we stayed on the 4th floor and had a splendid view of a brick wall. :(",N
967,"The Amalfi Hotel is a great choice when staying in Chicago.  Located just north of the River, you get around pretty easily either by foot, ""L"" train or car.  We were greeted by a very friendly staff and check-in/check-out were effortless.   The room was very nice.  There was a much in the way of space and amenities as a person could want.  The TV was fine.  The remote has a tiny delay but, that doesn't set me back.  There was plenty of space.  The bathroom was fine.  The double faucet in the shower was a personal dream come true.  We even had a pretty good view of the city from our room. Every morning, there was a generous continental breakfast that was maintained pretty diligently by the staff (who were also really nice).  Each evening there was a cocktail party in the Ravello Lounge on the top floor which is always pretty popular.  The house cocktails (the Amalfitini and the Sorrento Sunset) and pretty darn tasty!  I won't lie, it's a pretty sweet set up they've got here.   I plan on returning to the Amalfi.  I also recommend it pretty freely.  We were treated well and left making plans for our next visit.",N
968,"Full disclosure: I did not actually stay here.  But my friends did!  And I was with them during check-in and saw their room and all that, so I deem that I'm qualified to review the Amalfi. I actually work next door, so I can tell you that the doormen are super friendly - they always have a nice smile for you or a quick hello as you walk by, guest or not.  Every once in a while, they've even helped me get a cab - thanks guys! The desk staff is equally pleasant.  They couldn't have been nicer during check-in!  There were a lot of people waiting around, and while they were efficient about getting you settled, they never made you feel rushed. The room was nicely decorated, very clean, and a good size.  Everything looked fairly new - they seem to do a good job of taking care of things around here. There's also a complimentary happy hour for guests starting at 5:30 and let me tell you - it is wildly popular!  At 5:30 on the dot, there was pretty much a mad rush of people going up to the Ravello Lounge.  It's probably a little less nuts during the week, but I'm betting the place was packed based on how many people were headed up to the 6th floor. Overall, my friends had a good experience here, and I was pleased with everything I saw - I would certainly recommend the Amalfi to Chicago-bound visitors!",N
969,"Spent the weekend here and it was great.  Checked in at 3:00, our room was ready and after checking emails and catching up on a little bit of work, it was 5:30.  Cocktail hour (or in this case...90 minutes)  They have a room set up for free drinks and food every day at 5:30.  Good stuff.  My wife had the ""Amalfitini"" and I had a gin and tonic.  Beefeaters Gin, better than what I had expected.  Met a couple from Switzerland and had a great time talking over a few more drinks. We had a corner room with views of 3 different directions.  Plenty of space and in the morning, there's a continental breakfast set up on each floor.  This is great as you don't have to juggle coffee and a bagel in the elevator. Bellmen were nice and accomodating.  It's in River North and close to so many restaurants and clubs.  I highly recommend it.",N
970,We all know travel can be stressful and where we reside upon our travel is absolutely important.  I travel to Chicago nearly 7 times a year and choose Amalfi Hotel not only for the convenience and great rooms but the staff and overall experience is worth it.  There are endless restaurants and convenient shopping whether you wish to shop State or Michigan Avenue.   Safe Travels to you...,N
972,"Our room was cozy. I really couldn't hear anyone in the halls or rooms next to ours. Unfortunately, on the weekend we could hear the bars downstairs quite a bit, but it wasn't too bad. I wish there had been more outlets for all our electronic devices. We loved the morning continental breakfast and the evening happy hour. The workout room was clean with modern equipment. The staff was always very helpful and pleasant.",N
973,"The room view was of a brick wall,but the shower was awesome a double head sprayer,the cocktails and snacks from 5:30 to 7pm was totally reelaxing and a superb way to begin a evening .a few bill disputes stopped a 5 star rating",N
974,"Four thumbs up! First trip to Chicago and the hotel experience at Amalfi blew away any hotel I have ever stayed at. Perfect location, especially for St. Patrick's day, and it was immaculately clean. Their staff at the front desk/concierge were knowledgeable, eager to help and SO pleasant. The room was roomy and spotless. Book the room that includes both breakfast AND the cocktail lounge (complimentary drinks) before walking to either corner of the Kinzie block for a fine dining experience or a casual fun bar! A ++++++++++ Thank you Amalfi for a great weekend!",N
984,"Nice place.  Styling was standard hotel.  I found it interesting that the decor was so nondescript, almost like what you'd find in a dictionary picture for ""hotel"". Cocktail hour was really good, heavy appetizers like a big tray of meats and cheeses.  Their signature martinis were good.  The continental breakfast on each floor was great too, you can run to get a coffee and a muffin or croissant and back to the room to get started on your day. Front desk staff was great.  Saved us on cover charge at Andy's Jazz Club right around the corner with the hotel business card.  Everyone was really friendly.  Location is near a few river-north clubs, and we had a street-view room so it did get noisy right about closing time but only for a few minutes.  A lot of people were in town for a clothing show at the Merchandise Mart which is only about 4 blocks away.",N
993,"This place is cute, but some minor inconveniences made my stay less enjoyable and I won't go back. 1. No blackout curtains in the room.  Just a sheer curtain and those fake side panels that you can't pull closed. Nothing to block out the street lamp outside the window. 2. We were the lucky guests who didn't have a do not disturb sign, which we didn't realize until the maid was banging (literally, banging) on the door at 8am. 3. People were screaming in the hallway at 3am. Not the hotel's fault, but knowing that they attract that certain demographic makes me not want to stay there again.",N
1016,we went last weekend to Chicago for my friend's wedding. good location but the rooms were just ok for the price paid. breakfast in the morning was great and so was the cocktail hour (free :) all in all 3 stars - would stay here again,N
1017,"I will never ever stay anywhere else in Chicago...ever.  I've been coming here for about 5 years and every year it gets better and better.  Just today we came for an anniversary stay, and they were so thoughtful that there was a lovely card and treat in the room when we got here. That is on top of the amazing staff, great lounge, and great breakfast in the morning.  Best hotel I have ever stayed in, hands down.  Thank you to the wonderful people here:). Consistent incredible service-hige kudos to the concierge!",N
1048,"This place is exactly what I expected for paying 39.99 a night. From empty pool full of garbage, broken air conditioner, overflowing toilet, shower with little to no water pressure, shower changes from boiling to ice cube. I look forward to staying again next time I'm in Chicago. The crew that hangs outside did a great job pointing towards the nearest White Castle and kindly offered us a wide variety of drugs for sale. Who says people from Chicago are rude?",N
1049,"Was looking for a cheap place to stay near the Allstate Arena, total was around $50 for a night for a King bed room. I've stayed in a lot of hotels for around the same price, but this one really reflects the cheap price. Here's why: -Hallways and common areas are really in need of maintenance and basic care -Mold on the ceiling above the shower -Shower fluctuated between cold and scalding and the water pressure was pathetic -Mattress was extremely uncomfortable and had a distinct dent in the middle that we both rolled into over the night. -Breakfast was described as coffee and donuts, the coffee was terrible and the donuts were actually a platter of ho-ho's. -One of our lamps in the room didn't even work, room also needed more lights. -Wi-fi was available, but only in the lobby.",N
1061,"Pretty swanky. Slightly above average bed, bath, and beyond. I'd go back as long as I don't have to pay again.",N
1062,At this star level and price this place is lacking in a few areas: 1. Nickel and dime guests for receiving packages -- I mean come on - ??? 2. Claustrophobic gym 3. Lacking good restaurant -- the one sushi bar they have is limited 4. No pool Swissotel around the corner is better for this location and price point.,N
1063,"It was my first stay at the Fairmont Millennium Park and am so glad I discovered this place.  The hotel is in a beautiful part of the city, surrounded by lots of gorgeous scenery.  We had a great view from our room.  I can't imagine that there's a bad view from any room in the hotel.  The hotel is also in a quieter part of the city, which is nice when sleeping.  The staff there are wonderful too and very quick to take care of anything you need. The hotel is very close to Millennium Station and the CTA, which makes it really easy to get to.  There are also several restaurants nearby and a CVS right across the street. Our room was great and very spacious.  The bed and chairs were super comfy.  The closet was spacious as well.  The bathroom was huge with a separate shower, bath tub, and separate room for the toilet.  There was also vanity outside of the bathroom with a bench where I could do my hair and make up without taking up the bathroom. A nice touch was the Nespresso machine.  That coffee was so good! This hotel made our weekend in Chicago a wonderful one!",N
1064,"Great view from our room.  My in-laws had the spacious couple king size bed room which has a center view of the Buckingham Fountain.  We were next to them and I only see a partial view of the Fountain but still a great view.  Since there's so much to see in Chicago, we didn't even once turn on the television for our kids. I would ding this hotel for not restocking shower gel - we've stayed here for 4 nights and only do I get extra shower gel on the 3rd day when we ran out  and bumped into our housekeeper that morning.   For a Fairmont, I was surprised they didn't replenish.  I understand being ""green"" and good for the environment but we paid to stay and should have essentials restocked. Hotel is definitely in a nice location and close to the Navy Pier,  Millenium Park, riverboat cruises, and Wildberry Pancake House (a great place to get breakfast).  Overall the hotel looks and feels nice.  Noise level minimal since we were on the 18th floor.  Our car was brought up promptly so service was great there. With kids, a pool is necessary and this hotel does not offer it but we were able to get access through long corridors to the Swiss Hotel's indoor ""in the sky"" pool.  Just speak to the Fairmont concierge.  From this pool location, you could get a closer view of the Navy Pier.",N
1065,I stayed here and really loved the view of the city from my room! The room was very elegant and was very tasteful.   I enjoyed the huge bathroom with the separate shower and tub...They also had a separate area aside from the whole bathroom where i would do my makeup.The room was extra spacious and comfortable.  The only thing I didn't like is the housekeepers weren't up on game and didn't clean up or restock anything? What were they doing picking their damn nose in the hallway or what?,N
1066,"I stayed here for 5 nights last week for a conference and it was quite an enjoyable experience! The rooms are spacious, clean and tastefully designed. I loved the huge bathroom with both a shower and a tub. The food from room service was surprisingly excellent! I had the hummus plate one night and the lobster roll on another night. The conference rooms were also spacious and well equipped. The hotel catered our breakfast and lunch everyday and it was some of the best conference food I have had. There was a lot of variety for each meal, and there was dessert with lunch everyday! My one and only complaint is that my room was never restocked with the essentials. I had to call to have more coffee brought up. Also, the cups I used disappeared but new ones were not put in there place. A minor nuisance in the grand scheme of things, but it is those small details that make all the difference! Otherwise, I would LOVE to stay here again for business or for pleasure.",N
1067,"Loved the Fairmont - it was old time elegant and the staff so helpful. We had a corner suite and the room next door that could close off from the rest of the hallway and let the kids roam. Lake and Navy Pier view. So nice. The lobby is beautiful - round with a wine, cheese chocolate bar in the middle (three of my favorite things) In the morning it was a coffee, juice, pastry stop. How cool is that? And the restaurant? Check this out: http://www.yelp.com/biz/...  Normally I wouldn't seperate a restaurant from it's hotel with different reviewsbut this isn't ""ordinary"" Service was prompt every morning  (sometimes too prompt) Beds were comfy, turn down service with water left at every bed, nice bath products. Location is great - between Michican Avenue and Navy Pier, allowing us to keep the van in the garage with one exception. Be warned - Parking is expensive here. EXPENSIVE. (I think it was $60 a day) We spotted a small park from our window...perfect for the kids to play while we sat and watched. Waterspout fountains for them to run in. We were the only tourists...others were residents from nearby condos. It was a great find. Why only 4 stars? Besides the cost of parking after you're already forking it over for rooms, on arrival we pulled up at the lower level and asked if that was OK. They told us it was better because the front entrance is undergoing renovation. Then we waited in the heat with 5 kids for 25 minutes for a bellman. Not a good first impression. Also...no pool although they can send you to a nearby hotel's pool. Two hotel lobbies in my swimsuit...I don't think so. And you had to go thru a tunnel at the front entrance due to construction. Creepy. Construction won't last much longer, and I would definitely stay here again! Two thumbs up.",N
1068,"I would definitely stay at the Fairmont again, if only for their giant sparkly mural in the lobby! Alright so maybe not just because of that, but that thing is amazing. I wish I could have it in my apartment. The staff here is so nice, and wasn't overwhelmed when our group of over 40 people checked in all at the same time. Our rooms weren't ready yet, but they let a few of us change downstairs in the spa, and wow is that place beautiful! If you can fork up the extra cash, definitely spend some time down there. Or hey, if you're me, just go down there to change clothes and scope it out. Our corner room was really nice and a great size, and the same goes for the bathroom. The views can't be beat, either. We ordered room service a few times and everything was great! Expensive, but that comes with the territory. The only thing I didn't like was about an hour after your room service arrived, someone would knock on the door to take everything back. While that may seem convenient, it actually was a little annoying because the first time I was in the shower and the second time I was sleeping. The guy actually came in after knocking and picked everything up -- as I was sleeping. I thought I was dreaming but when I woke up the food was gone. Kind of creepy! This is a great, centrally-located Chicago hotel. The bar doesn't suck, either! Consider it while staying in the Chi.",N
1069,"The rooms were spacious, the tv was big, but that was all this place had to offer. There are no pools. The free wifi was questionable, and when taking a shower anyone that flushes the toilet throughout the hotel will affect your shower water. It's so odd that it's connected. I would prefer the Swiss next door. They are also currently remodeling the front.",N
1070,"I have stayed at this hotel for over 60 nights... The hotel is great and the rooms are very nice.. Although the motif is not quite my style... Looks sort of the 70s style with yellowish walls and wood furniture. The views are great, the service is spectacular. Last time I stayed here was in February of 2011",N
1071,"Beautiful hotel and great staff... pricey side of course, it's a Fairmont in Chicago, i expect nothing less.",N
1072,Great location and the rooms were very nice with cool views of the city. No free Internet and the gift shop was a bit pricey especially for water and snacks. Breakfast in the lounge was convenient but nothing special considering you have to pay for it.,N
1076,"It's really hard to not like this hotel...  I was fortunate enough to have a  room facing the radisson and the lake.  simply fabulous.  the staff was attentive and friendly.  only downside was i was here for a work conference and the food wasn't too amazing... especially breakfast, it left me wanting so much more!",N
1081,"definitely kick ass location, lovely wine bar with a great menu, courteous/friendly staff.  Agree with other reviewers on the beds being awesome and the view from the 33rd floor was excellent.  Liked the bathroom with separate toilet/shower/bathtub areas and loved the extra-large bathtub and trademark bathrobe.  Only drawbacks:  Anthesthesiologists' convention in progress, and I wanted to have breakfast in bed on our last day, but the breakfast menu was severely limited.",N
1082,Parking is a challenge around here unless you know the area well or pay for valet.,N
1083,"I think I lucked out on this place. I got a room here via bidding on Priceline for like $80 for a Wednesday night in January. I had a great experience. Upon arrival the front desk lady was really friendly and was able to grant my wish of a room on a high floor (34th) looking out towards the lake. The view was amazing. The room was huge. The bathroom AREA was separate from the rest of the room. When I say area, there was a power area with its own mirror and bench, the actual bathroom which had a tub, a very nice stand alone marble shower, the sink area, and then the toilet had its own little closet within the actual bathroom. It was a little weird that there was no tank on the toilet and had a flushing system similar to what you would find in a stadium. This was really my only gripe. Besides that, everything was very nice. The TV was a 42"" flat screen. The bed was super soft with very nice pillows. There was a couch area with its own coffee table. There was a desk area as well. There was a nicely stocked mini bar, with about anything or any alcohol you could ever want. However, I'm sure everything in it was really expensive, i couldn't tell you for sure because there wasn't a price sheet, which was a bummer. If you need to use the Internet, be prepared to open your wallet cause it was $15 and some change per day for Internet. That too was a bummer. All in ll the place was great. I even used to concierge to book dinner at a top Italian restaurant before catching a show at Second City. This place was a great hotel and I would totally stay here again.",N
1084,"Great stay!! Me and my girls went to Chicago for the weekend, had a great stay at the Fairmont, it was affordable (on Orbitz), super friendly staff and the views were awesome. The prices were ridiculous though. 2 mimosas (not hard alcohol) were $35. Not gonna do that again!! But everything was great :)",N
1099,"Pros: Staff was very pleasant.   Beds were comfortable. Cons: $10 per day per person to use the fitness center. The coffee shop in the lobby is absurdly expensive ($3.50 for a medium drip coffee, $5 for a scone) and the coffee isn't great.  I would have vastly preferred Starbucks. All around, not as nice as I expected for a Fairmont.",N
1155,"Two words...FREE PARKING!  You can't beat that in the city.  The location is great - walking distance to some great restaurants and shopping.  Easy in / easy out.   On the down side, it's not the fanciest of rooms.  Clean and acceptable for the price.",N
1156,"This was a great place for our two-day stay in Chicago.  It was a good location, had free parking, a restaurant-style breakfast (instead of the typical continental fare), and a friendly staff.  There was one guy, Wallace Pope, who always had a big smile, and was extremely courteous and helpful.  I even wrote to the Best Western CEO about him.   It was not inexpensive ($375 for two nights, including taxes), but I think it was a reasonable price for downtown Chicago.",N
1157,"Older hotel, but price was right.",N
1158,Great for the price! Good location and free parking!!  If they had a fridge I might have given 5 stars! Nice staff!,N
1164,"Place is great I've stayed here a couple times now staff is always friendly and acomidating , price is very reasonable , rooms are very clean. I would deffinatly stay here again and recommend this place a+",N
1179,"Great affordable and nice hotel! Relatively close to Chinatown as well! I've stayed here twice and have had pleasant experiences. My family pricelined this place to get an awesome cheap deal! What we mainly liked is its close proximity to Chinatown which is what we usually visit in Chicago. It has its defects, but I would say the pros heavily outweigh them. PROS: - Great location and close to Chinatown - Clean! - Lobby is beautiful and decorative - Great customer service (I requested extra towels and was nicely granted them) - Nice and personable parking/valet staff - Affordable on Priceline! - Clean and spacious restrooms - Swimming pool - Parking garage is easily accessible - This is little, but they have free Aquafresh toothpaste in the bathrooms! (my favorite brand) - Some rooms have a GREAT view of the Chicago Downtown Skyline CONS: - Parking price - A little lower quality for a 4-star hotel - No fridges in hotel rooms - No continental breakfast - Rooms could be more vibrant - Some rooms have bad views of just concrete - Some bathrooms have no vent/fan",N
1180,"Stayed at the hotel for an anniversary weekend staycation with my fiance. The room was nice and clean with a comfy bed and your usual hotel ammenities. The view was atrocious (a lovely construction site), so we just kept the curtains closed. We mainly stayed at this hotel because of the pool and their multiple restaurant options. Unfortunately during our stay the pool was freezing cold, there were only 4 total chairs available on the sun deck that were all occupied, and Shor was the only restaurant open during our stay (the food and service were more than subpar). We did get a really nice package deal, the romance package that included a bottle of sparkling wine, a chocolate fondue, and breakfast for 2 the next morning with late checkout. While the items included in the package were great, we had to specifically request all of it. If we did not alert the front desk of this, we never would have received any of it. I don't understand the point of having preferance selections when you book online if no one is actually going to pay attention to them. Overall, would I stay at this hotel again for a staycation? No, probably not unless there was some sort of great deal. Would I visit the restaurant again? Hell to the no. Would I recommend this hotel- sure, but only if you're here for a convention at McCormick place.",N
1181,"My husband stayed here for a little birthday get-away from our apartment.  Got a steal on Priceline.  I guess I was just not that impressed. Pros: Beautiful modern lobby, extremely comfortable beds (I slept SO well and woke with no aches), and immaculately clean rooms.  New carpet and linens.  Extremely friendly service at the front desk, and check-in was a breeze. In addition to the standard bar of soap, shampoo and conditioner, they give you a travel size toothpaste.  Gotta take pleasure in the little things, right? :) Cons: Expensive parking - but if you're like me and not willing to pay $35+ per night, you can find free street parking a few blocks away, on the west side of McCormick place.  For a 4-star hotel, the room decor was pretty lackluster, the furnishings were updated, but not such that I felt like I was in a 4-star hotel.  No bathrobes, no showercap, no bath mat, no tea bags, no fridge, no complimentary high speed internet.  Poor TV channel selections, and though we're pretty tech-savvy, it was impossible to figure out how to order a movie (although the girl at the desk mentioned we could do that and charge it to the room).  When we checked in, I asked the girl at the front desk if we could get a room with a view of the city, and she did manage to get us up pretty high (17th floor) but on the south side of the building, so all we had was a view of McCormick place and a little bit of lake, really.  My husband and I noticed on our way out that most rooms on the north side probably don't have a good city view anymore, because there is a new building being constructed right next to this one blocking the skyline. Overall, the Hyatt Regency just doesn't seem to be my flavor of hotel.  I'm sure it's perfect for the business traveler attending a convention at McCormick, but I wouldn't dare pay retail price for it and I probably won't recommend it to my friends if they were visiting Chicago.   Hint: Get good at Priceline's 'name your own price'... I got this hotel at 70% off!",N
1182,"On Sept 4, I made a reservation for 2 nights at the Hyatt McCormick Place in Chicago. I usually stay at The Wit (a Hilton hotel that always provides excellent service) when I am in Chicago on business. However, the rate was very high, so I decided to stay at the Hyatt since I had a conference at the McCormick Place anyway and the rate was about $100 less per night. I ended up not needing both nights, so I cancelled the second night more than 24 hours in advance in compliance with the cancellation policy. In fact, I was assured I would not be penalized. They did not put the bill under my door. So, as I was reviewing my e-mails today, I discovered that Hyatt cancelled and did not charge me for the 2nd night. However, to my surprise, Hyatt charged $464.85 to my American Express card. Yes, a small portion of that was for parking and taxes. But you increased my rate for the first night pretty significantly! The original reservation was $259 per night. The rep said when I cancelled one night, Hyatt had to charge me the going rate for that day. I was not informed of that rate change when I cancelled the 2nd night. The customer service rep (whose name I should have gotten but I hung up because I was so mad) was incredibly rude, telling me ""It is what it is."" Since I am a Hyatt Gold Passport member, I decided to try my luck with that department. At least that rep was more professional, but she still said there was nothing she could do. I have stayed in hotels hundreds of times, and there have been occasions when I've had to shorten my stay and cancelled a night. Never was I charged more for the nights I kept! I talked to our fiscal office, and they never heard of such a thing either. I could understand if I cancelled both nights and booked an entirely different date, but the rate should not have increased for the original night I booked. Sticking with the Hilton chain from now on.",N
1183,"I stayed here last week for a work conference and unfortunately I returned home to find BED BUG bites on my feet, arm and few other parts of body. Very irritating and not what one would suspect from a Hyatt. Called to relate this to a manager. I guess I was given the the manager of housekeeping that told me this would be looked into. 3 days later he called back to tell me the room was cleaned and inspected and had no BED BUGS. Right. I guess I imagined this horrendous rash/bites that I had right after staying at this hotel.  Poor location. Drab and old-very plain. Only useful for a conference at this site. What kind of a customer service person at a hotel denies that you had a problem or bad experience and offers nothing but a weak apology and denial that it was their fault. Go to any other hotel. I have never had this problem nor this kind of follow up from any hotel I have ever stayed.",N
1184,"The darn room keys barely work! You can insert/extract them slowly, medium speed, fast, ultra-fast and it's hit-or-miss on getting it to unlock the door. Same problem with both my card-keys, other folks were having the same problem which led to a lot of knocking noises at all hours. People would keep trying to get into their rooms or they would knock if someone was already in the room so they wouldn't have to use the key. The a/c is a bit touchy and makes the room either ice cold or super toasty, you have to keep adjusting it as the temperature isn't constant. Rooms are a bit dark and needs more lighting, the closet is in the shadows with no light. The bedside clock/radio has both an iPod/iPhone dock and a USB port which is very handy to recharge things. Only one outlet on the desk lamp so you'll have to crawl under the desk to plug-in something else or you can plug something on the other side of the room. The WiFi is free but has a 200MB data cap for a single device, if you want unlimited data it's an extra charge. This is the standard Hyatt data plan, also if you go for the premium data package ($15 extra/day) make sure you do it over WiFi so you can use up to 3 devices for that package. If you use the ethernet jack you will be limited to that specific jacked-in device. The hotel is a bit in the middle of nowhere if you want to puchase things like food or other things. There are 4 places to eat in the hotel with the cafe being the most convenient option selling cold deli sandwiches, chips, drinks, beer, Chicago dogs, etc. I didn't eat at the restaurants. Little coffeemaker in the room with complimentary coffee/tea and housekeeping staff is very good about keeping it well stocked if you use supplies. Front desk staff is friendly, bellmen and other staff members are all friendly and helpful so they do have a good crew from what I experienced. Bathroom was fine, the bath mat towel on one day was frayed and torn with a faded nasty looking stain on it. Complimentary toothpaste is nice, the glasses for water are ridiculously fancy and on the small side so if you use them to pour a drink on ice you'll be refilling it a lot. Had a conference at the exhibit hall which is across the street from the hotel (there are a couple of enclosed bridges connecting the hotel to the exhibition hall for use during bad weather, just walk at street level in nice weather as it's faster). For the amount of money paid the value isn't really there. The exhibition hall venue was a bit disappointing and though it's not the hotel I thought I should mention it: No soap in bathroom dispensers, late coffee service for our workshops everyday, freezing cold venue, slow food service catered through the hotel (they kept running out of food, didn't have enough tables/chairs). The good part about the venue is it's fairly easy to find an outlet to charge laptops, free WiFi.",N
1185,"It was convenient for an overnight stay to attend a concert at Soldier Field. It was kind of busy and hectic in the lobby. We asked for food options and were given possibly the worst hand-drawn, then copied map ever. It was only slightly correct. When asked about walking back to the hotel from Soldier Field, we were told to follow the lake, which was about as abstract as you can get and ended up with us going way out of our way and needing quite a bit of help from others to find our way back. But the room was clean and the bed didn't suck. It's pricey because they assume everyone staying there is on a corporate expense account.",N
1186,"This wasn't the smoothest of hotel experiences I've had.  It wasn't terrible, but I probably wouldn't stay here again. PROs: + The lobby looked very nice and up-scale.  They've obviously put a lot of work into making their front-end look nice.  It's too bad the rooms didn't match. + The room was fairly large, reasonably clean, and well-stocked (full-size hair dryer, toothpaste, make-up removing cloth, etc). + The bed/bedding was pretty comfortable. + Service was reasonably nice. + I didn't get to use it, but the fitness center was nice, free, and pretty large for a hotel. CONs: - The price for parking was ridiculous.  It was something like $42 a day for valet or $36 for self-park.  I know it's Chicago, but really??  I got a good deal on Priceline, but that's almost as much as I paid for the room!  Am I buying a separate hotel room for the car? - The room looked old and worn.  Considering how nice the lobby was, I wasn't expecting the room to be that rough.  The three-quarter wall between the bathroom and the bedroom was kind of weird; the three-quarter-wall retro-fitted closet with a curtain instead of a door was weirder.  Was the room really not built with a closet, and was the the best you could do?  The carpet had seen better days long ago, the shower/tub was lookin' rough, etc.  Old, old, old. - I had hoped for a decent city skyline view.  Unfortunately it was a view of nothing but the active highrise construction site directly next to the hotel.  Shades closed, methinks. - Okay, this is a stupid little thing, but the vending machines sucked.  I just wanted water and was scared to venture out at night in search of a convenience store.  I went to vending machines on three different floors with no luck before I went to the lobby to ask if any of them had water.  The lady at the front desk told me to try the machines in the laundry room.  That one had water, but wouldn't give me my change.  I found out the next day that my colleague used the vending machine on his floor to get a diet cola, only to have it spit out grape soda, which wasn't even listed on the machine! - There's a charge for WiFi in the rooms. - Worst smelling toiletries ever.  I don't know why all of the Hyatts use that crap other than that it must be cheap.  Have the decision-makers ever actually opened a bottle and taken a whiff?  That's supposed to be ginger?  *gag* I've certainly stayed in worse places and this doesn't deserve a one-star rating, but the pretty lobby didn't make up for what the hotel was lacking overall.  I would not stay here again.",N
1187,"It's in the middle of nowhere and the in house restaurants Shor and Forno close at like 5 PM and serve barely edible, over priced food like the $15 personal pizza that's not quite as good as a pizza hut pizza but double the price. On top of that it took nearly and hour and another 15 minutes to run my credit card. Over priced everything including the room because it's a convention center hotel. The room itself was average at best, definitely not worth the price. The staff aren't great either. The front desk staff are rude. The restaurant staff are inept. If you're visiting Chicago and your company isn't putting you up here, don't stay here. You can do a lot better for your money closer to downtown for you'll pay here and you'll get better quality and much better service. The only upside - Toothpaste. Yep, toothpaste. They give you a small personal sized toothpaste in your room so you don't have to ask for it or buy it if you forgot your own.",N
1188,"Location, location, location.  Obviously if you are in Chicago for a conference at McCormick, then staying at this Hyatt is very convenient.  However, getting around town can be a nightmare.  Taxi lines were often 20 minutes or more, and there is almost nothing nearby that is worth going to.   The Shor bar and restaurant meets relatively low expectations.  The drinks are decent, and the food is uninspiring, but edible.   Finally, the rooms are staid and cold.  They have zero character, as if the decor was an afterthought to the location.  I have slept in nicer rooms at 2 star hotels.",N
1189,1.  Room insanely cold. 2.  Rude front desk phone service 3.  Wake up call happened late and then repeated twice with other staff making the call (lack of coordination) 4. No place to charge phone or computer 5.  Television on dresser beside bed instead of in front of bed. 6. You have to pay for internet The only upside: 1. Pretty quick cab ride to MDW in the early AM 2. They actually give you toothpaste in your room (you don't have to ask or buy).,N
1190,"I came to this hotel to meet my fianceÃÅ upon his return from service.  Our first night together since he had come back home.  Complete disappointment for his return home.  We were given 2 double beds. They didn't explain this and when we made it to our rooms and discovered this and asked for a switch they said no that they were booked to capacity, didn't even offer a chance to upgrade to a suite.    I have worked in the industry for a bit and no hotel is ever booked to capacity without a major even happening in the city.  No one was helpful at all with anything, housekeeping or front staff.  The only redeeming quality is the parking attendant.   The lobby was ok.  But the rooms were dated and the beds were not comfortable.   For a few bucks more I could have stayed at a better hotel in a better location.  When I say better I meant the HOJO or Red Roof.  This says it has four stars but there is no way that it does.",N
1191,"So, the over all experience here was good except for ONE glaring point.  Hotels should do a couple of things right.  1. Have clean linens and bedding  and 2. have room service that is on time.  That said the Hyatt had a nice gym and pool.  Decent equipment.  It was conveniently located close the convention center that we were working at.  On our last day we called the night before for room service so that we would be sure to be able to eat before working since we had an early call time.  Well they called 15 mins after the time they were suppose to deliver our breakfast telling us it would be another 15-20 mins and if that would be OK.  WE SO ANNOYED BECUASE NOW HAD NO TIME TO EAT AND FIND ANOTHER OPTION.  They had all night to figure out their scheduling to be sure to have our breakfast served on time.   Sorry Hyatt this was totally unacceptable and worse you left us high an dry with out having breakfast and going straight to work where eating lunch is not option due to how busy the day is.  Hopefully next time you get it right and in the event of screwing it up you offer something in return for your mistake.",N
1192,"I pricelined this hotel and was very pleased. Yes it's off the beaten path but waking up with the entire Chicago skyline each morning made up for it. Cabs to the loop were about $7-9 before tip and always easy to get one. The room was clean, the staff were nice. About a 10 minute walk to Soldiers Field and the lake. For a weekend away, this hotel definitely works. I was in Chicago to see the city not the inside of a hotel room.",N
1195,"It was by far the worst hotel experience I have ever had. I was there for two nights and house keeping never came in my room.....sleeping on dirty sheets and looking at old room service is the worst, so bad I made it my profile pic! Seriously the worst 4 star hotel period oh yeah for the inconvenience they offered me free coffee",N
1197,Very nice hotel. Was clean and kept up well. I had a room on the 26th floor with an excellent view. The hotel is in the middle of nowhere however so be prepared to take taxis anywhere else in the city.,N
1214,Extremely disappointed. Restaurant closes at 11 am. and then nothing until 5 pm.  Bar doesn't open until 5 pm. Felt more like a motel than a hotel,N
1257,"We needed a relatively cheap, central hotel for our vacation to Chicago, and this hotel did just the trick! It sits right on the border of Grant Park, and is only 2 blocks from the El train (which we rode constantly). The room was clean, the people at the front desk were friendly, and I saw some indie band checking out while I was checking in. What more could you want?",N
1258,"Location was good and price was low but I guess thats why they say you get what you pay for. Small, dated rooms. Super small ""suite"" that was hardly soundproof. Had a very difficult time checking in since the room was booked under my friend's father's name. If you plan on sharing a room, the desk required names of each person staying in room in order to obtain room keys, just for a heads up.",N
1261,"The hotel staff was attentive and quick upon check in. After having trouble with the internet they were also eager and swift to help. The rooms themselves are clean but out dated. They feature the usual ammentities and an old fashioned television set. The location, however, is great. It is walking distance from a lot of the popular Chicago attractions: shopping, Grant Park, Milenium Park, just to name a few. There is no room service but I recommend take out from Yolk, a nearby restaurant.",N
1266,after a 4 hour middle of the night drive from St.louis ( not the brightest idea Sarah) anyhow we were in town 8 hours before check in on no sleep however at like 9 am we stopped by the hotel and were allowed early check in at no additional fee now I know this can't always be done for guests but they were able to accomadate us this time I will be back,N
1273,"Even though I live nearby, we decided to spend a night at the Ritz for my birthday.  What a fun and extravagant experience it was!  The hotel is beautiful, the service wonderful, and the atmosphere decadent! Some things I really loved and appreciated: The room: -L'occitane bath products, the amazingly comfortable pillow top bed, the humongous windows, temperature control, beautiful bathroom, and a waiting bottle of champagne on ice with chocolate covered strawberries to welcome us!   -The window drapes totally block out any bit of light which leads to amazing sleep. -Also appreciated the phone in the bathroom (which actually came in handy once when I needed to call down but didn't want to wake up my boyfriend), turn-down service which comes with bottled water, a wonderful view of the city.   -He also asked to have chocolate cake sent up to celebrate my birthday and what arrived at 8:30 on the dot was an amazing chocolate cupcake complete with candles, matches, and a bottle of Evian to enjoy. The hotel: -The lobby is gorgeous, with crystal chandeliers and a fountain and a jazz band playing in the evening.   -The service was super nice.  I actually had a cold and needed some Advil, and called down late to see if the gift shop was still open.  They asked me to come down to the front desk, where I was asked if I was looking for medication (indeed I was) and offered a tray of options.  Cost $9 but was totally needed and I'm glad I didn't have to make a late-night run to find a convenience store. -Also each time you call the operator for help they call you by your name which is a nice touch. -Attached to Water Tower which was great for a little shopping I had been meaning to catch up on. Some random things that could be better, but are not enough of a big deal to change the rating from 5 to 4 stars: -You have to take to sets of elevators to get to your room, and the elevators are a little small so sometimes you have to wait a little -Although my boyfriend added my name to the room (we checked in separately)--when I arrived I was treated a little like I was trying to sneak in or something, and it's interesting how the service is for a customer vs. a potential customer.  Very mild difference, but definitely different.   -There is a way to plug in your Iphone/Ipod into the TV to play music--however it is cumbersome (you have to download and sign up for this app called LodgeNet Mobile) and it takes a bit of time, and even then I couldn't figure out how to use it. -The wifi is free but not that good, actually turned it off and used my 3G network which worked a lot better. I admit I am super-high maintenance, but I loved loved loved the Ritz.  For a fun night in the city I would definitely come back again!  Can't wait to try the spa next time!",N
1274,"My wife and stayed here for our tenth anniversary celebration and I broke my toe on furniture in the room. I know what your thinking, but that is not how. They had a chair set up near the bed with a foot stool. When I got out of bed I wacked my toe on the leg of the footstool. I told tthe manager and was basical shown to the security officer and treated like a criminal, instead of a long time customer.mind you, I never asked for special consideration or a freebie. None was offered, unsurprisingly Also, the hot tub had brown moosh on the inside that looked like feces. I refused to go in that mess and when I told management of the spa, it remained uncleaned for several hours and past cCheck out. The Ritz is not the quality hotel it once was. When were weren't asleep, there was a steady stream of elevaror noise. Beware of rooms with a 33 or 32 in their suffix.  The Ritz is not the quality hotel it once was.",N
1275,"This review is for the hotel cafe/bar and parking -- I did not stay here but visited friends who were (and forgot to check in on Yelp... #amateur). Coming from a Chicagoan, the location of the hotel could not be any more central; it's steps from all the major spots in the city. The lobby at the Ritz is lovely, but getting there can be a bit confusing as it isn't actually on the ground floor. I had my car valet parked (the prices are much higher than any garage), and then I was instructed to take the elevators to the 12th floor. Once I arrived, we went to the cafe for drinks. I had some of the best cappuccino I have ever had. I have no idea what it cost, but they were made with good espresso and had proper foam. I don't think I judge anything harsher in life than cappuccinos, haha, so if I say it was good, it was GOOD! They are 1/3 of a Starbucks tall (read: size of a real capp in Europe) but so good that I savoured every molecule vs. the mammoth Starbucks size which I gulp down in a few minutes. If it was $4-5, I would gladly pay that here because, although a fraction of the size, the quality was worth it. It also came with a wonderful biscotti that had cranberries in it, I believe.. Yum. Just yum. Our tray of pistachios was constantly replenished as were glasses of water; the servers were very attentive. There is also free Wi-Fi. My only complaint would be that there is no bathroom at the bottom. I didn't realize that I had to go until I was waiting for my car, and from there I discovered that I would either have to go back to the 12th-floor lobby or up to the food court at neighboring Water Tower. All in all, a pleasant experience. I wouldn't go back on my own, but if you want to invite me, I won't say no. ;)",N
1276,"Service- great! Location-great! Sleeping rooms-great! Bathrooms in sleeping rooms- cramped and outdated. Overall hotel lobby and feel of the property- stone age. Refresh your common space!! My husband and I stay here on his comapny's dime from time to time and we call it ""Ritz the pitz"" compared to other hotels we've stayed at in the city. Get with the times guys!!!",N
1277,This place is just a little bit ridic.  The lobby is outstanding and the staff and amenities are out of this world.  We did a luncheon/presentation over three days w. groups of about 20 each and could not have been happier with the level of service we received.   The food we had over the three days was also fairly amaze.,N
1278,"Another knock it out of the park experience with a Ritz property.  I don't know how to convey this but of course there is always the nice finishes that go along with a Ritz.  The real difference is the customer service as I've said before. Here's an example.  Checking in, chatting with the person across the desk he asked if I would be catching a game at Wrigley.  I tell him yes and go about my way.  Later that evening I return and he crosses my path to the elevator and ask me how the game was using my specific last name.  THAT my friend is going above and beyond no matter how simple it may seem. Bottom line, they  treat you like gold and this particual hotel has residences with doormen too that help grab cabs, etc. Fun note: I actually rode the elevator down with Lebron James here!  So be on the lookout for celebs!",N
1279,"I checked out of the hotel at an ungodly hour of the morning and, in my stupor, ended up forgetting my padfolio in the cab when it dropped me off at Yolk (best breakfast ever!). I called the Ritz and they put me in touch with the doorman. He remembered the cab driver and, when that guy pulled up again, he rescued my padfolio and called me to say he had it! Kind of a miracle, no? I swung by on the way to my interview, got my padfolio, and tipped the doorman $5. Writing this, I feel bad for not giving him more.",N
1282,"We had a lovely experience at the Ritz-Carlton Chicago. LOCATION:  Very conveniently located to major attractions, Michigan Ave, & Rush St. STAFF:  Haven't encountered one sour puss. Everyone from door man to front desk & concierege to housekeeping has been perfectly pleasant and acccomodating. QUIRKS:  You take one set of elevators from street level to the lobby (12th floor). You take a different set of elevators from the lobby (12th floor) up to the guest rooms. And a third elevator takes you from the lobby down to the next level (11th floor) where the pool, exercise room and spa are located. The pool is one of the only amenities that appears in need of a renovation. It seems dark, uninviting and a throw-back to hotel pools of yesteryear. After a day of sightseeing and shopping, we mistakenly thought we'd chill poolside, take a dip, enjoy a beverage (avec tiny paper umbrella) and read a book. To our dismay, the room was dark and cavelike, the seating was sparse, and the pool was roped off into 4 lanes making it more of a lap pool than a place to unwind. And, there was no tiki bar. ROOM:  Quite comfortable. Large window across far end of room looks out over city. Comfortable couch. Spacious dresser with in-room safe and plenty of drawer space. Comfortable bed, soft linens. Two night stands. Stylish furnishing - not too edgy and not too ""starving artists sale out at the airport."" Nice sized flat screen TV on swivel stand on dresser. Large desk with office chair. Plenty of lighting and lamps. Nice sized closet with plenty of hangers. Separate bar/fridge area. BATH:  Spacious. Double sinks/vanities. Separate room with toilet and shower. 2 robes and 2 slippers provided for use during stay. Towels soft but still confident in structure and oversized. L'OCCITANE products including: 3 bar soaps, hand lotion, shower gel, shampoo & conditioner. Small canister on vanity with cotton balls, cotton pads and Q-tips).  Bath mats in front of toilet/shower and in front of sinks. Hair dryer. OTHER:   A little bar appears in the morning near the front desk area in the lobby with coffee, tea, espresso and a small assortment of pastries. It's adjacent to the hotel's business center, where I sit at this moment, composing this review. It's open 24 hours/day and offers a Mac and two PCs for guests' use. A fine place to slip away should one of you be an early bird and want to allow your other to sleep, hypothetically.",N
1286,"Just a review for the Greenhouse, the bar at the Ritz. Good live music played at just the right volume, great bartenders, lovely setting.",N
1289,The most comfortable beds on the planet.,N
1293,"Attended a church gala on Saturday night in the 12th floor ballroom. The venue was very classy, and the food was great (filet, scalloped potatoes, asparagus). If you are looking to host a mid to large event, I'd recommend the space.",N
1294,This is by far my favorite Chicago Hotel. The location is great and the service is impeccable. This hotel is a class act the moment you arrive. I definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for a luxury hotel in Chicago.,N
1295,"Pathetic! After a 45 minute taxi ride, our room is not ready? 5:00pm and our room is not ready, really? I expect that from a Holiday Inn not a Ritz Carlton. Lame.",N
1333,"I proudly was a resident of this amaaaaaaaaazing hotel when I was 7/8!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I looked out of the windows upstairs with a big expression on my face like...""I want to be here forever."" I was so spoiled for the rest of my life thinking I could walk out with everything at my fingertips in the hotel and go outside to the lake, the malls, the big museums, the Shed, etc. my parents used to get me books so i could read as i looked at the snow falling outside! It was a dream! I dreamed of this place the moment my parents made me go back to the crappy quiet IL area I was from - all right it was a nice town but just not my bag, baby, as Austin Powers might say - and from this point on, I knew that while my parents chose a different life, I was going to become a working child at 12 so I would never again have to leave my favorite Midwestern metropolis. I certainly made that true when I began working in journalism and running around Springfield and Chicaboomboomwow town at 14 for work. Was it all due to this experience? Nah probably not, but the pampering love I found here lingered in my heart and still does. I remember being treated so well when I was a kid. I know before that, I had gone up with my parents when I was 6 as I remember my dad taking me to watch Aladdin at the theater just across the block at the Water Tower, followed by getting me the little genie kit at the mall. I know I was up here back and forth. I miss it. I'm sorry, I know this whole thing sounds idiotic, but when people are so nice to you, the hotel you're lingering around forever has great food....great views....everything you could ever dream of as a little kid up til now.....I wish I could live here but my career choice wouldn't allow it.... ;( I can't stick around in IL if I want to be a mega successful chef/editorial model......",N
1343,"I loved the location of this hotel! I loved the staff of this hotel! We had a suite, so it was spacious! I heard other guests talking about how small the regular rooms were, so I'm glad we upgraded! The bartenders were really cool at this hotel! Try the Barry White shot (rasberry kamikaze) and the cucumber mojito! Delicious! If it's raining, the bell desk will check out an umbrella for their guests!! This came out handy for us! Right by Magnificent Mile and all the cool restaurants on Rush Street! Subway is also near by!  The lake is blocks away!",N
1344,"Our stay was greatly enchanted by the staff of this hotel. The service is fabulous, the location is probably one of the best ones and the decor is pleasant. The only thing where they lose some stardom is that it is very humid. Our clothes were constantly damped and the odor in the hall of our room proved that it was humid. Also the rooms are very small and though the modern deco makes you feel like a million bucks, there is little storage place and in the bedroom and the bathroom. Last point that surprised us was that a simple coffee was charged at breakfast. The breakfast price was quite expensive and I would have thought that the coffee would come with it. Or at least not been charged for a refill. So in general, totally in love with the staff, but hotel has its ups and downs.",N
1345,"My husband and I booked the hotel through Expedia.  We were landing at O'Hare super late (like midnight) so we didn't get to the hotel until about 12:30.  When we got there we were told there was something wrong with the plumbing and they didn't have a room available for us.  They already had us set up at another hotel close by and gave us cab fare.  Not bad.  When we went back the next morning to drop off our bags we were told our room was available and they upgraded us to a junior suite. Sweet!  Everyone was super apologetic.  As my husband & I told them, it happens! The hotel is pretty close to everything.  The el is about a 6 block walk.  Quick $10 cab ride gets you to Navy Pier.  Hancock building is just a few blocks away.  The concierge is super helpful and will even call and get you reservations for a tour.  The bar has some pretty yummy food.  The drinks are a tad bit expensive but they definitely do not skimp on alcohol.   We will definitely stay here again next time we are in town.",N
1346,"My friend and I decided to use Priceline ""name your own price"" bidding war to book our recent trip to Chicago.  We bid for a 4 star deluxe hotel, but wouldn't be able to see the actual hotel chosen until our bid was accepted and paid for.   We ended up w/the Knickerbocker.  My friend and I ALWAYS murder words so to stay at a place called the Knickerbocker was priceless.  We're staying at The Kinkyfker. The Redenbacher. The Betty Crocker. Mutherfker. We looked at how much the room would've been had we booked w/them straight up.  We saved more than half the price.  Hands over our mouths we were like ohhhhhhhhhh y'all just got priceliiiiiiiiiiiiiined!! Joke was on us, though.  We believe the hotel puts the pre-paid priceline guests in the worst rooms ever.  Right at about 4 in the morning, we awoke to the sounds of rumbling and slamming and racket that should only be heard at a construction site or a honeymoon suite.  We called the front desk and explained the noise.  They responded with, ""Oh, that's odd.  We'll investigate and see what's going on."" We never got a call back.  So we investigated ourselves.  Turns out our room was RIGHT next door to the service elevators (hidden by a door that says ""empoyees only"" or some sht like that). At any rate, we were rarely in our room because Chicago brought out the rockstars in us so we pretty much just used the room to bathe and change.  2 things to note about their bathroom: 1.  Rain shower head.  Finally, my chance to reenact a music video of some girl w/long hair under falling rain.  But the water pressure was too light, so it took longer to get the shampoo out.  And I wasn't used to the soapy water all up on my face.  So much for that.   2.  Dual-flush toilet.  Designed to save water.  A button for number 1, a button for number 2.  Great.  But their toilet was hella high off the ground.  My friend was getting tired of giving me a boost. 2 stars mutherfkers.  2 stars.",N
1347,"The location is great! Right off of Michigan and within walking distance of everything. You are close to Lake Michigan, shopping, dining, etc. The rooms are small but while on vacation, you are supposed to be out on the town! :)  The hotel staff is extremely friendly and responds promptly to requests.   Parking is expensive no matter where you go so if you don't absolutely need to rent a car, don't.  From O'hare, the cab fair is about $40.  In the city, you can walk everywhere, take the Ele train, or city cabs.",N
1348,"We had a great stay here and the price was very reasonable. We stayed for 4 days/3 nights on the weekend. The room was always clean and the bed was so comfortable. The shower with the waterfall and detachable spray-head were great! Our concierge Sheryl W. was an absolute pleasure! She got us reservations and wonderful restaurants that we all enjoyed. All 6 of us guys and gals really enjoyed ourselves! The two bartenders are a kick! Be sure and call ""Floyd"" by his psuedo name ""RICO!"" (As in Rico Suave)! This place was located in a great part of Chicago. We practically walked everywhere! Even to the Shedd's Sea Aquarium! I highly recommend staying here on your next visit.",N
1349,"This is a really nice golden-age hotel on the waterfront. I have to say, I didn't explore the dance floor, but the room had one of the best hotel beds.... I suppose you come to expect all-down bedding and an ultra-plush pillowtop mattress from a hotel at this level, but it was like sleeping in a cloud. The mini bar was stocked with the good stuff, including Bombay Sapphire (my personal fave). Classy bar, classy mirrored elevator.... smallish reception desk. I think people need to give the hotel a break.... it was built before swimming pools were common. My one prob with the hotel room was the bathroom. It did not have a tub, but a walk-in glass walled shower. So there was no way to have a bubble bath, first off. Secondly, the glass sCrEeched! When the door was closed, as it was glass-on-glass. Needless to say, since there was no seal, water leaked onto the bathroom floor. The other problem was the rain shower. You could only turn on the water and adjust the temperature while standing next to the hand held spigot ... right under the rain showerhead!! So.... you are forced to endure a few seconds of cold water from the shower head (even my attempts to squeeze into a corner of the shower stall did not spare me) as you switch from the handheld to the shower head. BAD design... I also had gotten the Groupon for $89 and spent Valentine's evening here, and I admit I might be giving it three stars if I'd paid full retail price. However, with the discount, the big bed, the cleanliness, and the super location, I am satisfied.",N

1351,"We had our wedding here.  I loved it.  The venue was fantastic and our coordinator was great.  All of our guests were impressed with everything.  The food was fantastic, the timing was great for everything, and the dancefloor was unforgetable.  All of the guests at the hotel seemed happy with their rooms.  I would recommend this venue to others.",N
1352,"I was quite disappointed with this hotel.  You are paying entirely for the location (which is admittedly wonderful, sitting just off Michigan Ave), however the amenities are sadly lacking and the rooms are tiny. We had a standard room, which regularly goes for $190/night (although we had a Goupon for $89).  The room was spartan and small - the king size bed taking up nearly the entire floor space.  The bathroom has a tiny, uncomfortable toilet and the sliding door, while stylish, provides no privacy or sound dampening (hope you enjoy hearing everyone do their business).  The bed itself, however, was quite comfortable. If you forget anything (toothbrush, toothpaste, etc), the hotel has you covered - for prices that would make the mafia proud.  No complimentary toiletry items here, but you can buy a toothbrush for $5 or toothpaste for $8 from the minibar.  WiFi is $10 per day, which I found to be rather ridiculous.  Free WiFi is standard these days in almost every coffee shop, yet at $200 hotel it is extra? I expect far more from a supposedly higher-end place.",N
1353,"This is a nice old hotel right off Michigan Ave and very close to the lake. I booked my stay here while a 20% off special was running, it came to about $150/night for the middle of the week. While that is a good rate I believe for a hotel in the area, what you realize when you get there is that a lot of the incidental, parking etc. are pretty outrageous. Valet parking was $55/night. I needed a roll on bed added to my room, in most hotels I've stayed in this has been for free but they charged $20/night for this too. In many ways this hotel is the bastard cousin of the Drake, right across the street. Don't expect it to be quite as glamorous or classy, but ofcourse you get what you pay for. Also the location is smack in the middle of the ""Vi-tri"" (Viagra triangle) in Chicago. Basically a lot of old dudes hanging out at the steakhouses and bars in the area. If you're not an old dude you'll want to get out of the area pronto! In summary, good hotel, great location, friendly staff, just don't come here expecting it to be the Drake!",N
1354,"This hotel was okay but not fantastic.  I was expecting it to be a lot like the Drake (which is directly across the street) because they were both built in the golden age.  But, believe me, it isn't anything like the Drake!   My best friend and I were in town for the Shamrock Shuffle.  We first checked in and walked into a smelly smokey room.  I went to go open up the window to get some fresh air circulating...well that's why it smelled like smoke.  There were cigarette butts in the window sill!  We went downstairs on our way out to tell them (I also took a pic with my phone and showed them as well) as I didn't want to be charged anything for the smokey smell thinking it was us who left the smell.  The receptionist apologized and said she would let a manager know but that was all the communcation that was made.  I would've thought a manager would've at least contacted me or something.   When going to take a shower, watch out!  You either have too much water pressure from the shower wand or not enough from the shower head in the ceiling.  I, got blasted in the face from the shower wand.  You apprently have to have a engineering degree to use the shower!   About the only positive of the hotel was David the bartender downstairs.  He was funny and hospitable.  Go see him! Overall, not a great Chicago hotel.  Will definetly find somewhere else to stay next time! Location was great though!",N
1355,"Here is everything wrong with the hotel, since I don't really want to take up that much time.  The rooms are small, we had one of the bigger rooms and it was still very small.  The workers were very very rude.  No matter how friendly they were trying to be, you could easily read their disdain in their reactions.  We were locked out of our room at one point because the hostess didn't charge us the entire safety deposit for our stay and required us to come back down.  She was very rude and didn't seem to understand us when we did.  The pillows smelled like mold, the elevator felt like it would break down at any minute, and the shower door wouldn't stay closed totally.  After we checked out, I realized I lost my house keys, so I called back and asked if they had them.  They called back quickly and told me they had found them and I could get them at the front desk at anytime.  We were at Shedd Aquarium at the time, so we came a few hours later.  When I asked they said they didn't have them and had to check the room again.  I sat for close to 15 minutes before they finally said they had them at the desk.  The doormen were very nice but I would never stay here again.",N
1356,"Why is wifi $10 a day? Taco Bell has free wifi these days. The bathroom layout was inconvenient, and the air conditioner sucked. We couldn't get the room cold. These are the types of things that a cheaper hotel does right. The location was great and it was safe and clean.",N
1357,"Our suite at the Knickerbocker is quite nice, but the behavior and attitude of the staff is beyond abysmal. First, a member of the staff entered our room mid-day unannounced only to apologize after realizing that he failed to verify that we were present.  Not a tremendous problem, but when the young woman at the front desk replied ""What do you want me to do about it"" with the tone of a flippant teenager, I began to suspect that a severe deficiency in manners may have been evident in the staff. Fast forward to this evening.  Following a lovely meal off the premises, we chose to turn in a bit early at 11:30 pm only to discover that despite our best intentions, the bass from a party downstairs was more than audible in our room. Acting prudently and with restraint, we decided to phone the front desk to inquire as to why our room had been inadvertently annexed into the party downstairs, but yet again we were met with a curt and quite rude response. Sean at the front desk informed us that the party was a greater priority for the hotel, and that the family dictated that the music was to be set at a certain volume.  On one hand I appreciated his honesty, but on the other, I truly would have preferred that he at least pretended to care about the guests who chose to stay at his property. Since we're out of options for the evening, we've decided to stay up and try to watch TV for the time being, but given the circumstances, the staff could have easily made up for the negative situations that arose in quick succession. Also, I was alarmed to learn that while I slept the prior night, a possible gang-related shooting took place mere blocks from the property.  This wouldn't have been a concern if like nearby hotels, the Knickerbocker chose to enlist any type of security measures within their lobby. Would I stay here again?  Maybe on a dare, or if someone else was footing the bill.  Yet I've had better experiences in road side motels, and the employee training regimen could use a serious revamping to better serve the interests of the guests, and more importantly simple common sense.",N
1360,Great location!  Staff is helpful too many Priceliners including myself... You can't beat $108 a night on Michigan Avenue... Bump up to a suite for an additional $50 a night.  I prefer the Intercontinnental and of course the Elysian( recently became Waldorf Astoria) but they'll set you back!,N
1362,I had a lovely three night stay here. Location is right by Michigan with all the designer shops. Service was top notch and efficient. We had the one bedroom suite which came with a living room. The bathrooms have this jet tub thing plus a rain shower. Plus I love the turndown service where they come in and turn down the sheets and leave chocolates on your bedside table. All the staff in the hotel were very friendly and always greeted us. My only complaint would be it was a little hard to control the temperature setting in our room (it was either a bit too cold or too warm). I would definitely stay here again.,N
1363,"We were able to get a great deal travelocity so this is a nice hotel than we can usually afford. It's in a great location right at the end of Magnificent Mile, and perfect for bus rides to the downtown area, as well as Wicker & Lincoln Park. The staff and door men are very friendly and accommodating. The rooms are beautifully decorated with classic B&W photography and comfortable which a flat screen tv and complimentary coffee. The bathroom is really beautiful and the rainfall shower is AMAZING! i wanted to shower three times a day! another nice feature is that the elevators respond very quickly and are a good size for such an old building. and there are three of them so it was really easy to get to and from our 7th floor room. ice machines are only on three floors so we got lucky that one is on the 7th.",N
1366,I enjoyed my stay here in the perfect location by the Hancock Tower and just off the Magnificent Mile. Rooms were very clean and comfortable and there is a grand old-fashioned lobby to enjoy a cocktail or post-shop cup of coffee. It's an easy walk to the beach and all the great sights of this historical city. I found the rate very competitive too. But the very best thing about this hotel? The grilled cheese and tomato soup! The best I have had anywhere and available on the room service menu.,N
1367,"As a frequent visitor to the the big city, I have stayed in a LOT of hotels mostly all through priceline bids and Groupons/Living Social deals. This one failed to measure up in too many ways for me to return. I went up with a group this trip and we didn't request rooms near each other, they did offer us adjoining rooms so that was very nice except they never sent anyone up to unlock the interior door so we just swapped a key and had to go in and out in the hall. Not too big of a deal but maybe annoying for the rooms next to us hearing the doors slam over and over. The elevators were tiny and although there were 3 one was broken with the door stuck half open. I will agree the bathrooms have zero privacy with every sound clearly coming into the room. No-name shampoo/conditioner and soap was pretty boring. Was also sad about the $10/day wi-fi and I don't know how they can continue that $50/day parking when there are 2 lots within 5 minutes of them that are $25 and $30/day. The valet parking does have unlimited in and out while the other lots do not. We wanted to have a drink in the lobby hotel when we got back from our nightly entertainment but when we walked up they were removing the bottles of alcohol and storing them away for the night. As we stood there discussing if we wanted to try walking elsewhere, a lady came up and ordered a vodka tonic with lemon. He made a tonic with lemon instead of telling her they were closed so then when she tried to pay and he said No charge, she got all confused (this wasn't her first vodka tonic!) and kept demanding they add vodka. He was telling her to go to her room and add it from the mini bar but I think if he would've just said we are closed, I can give you the mixer and you add the vodka, right from the beginning, there would've been less of a scene. Also, in the morning as we came down on our way to breakfast, we stopped for 4 coffees to drink on the way and it was over $20. For 4 black coffees, no lattes, no espressos, just drip brew flavored water. Didn't guess that was the average price or we would've waited until breakfast! I wouldn't buy another discount deal for this place but if I won it on Priceline, I guess it would do.",N
1372,"As with most http://Hotwire.com deals, we reserved a room and found out upon checking in that it was, indeed, a king-sized bed to be shared between four people. Aside from the cramped arrangements, the hotel was excellent. The hotel bar was expensive (as is anything in the Loop), and the ceilings were pretty low. My only other gripe was that the door to the bathroom was a sliding door, and left a rather large and awkward open space between the panel and the wall. Other than that, the room and hotel itself were very nice, and the location was excellent - right across the street from The Drake and footsteps from Michigan Avenue.",N
1373,"Nice jumping-off spot to go shopping on the mag mile. Our room was fairly big for a city hotel.  People working there were really friendly.   They're currently charging $55 for valet parking, but you can find cheaper (like $29 for 24 hrs) if you're willing to walk a block. Note:  For this hotel ""Millennium"" refers to the hotel chain, not that it is near Millennium Park.  It is in the touristy Streeterville/Gold Coast/North Michigan Ave. shopping area.",N
1379,I loved this hotel!  The entire hotel staff was top notch...the doormen were so friendly and the service was exceptional.  This hotel was a great mix of history and modern upgrades to make it a top hotel.  The location was great for shopping and dining...would definitely stay here again.,N
1384,Staff was extremely helpful and professional. Ask the bellman for advice on where to park if you do not want to valet.  The room was on the small side but comfortable.  The lobby bar is a welcoming space.  The sheets were great.  The shower was fun.,N
1434,"I booked this hotel on PRICELINE and just like my fellow YELPERS say, they don't give you the suite advertised.  I knew this going into it so I asked why not and they told me they don't for people who booked through 3d parties.  Well after giving them a dissapointed look and telling them I was not happy about this, the OMNI did right by giving me a proper suite that they advertise on their website. The hotel is a bit older but is still a great spot.  Location can't be beat, as it is within walking distance to anything you want to do in Chicago except maybe Wrigley (5 miles away).  I will def. use this hotel again in the future.  The only reason I'm not going 5 stars is because the stunt they pulled by trying to give me a lower quality room for booking through a third party.   Tip:  Any room that ends in 18 is going to be a lower quality room, do not accept this.",N
1435,"Holy disappointments! The hotel is BEIGE and kind of blah everywhere and the carpets/rugs are dirty and worn. There isnt nearly enough lighting in the rooms and the seating (one hard backed chair by the desk and one small pull out couch...no other seats at all) in the ""suites"" is non-existent...why have a suite that sleeps 4 or 6 but not enough seating for the  group to all sit together in the same room to eat and/or watch TV? The food is nothing special at all, cheap ingredients disguised by froo froo plating presentations and high prices. The toiletries are cheap and the ancient TV in the bedroom of suite 1806 is so dark you can't watch the $16 movies ( BTW- engineering advised there is no bright adjustment because of the Lodgenet remote....but then nearly insisted on replacing the TV at 9pm while I was in my PJs, ummmmm, no thanks). Only reason I even purchased a movie is because it was cloudy and raining outside and so the cable/satellite was out ( searching for signal) on every channel for about 4 hours. The room doors SLAM 24/7 so if youre a light sleeper, bring earplugs. Good news ~ the beds are comfy, the location is excellent, close to alot of great restaurants and shopping, taxis are quick and easy to find. Cant believe this is where Oprah used to house her guests.",N
1436,"This was our first stay at an Omni.  We booked this as part of a land air package via Travelocity. Located on the Magnificent Mile, it was a very nice stay.  We got a king one bedroom suite on the 20th floor.  Other folks in our group were on the 22nd and 25th (highest) floor respectively.  We had a view of the Trump from our window. Our bed was turned down every night.  Fresh linens replaced twice a day. You can request a courtesy refrigerator separate from the mini bar.   USA Today delivered daily. You enter from the street up to the hotel lobby on the third floor.  Then take another elevator to your room. There's a food cart with Starbucks coffee and breakfast items for sale.   You can print your boarding pass at no charge in the business center. Wi-Fi is available at $9.95 a day or free if you're a loyalty member.  Sign up for free to join the club.  I passed. Hubby worked out at the fitness center.   We also requested late checkout.  They gave us until 1:30 pm. I'd stay here again.",N
1437,"Just recently returned from my three night stay here. We stayed in a King Suite on the 27 floor for around 480 a night. + The service from the staff was probably the best part of the stay at the Omni. The staff were extremely helpful and professional.  The turn down service was great as well. The room was a generous size. Complimentary wifi if you sign up for the select guest program, connectivity was great. - Our bathroom was extremely small. Two people could not get ready at the same time and the only other mirror to use to get ready was outside of the bathroom and above the bar. - The carpets were stained and our pillow cases had stains on them. - The decor was outdated. Overall, the stay at the Omni was disappointing. Considering the price we paid we would've paid a little extra and indulged in a more modern and trendy hotel.",N
1438,"I came here for a stay over the weekend.  I have to say that the service was superb and the staff was all really nice.  They made our bed once in the morning and once at night.  The beds at Omni was also very comfortable, more comfortable than the bed that I slept at home.  The curtain was also thick and really good so it sheds out all the light.  They also had all the little stuff that made life a little bit better, such as liquid soap, shampoo, cotton balls, q-tips, sea salt for the bath tub, shampoo and conditioner, and lotion. The place smelled good.  TV also had cable, and I had wifi connection as well.  I had a good time at Omni and will be staying there again if I ever go back to Chicago.  Location for this hotel is also good because you are within walking distance in downtown Chicago so everything is a few blocks away.",N
1439,"Babysitting again... got to enjoy a night sitting on my computer in front of the TV while the baby slept. Its not Peninsula or Ritz Carlton, but its a nice hotel.  The layout of the room was a sitting room connected to a bedroom.  The bathroom was spacious and the living area included a wet bar and a desk.  The room was very clean and the housekeeping came down to turn down the room bringing milk and cookies - a very nice touch.",N
1441,"Pros: 1) All suite hotel, great for kids, lots of space and two TV's.  Kids and parents could watch different TV shows. Fridge and microwave were put to good use with all of our leftovers. 2) Ordered room service twice and food was delivered very quickly. The burger is one of the best, if not THE best burger I've ever had. We ordered the burger twice during our stay. 3) EXCELLENT location. Walking distance to Giordano's, Gino's East, Rosebud Italian Restaurant, Water Tower Place, Navy Pier, Lakeshore, Apple Store, and John Hancock, and Eggsperience. 4) Really tasty coffee provided for free in room (2 cup coffee maker) 5) Housekeeping was excellent. They left extra toiletries, towels, creamer, coffee upon request. 6) Lots of drawer space for clothing. 7) Didn't get to use fitness center, but it looked nice and clean. TVs on cardio equipment. Cons: 1) Sink and shower wouldn't drain quickly enough. 2) Required to transfer elevators at lobby level to get up to rooms. From street, you take one elevator up to 3rd floor, then transfer to second set of elevators. 3) No Disney channel. (Nickolodeon available) 4) Bed comfort could be improved.",N
1449,Nice.  Did a stay-cation for Valentine's day and it hit the spot.  The biggest upset-- NO JACUZZI.  I was up for a bubbly soak but it was out of order.  So sad.,N
1501,"Love this Hotel!!! I had spent and evening with a Bachlorette party here years ago and beside the $40 parking fee I loved it so much that I had to return. So just recently my love and I ate at their restaurant. It was super great. Outdoor seating on the river, booth table, great food, and exceptional drinks. I felt fancy and 2 classes above my rank. My fav drink was the tequila martini.....oh la la it was damn good. Best martini I've ever, ever had and I was a bartender. So there. My love had beers and appetizers, I mostly drank my dinner and munched a bit on the meat and cheese platter and shrimp appetizer. The setting is perfecto. Seriously if your gonna bring your date and your A game this is where you do it. This is where the magic can  and will happen. Now it gets pricey but sometimes that's cool with me, with the surroundings and drinks Hotel 71 gives, I'd do it weekly if I could.",N
1502,"We LOVED our room and our stay here at Hotel 71.  The staff was very friendly and we got an upgrade from our regular king size room to a river view.  Amazing view of the Chicago River and Trump Tower across the street.   The bed was really comfortable and the bathroom was awesome.  there was a standing shower stall in our bathroom with a rainfall shower head in it.  It felt like we were at a spa!  We definitely took more showers than we needed to just because the shower was so nice!  There was even a TV in the bathroom and it was nice and spacious in there.  Another great thing about the bathroom was it had a dimmer switch for the lights in there.  What was amazing about this was that my early morning trip to the bathroom didn't end up blinding me when I turned on the light.  I just turned it on just enough to see where I was going and then was able to hop back into bed without a problem. We only stayed one night so we didn't encounter the housekeeping staff at all.  Our room was clean and modern, so no complaints there at all.  Valet parking was quick and easy and the hotel was located close to everything we came into the city for.  For the price and location, we'd definitely stay at Hotel 71 again.",N
1503,"The location is prime. That's one of the biggest things you look for in a hotel when visiting a city for the first time. If you have never been to Chicago & are unsure of what area to stay in (as I was), don't worry, just go with Hotel 71. It is a 5 minute walk to Michigan Avenue. If you go right, you'll hit Millennium Park in 5 minutes. If you go left, you'll hit the start of The Magnificent Mile in about 5 minutes. The further down Michigan you walk, the more upscale the shops become. So yes, the location is prime. However, there are still some negative points worth noting. We stayed in room 2414; it is a corner room with magnificent views. It was also very cold, being as it is April. We blasted our heater full blast, but for the life of us, we could not get warm. I was beginning to think something was wrong with US, until I called the front desk to have someone take a look at our TV because it wasn't turning on. When the repairman came, he fixed the TV and I told him about our heater. Well, he fixed the heater, but then the cold air wouldn't work. Why do we need the cold air after I was just saying how cold we were? Well, we had the corner room with magnificent views, right? Which meant, windows around 3/4 of the room. Although it was cold and windy out, the sun was still shining, so when we would come back to our room in the afternoon, IT WAS BAKING HOT. The windows do not open out (& rightly so, as it is the 24th floor), but with the AC not working either, we had to close the curtains for some relief, which sucked because we did have such a beautiful view. There is a mini fridge under the TV. Perfect for keeping our water cold. It came in handy, too, for our leftover deep dish pizza. But when I called room service to ask for a set of utensils, they refused, saying that they can only bring me utensils if I ordered room service. Well then, why did you give me a damn fridge in the first place? I suggest that any hotel that gives you a fridge in your room should be willing to heat up your leftovers & supply you with utensils. It only makes sense, does it not? Valet is $49 a night. I didn't rent a car, so this didn't bother me, but still, that's a lot, City prices, I guess. What was annoying about checking in though was the nightly incidental charge. I prepaid through Expedia and then called the hotel directly to ask if they required a deposit for incidentals. They told me no. I specifically asked and again they said NO. Upon check in, the front desk tells me there is a deposit of $220, which came out to something like $70 a night. He tells me he cannot take cash for it, it must be put on a credit card. This was incredibly annoying because I did not account for an extra $220 in my travel budget. The clerk kept calling it a ""hold"" but come on friend, let's call it what it is - a fully refundable deposit, granted you do not order room service. Unless you want a fork, in which case you'd have to order room service. Blah. And how come the doorman doesn't open the door??? This is the ONLY hotel I have stayed in where the doorman doesn't open the door. If I have to open my own door, it's because there is NO DOORMAN. They don't even say HI or WELCOME BACK whenever we came back to the hotel. Maybe Hotel 71 should stop by a Kimpton hotel & see how they do things. There's one across the street... But location is prime & the views were magnificent. Free wi-fi, although it was spotty & only seemed to work in the bathroom, but we learn how to pick our battles, I guess..",N
1504,"I stayed here for several days when in Chicago for work a couple years ago.  I was on a high floor and had fabulous views of the river which made for amazing sunrises.  The staff were great, very accommodating, and the rate was reasonable.  The location was also perfect, as we were very close to lots of shopping, restaurants, and Grant Park.  I'd definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it.",N
1505,"The hotel staff was less then helpful, the room was small with a cramped bathroom and the airconditioning didn't work well.  the views were nice and the location is good.  but the little things.  we asked them to put something in the outgoing mail, took over a week for it to be sent. wtf? calling them on the phone results in getting hung up on.  I would stay somewhere else, the cost doesn't metter the quality.  skip it.",N
1506,"A fabulous boutique hotel with unbelievable views and amazing location! My family and I stayed here during Lollapalooza weekend because we had a wedding to attend down the street. A bit pricey, but since almost every room was literally booked downtown that weekend, we decided to go for it.  It was a great decision mostly because we didn't have to drive back and forth between the burbs and city, and the fact that we felt super fancy having an awesome view of the river and Trump Tower. The hotel staff were all very accommodating, and really made us feel welcome. I would wholeheartedly recommend Hotel 71 to anyone that needs a temporary home in our beautiful city!",N
1507,"My boyfriend took me here for one night on my 29th birthday, and we coincidentally got a room on the 29th floor!!  We had a BEAUTIFUL river-view, and just loved our time there... it was more like an apartment than a hotel room, and we enjoyed our time there immensely.  Just a hop, skip and a jump away from Morton's Steakhouse, where we had my birthday dinner.  Would definitely stay here again!",N
1508,"Upon check-in there was a flood above the fitness center. Causing havoc for new arrival guests.  Fitness Center was filled with water buckets.  Hotel staff is not attentive. Front desk concierge blatantly rude when you ask for city directions. You need to figure your own way around town. Don't expect recommendations or directions from the hotel staff. Hotel housekeeping keeps room service trays in hallways for a full day before pick up causing the hall to smell.  Bellhop staff not helpful. Toiletries are not refreshed unless you specifically ask. Toilet water pressure is extremely low. After a two weeks business stay with no other options, I was glad to check out of the hotel.",N
1509,"Great hotel, great location.  stayed here for St. Paddys' day.  The rooms were big and the view amazing, of the river there in Chicago. Positives were the staff, especially the front desk were excellent. Check in was super quick and easy and they upgraded my room to a river view! Room was large, the beds were comfortable. Keurig in the room, TVs were nice, and a big desk. Main complaints were that they weren't serving a breakfast when I was there, only a breakfast buffet which wasn't too bad but was like $22 bucks (I think it being St. Paddys day they had a lot of people taking the day off). Also the Elevators were pretty slow, sometimes waiting 5 minutes. I would stay here again.",N
1510,"There are few things not to like about Hotel71. Fairly unassuming from the outside, the interior is chic but not so much that it loses its warmth.  Its prime location makes it a short walk to Magnificent mile and other places you may want to go.  Within 5 blocks you have access to your own personalized pizza tour as Uno, Due, Giordano's and Gino's East are all easily in reach. Rooms: spacious fantastic view INdividual K-Cup coffee brewer the closet being in the bathroom was a bit weird but it did make for a larger space. Free Wifi. The bar/restaurant at the hotel, Hoyt's is also really good.  They have a very creative menu that is modern American.  Staff are all friendly and professional.  Of course, parking is standard Chicago rates $49 per night.  The only minor drawback was that I did not notice any gift/sundries store, but at least 7-11 is right across the street.",N
1511,"Great location- near Grant Park and Michigan Ave, plus on the river and a few blocks west of the lake.  Great staff- very accommodating!  One of the best fitness rooms in a hotel.  And so appreciate the free wifi.  Unfortunately, hotels are now charging an arm and a leg for that. Would have rated them a 5 if they had a pool/hot-tub and provided more updated bathrooms.  However, I slept well.  They have very comfortable beds.  And I was on the 24th floor. I had a really good view. When I'm back in the windy city I will look to rebook her.  First, I will ask if their bathrooms are updated.",N
1512,"Great location. Clean Room. No Pool, Big Room. Lousy View (City View). Concierge Service Slow. Parking Expensive ($50 per night). Great Rate Via Priceline.",N
1513,"I really enjoyed my stay here.  The entire staff was so friendly, and really went out of their way to accommodate my special request.  I work nights, had caught an early flight in, and was standing in their lobby by 8am.  They gave us an excellent suggestion for breakfast, took our luggage, and called my boyfriend on his cell to let us know they had our room ready (by 10am).  It was a relief to say the least. The bed was super comfy, and we have a great view on the 36th floor.  I guess it was a city view room, but we could also see the river.  The room was super clean and fresh, and I really enjoyed the citrus injected bath products.   The only thing I can fault is how loud the doors are.  They really make quite a loud banging noise no matter how gently you close them, and not everyone is concerned about gentle door closing to not interrupt the neighbors. I absolutely would recommend this to anyone traveling to the area, especially given the location right in the middle of the popular destinations.",N
1514,"We chose Hotel 71 as basecamp for our wedding this past October.  We also had our rehearsal dinner there. First things first, the rooms were very affordable for downtown and were so nice.  Depending on what side of the building you were on (hopefully river side) the views were absolutely amazing!  The beds were plush and comfy, the tub in the bathroom was divine (although this may be only in the suite, not sure) and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality considering the price we paid.  Plus the location is perfect!  It's right on the river, across from the Trump Tower...easy walking to a lot of the loop and near north attractions.  Our guests loved it!   I worked with several people during booking, all of whom were so polite and helpful.  We were actually in one of their suites for the weekend, we used it to get all the girls ready for the reception in and it was plenty big enough.  After the fact we decided to stay an extra night, fully intending to move to one of the regular rooms, but they told us to just stay put in the suite at no extra charge. How nice! The restaurant attached, Hoyt's, is pretty good.  They have a really great mac & cheese with bacon and truffle oil (yum!)  And as a bonus, the bar is open till 2am - which was nice for the wedding party :) We also had the rehearsal dinner here.  I worked with their catering manager, Rebecca, during the whole planning process and she was just wonderful.  She bore with me as I planned remotely, sending runners in to check out the space, and working with me to make the menu exactly what I wanted.  We originally had planned to have it on the 6th floor in one of their newly renovated spaces (which are very nice).  A few days before the event I got a call from her saying that the ballroom space was open and would we like to upgrade...no charge.  The views from the ballroom were absolutely amazing and it made for an unforgettable dinner with all the people who are closest to us! We had an absolutely amazing experience at Hotel 71.  The rooms themselves, the view and especially the service were above and beyond what I could have expected.  I'll never stay at another downtown hotel if I can help it!",N
1517,A couple of my buddies were in town for a dudes weekend. Great views just crappy hotel. No fridge in the room meant that we had to re-create prom weekend in filling tubs/sinks with ice to chill our beverages.,N
1553,"I'm a little biased on this review, because my wife and I have been spoiled at other hotels we have stayed at.  Not that Hotel 71 is terrible, they just don't measure up to some of the other hotels we have stayed at such as the Westin and our new favorite, Hotel Monaco.  One thing that is important to us is a great view, which Hotel 71 has, but the other hotels we have stayed at have a place at their windows where you can lounge and just relax and enjoy the view.  You have to stand and stare out the window at Hotel 71.  I know I'm being picky, but you would be surprised how nice it is after walking around all day in Chicago and to be able to kick back and just watch either the city lights or the river (Hotel Monaco actually has a little lounging area built into all their windows - very nice).  Also, the walls must be super thin, because we heard our neighbors, talking, not shouting, until 2:30 in the morning!  On the plus side, the rooms were clean, but are starting to show wear, which is ok.  I know hotels can't stay pristine forever, but I just haven't seen this at our other favorite hotels. They also need to have in-room safes.  This is pretty standard in hotels now, so I was surprised we didn't have one in our room. On the plus side, their personnel are very friendly and do their jobs well.  Good customer service is important to me and this is why I'm giving Hotel 71 3 stars.  I think Hotel 71 is a nice hotel, but there are other hotels in the area that are better, at least in my humble opinion.",N
1635,"Terrific business hotel if you are working downtown. The gym is small but serviceable,  the rooms small but very clean and the restaurant that is attached serves wonderful meals. The best part of this hotel for some meeting clients is the European style lobby. It serves as a first rate office away from home with high speed internet, meeting areas and coffee in the morning . Staff are super polite and  helpful. The area has loads of good place to eat. If you have the time the lake front is an easy stroll from the hotel.",N
1636,"I'm not quite sure why this place gets 4 stars. I just spent 3 nights at the Allegro and will not be returning The Hotel: It's old. And dirty.  Like something the cops would raid in Training Day 2 The room: It was the size of a large closet.  The closet was the size of a large cardboard box.  The blinds are old and fold down with a drawstring that takes about 2 minutes to fully open or close.  Not ideal.  The bathroom is great if you enjoy being able to brush your teeth while evacuating your bowels and washing your hair, because all are within an arm's length. The elevators: There are 3 elevators for a 19-story building.  Be prepared for a long wait during peak times.  I actually took the elevator down to go up at around 6pm since they were all full on the way up. The staff: The only reason I give this hotel 2 and not 1 star is the staff.  Very polite, professional and reliable.",N
1637,"Hmm...not so sweet the second time around. I was in town for a wedding and chose to splurge and get a hotel room for two nights.  I had multiple offers from friends to stay with them to save $$  but I wanted to do this.  Should have stayed w/ friends. Don't get me wrong, I still like this hotel, it just lost its luster from my original experience.  I booked my room about a month beforehand on Orbitz and it was still a shit ton of cash-ola.  Two nights was $367.  Yikes!   Check-in and check-out are a breeze, if you pre-pay.   The room was very clean and the a/c worked lovely.   But the bed was definitely not what I remembered it to be.  It was like, lumpy or something.   Maybe it had been used a lot....?  (gross.)   I do love the mirrors in the room.  You kinda have to see it for yourself.  So all in all, it's a nice hotel with the fun perk of wine happy hour.  Who doesn't love that??!",N
1638,"A-OK.  The reservation desk is on the second floor.  Confused the hell out of me, especially when I arrived during the manager's reception, which was crowded as hell.  The room was cute but the walls paper thin.  Also, the bathroom was claustrophobically tiny.  There was unused space in the room so I think they could have redesigned to make the restroom slightly larger. Free wi-fi if you sign up for their loyalty program.  All they want is an email address.",N
1639,"This was a great hotel for the money. The location was perfect and very close to many Chicago attractions. It's right next to the L and pretty close to a couple Subway stations. They have a free wine reception every night from 5-6pm, which was a nice touch. The wine they served was Flip Flop wine which was pretty terrible, but it was free so what can you expect?! We stuck to the beer. They always have beverages out and switch them up during the day. If you forget anything from home, they have lots of stuff they'll bring to your room upon request - needed a makeup mirror and a couple toiletries which they brought right up. The service was great, the room was clean and nicely decorated, the ambiance was relaxing yet trendy, and the price was right. I would definitely stay here again!!",N
1640,"I needed a hotel that was a little less spendy than the $200+ rack rate of the conference hotel (and yes, that was with the conference ""deal.""). Luckily for me, my travel agent (aka the bf) found Hotel Allegro, which was a mile away, for less than 50% of what I would have spent if I had stayed at the conference hotel. Yes, this is less than their advertised rack rate. I have a great travel agent. Hotel Allegro is a Kimpton hotel and after my experience, I must say I'm a fan. A complimentary wine hour (5-6 pm) every day? Don't mind if I do. In the afternoon, chilled water with slices of lemon and lime and either lemonade or a tea spritzer are available for you to quaff after walking around under the blistering sun. In the morning, coffee (hot and iced) and tea, along with a myriad of newspapers (by the way, you can get a paper delivered to your door gratuit), are awaiting you. Hotel lobbies are usually such dead spaces, but here, they're a lively and yet tranquil place for hotel guests to sit and relax. The only drawback is that the morning coffee is of Yale Club quality* (http://www.yelp.com/user...). The room was sumptuous and comfortable. After joining some hotel program, I had all the free wifi I wanted. The maid was scrupulously honest. I left some money as a tip for her (labeled in an envelope ""for the maid""), and when I came back, the money was left untouched because I guess she couldn't read English (I read somewhere that this was not uncommon). So the next day, I left the envelope on the bed where it was clear that the money was intended for her. The rest of the staff was also very courteous and accommodating. I had a lovely stay at Hotel Allegro and I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Chicago. *If you can't be bothered to read my review, it means that the coffee is extremely weak and watered down.",N
1641,"I stayed here from June 7th - 11th fora a birthday weekend getaway, and I found myself pleasantly surprised with the hotel. Comfy beds, trendy decor, two on-site restaurants and a world class staff. I made a big mistake though, forgetting to tip my wonderful house keeper, so to whoever you are - I was in room 602 and I hope that this review makes up for my lack of appreciation. It's completely out-of-character of me and I sincerely apologize. Thank you so much to the Kimpton staff for being some of the most hospitable team members I've come across. You've definitely earned my loyalty in the Kimpton Hotel family and I'm looking forward to a repeat visit. I hope this review finds you and your future guests well. Great hotel, Great location, and one memorable experience to keep forever. Thanks for being rockstars.",N
1642,"My husband and I were in town from London, UK for a wedding and stayed at the hotel through part of a very reasonably priced wedding rate.  When I made the reservation online a few months prior, I noted that it was also our anniversary weekend and I would happily pay for champagne and strawberries to be delivered to our room upon arrival.  At check in, the woman at the front desk wished me and my hubby a happy anniversary.  It had been a few months since I had made the reservation and during that time I had gotten some rather unexpected news that I was pregnant (Btw Yelp friends, this is why I haven't Yelp'ed any restaurants lately--morning/all day sickness doesn't allow me to be very adventurous!)  I thanked the woman, confided our baby news and told her that we no longer needed champagne (no point in me getting bitter with the hubs as he chugged down ""our"" bottle).  An hour after we got to the room, there was a knock at the door and a staff member dropped off sparkling water and a bucket of (what I thought was) champagne.  I sighed and briefly considered just giving the bottle back...until I looked a bit more closely.  Hotel Allegro has popped a bottle of sparkling apple cider into a champagne bucket and included a hand written note congratulating me and the hubby on our anniversary and our new bambino.  BEST HOTEL CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.   Although I didn't get to indulge in anything but water during the 5-6 PM wine hour, my hubby loved it.  Close to all the downtown hot spots, the location of this hotel is spectacular. The only cons...small rooms and not the thickest walls in between rooms.  Without a doubt, I would happily stay there again though!  Absolutely amazing hotel experience with great customer service.",N
1643,"My best friend and I were going to a concert downtown (July 28, 2012).  I live in Chicago and she lives in the suburbs but we wanted to book a hotel room and make a night of it.  We tried for a week to get a room but literally all the hotels were booked, as there must have been a convention in town or something.  So, we waited until the day before and tried again.  The cancellation policy for most hotels is 24 hours.  We got lucky enough to get a room at the Hotel Allegro.   It was a really great place to stay.  I've read all of the other reviews and people have complained about silly things like the fact that the lobby is on the second floor.. no big deal, there is an elevator.  They also complained about the rooms not being very big.  That didn't bother me because they were SPOTLESSLY clean.  The bathroom and closet were tiny but for us, it didn't matter.  We were only staying overnight.  The only challenge we had was that we both couldn't be in the bathroom doing hair/makeup at the same time.  That's a small sacrifice for a great hotel and super friendly staff!  We got vouchers for complimentary drinks to use at any time since we checked in after their free wine party.  That was really cool!   I also ""LIKED"" their page on Facebook and there was a secret word that we were to give upon registration for a free gift.  We got a $50 food voucher which we used for breakfast the next morning.   Overall, I was VERY satisfied with our stay there and I would stay again FOR SURE!",N
1644,"Weird hotel layout. Hotel bar closed at 12 on a Saturday night during lollapalooza. Staff at front desk always seemed harried and overwhelmed. Rooms were tiiiiiinnnnyyyyy. For the price expected better but the room just felt like a mini attempt to be ""hip""...it was as if my mom's ""decorator"" friend designed it. Word to the wise for hotels...if you want to make an older building look updated don't update it with older looking pieces and shabby bathroom fixtures. Also the mirrors all looked as if they had been through the great fire. It was a bit unnerving. I just wanted to look good, but I couldn't tell a thing in them. No wonder I had no free drinks that night! Overall a disappointment for the Kimpton brand.",N
1645,"When friends come to visit I recommend Kimpton, so for our anniversary we planned a little ""staycation"" I am sad to say I was disappointed.  I love the vibe of Kimpton, and the lobby had it, but we must remember this is a HOTEL and the rooms are sad!  The rooms had a few problems:  1.  small room  2.  tiny bathroom 3.  thin walls  4.  housekeeping was knocking on our door early in the am.  All night I heard people getting off the elevator, I wanted more than Allegro could give.",N
1646,"Honestly, I usually like Kimpton's. This one has the worst Feng Shui (why are there mirrors across from the bed? Just creepy!). The walls might as well be made of cardboard because you can hear EVERYTHING happening next door. Pros: Hotel staff is nice, except the lady at the free wine hour who carded me. Seriously? And of course I didn't have my ID because I'm staying at the hotel. Not going all the way back up then down just for your tiny glass of wine. Other pros... clean, bed is relatively comfortable, AC, convenient location... iPod dock. Free WiFi if you register with Kimpton online. Cons: See above plus tiny rooms, even tinier closet, noisy, noisy, noisy!!!!!!!! Decor = not my style. And oh, THEY CARDED ME at the free wine hour which was full of business professionals. I was dressed like a business professional, am pushing 30, and that's just kind of embarrassing to be honest. But again, the worst part is that the walls are made of cardboard and you can hear everything happening everywhere. Bring ear plugs.",N
1647,"Our room was very nice, we had a King bed, reg. room.  It was small, but very cute ! We had one small suitcase and no where to put it.  It would be nice if the hotel had a folding stand for a suitcase.  Yes,  the bathroom is small also, but very clean and nice.   The staff was great !  We every much enjoyed our stay !!!!!  Great location too !",N
1648,"Im a big fan of Kimpton Hotels -- they're always a little funky, quirky, and not to mention comfortable. The Hotel Allegro is really no different. Location is great -- sort of business district I guess, but everything in the city is walkable (granted this is Illinois, and therefore flat. I walked 15 miles in one day w/out really realizing it). Check in was a breeze, staff were friendly and helpful, and made sure I knew about the wine tastings they had available for FREE. That was an awesome extra touch as well. Lobby has trendy oontzy music playing, elevators are quick. Rooms are mod and posh -- though not on the huge side. For one to two people though they are more than fine. There are plenty of extra pillows on a comfy bed (always a bonus for me). Internet access is available for an exorbitant price. Room service, Big tv -- but I didn't use them, and thin as paper walls. I heard my neighbors having a good old time every morning about 6 am and Im sure they heard my late night good times as well. At least we all were enjoying ourselves. Checkout was easy - via the phone. I did however pay extra for a late checkout and the damned cleaning staff kept forgetting and walking in on me while I was packing/getting ready to go. All in all a great centrally located hotel, will def come back when im in the windy city again.",N
1649,"Wonderful property from a meeting planner's point of view! I hosted a 2 day meeting here this week and everything went great! the service was top notch! Jesse and his banquet team were pleasant, friendly and helpful the entire time. the food was affordable and tasty! I would love to come back soon!",N
1650,"We stayed at the Hotel Allegro the weekend of our wedding. We talked to ""small groups"" who told us to book reservations on our credit card and transfer them to our guests. This system did not work! Small groups and the reservations department don't coordinate! Anytime someone would call to transfer one room all the rooms got transferred into their name! For instance, at one point my aunt was going to be billed for all 9 rooms we had booked! Luckily we figured it out, but it took us 4 hours on the phone with them 2 days before the wedding to straighten it out. And they did not offer us a discount!!! So we went in pretty upset. Despite this the people on the phones were always very pleasant. It was just the system seemed to be inadequate. The hotel is actually a pretty cool place. The lounge areas are sort of hip and the rooms and our King Suite were very nice. I'd recommend staying here if you just book your own room. Don't use small groups!!! This may be a Kimpton problem more than just an Allegro problem.",N
1652,Very nice ambiance. The restaurants and bars in this hotel taste and fit well. Rooms kinda small. Close to everything downtown and Valet was very helpful with ideas for shopping. I would revisit.,N
1653,"I was procrastinating on V-day plans and ended up booking this hotel for a last-minute staycation. The hotel itself was very beautiful. I liked the sweeping staircase--kind of reminded me of the one from Titanic. The lobby is pretty standard, I don't understand why people rave about it. The service didn't really stand out. The concierge was not very good. She didn't really give me any helpful tips/information like they usually do. Her only suggestion was informing me of the 4-course Valentine's Day dinner at the hotel restaurant. Our room was small-- but since we didn't have any luggage-- the size didn't bother us. We also didn't hear any noise from the other rooms and the hotel was quiet overall. We got free wifi by signing up with their rewards program  so that was nice. The bed is hands downs my favorite part of our stay. It was hard to leave it :/ The location is probably its biggest selling point. It was too cold and windy to walk but I can imagine that it would be super nice in the summer. Cab fare is about $7 plus tip to the restaurants off of Michigan. I would rate my overall experience as 3 stars but I'm taking off one star for the non existent service. I will probably pay the extra money to stay at Hotel Palomar next time.",N
1659,Very cool and clean!,N
1671,"Beautiful hotel - very modern and stylish decor, front desk and concierge were very friendly and helpful. I didn't give this a five star because our room was tiny. Besides for the size I loved the view and modern amenities.",N
1689,"We loved the Allegro Hotel.  The staff was absolutely wonderful, from house keeping, to the front desk staff, the happy hour staff and door service.  They took care of us on many levels: took our picture in the LR all dressed up before we headed to a wedding, kindly obliged at the happy hour to pour a glass of wine that they weren't serving and got it from the kitchen for us, happily steamed my suit after having traveled from the west coast with it in my suit case.  And if that wasn't enough, it was btw, prior to our visit a couple of days, the hotel guest relations head emailed me a personal note welcoming us and offering up whatever it was that we might want and/or need for our upcoming stay.  A very nice touch and great staff at this Kimpton location.",N
1713,"This hotel is nice, Its got great, fun, style. The lobby is really nicely done. I like the way the room looked but the bathroom sink was tiny. The King size bed was perfect, so comfy in fact that I looked for the brand on the mattress for my own house. The staff were great too. I do have a major issue though and thats the fact that I remember being in this hotel in 1995 and I was BLOWN AWAY with the original Art Deco style of this building. Now, only the elevator doors remain. It breaks my heart to see the destruction of architectural heritage. I dont know if it was the Kimpton people or some other company that ""remodeled"" this place but I cant think of anything else when I walk through it.",N
1724,"I took my lady to Hotel Allegro for a ""staycation"" here in Chicago, and we had such a great time!  The room was small, but it was so wonderfully decorated and hip, that it didn't even matter.  The staff were all very friendly with good senses of humor, and we loved the free wine hour and free hot cocoa/coffee (I recommend half of each to get a mocha going).  : ) I stayed at a 4 and 1/2 star hotel a month later and didn't have nearly as good of an experience as I did at Allegro.   It's a really good spot in every respect.",N
1798,"My husband and I had our wedding here and we are so happy and thrilled we did.   First of all, the entire staff was so nice and accommodating.  We had several room change requests and they always did what they could and gave us the biggest rooms possible.  The hotel itself is very stylish, clean, and hip!   My wedding went so smoothly.  We had the world's best catering sales manager (Alison) who was so patient with me, and I truly consider her a friend now.  Our food was amazing.  We heard so many compliments on the food.  But most importantly, the space is so romantic and breathtaking.  It really is impressive. Please feel free to message me if you are considering having a wedding here.  I would be happy to answer any questions.",N
1799,"This visit was a follow-up to another trip in May 2012. I had some minor issues and hotel management contacted me and invited me to come back. I booked my room via the SPG website. I received an email from the concierge a week or so before my arrival, which was a nice change from last time. I didn't specifically tell them I was coming because I wanted to experience the hotel without thinking that they were treating me special because I complained once. Well, this time they gave me a lot more to complain about (and the issues were much more substantial than last time). It started when I had to wait 2 hours for my room despite requesting an earlier check-in. I totally understand that it's really them doing me a favor based on availability and clearly they were full this weekend. While I was waiting I had my luggage stored and then asked the concierge for help booking the Acura Experience. By the time my room was ready the Acura Experience was already full. I found out there was still some availability at the time I reached out to the concierge (and for about an hour afterward). Clearly she neglected to reach out on my behalf and I missed out. My room was finally ready and I gave the luggage guy my ticket to have it brought to my room. But for the fact that I was standing in line waiting to follow-up with the concierge, he would have given my suitcase to another guest. I saw him bring it to them and I purposely waited to intervene to see how he handled himself. When I finally said it was my bag the guest apologized, even though it wasn't his fault and he had nothing to do with the error. The luggage guy didn't say anything and I brought my bag upstairs myself. I really wanted to settle in quickly so I could get my trip started and start coordinating meeting friends. The employees continually reminded me that check-ins aren't guaranteed until 3:00 PM. I realize that, but it was disappointing especially since they knew about my request at least a week prior to my arrival. There were many other issues that came up and I'll save those specific details for management to address before adding them to a review. This hotel is no longer my first choice when coming to Chicago.",N
1800,"This place has a very fun and fantastical feel to it when you walk in; you definitely feel a little like Alice in Wonderland. When I've had a frumpy day, I like to go here to class up my night :p I've had nothing but good service from the waitresses to the concierge. I work in the Loop so I go to the W for drinks sometimes after. I stayed here with a friend for a ""stay-cation"" a few months ago and I was appalled by the size of the room! I literally think my jaw dropped. The bathroom, on the other hand, was generously sized. Weird. We really just needed a place to crash after drinking but had I been staying here on a real vacation, I would have made reservations elsewhere!",N
1801,OK W seriously...I had two trips back to back...Chicago then LA.  I stayed at the W in chicago and then stayed at the Fairmont in LA.... I'm thinking about exclusively staying at W's I absolutely love the W Everything was great my friend got an upgrade in her room because it was her birthday...the food was amazing...they take the Whatever/Whenever seriously...sure it's pricey...but I'm going to argue at the W you really get what you paid for...,N
1802,"I stay here a lot for work, mainly because it's the closest hotel to my office.  A lot of the rooms are really small and some of the bathroom are REALLY small, but the beds are pretty comfortable.  The service has been good and the room service has some decent options.   The bar is a bit overpriced, but good service and good bartenders.  The lobby is dark and there's always fairly loud music, so depending on what kind of hotel you're looking for this can be good or bad.",N
1803,"I absolutely loved this place, it was actually my first stay at a W, so they took my W card if you will. Bad thing was the front was going on some type of construction, so some scaffolding was there, but that was a minor inconvenience.  The door staff was super nice in getting our bags and doors upon check in and out.  Also, do yourself a favor, talk to Vanessa at the concierge, she helped out A TON on our last day there. The hotel was stylish, clean and I'd stay there again based on their music in the elevators.  Only weird thing was some 3D art that didn't agree w/ my mind after a few shots and beers coming home late.  The Fabulous room was awesome, super clean, spacious and perfect if you need two beds and you've got someone with you.  Plenty of hook-ups for charging devices and all that, kind of bothersome that they didn't have free wi-fi for the rooms, and it was only in the lobby. The bar was cool for a random afternoon drink, but I didn't get to experience breakfast or anything from the local restaurant inside.",N
1804,"I was coming back to Chicago for a quick weekend and thought it would be fun to stay at a hotel since I was bringing a friend from Minneapolis. The W actually was the cheapest hotel in the city that weekend (and still by hotel standards not cheap). I had never stayed at a W, only have heard about its character. The front (desk? Counter? Pod?) person was super nice, as well as the bartenders in the lounge. I thought the room was cute. Yes, small but not the smallest I've been in. My friend, who has stayed at W's in other cities said while this room was nice, it was not as fresh and updated as the one in Mpls or San Francisco. However, I did love the amount of electrical outlets. Many outlets at a hotel are a must these days! If we weren't really there to just sleep I would have probably taken more advantage of the concierge concept. Looked and sounded great! Notes: if you are a new Chicago visitor and want to be walking distance from anything, I would stay a little more east and north. This place is quite alright if you don't mind always hopping in a cab or on the train. There are tons of garages nearby if you don't want to $55 overnight park. I paid I think $12 bucks at one at Franklin and Wells for 12 hours. I'd stay again for sure.",N
1805,"It's a nice looking hotel, but the rooms are small and the bathroom is tiny...The location is great if you're wanting to check out the sites downtown as it's only a short walk or cab ride to quite a few attractions if you're from out of town.  It's a little pricey but what can you expect when you're downtown at the W.   I was disappointed that when we checked in our room wasn't ready and that was after 4pm.  We had to take a walk and eat lunch before the room was ready so almost an hour went by before we could actually go to the room.   Another disappointment was the view.  Lovely rooftop.  =)",N
1806,"This truly is an exceptional W.  It screams all the things that a W should scream: style, innovation, comfort, sexiness and charm.  The lobby itself is ethereal, and even if you're not staying here, drop in and check it out.  The lobby, however, does turn into a cluster. The property must've been full during my stay because there was barely room to move and walking to the elevators required some Gladiator moves. The Fabulous Room is, in fact, fabulous.  Incredibly spacious, comfy, sexy and chic. Really impressive decor and equally impressive functionality: bed, work desk, etc. Staff is helpful, halls are quiet, didn't hear a sound in my room the entire time even though I know they were sold out. Lastly, close to lots of stuff - ideal location in Chicago, in my opinion.  I hope to be able to stay here again.",N
1807,"I have always loved the W hotels, but this one was.. decent but not the most amazing W hotel I have stayed at. The reason I say this is because the rooms are really way to small - at least the Cozy rooms were. The room itself was also slightly old. You can tell from the walls and doors even though the decor in the rooms was modern. The bathroom was also way too small. There really was no space to move at all and this was the same with the spacing between the desk and the bed. It was very difficult to even slide the desk chair out. Another thing that bothered me during the stay was the fact the walls are paper thin. The room next to mine was definitely throwing a party and unfortunately, I could hear the television and the screaming pretty clearly. While the rooms themselves were cramped and older, the overall hotel decor was magnificent. The lobby was beautiful along with the second floor of the hotel - it'd be a great place to throw a party or event. I just wished that the spaciousness of the public areas applied to the guest rooms. The hotel service was pretty good though. I ordered late night room service and even though the kitchen messed up the order, they immediately sent up a different late night entree (on the house) and said that I can order whatever I like for breakfast the next day free of charge. My boyfriend and I definitely took advantage of that one and W Hotel did not say a word about it. Internet was also complimentary during our stay so that was definitely a plus. On another positive note, the location of the hotel couldn't be better so it was definitely very convenient to get around.",N
1808,"Not a fan at all. 1.) Noisy- next to the L. One day there was also amplified music outside at 6AM which woke me up- told management but they did not seem to care 2.) Generally good service (most folks really tried) but had the front desk get snarky with ,me for their screw-up, separately  eff up my reservation, and make me wait about 20 mins to check out on a third occasion.   3.) Ws are great for hipsters- they're not great if you're traveling for business. Little things (like think lights that are actually bright) just aren't there 4.) This part of town is dead after dark, so don't expect to walk to dinner unless you're not picky. 5.) The gym sucks even by hotel gym standards For the price, not worth staying here. Marriott, I think I'm coming back!",N
1809,"This place is unique and great. I was here for 5 days and had I been at a lesser hotel, it would have really worn me out by the end. Instead, the bed was so fantastic that I slept like a baby and didn't really feel the traveling effects that set in after day 2. My only complaint is that the bathroom was tiny. I mean, really, really small. When I sat down on the toilet, I had to rest my arm on the top of the sink because I was so squished. GREAT place",N
1810,Strictly based on the lobby and the bar. OMG freakin' GORGEOUS inside. Love the trendy vibe. Perfect place for causal drinks at the bar after work or before going out!,N
1811,"I love W hotels. This one is definitely not my favorite one. We opted for this one over lakeshore to get two rooms for a bachelorette party in April because I was able to get a better airline industry rate at this one. The rooms are quite small. The girl at the front desk was helpful she was able to get us connecting rooms. However, we had to turn one of our rooms from a one king to a one queen. I didn't even realize such a thing as a one queen bed room existed but ok...the rooms were the exact same size except in the king you didn't really have much walking room. Also note, the king room didn't have a real door on the bathroom but a sliding one that was pretty see through. Can be a bit uncomfortable.... However, my main issue with this hotel was the lobby smelled BAD. It kind of smelled like sewage. They were doing construction across the street which may have caused it but either way it was gross.",N
1812,"This is like a traditional W hotel's attractive, quieter, hard-to-get-to-know sister. The W City Center is still a bit of an enigma to me and I have stayed there several times.  The first time I booked this hotel, I was surprised by its location, but drawn in by the name, I made the reservation and hoped for the best.  Honestly, it is not as bad as some of the SPG hotels that I have stayed in, but it doesn't have the redeeming qualities of the other Ws.   The thing about a typical W hotel is that beyond all of the pretentiousness is excellent service and cleanliness.  This W has the cleanliness, but none of the excellent service.  Most of the service I got boarded on you-are-interrupting-me-checking-into-foursquare-¬≠under-the-table looks and uninformed service on the phones. They usually have better pricing than the other Ws, but you won't get the benefits that come with the extra dollars.  By ""extras"", I mean basic customer service.",N
1813,"From all the hotels I have stayed at (everything from the W to the St. Regis), this particular hotel ranks #1 when it comes to concierge and front desk service. 1. Bill, who works front desk, certainly went above and beyond my expectations. Upon check-in, I made a request for a top floor room with a view of the city. Bill was more than obliged to get accommodate my request. However, when I got into my room, the view was only a building. Ironically, a few minutes later, Bill called and wanted to make sure if the view was to my liking. While the room was very spacious and in the corner of the hotel, I admitted to him that the view was not to my taste. Bill then decided to call me back in a few minutes so he could look over the hotel layout in order to find me the perfect room. A few minutes later, he called back and presented me with a room that could be a hit/ miss. Not only did he come up personally to show me the room, but he also brought up the new keys and offered to carry my bags. This by far is the best ""above and beyond"" experience I have ever encountered. Major props to Bill! 2. Concierge was awesome! Eden was very sincere and helpful when it came to planning my brunch/ sightseeing. She also gave me her business card and hand wrote her name on the card so I could give to the hostess at the cafe, in order to be 1st on the list. Concierge connections such as that definitely brings value to rate! Thank you, Eden! 3. Stephen Bee (manager on duty), thank you! I want to personally thank you for listening to my feedback and recognizing the W-Team. Your follow-up e-mail was also very much appreciated! Thank you once again and kudos to Bill, Eden, and Stephen!",N
1814,"Hmmm...Thoughts: 1) I have never seen smaller hotel room. I have always wondered what my closet would look like with a kingsize bed in it! 2) They asked if I wanted to take part in the magical program (or something like that). That means that you let them NOT clean you room while yo are there and they give you 500 SPG points. Uhm...No! this is a good deal for me how? Clean my room! 3) I kid you not, The bathroom is so small that when you sit down to do your business, you have to lean back all the way so the toilet paper holder can go in front of you. This is the Cirque du Soleil version of going to the bathroom! 4) There is...wait for it...a kaleidoscope in my room on a stand that says ""wish"" umm...I don't get it. 5) On the foot of the bed is a faux fur runner. I cannot even imagine what people have done on that!! ewwww!!",N
1815,"I'm a Starwood bigot, admittedly, but this is one of my least favorite properties.  The rooms--even when upgraded--are small and not that well-appointed.  They always, always, always smell like the cheap MDF that you get at IKEA. The ""Sweat"" gym at this W is a joke:  two lousy bikes, three treadmills, and a few free weights in what might best be described as a room the size of a large janitor's closet.  They don't have a pool--which is fine--but with nearly 400 guest rooms, the gym could be 4x this size and it still might not be sufficiently sized.   Half the rooms in City Center face the obnoxiously loud L, which will ruin your night no matter how many $18 drinks you can stomach. I generally opt for the Westin on Michigan Avenue or the W Lakeshore whenever possible, but sometimes get stuck here due to logistics or availability.  I always cringe, but at least the rooms are clean and I get my Starwood points.",N
1816,"Great decor and really swanky. The ""Living Room"" lounge which also serves as the hotel's lobby is nicely decorated and a great place to grab some good grub. Right in the the middle of everything, you can walk to the El and River and Magnificent Mile. Good luck with finding parking though and I would suggest you just account for having to pay $55 / day for parking - at least you'll be able to come and go as you please. The room I got was contemporary with hip furniture and stuff, but it was super small. eh. Good times none the less.",N
1817,"Probably more like 3.5 stars honestly, but I'll give them a little boost. This was my first stay at a W and I was pretty taken aback when I thought I had accidentally stumbled into some club. The heavy odor of cologne in the air, the obvious mood lighting, and the yuppie crowd with drinks in their hands made me feel like I had just missed the annual Chicago gigolo convention. They play clubbish music most of the time too, which makes me feel like I need to dance everywhere I go rather than just walk. Anyway, the staff is incredibly friendly and gracious, overbearingly so honestly. Everyone kept asking me ""how are you sir? Is everything OKAY??"" Dude, don't be so insecure, I'm cool. The room was fantastic, though I'm not used to inspirational messages on the walls of my hotels. Loved the bath products, though we often didn't have enough. As to why this goes to 3.5 stars ... well like I said the staff was a little overbearing at times. I like good service, but this had an aggressive air about it that made it feel fraudulent somehow. The cleaning staff was not the best. They seemed disorganized most of the time. We opted for the going green option (my lady is a massive point hoarder) but then they cleaned our room anyway, negating the points until we got it cleared by the concierge. Also, the first night we arrived our comforter had several brown stains on it. It looked like a chocolate bar had been rubbed across it ... at least I hope to God it was a chocolate bar ... I need to shower now. The gym was okay, but small and lacking some basic stuff. They have 4 machines: 3 for leg exercises and 1 unwieldy one for ""all those other body parts."" If fitness is important to you, you might want to look elsewhere. And this is just nitpicking, but I'm not a fan of how they have to be hipster with everything. For example, the gym isn't called the gym. It's called ""Sweat."" I got off the elevator and was looking for the sign that said where the gym was. Finally I saw a sign that said ""Sweat (Arrow)."" It's one of those ""collapse your shoulders and tilt your head"" moments as if to say ""Really? Really now?"" Just call it the gym dude, everyone knows hipsters aren't going to be working out. But yes anyway, definitely a different experience for a hotel. Glad I gave it a go and I might just try another W somewhere else.",N
1818,"If given the option, stay at the JW Marriot directly across the street from the W. That is, if you care about the quality of the gym, the room service options and the room. The W gym (I was there just this morning) is a dingy gross room with VERY OLD equipment. 3 treadmills: This morning one was broken completely, one was locked on chinese language and shook violently when operated and one worked. 2 very old ellipticals, 2 old bikes and 1 weird cardio machine that must have been free b/c no one would ever use it. The guy next to me described the place as a ""dungeon"" and we both were just disgusted. The JW Marriot, on the other hand, has a gorgeous and clean workout facility.  The machines are new and the place is just clean. The W is downright dirty. Oh, and the wipey towels were totally dried out so clearly are never used. The room service menu is very limited. The restaurant is weird and expensive. Bottom line: If you can stay at the JW, you should. The W is a dump.",N
1819,"This place is very nice!  I loved my stay here and will use it again if I ever find a need.  Finding the building is not difficult and there is plenty of parking around if you need it.  Or if you're taking the L, there are many stops in the area to catch it.  Checking in was easy and the staff was very nice and courteous.  As I took the elevator up to the room, the walls had a almost trippy 3D effect that was cool.   The room was very trendy and very clean.  The room was fairly small but adequate for only needing to sleep and leave belongings there.  For those who travel for business, this room would work well since there is a desk with any and every kind of connection you would need to work or charge an kind of tech piece.  The linens in the room were white and the decor was well done.  My absolute favorite part of staying here was the bed and pillows.  So soft!  You kind of just sink in to a cloud.  Very comfortable and relaxing.  I want those pillows! The next morning I went down to the lobby to ask the concierge about a breakfast spot I had heard about, and she was very helpful and gave a great recommendation.   Overall I really enjoyed staying here and would recommend it to any of my friends.",N
1820,"I've stayed at this location twice - this first time was nice, the second time was okay, and that was mainly because of the customer service. The front desk staff seemed like they did not want to be there. Customer service was lackluster. This hotel is very posh, chic - I love the lighting and decor. Its slightly over priced though. Rooms / bathrooms were very clean and nice, the extra towels were a nice touch. On day two, l had to call the front desk to send towels and it took them forever to send them up. I also thought my room was a little small for the price. No free wi-fi. Okay view of the city - very good location to shopping (walking distance or short cab ride). There are so many other hotels to book in the city, and though its a cool spot, I probably will never stay at this hotel again.",N
1821,"I'm using the W's $15 a day internet to tell you that, I have only been at the hotel for 30 minutes, and I already know I will not be returning to any W hotel or recommending this hotel to anyone who comes to Chicago to stay. When I came to the front desk to check in, I told the person at the front desk my name, gave him my drivers license and credit card.  The guy tells me that he can't check me in because my husband made the reservation and ""forgot"" to list me on the reservation (in actuality my husband made the reservation on a third party site that didn't tell him he should list other people staying with him).  I had my 4 month old son with me and he was getting fussy because he was hungry, I had all my luggage with computer and expensive stuff sitting out in the middle of the lobby, and my last name is the same as my husbands last name on my drivers license, and I am wearing an obvious wedding ring.  And this jerk is telling me to go sit in the lobby until I can get ahold of my husband at work during a busy workday because it is ""company policy"".  It made me feel just awful, like why did we bother paying extra money to stay at this fancy-pants hotel if they are going to treat me like I'm trying to break in because I didn't follow their stupid rule exactly right? I get that the W doesn't want people sneaking into their hotel and it's a safety concern... but come on.  How often do people with babies, lots of luggage, and the same last name as someone who has a reservation fake their way into a hotel?  And, what would have been so bad about checking me in, and asking me for my husbands number so he could confirm the reservation?  You gotta give people the benefit of the doubt sometimes!   They upgraded us to a room with a king bed from 2 twin beds, but, really, I don't care if they had upgraded us to a suite with five rooms and a Jacuzzi, or if they have the nicest bar and restaurant in the city, the damage has been done.  You gotta treat your guests right, and this guy did not.  He ruined my stay and made me feel like crap, and I'm never coming back to this hotel again or recommending it to anybody to stay in (and I live in Chicago and recommend hotels to people a lot). In case a manager at the W reads this and wants to know who the front desk jerk was, the dude's name was Steve, he was a tall guy with glasses and brown hair.",N
1822,"I stayed at this W with my girlfriend and we really enjoyed it.  The location was perfect for us.  There was a lot within walking distance, and almost everything was within a short cab ride. The hotel itself was really nice.  We went to the hotel bar a few times, which has a nice, quite atmosphere.  We used their free Acura car service on multiple occasions. Our room was small, and we were right above a train, but the room was very clean and modern. I would definitely stay here again.",N
1823,"I stayed here for 5 days and was thoroughly satisfied with the Doble-Ya. Service was awesome!   Everyone was incredibly friendly and on top of things.  One of the perks of staying here is the Acura Experience complimentary car service which takes you anywhere within 5 miles of the hotel.   Some other perks: Coffee in the morning, hot chocolate in the afternoon, apples in the lobby, Bliss products in the room.   The hotel's location is within walking distance of some historical and popular spots such as the Rookery building, Federal Reserve Bank, and Chicago Board of Trade.  Walk a little further and you can get to the Chicago River, Millenium Park &, my personal favorite, the Art Institute of Chicago.  You'll be singing the theme song to ""Perfect Strangers"" & re-enacting scenes from ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" in no time!   I wish they had free wi-fi within the rooms, and free printing services... but I rather have the free car rides anyday.  :) Another thing that I would say is bad about this location is the lack of nightlife when the lights go down in the city.  This is the financial district...  but walk a mile north and you'll be right next to all the best places Chicago has to offer.",N
1824,"We used this hotel for the girls in a wedding party to get dressed.  This place has beautiful architecture and decor which allowed for many great photos of the bride and her bridesmaids.  They were even able to give us a day rate which gave us access to the spacious room for the time frame that we needed.  My only complaint was that staff, possibly a manager, roped off a staircase once she saw that we were taking pictures in the lobby.  Maybe she thought we walked in off the street?  Anyway, we did get plenty of pictures.",N
1825,"Service Service Service, Oh and like all W Hotels its swank as hell. How do you take a 75 year old building and make it this cool. You give it to Starwood Hotels. TK - Our concierge did such an amazing job. Transferred our bags from the Westin Ohare, were we had to stay for one night cause the whole town was booked, having complementary beer in a bucket of ice and snacks when we came back from the trade show, SO NEEDED!!!!. Running down to CVS to get meds for us and all weekend car service. I will never stay anywhere if I can help it.",N
1826,"I've never stayed at a W Hotel before and we decided to on this occasion, because surprisingly enough, it was the cheapest rate. Upon entering the lobby, you do feel like entering a club. You may even miss the small check-in area to your left as your distracted by the seats in the center and all the people lounging around. Service was really friendly and efficient. I was impressed at how nice the girl behind the counter was. When we got to our room, we were so surprised. There was so much room (even in the bathroom!). Coming from NY, you're not used to a lot of room where you can spread out. Our room had plenty of walking room and a one person couch as well as desk. The only thing I wasn't pleased about was that you could hear the train from our room. I'm not sure if every room was like this or if we were just closer, but even at 4:30 AM (when I started drafting this) I've heard the train go by many times. Make sure you bring some ear plugs and maybe that'll help? Location is good and I would definitely stay here or at another W Hotel! We used the complimentary Acura car service they offer and that was pleasant (they offer a one time usage of a car ride within a 5 mile radius). I loved the Bliss products as well!",N
1839,"I normally stay at W hotels during my vacations, so I selected this one in Chicago.  I was expecting the normal wherever, whenever service and trendy decorated chic rooms, lobbies and bars.  What I didn't expect was personalized service.  Before my arrival, I was greeted by Laurelin via email inquiring if I needed anything during my stay.  I let her know it was my birthday.  She responded immediately that she would like to offer some complimentary gifts on behalf of the W since I am a platinum member and also asked if I needed help with reservations at restaurants for my birthday  night.  Laurelin went above and beyond the ""wherever whenever"" slogan during my entire stay.  Even though we already had reservations, she called hostesses to reconfirm our reservations for both the restaurant and nightclub to ensure a hassle-free evening.  Additionally, she came to personally greet me after check-in.  Because of her efforts, me and my girlfriends had an amazing time. It was not just Laurelin that provided outstanding service.  We were asking where we could find a 7-11 and the doorman offered to go for us since it was freezing outside!  Another time, we were in a hurry to get food so they helped us get into the Acura car and called ahead to the restaurant to let them know we were coming and needed to be served quickly! At the W you are not paying for a nice hotel, you are paying for the outstanding service.  Laurelin really provided this and ensured that we had a memorable weekend.",N
1967,Hotel was awesome. Very clean. Pool was great. Lots of rules but that's what makes is so clean. Health club and sauna so clean. There is so much to do at this hotel. Pizza in lobby restaurant is so tasty. Front desk manger Gerald was so helpful. Barnard helped us with all our needs in the lounge on the 17 floor. Make sure you get a room that you have the privilege to use the longe it has a great breakfast and a great cocktail reception. Oh I forgot to mention Sarah in marketing who help me with all my reservations. Thanks again Radison... I will be back Forsure Mercedes,N
1968,"The hotel is beautiful with many subtle Chicago touches. I stood in a wedding here last weekend and it was just ok. While checking in at the front desk I was not sure what name the room was booked under but the gentleman apparently doubted if I was even at the right hotel. I believe he was joking but his insinuation was not appreciated. We stayed three nights and the first day our room was not cleaned. I called the front desk with two questions and no one picked up. The message I left was never returned. The suite we got ready for the wedding in did not have a dvd player or anything for us to hook a computer up to the tv with. When I did encounter staff they were nice but overall the experience was underwhelming. The wedding party had a wonderful weekend but the bottom line is for the market the hotel is trying to market itself in (close to $400 a night rooms, $15 dollar drinks) the service and small touches were simply not on par with the rates. We easily could have had an equally good time somewhere else.",N
1969,"Stayed here over Labor Day weekend. Loved it here, clean, gorgeous, convenient location close to everything in a safe part of town. I went jogging down the street and by the marina, which was absolutely beautiful. You can walk to most everything or take a short cab ride. The bar and restaurant are also excellent; the food was delicious. My room had very clean, simple and modern lines (7th floor). My family rented one of the condos on the 44th floor with a wrap-around balcony, the views were absolutely amazing. The door men were exceedingly helpful and friendly! I especially loved the outdoor pool, track, and garden area. My only disappointments were that this area closed to guests -- you couldn't even walk around! And the hot tub was not as hot as I would like, and a little too small. Although there was free WIFI I did not always get a good signal. But other than that, fantastic! I would definitely stay there again! :)",N
1970,"What an amazingly beautiful hotel. We went here for Lollapalooza and I have to say I was surprised at how quiet it still was with all us crazy people there. The location is perfect! It only took us less than 10 minutes to get to Grant Park walking. You've got Michigan Ave less than 5 minutes away. O'Hare is about a $40 cab ride away. Not too bad. There are 2 pools which are both lap pools, but not too many people doing laps. 2 hot tubs that were nice and heated to the right temperature. The rooms are very modern and beautiful. Don't get the side with the fire house. I'm a deep sleeper so I never heard it, but the bf complained a lot about the sirens. I wish the balconies had furniture, but I get why they don't. I love that you could schedule your room clean up through the tv. Amazing! I would definitely return on my next trip to Chicago. Loved how friendly and helpful everyone was. Oh almost forgot one of the elevators broke on one of the days and in a few hours it was already fixed. I was quite surprised. Great hotel!",N
1971,"My parents were planning on going to Chicago for my father's 81st birthday and their 43rd wedding anniversary. When I asked where they were planning on staying, they replied 'Red Roof Inn'. Noooooooo! I quickly called Blu Aqua Hotel and booked a 2-night stay (my treat!) for them. Blu Aqua was awesome! They first looked to see if there were any specials they had for seniors. They didn't at the time, so they offered a breakfast and balcony room package deal. Blu Aqua upgraded my parents room to a corner room (much bigger) with wrap around balcony. They had beautiful chocolates waiting in their room (a birthday and anniversary gift from hotel). They also allowed my parents a super late check out. While in Chicago, my Dad got his wallet snatched (not anywhere near the hotel). The Concierge totally helped Dad cancel his cards by looking online for phone numbers, etc. This would have taken a huge amount of time (and a lot of stress) for my non-tech savvy parents to do this on their own. I totally appreciate how Blu Aqu took care of my parents (especially after the wallet snatching - and helped make such an enjoyable trip). My parents are older (Mom - 72, Dad - 81). It's nice to know someone (Blu Aqu) is looking out for them - when I'm thousands of miles away. THANK YOU, Blu Aqu!!!!",N
1972,Such a beautiful lobby and the rooms are bright and fun. The staff was very nice and helpful as well. Plan to host many of our filmmakers here for Chicago Comedy Film Festival as well and look forward to giving them the very best of Chicago!,N
1973,"As a retired Hotel General Manager and owner of 2 hotels I want to express my appreciation of the service and quality of the hotel and food operation as excellent. The total staff from the front door to the bellman, front desk staff, and food service peronnel was one of the best hotels I've stayed at. I have traveled plenty and must say for a young operation I give them a 10. The room cleanliness as the entire hotel is spotless. Go see for yourself how great this hotel is. I'm going back. F. Caputo",N
1974,A beautiful hotel with a great view!,N
1975,"I totally love the funky, chic feel of this hotel!  Stayed here with a group for a wedding and could not have been more pleased.  Agree with the below review about the total awesomeness of the funky theme throughout the hotel's furnishings.  When I opened the door, the combo of the black sparkly floor with the metallic closet doors created a disco-ey feel, kind of like the room was welcoming you into a party.  This, combined with the funky blue blue plush carpet was enough to set me back a few years.  The best part of the room?  Definitely the bed.  I have never slept so well.   I found the hotel to be super quiet, and also surprisingly, with an excellent desk for me to get some work done during the day.  I loved the ease of having a nice restaurant downstairs that wasn't too pricey, yet still nice enough to enjoy a good drink and some apps while relaxing from the day's events.   The proximity to Millennium Park is also unbeatable!  Location is always key (particularly in a city that has such scary driving), and the Blu did not let down in this respect.   I also found all the employees to be extremely accommodating.  Overall, it was a wonderful stay and I would definitely be back!",N
1976,"This is snazzy hotel in a great location. You're close to Millennium Park and Michigan Ave (where all the shops are). We had a room on the 13th floor with a great view of the park and buildings. The room itself is spacious and lovely. The king size bed was very comfy. The bathroom was spacious as well. The shower was nice with a shower head atop and then a shower massage. The facility itself has a nice fitness area and both outdoor and indoor pool.  They're both lap pools and there's a hot tub as well.  We didn't get to enjoy the outdoor pool as much as the weather was on and off rain. There's a sauna, a basketball court, and a game room with pool tables. We ordered room service one night and it was good, nothing out of the ordinary.  There is one complaint - one day maid service took awhile and we had to call twice.  That was a bit annoying as they didn't come into our room until after 4PM! Also, beware even if you touch a drink in the mini bar refrigerator they'll charge you! All in all though, a great place and I'd stay again.",N
1977,"We reserved a block of rooms for our wedding here. We did have some initial issues with reserving the block, but it was during the first week that the hotel opened, so I am willing to chalk that up to growing pains. Once we got there, everything went very smoothly and we received top-notch service. There are plenty of common areas, indoors and out, to gather groups in. The fitness center is fantastic. The location is prime. The restaurant/bar is tasty. The price is average for the area, but the decor and facilities are brand new. We also took a lot of our wedding photos in and around the hotel and they are beautiful! I absolutely love the aesthetic of this place!",N
1978,"I really enjoyed this hotel!!-- It looks very new. The rooms were well designed and it is very modern. It was a splendid stay. The fitness center was very modern and well designed. It would have been nice to have towels supplied -- but, this is minor. Great facility -- really enjoyed  my stay",N
1979,"I was here for a wedding over the weekend and could not be more impressed. The lobby is stunning, the hotel has free internet (which is rare for nice hotels), the pool is to die for and the food I got from room service was great and timely - even at all hours of the night. The event space where the wedding took place was stunning and the rate we got for the group, $190, is pretty much unheard of in the area. I would definitely stay here again for special occasions.",N
1980,Just stayed at this hotel on a business trip while in Chicago.  Excellent Hotel!!  Extremely well designed and decorated with impeccable service.  The amenities were really nice including pool and work out room.  The restaurant and bar was really nice and great food. Location is really nice and easy access to all the downtown Chicago hot spots.,N
1981,"I experienced the best service and attention to detail in a hotel that I have seen in a long time.  I was impressed with the service, the cleanliness and the cool factor.  I look forward to staying here again in a few weeks.",N
1982,"This place is snazzy and jazzy. One of my favorite hotels I've stayed at. The Radisson Blu Aqua is this pillar of awesomeness that is truly splendid both outside and in. They kept the wave theme throughout. The halls/room were decorated in an offbeat sort of way that I liked, with this blaring aqua colored carpet and then half the place had these little sparkly mica bits embedded in the floor, so it was like a disco ball in the entryway. The not so good: it was very quiet until Saturday night, when there was a huge party and the people next door were ordering room service at 2am. The doors on the rooms slam inadvertently. And when they were out on the balcony I could hear them speaking even though they were not speaking loudly. In the morning, a tourist ferryboat comes by on the river with a megaphone and it sounded like he was right in my ear. And I was on the 10th floor. But if you don't sleep in this wouldn't be an issue. The noise things did not dim my appreciation of the experience much. p.s. if you are staying here while going to a conference at the Sheraton (less than 10min walk), be aware that the most direct route across the river involves 3 flights of stairs down to a lower road level. There is another bridge that doesn't involve stairs but it would add 5-10 mins to the walk.",N
1983,"I got a reservation for this hotel through a groupon purchase, and it was definitely worth it. The hotel itself has an amazing location, great views, and I love that you can go outside on a balcony (a rare treat in the city). The room was beautiful- extremely modern looking, but still comfortable and completely spotless. The staff was very friendly- both at check in and at the Filini Lounge where we had a couple drinks late at night. I was impressed by the overall appearance and the staff. If the hotel was more affordable I would definitely come back... might just have to wait for a special occasion or another groupon!",N
1984,"Very good service and really nice rooms! Stayed in a Park Suite and loved all the amenities. Really, really nice workout facility. Great business lounge... Not sure what else to say. Probably my favorite hotel I've visited.",N
1985,"One of my favorite hotels in Chicago....and we have stayed at a variety of hotels in downtown!! Staying 1 night at the Aqua made us want to move to the building permanently....if only ....*sigh* Location is great, it's close to/lovely walking distance to River North and the Mag Mile, yet you're separated from the hustle and bustle of downtown. Although our view was directly of another building, we could still see Navy Pier and the Lake. Morning swim in the indoor pool and dip in a jacuzzi is the perfect way to start a Saturday or Sunday morning!!! The lobby is GORGEOUS!! I couldn't get enough of it! Intricate gold chain designs over mirrored walls with brick column type structures and delicate flowers atop low tables...haven't seen anything like it in Chi yet. The room felt very fresh and clean, loved the modern design of the bathroom...felt very European. Great service. Delicious food and drinks at Fellini. Can't wait to come back.... another Groupon perhaps? :)",N
1986,"I just spent several days at the RBA for a conference and have mixed feelings about the space. Aesthetically, it's gorgeous. The beds are ridiculously comfortable, the shower is GIANT (some rooms have up-to-your-neck deep soaking tubs), the public spaces are inviting and comfortable. But, as an event planner, when I'm paying this much money for a room/event space, I expect some pretty high end functioning. We had several mix ups with our staff rooms and guest rooms (the hotel checking people out too soon or cancelling reservations even when we specifically stated the reservation needed to be changed, not cancelled), the shower handle in my bath broke, as did the knob that gave functionality to the handheld shower head. A member shut her glass shower door only to have it shatter (thankfully it's covered by a film that held the glass in place). And the room had a ridiculous espresso machine that didn't work properly. As far as the event space...again, aethetitically, it's great but it's not set up well for functionality. Screens are too small in meeting rooms, sound system is not created to work on an individual room basis so stand speakers that blocked the screen views were set up, and the registration area is a bar that has little functionality for the needs of registering several hundred people. As a plus, the service staff were extremely friendly and on top of things as soon as they needed to be done...which was a big plus, but not quite enough to make up for the other elements. Hopefully they'll work out the kinks before I get back there next year for our 2013 conference.",N
1987,"Absolutely beautiful hotel-- probably the nicest I've ever stayed in. I live in Chicago, but my friend and I went there for a ladies get away in the loop, and it was a fantastic time. The lobby and rooms are impeccably decorated:  warm and inviting yet still sleek, modern and colorful.  The sparkly marble floors in the room are a stand out.  The shower and bath area is beautiful, and the rain showerhead is incredibly relaxing and upscale from most hotels I've stayed in.  The beds are super comfortable and warm.  Our room had a balcony, which was fantastic, even thought it was winter and we didn't get to use them. We used the indoor pool, workout facility and spa which were all great.  Though, be prepared to share with residents of the rentals and condos. The TV was great, though I'm not a big tv person, so we didn't use it too much. I would love to give the hotel the four five stars, but there are still a few things I thought were missing, for such an upscale hotel, and those are: - Better coffee. The room includes a pod coffepot and tea and coffee pods.  But, the coffee wasn't as good or as strong as I like, and I was disappointed that there was not a coffee bar or Starbucks in the facility.  On a cold morning, it's a long walk to Michigan Ave. - Better toiletries.  I've stayed in hotels that are not as nice as this one that used Aveda products.  They weren't bad...but they could have been better. - The bathroom doesn't have a fan or a proper door.  You can hear everything coming from there, even peoples feet slipping in the shower, etc.  Seems like something they shouldn't have missed.  If you are on the right side of the room too, you can see people undressing through the crack between the door and the wall - The restaurant did not interest me.  It was too pricey for every day, and there weren't enough vegetarian/vegan friendly options for my friend, who is vegan. - As a Chicago resident, the hotel could do a better job of informing guests of ALL the options for food and entertainment.  They do not list any theatre besides Second City, and when we called the concierge to ask what nearby restaurants that deliver to the hotel, they didn't have many options or any menu books available.  It seems like  they  really want you to eat at Fellini, but with the fact that a bowl of oatmeal costs $12, it can get kind of pricey, especially if you want to do some serious shopping. - Also, the pillows were a little too soft.   I'm pretty picky, though, so that's why I'm so discriminating.  :) All in all it was wonderful-- maybe bring your own pillow and toiletries, and prepare to go out to get coffee if you like it strong.",N
1988,A stylish European style hotel located in the heart of Chicago.  Expect large comfortable rooms with stylish bathrooms.  Standard rooms have bright blue carpet and marble with flecks of iron so you get a very classy upscale feel from all the light reflecting on the walls.   Larger rooms have hardwood floors and a nice separate sitting area (suite) along with a balcony.  Wonderful views abound including views of the Chicago River and Navy Pier on one side and the edge of Millennial Park on the other. Downtown and Michigan Ave. are short walks away.  A great spot.  We've already stayed their twice and we plan to return once the weather warms up.,N
1990,"Great location if you are taking the commuter train to Chicago. I actually drove this trip and parked in the Millennium Garages. We walked out of the north end of the garage and the hotel was just in front of us. It was great. We could see Lake Michigan and the end of Navy pier from our north facing room. We did not get a room with a balcony, but since it was only 20 degrees F, we didn't need the balcony. We did not use the indoor lap pool or spa, however, it looked inviting. It is truly a lap pool, which I have not seen in a hotel before. Not much room for the kids to  splash around. I suspect the outdoor pool would be more fun for kids in the summer. The decor is modern and a little ""flashy"" for my taste, but it is a well appointed room and large compared to some we have stayed in downtown Chicago. Free wireless throughout the hotel. Easy access to bus and train stations.",N
1991,Beautiful hotel. Friendly staff. Room was a little small but comfortable. Missed having a tub but shower was spacious. Free Wi-Fi and cable. Their restaurant Filini was delicious. We had breakfast there. A little pricey but worth it. Only drawback was that they never left regular coffee and my husband needs his caffeine in the morning. I called for some but no one ever showed. Thank goodness for the CVS downstairs. Overall a very nice stay and conveniently located in the heart of the city and right next to millennium park. Look for deals on http://hotel.com,N
1992,We recently stayed at this hotel for the grand opening.  The room and views are magnificent.  We loved the hardwood floors in the room and also had a balcony.  I would highly recommend this hotel on your next stay to Chicago. Tip:  If you want a balcony room when you book your rate look at the detail of the rate and you can see if it has a balcony or not listed.,N
1993,"I stayed here in March on my first visit to Chicago, and it was fantastic. It is definitely my favorite hotel I have ever the stayed at. The staff were very polite and kind, the amenities and room features were amazing, and I could not have asked for a better experience. I loved the urban, exotic, foreign feel to the place and it was terrific. I loved the decor, it was so unique! When I was staying there, a group of architects were on a tour, so I picked up a few fun facts from them. The bricks in the lobby are from old Chicago streets! and the fireplace in the lobby is the longest fireplace in the United States. The gold decor on the one wall is handmade by a world renowned artist. It's a really neat place to stay and I really enjoyed it! The downside: it's next to a fire station. You might wake up to a siren ever now and then, but the location is really great as well. We were touring Loyola University Chicago and had nowhere to put our luggage during the tour after we checked out, so the staff were very kind and stored it for us until we were finished with our visit. Overall, I had a great experience and really enjoyed it there! It is worth the extra bucks if you're only there for a night or two. :)",N
1994,Never was a Radiasson fan but with Blu...I am in!   They are even cooler in Europe but the one in Chicago was good.   Restaurant was not my taste but great environment.,N
1996,"We were traveling from California to Chicago for the very first time. Prior to booking a hotel we did a lot of research online. Ultimately, we chose to book with Radisson Blu Aqua and I couldn't have been happier. A wonderful high end hotel & residence located in the heart of downtown Chicago's River North district.  We stayed for 5 days & 4 nights and every time we entered and left we were greeted by the doormen & other hotel staff. This hotel is state of the art in design and services. It ascends above the city and offers great views of downtown. It offers a sleek, sophisticated atmosphere, refined service and sweeping views at every turn. It's located just blocks from Chicago landmarks, such as, Navy Pier, Millennium Park, Michigan Ave (high end shopping), and the Chicago Riverwalk. We rented a car from Midway Airport upon our arrival but we quickly realized that traveling by foot is much easier and faster. This may sound crazy, but Chicago traffic is 10x worse than in Los Angeles. Another downside, valet parking (with in/out privileges) is $45.00 a day at this hotel. A cab ride from the hotel to anywhere downtown cost us an average of 5-7 bucks one way. Another reason to walk or take a cab is because parking is a nightmare and very expensive throughout Chicago. If the weather was better we would have walked everywhere. Although the Filini bar is located in the lobby of this hotel, I did not factor my feelings into the 5 star hotel rating because they have their own yelp page. With that being said, I give Filini 1 star for food, service, and price of food versus quality. This place is full of hoity toity, pretentious individuals who wear designer clothing and think they are cooler than you. The service was horrible and I think the bartender forgot to put alcohol in our cocktails. Maybe because we were wearing jeans and t-shirts but we just spent the entire day walking around Chicago and wanted to end the night with food and a cocktail.... Ok back to the hotel... Our room had no refrigerator but it did have a coffee pot. There is a CVS Pharmacy directly next door where you can find cheap souvenirs, snacks, and a nice selection of alcohol (to stock up your room). Another great option for snacks, groceries, or alcohol is Mariano's Fresh Market which is located to the south of the hotel (3-5 minute walk). My fianceÃÅ and I both packed our gym outfits and had good intentions of using the fully furnished gym, but we found ourselves occupied with other activities. All in all, this is a great hotel in a great location. The rooms are beautiful and the views are amazing.",N
1997,"The rooms were clean and impressive. However, I was disappointed that mine did not have balcony access. The bathrooms were large and very modern and we loved the the soaps and shampoos. Because it was winter I didn't get a feel for the rooftop amenities but I can't wait to come back in the summer.",N
1998,"Great deal, great staff. Great city view for now, but construction has started on a new building that will probably block the view of Lake Michigan, so enjoy it for now. Room was fantastic. Staff are very friendly , and helpful!",N
2000,"Only stayed for one night.  However, room was clean and comfortable.  Bed was comfortable, nice bathroom, decent decor.  The service and the food were good.  The overall feel of the hotel is warm, yet modern.",N
2001,"Me and my wife stayed here during our trip to Chitown in May. A brand-spanking-new place that I believe just opened late last year. Very lovely lobby area...a firepit that extends along one wall, comfy lounging couches, lots of luxury. The room was on the smaller side but very comfortable with a big bathroom and rather large shower. It is in a perfect location, a few minutes south of the Chicago River and a block from Grant/Millenium parks..so you have those attractions plus the Mag Mile and a slew of restaurants within walking distance. I would knock off half a star because room service was very poor as far as replacing coffee..they would give me two decafs instead of a regular, but I am too easy going of a guy to be that harsh and will have to round up to a five star, because I would def. stay here again. Plus, they have their own Andriod app that is actually really cool and benificial for checking airlines, reservations, getting taxi service, checking out there restaurant (which we went to for breakfast twice and was really good), etc. The manager seems very commited to providing the absolute best for the hotels guests as he seems to respond to a lot of comments on here and it is nice to see someone who cares. Great job with this wonderful hotel, see you again soon.",N
2002,"Stayed here while visiting family in the area. The room was lovely, very comfortable. We had dinner one night in the Italian themed restaurant -- my risotto was top notch, my son's fettucini great, and my wife's salad also great. Good chianti by the glass if a bit sparing on the pour. The pools on the third floor (indoor and outdoor) are designed for lap swimming.",N
2004,"I stayed at this hotel the weekend after valentines day as a treat to my fiance.  Initially I had reserved to stay at the Martiott on the mag mile on north michigan. After reading reviews and looking at pictures, the marriott didn't have that wow factor I was looking for. Radisson aqau blu had it all. From the structure of the building to the lobby entrance down to the bathroom in the room, I was impressed.  check in was fast and worry free. They were accommodating and made sure we had what we needed. Our room was awesome! Modern, clean, and relaxing. Carpet was aqua blu which was nice with marble floors and countertops in foyer and bathroom. it was definitely worth every penny spent! Our next stay will be in an executive suite for sure. If you need a place to stay I'd definitely recommend this place for your needs including dining.",N
2007,"first time stay! great hotel,great service. beds are comfortable and large showers. first class gym with sauna and steam room",N
2008,"I am not sure what this hotel is like inside, but I know the customer service is horrible. I tried to reserve a block of rooms here for my wedding - called three times and sent one e-mail and never got a response, even after talking to someone on the phone. She promised to send me information on rates and availability and then radio silence. I even called twice to follow up. Nothing.  I guess they don't need the business.",N
2009,"You may want to look at another hotel for a wedding reception.  It is a beautiful spot and the ballroom is large with a view which is rare in downtown Chicago, but the service is lacking and it is way overpriced.  I placed several calls and emails over the course of 2 weeks to set up a meeting with their event coordinator and received no response.  I never heard from her until I sent an email to her boss.  When we finally met she gave the impression she didn't like her job and was unprepared. She then floored me with the 5 star hotel price and they are only a 4 star hotel.  She also told me other events could be booked the same day,  only food can be put to the minimum (which you will only meet buying the highest priced package), and anyone can walk through the cocktail hour (the residents enter through that door).",N
2011,My husband and I stayed at the Radisson Blu Aqua last weekend for two nights. We loved this hotel! Everyone at the hotel was very nice and helpful with questions or quick to respond with requests for additional towels.  The rooms are beautifully decorated and very very quiet. The beds and pillows were high end and very comfortable. We loved the book lights on each side of the bed too. The bathroom had a spa like zen feel. The restaurant and staff were fantastic.  One evening we went down to the bar for a nightcap and found the ambiance very romantic and relaxing too. We will definitely be back!,N
2012,"The hotel opened in the fall of 2011. It's very modern, yet warm and inviting. We found the staff to be consistently welcoming and helpful. There is an outdoor running track, indoor and outdoor pools, a huge workout room, and more. Our room was quiet and comfortable with many touches of beauty. The concierge arrange deep tissue massages that were world class. The hotel is a block from Millenium Park and within walking distance of Navy Pier and many other attractions. Filini restaurant is in the hotel and we found it quite enjoyable. We can't wait to go back!",N
2014,"Great for business travel.  You're right downtown, an easy walk to the towers, and really not that far of a walk or short cab ride to a ton of evening dining or bar & grilles.  If you're lucky enough to get a river side room (50% chance), you can't beat the view, and as the hotel is the upper floors of an office building, you're never lower than 15. Inside amenities are normal for a Holiday Inn in a business end of town.  On the main floor is an over-priced bar but with a nice view, and a relatively attractive looking but otherwise mediocre restaurant (at least for breakfast as I didn't use it any other time).  Floor 16 hosts an indoor pool (a little small for those really into lap swimming, but otherwise just fine) and a fitness room with a good amount of cardio, some free weights, and a few awkwardly placed cable/smith setups.  You can get in a good enough exercise to do the job.   If you want more, the internal stairs are all open for use between floors 15 and 23, so you can make use of those as well. Rooms are average for a HI; OK quality mattress, smattering of lower-end wood furniture, in-room WiFi (free), mini-coffee setup, ironing board, room service, etc.   I was happy to see that the bathrooms were updated at some point.  Only thing I didn't like was the air conditioning unit from 1974 that was the size of a piece of furniture and as loud as an idling car when on (which it had to be a lot for this week of 90+ weather), but a few ear plugs to make it through the night and you're good as the rest of the hotel was nice and quiet. For the price and location, this is a great business stay.",N
2015,"My wife and I booked a room through Priceline from 9/6-9/10.  As you can see I'm reviewing on 9/8, because I've checked out early.  It was so bad I opted to lose the last night I prepaid on and eat the loss because it was so bad.  The one saving grace, and sole reason I'm going with 2 stars is because the hotel did refund my last day of stay. As I said we booked a room through Priceline name you own price.  We requested a room with a view.  Upon checking in they told us the room did have a view, but once we got their, it did not.  We took in the basic interior room they gave us and asked about upgrading.  They said we could upgrade for a $20 a day charge.  So we did because they hotel room was SO DATED.  If I hadn't entered in through the Chicago Sun Times building I would have thought I was in public housing. After upgrading to a King room with a view, which they also informed us that they couldn't do this for free because we booked through Priceline, we tried getting settled in.  If you didn't catch that, they saved the worst rooms in the hotel for the Priceline guests.  They penalized us for booking through a 3rd party. Be warned, the pictures posted online for this hotel show some very nice rooms.  Those were not the rooms we saw.  The hotel is so dated, it's like going back in time.  My wife described the bed linnens as scratchy.  If there was one word to accurately described this hotel it is DATED. So finally we had a room with an amazing view of downtown.  However the room is still extremely dated.  We stayed for the first two nights of our trip.  But after waking up with our backs aching from the awful, awful bed we opted to move to another hotel.  Both mornings we woke up feeling like we'd been in a wrestling match and our backs were so kinked we were literally in pain. We will never stay at this hotel again.  It was easily the worst hotel I've ever stayed at in Chicago.",N
2016,"THIS HOTEL IS HORRIBLE! I've stayed at this Holiday Inn before and use it for work bookings often since my company is located in the Merchandise Mart but I will never stay there again and advocating all of our out of town guests do the same. I had a reservation for last weekend and received a confirmation number the week before I was supposed to check in. I had guests that were unable to make it so I got online and cancelled (there is no cancellation fee). I received my confirmation, everything was good. But when I logged onto my bank this weekend, they billed me for 2 of the 3 rooms I had reserved. When I called to say I cancelled online and gave them my confirmation number, they told me that all rooms were booked under that confirmation number but they had separate booking IDs and I needed to cancel each one of them. When I previously went online to cancel the reservation, there were NO OPTIONS for that and it did not tell you that you were only cancelling one room, not the entire reservation. I will never stay at the Holiday Inn again and suggest you go ANY other hotel downtown and receive better customer service",N
2017,"I booked this trip on Priceline and snagged a great deal for the location. I called to ask for two doubles and a non-smoking room and they did give me a fair warning that since I booked through a 3rd party, that they would try their best. Did end up getting the 2 beds in a handicap accessible room. The rooms were not as renovated as you'd expect from seeing the lobby but the amenities of a nice view, pool/gym, restaurant and bar make up for that. Pros: Cool factor of a 15th floor lobby above the Chicago Sun Times building Fantastic views of the city from the bar and restaurant Open atrium lobby In hotel upscale bar and restaurant with room service options Friendly check in staff Flat screen TVs Rooms with ""span the width of the room"" windows with nice city views Pool and gym Lounge like lobby area for work, reading, or chatting Walkway from Merchandise Mart CTA station is priceless. You can walk straight off the CTA station through the mart and take the elevators onto the hotel lobby on the 15th floor. Cons: Really outdated rooms with sparse furniture Beds that need replacing Overpriced drinks Location is far from any dining options within walking distance except for close to River North (expensive)",N
2018,"The fact that the hotel is on the 15th floor and up gives it a fancier feel than other places, but the rooms are your typical Holiday Inn rooms. My major complaint is the counter space in the bathroom. You get one little triangle sink for all your stuff. Try that out for three girls and one guy. The staff is so nice and accommodating. We would ask the maids in the hallway for tissues boxes and towels, and they were always courteous and friendly. I love the grand entrances from the street and the lobby. The front of the taxi area looks out to the river and skyline. Perfect for pictures. The bar they have on the 15th floor has a great view as well. You can get an expensive drink and watch the sunset. There is an indoor pool and a bad and pricey hotel restaurant. If you are lucky enough to get a room with a riverfront view, your windows will probably be open 24/7 because the view is gorgeous. The location is a little far from the touristy stuff. You will probably need to take a taxi.",N
2019,"We stayed here for a wedding in the same hotel.  Not only was the wedding itself amazing, but the accommodations were great! Every person we met who worked at the hotel was helpful and friendly. The room was comfortable, clean and surprisingly quiet.  We faced the river and the Metra station - I thought it would be loud, but it wasn't at all. The views are the real winner here.  It was a picture each time you looked out the window. The pool was big and my kids made sure we stopped there daily. The restaurant had a great menu with some excellent french fries!  We enjoyed the lunch/dinner menus.  We had breakfast there a couple of times. The buffet was ok - but I preferred to order off the menu. The pancakes were great! I'm a big fan of the hotel bar. It was a little pricey - but worth the location!! I can't wait to stay there again!",N
2020,"Stayed here for one night. Not a bad place but the rooms were a little outdated and it was in an isolated area.  Since i'm from Chicago, I navigated the area pretty well but for first timers, it may have been a little challenge.  It's VERY quiet after 8pm over there. Not far from the nightlife on Hubbard Street and decent staff(except for the one guy who gave me the wrong room and had an attitude). I got a $90 room from priceline but i DO NOT recommend paying $230 which is the regular price. There is a nice bar there with a view but we didn't go there. It's a no frills, decent hotel with slow free wi-fi.  It's definitely not high-end.  Also, parking is a cool $35 outdoors FYI.",N
2021,"I was prepared to hate this hotel. Previous one-star ratings had me terrified (particularly the bed bug review). I searched immediately when I arrived - no bed bugs, nice room, great view, friendly staff. I would stay here again and be happy. Not sure why the bad reviews. Bottom line: nice hotel in a great location.",N
2022,"This is a fabulous hotel! I had friends that stayed here over the weekend, and it was perfect!  (I didn't stay here, but I did visit them, saw their room, wandered around the hotel, and used the concierge service with them). I think the hotel is in a great location.  It's easy to get anywhere downtown, in river north, or off the brown line. This place has amazing views!  The views from the rooms are stunning, the views from the bar are incredible, the views from random areas in the lobby are outstanding.  Really, the view is that great. The room was nice. I think what makes this place amazing is the staff.  I got a flat on my bike on the way to visiting them.  Since there are no gas stations particularly close, I thought I would see if the hotel's garage had an air compressor/some type of pump.  We asked the concierge.  The concierge called the engineer, but didn't get a response, so he called the nearby Ace Hardware and quoted me 2 pumps.  We didn't get to Ace until they had closed.  So when we returned from dinner we asked the concierge to ask the engineer again.  He called the engineer down to meet with us.  The engineer was able to blow up the tire.  The staff were so friendly and so helpful!   My friends had a great time, and plan to stay here again anytime they need a hotel in the city in the future! Oh, parking is $40 per night, while that's a lot, it's not crazy for the area.",N
2024,"I've stayed here twice - once with my family in 2010 and once for work in 2012.  Location was good for the work thing I had in River North, not so good for the touristy stuff I did with family.  If you're not familiar with the city and stay here be prepared to cab it.  Both times I ended up with ""interior view"" rooms, but if the view from the bar is any indication the city-view rooms probably have a very nice view of downtown. Lobby is nice and staff was friendly.  Inside could use some TLC, but it's not horrible.  The 15th floor thing is weird but they have elevators inside that go straight to the hotel.  I would probably stay here again if the room was $150/under and I had a reason to be nearby.",N
2026,"I went to a conference here and it was nice and convenient. There were some issues with the heating and cooling, but it was fixed rather quickly. The validated parking was nice, and the complete indoor access to a good portion of downtown Chicago was great.",N
2027,"One of the worst experiences I've ever had.  Reserved a non-smoking room, king bed with a view, got a room that reeked of cigar smoke with no view.  When we complained we were moved to a smaller room, no view and double beds.  Again complained and were ""comped"" a meal that was average at best.  Then had a hard time getting a coffee pot for the room (I believe that they thought we'd stolen one) and getting housekeeping to change our room within the 6 hours we were out at a conference.  Holiday Inn is not a place I'd recommend to others if they are looking for a good experience.",N
2028,"The view was amazing from this 20th Floor Bedroom. As a priority Club platinum member, the check in was fast. If you are one of these Platinum menber hoping for an upgrade, don't get your hopes to high, while I stayed more than 130 nights, and the absolute highest status available they  have "" no upgrades"".  That's ok. My real disappointment was with the internet. It simply does not work. I could not check email it would time out. You can't visit any pages, even http://delta.com would not load without timing out. This has been thru since I got here. From time to time it works ok ( I guess when there is less users) but it lasts just for a few minutes. While it's a regular holiday inn with a beautiful view, it is horrible for the business traveler who needs to check receive email or anything else internet related. I gave up and went down to a coffee shop (quite a ways out) to work and came back to the hotel later. If you need internet while you travel, Forget it!. Their network just can't handle it! Thanks",N
2029,"For-a-fee self-parking was the only option, expensive ($39 per night) and inconvenient (clerk claimed to have validated parking for two nights, but did not, so it held up my departure the following morning due to the parking gate not opening for me). Poor room size, furnishings, and amenities. Very poor view (interior 'courtyard' view of pool roof and concrete wall only). The separate main atrium had a very cold appearance and feel, could use color and/or planters in the 10+ levels of visible corridors. Clothes iron leaked water all over my dress shirt in the morning, so I had to reuse a shirt from the previous day, which is important not to do when visiting clients, or even coworkers. The clerk I brought the faulty iron to did not even ask what she could do to make my stay better, let alone apologize for the inconvenience. The front desk staff member who re-validated my parking was rude and confrontational. I waited in line for 5 minutes to re-validate something that was supposed to have been done the night before, and while 2 visitors were awaiting me in my rental car in the parking lot below. She initially said ""no way"" to being able to validate the parking, since I was going to spend that second night with my family nearby, even though 3 members of my party were staying the night at the same Holiday Inn. Finally, when the supervisor was involved, he took care of me right away. Validating a parking ticket should not be brain surgery, but the first clerk and the second ""rude"" one seemed to not understand the system or customer service at all. To add insult to injury, the self-serve breakfast BUFFET was $22, and they had the gall to include a line item for tip in the breakfast bill. I stayed/ate at a Hilton Garden Inn the previous two mornings, and their $11 breakfast buffet was better than this, and neither was much better than the FREE breakfast buffet at a Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn Express. One last complaint: the business center charges for printing (except for boarding passes). Overall, this was the worst hotel stay that I have had in many years. ""Value"" was definitely missing from this particular hotel, even if my experience might not be representative of the whole chain. My preoccupation with these negative points brings forth a disturbing trend: hotels are keeping room charges at an apparently reasonable rate, but then are gouging guests with expensive parking rates, sky-high breakfast prices, extra-cost printing and sometimes internet service. In the end, it is better to stick with the Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn Express, which include these items as standard.",N
2033,"Great for business travel.  I had a great room with a view of the river.  I was worried because my room was right in front of the elevators, but it was not a problem I couldn't hear anything outside of my room. The woman that checked us into our rooms, was  rather rude and unattentive to our needs.  She didn't even tell us what elevator to take to get to our rooms, other than that we had a very good tray.",N
2038,"Reserved 3 rooms this past weekend(5/18/12-5/20/12) for a bachelor party in the city. Rooms themselves were fantastic. Although I received the WORST customer service of my life. I had to call three time during the week to put my friends names on each room so they could check in early. Every time I called they said my name was still on the rooms. I had them change it twice and when my friends got there to check in, my name was STILL on the rooms. I was also told I would get a discounted rate with 2 free breakfasts for EACH room. When my friends checked in, the discounted price was only on one room and it had to changed to all three.  I booked these rooms all together and I had the confirmations stating the prices.  When we tried to get the 2 free breakfasts on Saturday morning they said it was for only one room. I asked to talk to a manager and expressed what I was told over phone and she told me that was not what was said and basically called me a liar. What happened to the customer always being right?  I mean I was trying to scam anyone, just trying to get what I was told I was I supposed to get.  Upon checkout, the front desk person tried to charge me for 4 rooms when I only had 3. I thought we were good once I told him I only had 3. Well when I got home and checked my account, I had 4 charges from the Holiday Inn. We spent a good deal of money at this hotel and did not get the service we should have been given. I am very disappointed with this hotel. I will never stay at a Holiday Inn again!!!!! Terrible!",N
2059,"I booked this hotel after alot of research for a weekend away with my 13 yr old daughter and a friend of hers. The hotel is very easy to find and has great views. Its clean and updated. Not alot of frills or bells and whistles which is fine. I didnt pay for that. I got free parking which was the deciding factor to booking with easy in and out anytime I wanted. The pool is very nice even if a little cold. Work out room was up to date and clean. Lobby restaurant and bar were just fine as well.  Great views from the bar if you are over 21.   No in room fridge or mini bar, but like I said I didnt pay for that and didnt need it.  Free wi fi. We had a great stay and would go back. Id recommend it to anyone.",N
2100,"When you stay at the Intercontinental Hotel on Michigan Ave in Chicago, you get exceptional service from the minute you check in. The rooms are super clean and the plush beds are so comfortable you'll want to order breakfast in bed.   But don't!  The breakfast buffet is SO amazing (some rooms include it, complimentary, so ask at check in) you will want to enjoy everything on the buffet...and you won't be needing food until dinner (if even then) once you've finished! I want to expound on this a bit because this awesome breakfast buffet is a good enough reason alone to stay here (but the other amenities are superior, too!).   The $28.00 price tag is COMPLETELY WORTH IT!  Remember, you will likely NOT need another meal that day.   Not only does this buffet have  the traditional fresh omelets and Belgian waffles to order,  but it had TWO different types of smoked salmon (complete with condiments- capers/onions/cream cheese, etc); an array of fresh bagels/breads/muffins, etc; a fresh assortment of fruits, brie and other delicious ($$) cheeses; amazing ""Crab-cakes Benedict""; bacon, sausage (YUM!) and scrambled eggs that were so creamy, it left me wanting to speak with the chef about how he did that en masse!   I'm so impressed with this buffet (can you tell??)!  I have traveled the world and eaten at countless fine restaurants and I would be hard pressed to find a breakfast buffet that compares to this one.  ...perhaps the Auberge St. Antoinne in Quebec, but I digress.   The point is, this hotel (and breakfast buffet) is WORLD CLASS, as is the staff who work there.  Michael Jordan's Bar (in the hotel) has amazing burgers and macaroni & cheese and the hotel itself is something to behold, from the indoor coliseum-like pool area (which you can order drinks to) :) to the Grand Ballroom that houses the largest (12,000 lb) Baccarat crystal chandelier in North America.   All of this equals something to behold in this remarkable hotel.   OH!  And it's entrance opens up onto Michigan Avenue in Chicago...enough said!! Just stay there!!  You WON'T be disappointed!",N
2101,"I never thought I'd give Intercontinental a 3 star but here we are... I love the Intercontinental brand, you know what you're getting every time you come here and most importantly the beds are damn comfortable.   If I had to compare this to other Intercontinental's (not other hotels) I'd say the single ice machine on the 7th floor sucks!  Paying to use the gym sucks!  The room is much smaller than other Intercontinental's I've stayed at and the walls are pretty thin. The pluses include a Starbucks downstairs and jumping on their wifi is simple, the staff are helpful, the concierge makes solid recommendations especially when you want non tourist things, the hotel is beautiful and did I mention the beds are damn comfortable?  I think my favourite thing about this hotel is the location.  I'm glad we chose this one but the next time I'm in Chicago I might check out The James. To the couple having sex in the next room...guy, that was a poor showing...really poor!",N
2102,"Lovely historical hotel. I enjoyed its location the most - right on Michigan Ave. in the heart of the bustling traffic! Oh yes, this is the city for sure. But I loved every bit of it. I also thought that the rooms were pretty comfortable, as I stayed with two of my family members. The hotel employees pretty much helped out but mostly minded their own business which is a nice gesture, as some of us want to relax after a long day out sightseeing/or shopping. Our huge fam frequented the ""Michael Jordan"" lounge too, as it was conveniently located right next to the lobby. In addition to that, during the mornings, we would also load up on coffee at the Starbucks that is attached to the hotel. Enjoyed my stay and would love to come back again; maybe I'll take my significant other next time! There is a possibility that we may come back sooner than later. :)",N
2103,"I recently made the best discovery since Columbus: to stay at a hotel on North (and specifically North) Michigan Ave, you'd have to pay an arm and a leg, or maybe all four of them. If it weren't for consistently stalking internet deals, I'd be staying all the way in the South Side. Here's the thing about my hotel standards: don't care about fanciness, just be clean, roach/rat-free so I don't have nightmares and most of all, proximity. Intercontinental was quite accessible (as in walking distance) to the main attractions in Chicago, was clean and not as fancy as I had imagine it would be. I checked in early since I had an early flight arrival and was told I would be given a call/message when a room is available. Maybe I misinterpreted their implications by giving a call before the 3:00 p.m. usual check-in hour. When the clock hit 3:25, there was still no call but an immediate room when I stormed down there. I was placed in a room in the Main Building, with the whole Historical Building blocking my view of the Chicago River, not that I care too much  about it since I was barely in my room. Turn-off #2: No shower caps or slippers. I've been to cheaper hotels and they would provide them if you ask. Even after calling the front desk, which directed me to some other irrelevant service that made a ""note"", I never got my shower cap. Turn-off #3: Housekeeping. While the ladies do work hard to keep the room nice and tidy, their impatience really annoys me. I would get knocks on my door at 8 a.m. - 9 a.m. every morning, asking if we were ready. No, I am in the middle of my five-hour nap and I'm on vacation, so I will not wake up as if I'm going to work. The fridge was a bit of a problem, seeing I could only fit things up to the size of 2 cans. Only buy small things you know you can fit up to or if you want to do it like I did, place everything on top. Or go all the way down to the 7th floor to grab ice. The ice room is pretty disgusting with the dirty dishes lying around. I've read so many complaints about the paid wi-fi prior to booking, but here's a trick and pay attention carefully: take your laptop, iPad, ipaq by the Starbucks downstairs, connect to the wifi and toy around with it for a few minutes and it will last you throughout the whole night and morning in your room! Not bad, eh? The staff here are very nice and the place is very clean. The staff at the front door are especially friendly and kind. This hotel isn't too bad, especially for the perfect location.",N
2104,"Hmmm, didn't get any of the same perks from my first visit, wonder if we downgraded our corp perks.  This visit I was in the newer tower and had a great view of the Hancock building.  My wireless was super spotty and I was ready to dislike the place when the front desk removed the charges. All in all, clean, comfy, safe and convenient.",N
2105,"Not good. First room had a broken shower. Second room had a funny smell that never did go away. Walls are paper thin and we were awoken each night by about 12 giggling party people coming in at 3am and continuing the par-tay in the room next door. At one point I could hear someone coughing through the walls. That's right--just a cough. So you can imagine that 12 drunk people effectively shut down any more sleep, even after we called security. The rooms are in severe need of a refresh--dusty and dated. Not charmingly dated--more like udpated sometime in the mid 90s and in desperate need of a facelift. These stars are for the location, which is fantastic, and the lobby, which all marble and really pretty. This hotel is expensive for what you get and next time we're going to stay somewhere more modern.",N
2106,"The nickel-and-dime jackassing over the fitness center and mini-bar... not cool. - I had never been asked to pay to use the fitness center in any hotel, ever. - Any device in the room should be there to serve me.  There was no space to put a single item in the fridge.  The spring-loaded charge detonators attached to every item in the fridge was disturbing.  I had nightmares about whether I would be charged arbitrary amounts for having jiggled a can while trying to squeeze a cucumber into the fridge.  Is it too much to ask that I have a place to keep something healthy to eat?  The front desk assured me there was space in the fridge for me to put something.  This was not a large cucumber.   Whatever MBA dreamt up these margins should be sentenced to hard labor because it adds no value whatsoever.  My employer puts me in a nice hotel so I can focus on my work, not so I can be shaken down.",N
2107,"We had a wonderful experience!    Our check-in time was 1:00 a.m. (late flight in to O'Hare) and check-in was a cinch!  When we arrived at our room, we learned that they upgraded us to a suite with two full bathrooms.  I had left a small note in the reservation that it was an anniversary trip and they impressed with the experience--beautiful room and cold champagne with strawberries & champagne & chocolate.   The maid service was excellent and it was a quiet room with a peek a boo view of Michigan Avenue. They allowed us a late check-out of 2pm for no charge.  We left our luggage with the bellperson and it was secure and untampered with.  The only thing that wasn't over par was the time it took to pull the bags from storage--it was a little disorganized.  Otherwise, it was a wonderful experience and I recommend it.",N
2108,"When I got there, I found I had to share a room with a stranger (my co-worker I hadn't met).  The company asked for a double bed room not single.  When I went to the front desk the guy seemed uninterested in what I was telling him and got smart with me.  Then, told me he couldn't help me ""sorry, we are sold out."" They were not sold out so he lied.  I had to get my manager involved for them to do anything for me.  Then, he had to get management involved. Finally, they put us in a double room. It was small but better than a small room with one bed. Be prepared to pay for forks and spoons when you get there.  I think they probably charge for everything but the forks and spoons are $5.74.  You could get a fast food meal with that or one of their drinks in the refrigerator. BTW, the frig is small and they load it with stuff you have to pay for.  So make sure when you take it out, you put it back.   If you have a long stay there, you won't be getting a microwave either, FYI. I tried not to bother the front desk much since they seemed to unfeeling; however, the bar people were great! I spend a lot of time at the restaurant and bar.   Their Starbucks in there are slow too, they made me late for my bus when all they had to do was heat up my egg sandwich.  Took them ten minutes and they knew I was waiting.  They didn't do anything but refund my money or my inconvenience.  Not sure if that has anything to do with the hotel but it is connected to the hotel.   I learned to go across the street after that which was not far from the bus stop.   Other than that the hotel was okay! Not the best but okay.",N
2109,"I loved this hotel. We arrive around 5am into Chicago so by the time we reached the hotel we were exhausted. The staff was really nice and welcoming. Our room was beautiful! We had great views and a clean, beautiful, large room! The staff was really nice all weekend and dealt with us crazy lollapalooza fans roaming around their nice hotel. The location is great too. Next to tons of shops and restaurants. Wifi is expensive so I suggest cruising down to the starbucks and using theirs for free.",N
2110,The rooms are lousy and outdated. The walls are thin and the rooms are small with very limited room for your luggage/clothes. The service is horrible. The staff is rude and on the arrogant side. The only positive is the location. But at the same time there are many other choices in the area. Enjoy Chicago! Its an absolutely gorgeous City.,N
2111,"Service is excellent! Prices are pretty darn great. Location can't be better! Facing Michigan avenue, it's a bit noisy. But, it's the city, so what are ya gunna do! I did a ""stay""cation so got a room. I'd recommend upgrading to a suite. (bigger, better view, upgrades = turndown service + fancy and abundant toiletries) Parking is free on Sundays (e.g. 12:01am Saturday ""night"") along Wacker and Michigan (south of the river) so get urself a room with your loved one, and chill in the city! (stay away from the $57 valet!! at least they have in-and-out privledges) Very cool touch screen thing in the room. Soft music was playing when I entered (scared me a little). And it gives you info about the hotel (not those dirty little books to tell you where ice is), as well as access to coupons, information about shows, call the concierge, weather, etc. Internet was $18/day-- wuh!! But free in the (busy) Starbucks in the lobby. It's also a very big and busy hotel, so we were always sharing the elevators and seeing people in the halls. Although we didn't hear anyone through our walls, luckily. The rooms were a big old-- but they weren't dirty. So, don't go expecting the Ritz Carlton room quality, but imho you do get Ritz Carlton level of service.",N
2112,"My husband booked spur of the moment on a Saturday to surprise me and our little boys.  He had heard about the great landmark of a pool and got it for a decent price, for a Saturday night on Michigan Ave.  Valet was $57/night.   Check in was efficient & the clerk friendly, however, she informed us that the pool was closed but that we were welcome to go across the street the the Marriott to use their pool.  Seeing as this was the first weekend in March, thank goodness the Marriott had showers and provided shampoo and dryers!  The room was a very basic, small hotel room with a small bathroom and a few wallpaper peel spots.  Days Inn quality, which is fine if that is what you are expecting.  (I don't expect this of ANY hotel on the Magnificent Mile, personally.)  I won't stay there again.",N
2113,"Great Location Outdated Design. I am an IHG fan and have stayed at several locations all with fabulous service and great design however, this location was a bit disappointing in terms of an interior design aspect. It felt a bit outdated from a design atheistic in addition to poor lighting.  This location can definitely use a renovation! The location, Magnificent Mile, is awesome; in the middle of all things Chicago! As far as future trips are concerned I'd more than likely book else where since I'm big on the comfort level and visual appeal of interior decor.",N
2114,STAY AWAY. Terrible terrible service. Have good location and think they can forget about service. What a shame. Don't let them ruin you're stay. Too many other fine locations. That's why they have the rating they do.,N
2115,"I recently stayed here for two nights for a conference and it was wonderful! You really can't beat the location which is right in the middle of everything (and across from the purple pig, which is good as well). The room was nicely sized and clean. I would definitely stay here again.",N
2116,Great location right on michigan avenue. Try to get a room on a higher floor so you can get a better view. Internet was super expensive so just tether to your phones internet. Sign up for priority club to have access to later checkouts (2pm),N
2117,"I've stayed at InterContinentals before (San Francisco, Boston), so I kind of knew what to expect from a luxe downtown hotel. This time I was in Chicago on business for one night. My co-worker and I saw the valet parking at the curb in front of the hotel but no one was there, so we opted to find the garage ourselves. That was tricky. It is located behind the building and underground. Take a right on E. Ohio Street, right on N. St, Clair, and then another right into the underground garage looking thing. The 505 Michigan Ave. parking will be on the left. Parking for one night was $57 (ouch!) but it was come and go as you please and was good until 5:00pm the following day. The employees at the front desk were friendly, as were the bellhops. We inquired about late check-out, and the latest they could offer us was 2:00pm if we signed up for their free rewards program. Eh, why not? I travel enough or work anyway. It's also good at Holiday Inn/Express, people. The room was nice (King bed). I really liked the soft music playing on the computer screen. It helped me sleep by drowning out some of the street noise. The pillows were nice and fluffy. I was really bummed that there was a fee to use the gym. I mean, I could understand the fee for wireless, parking, etc. But for the gym?? That made me sad. I love to work out and I wasn't about to pay almost $20 to use the gym for one day. Otherwise, the location can't be beat. Right near a lot of shopping and restaurants. You did A-OK, Intercontinental, Chicago.",N
2118,"A two night business stay was pleasant and I had everything I needed. Clean room with all appliances. Mini bar was very expensive ($9 for a small can of Heineken!), but that goes for most hotels now. The hotel 'navigation' computer display was completely useless as it kept crashing, so I unplugged it. I won't let that minor gripe spoil the 4 stars  rating though. Makes a great base for exploring Chicago.",N
2119,"We used priceline to stay here.  Only $80.00 dollars a night!  Great price, location, near shopping areas on Michigan and rooms were clean! I love the view where we stayed (over looked Michigan Ave.) and staff was friendly.   My only con is the gym area, that I had to pay $25.00 to work out.",N
2122,The InterContinental Hotel Chicago has a rich history as one of the city's great landmarks of Freemasonry because it used to be the Medinah Shriners Temple private athletic club at a time when Freemasonry was incredibly popular and the Shriners used to conduct incredible parades and pageantry throughout Chicago. This building is particularly interesting because the symbolic features are so prominently and beautifully displayed. As you walk up the grand staircase you will see very ornate columns and images from a time when the Near East represented all that was magical and mystic which glorious images of Crusaders and Moors. The pool is particularly worth viewing given the chance as are the upstairs ballrooms. Take your time viewing and enjoy the treasures you're guaranteed to discover!,N
2123,"I was expecting a 4.5 star experience; here's why it was a 3.0: 1. We stayed downtown overnight to treat the kids to a ""staycation"" with a pool.  We checked in, got to our room, and saw a note on our desk that the pool was closed indefinitely. Really?  They couldn't have put that on the website or told us when we checked in?  My husband complained and they took $80 off the room rate, which was nice, but we wanted the pool. 2. There was writing on the bathroom wall above the bathtub. In marker. Big letters. 3. The TV programming did not work and the issue was not resolved before we all fell asleep. 4. No moisturizer in the bathroom.  It's the little things...",N
2124,"My husband and I were SOOOO impressed with the entire InterContinental staff during our wedding in the Grand Ballroom on May 5, 2012.  The entire process was amazing, especially working with Budi Tanzil throughout all of the wedding planning.  We heard countless positive comments about the actual service during the wedding meal/reception!  The food was DELICIOUS.  The hotel was very accomodating to our guests, especially considering it was a particularly busy weekend downtown due to the restaurant show.  I am so happy we decided to have our ceremony and reception at the InterContinental and will forever have wonderful memories of the weekend.",N
2125,"The location of this hotel is great, but unfortunately that is the best thing it has going for it.   We booked through hotwire, where this is billed as a 4.5 star hotel.  It most definitely was not.  I would say it is more of a 3 or 3.5 star hotel.  Our room was acceptable, but certainly not what we were expecting for something that calls itself a 4.5 star hotel.  The was incredibly small, the furniture was worn-looking, and the walls seemed to be paper thin.     It was also annoying that they seem to try to squeeze as much money out of you as possible.  In particular, they charge about $13/day (or something like $17 for your whole stay) to use the fitness center, which seemed completely ridiculous to us.  (They also charge a lot for the internet,  but since we didn't use their internet, I can't comment as to the quality of that).   Use of the pool is free, and the pool is stunningly beautiful.  It is worth taking a look even if you are not going to swim.  Unfortunately, the morning I chose to use the pool, it was extremely crowded, and they only had one lane set up for lap swimming, so it was challenging to actually use the pool for exercise.  Also, there weren't any hotel employees to monitor the pool and I saw several people in the pool in street clothes.  I got out when I noticed the baby that had a regular diaper (not a swim diaper) on--yuck!   My biggest issue was that this hotel was just not what we expected.  Had we booked a 3 star hotel, it would have met our expectations   But since we were expecting something on the level of a 4.5 star hotel, we were disappointed.",N
2126,We were surprised that our room was available at 10 AM. That's always a plus. We did end up getting a wheel-chair accessible room and didn't realize this until I was taking a shower and water was everywhere. I tend to be pretty clutzy and if it weren't for my boyfriend coming in to hand me a razor I was more then likely going to fall on my ass. We went downstairs and spoke to the manager immediately and she ended up upgrading us to a suite with 2 bathrooms. Woohoo! If you're a girl needing your time to doll yourself up for luxe dinners and nights out - you would be ecstatic too! We also complained about the pool and the gym being an extra fee so she ended up giving us a 3 day pass to L.A. Fitness. The doorman and bellhop were really chatty and seemed to really care about providing great service. Minus the room mix-up I'd definitely stay at another Intercontinental hotel again.,N
2129,"This hotel was immaculate. Beautiful room, quick check in and check out. Swimming pool (WOW) is amazing BRING YOUR SUIT! Great location, would stay here again.",N
2130,"Shockingly terrible.  I come to Chicago maybe once a month for business and typically have enjoyed the Trump.  This place was recommended by my travel people, as close to office, nice etc. What I encountered are rude staff, a tiny room with no amenities, $7 bottles of water, a weird touch screen and tiny TV.   There are no towel racks in bathroom.  Turn down service was nonexistent.  Internet is $17 a night, shouldn't that be free by now? The hotel is massive and there are no personal touches to make you feel more at home which are essential when traveling for work. Needless to say I will never stay here again and will recommend all my colleagues to avoid.",N
2132,"Lovely, well-presented room. Small-ish but very nice bathroom (with a nice big counter!). Room was impeccably clean and everyone we interacted with was so kind and accommodating (especially the bell-men). The hotel was very quiet, even though our window overlooked Michigan Avenue. Beds were super comfortable. The only thing to complain about is the BS internet fee ($15 a DAY?!).. but that's all nice hotels these days. Perfect location; convenient to the lake shore path for runners :)",N
2140,Dependable enough and really well located on Michigan Avenue.  But I do not understand why the InterCon chain - in general - charges a fee for it's fitness centers for people who aren't status members... Ridiculous!,N
2198,"Love the pool at the Intercontinental Hotel on Michigan Avenue.  The pool is back in business after being shut down by the city of Chicago for a few months (like many other pools in the city).  Well, now the most famous pool in Chicago is back and so refreshing...not small kid friendly so bring water wings, floaties, etc for the small kids.  Health club staff, Robert and Tereza, are exceptional.  Always friendly and courteous....a great asset to the hotel.  Locker rooms are clean and have dry saunas in both the men's and women's sides.  Always good for a sweat!  Would be great if they could remove the massage room in the men's locker room and replace it with a steam room.  It's too noisy in the locker room to have the massage room next to the showers.  Ask to have your massage in the more private space.  Also, the health club is getting all new flooring and new equipment this week.  Can't wait to try out the new state of the art equipment.",N
2207,"Stayed here over the weekend 2/11/12 and I will say that for the most part, I enjoyed my stay.  We arrived in Chicago around 11 a.m. and were able to check in right away. Check in was fast and my husband had no problems.  (We typically stay at Intercontinentals and have had our share of problems with checking in on past vacations.)  The room was clean and decent - had 2 full bathrooms and we had a view of Michigan Avenue from the 10th floor which was nice.  The location was great and it is right across the street from a mall and right by all the North Michigan shopping areas.  I was impressed with the bed - it was very comfortable.  Bed and pillows were perfect - and for me, that doesn't happen very often.  The hotel has a place called Eno which is a place where you can sample wine, chocolates, and cheese and the Michael Jordan Steakhouse is also inside.  Valet and doormen were very helpful which was appreciated.  The only downfall of our trip and the reason why I didn't give the hotel 4 stars is because it was very loud as I was trying to go to sleep.  The walls appear to be very thin and the group in the room next to me were being very loud - laughing, talking (I could tell you every word in their conversations...) and just having a good time.  Now I understand that I am in downtown Chicago on a Saturday night, however, I am a customer too and I feel that at 1:30 a.m, I should be able to get some rest.  I called downstairs to ask the front desk what could be done and she said she would send security up....around 2:30 a.m., the noise finally stopped.  It wouldn't have been a big deal if I didn't have a train to catch at 6:00 a.m.  But anyways, that was the only thing I didn't like, that it took security almost an hour to get the people quieted down.  Good hotel otherwise.  Oh, I almost forgot.  Right now the pool is closed for renovations and hotel valet overnight is $54.  Wowza, good thing we took a cab.  Cabs are aplenty in this area so that was no problem, but Michigan Ave. is very trafficky, so you may pay more because you sit in traffic a lot.  Also, the hotel in general is a bit noisy because cabbies like to honk their horns as if it's gonna make anyone move faster, and that can be heard from inside the hotel at times.",N
2257,"Ahhh, Marriott chain, I have come to really appreciate you! * Firm mattresses * Great pillows * An awesome city view from our 31st floor room * Super early check-in availability, which we were not expecting at all * Flavored ice water in the lobby * Yummy Bath & Body Works products in the bathroom (they smell like Fresh Sugar) * Full Starbucks location in the lobby * FedEx location on the second floor * Bar in the lobby Even though your bedside outlets are only accessible by moving the bedside drawers, we had no fridge in the room, and the water pressure in the shower is pretty low, I'm still a fan!",N
2258,"We had a pre-wedding dinner party at the Marriott on Michigan Ave, and we were absolutely floored by the extraordinary level of commitment shown by every member of the Marriott staff. Kristina Cappazoli helped us plan out our event, and was amazing right from the get go. Each time we interacted with her, we felt more confident that the dinner would go well -- and it did! We continue to get compliments from our guests on how wonderful everything was -- the food, the ambiance, the service. It all added up to an unforgettable night, and we owe thanks to Kristina for helping us make it happen. Special shout out to Cheryl B, the amazingly talented pastry chef who designed our wedding cake. She came up with some excellent designs, and was willing to adapt to our tastes and preferences. More than one guest came up and told us it was the best wedding cake they had ever tasted. If you have to plan an event in the Chicago downtown area -- I'd wholeheartedly recommend the Marriott, especially if you get to work with Kristina and Cheryl!",N
2259,"GREAT location, that's worth it in itself. Clean rooms, comfy beds. They have a nice bar in the middle of the lobby, and a Starbucks as well. Our concierge (Matthew, I believe) was incredibly accommodating and gave us a jump the line (and free appetizer) coupon to Gino's East (YUM), which was much appreciated by an out of towner like myself. This Marriott is walking distance from tons of shopping (Zara, Topshop, H&M, etc) and dining spots. I would definitely stay here again.",N
2260,"Good hotel, great location and nice on-property amenities for business (FedEx Office, Starbucks).",N
2261,The hotel is a great location on the Magnificent Mile and across the street from Nordstom's!  Praise the lord the Marriott Downtown hotel had the availability since I was scheduled to have my event at the JW Marriott (ahem Legionnaire's disease - no thanks!).  Anyway it all worked out the catering & hotel staff is top notch here.  Everyone is super friendly and helpful.  Plus they have an abundance of meeting space.  The hotel rooms are small and needs updating.  But who's complaining...this hotel is great for meetings.,N
2262,"I was extremely surprised that i was checked into a room #2107 friday 5/25/2012 where the room was hotter than outside 80 degrees, smelled like old wet carpet and when you turn the light on you can see the dust on the desk and on frames etc . The desk the LCD was on was chipped. I felt like i was in a motel 6. The blue chair, it was white smugges/stuff on it. I'm thinking this can't be happening. This must be a bad dream. Wow! Now don't get me wrong love the Marriott and I have stayed in some of the Marriott hotels in different cities. But this is a first I experienced this at the Marriott especially downtown and I'm still in shock. I called their front desk/ays dept and informed them it seem like no one hasn't stayed in this room for a while.Even though  I had turned on the room temperature 50 degrees at 7pm, at 4am the next morning it still felt like it was 85 degrees in that hotel room. The gentleman front desk/ays dept stated that if i would like to have an engineer to come and fix it. I'm thinking at 4am in the morning and my fiance and I will have to get up and put cloths on because they placed us in a room they knew was not used in months and that the air condition didn't work. So i said no, because it's going to be an inconvenience and checkout is at 11am so I stated that it wouldn't help. The gentleman explained to me that the building is old and needs some minor repairs and he apologizes. I'm thinking WOW!!!! But then, an Express checkout/bill was placed under my door. LOL!!!! But I was not offered and continential breakfast or a refund or anything. LOL!! Wow!!! Not even an room change was offered. Lmao!!! I know this is not the type of service that Mr. Marriott will ever agree with. Mr. Marriott always has pride his self and the corporation on cleanliness and providing exceptional service and great customer service.",N
2263,"If you are a type A personality do not stay here. You will find things about this hotel that bother you and you can't figure out how to make it not bother you. I stayed for 4 nights on the 38 floor and went to a conference at the courtyard Marriott down the street. Pros: Wifi worked all over the hotel for me There is a Starbucks in the hotel (with limited hrs of 6 am to 8 pm) Great location on the strip, especially with all the new stores popping up on the street Room service was super nice and generous (although food sucked but since when has room service ever had good food?!) Morning concierge staff was nice and helpful Air conditioner worked GREAT on the hot nights I was there Huge workout room Cons: Room did not have the most pleasant smell (smelt like feet) Infrequent hot water availability (I wear a pliable splint that needs to be heated up and had to sleep one night without it) A wet pillow case was left in the room by cleaning service Check-in concierge was extremely rude Overall, the hotel was in an amazing spot! I won't lie, it was nice when I went shopping and had a quick stop in between. But in reality, I felt like I was at a super 8 or something of that caliber. There was one morning when I left (8am) and before my door even closed, a cleaning staff member jumped in to start cleaning the room. I understand you have a job to do but at least wait until the door is closed and use the room key! Warning, if you are not a big fan of noisy lobbies then stay clear of here. The hotel bar is in an atrium and all noise there is amplified. I didn't mind it but in the morning it was strange. If you have stayed with Marriott before, you might be disappointed. If you simply don't care about much in a hotel, stay here...you'll be fine and won't care about the same things us anal-type a personalities do!",N
2264,"One of my favorite hotels in CHI- it's your standard cookie cutter Marriott as far as the rooms are concerned, but the location is excellent, right in the middle of Michigan Ave. Also, the staff are really friendly, a cut about the standard Marriott. Lastly, the concierge lounge is pretty big and serves up a good spread. Overall, a good place to stay in downtown unless you want to spring for the Westin.",N
2265,"I stayed at this hotel for a conference the week of June 4. The conference facilities are nice, and what one would expect from a hotel located in a downtown district. The rooms were clean, and updated with a contemporary look. The lobby is large and open. The pros: -location -staff is very helpful and friendly -lobby bar is lively and serves decent drinks The cons: -the wifi access throughout the facility is spotty and extremely cumbersome. Being there for a conference, I was also working. I needed reliable access for the multiple devices I travel with. One can login as a guest in one's room, but when one tries to login on the conference levels, the same network is either unavailable or unusable. Same is true when trying to access via the lobby -- there is a separate network, apparently, for each of these areas. My iPhone was virtually unusable via wifi outside of my room, same for my iPad. The 3G access is awful as well. Text messages between myself and a colleague (also staying at the same hotel) were spotty -- either not arriving at all or taking several minutes to arrive. If you're considering staying here as a business traveler, I would recommend one of the many other options in the immediate vicinity. Obviously, based on the above, I place a premium on broadband internet access which has colored this review. Fast, reliable access is a must for me and the hotel fell woefully short in this regard. That said, it was a perfectly acceptable experience outside of the wifi issues, and based on the moderate price, might be a good choice for those looking for a room in the heart of the magnificent mile. There is extremely easy walking access to multiple great restaurants, and the art institute is just a nice stroll down Michigan Ave away.",N
2266,"I try and stay here every June for The World Trade Fair - NEOCON. It's the perfect location right on Michigan Avenue (NR Wacker) where all the shops start and right next to Nordstrom also walkable to the Merchandise Mart. The rooms are small, but comfortable for one person on a business trip for a couple of nights. Very comfortable beds and bedding. The customer service I found to be good. The AC was leaking in the floor outside the bathroom in my room and the carpet was wet. The maintenance guy was up within 10 minutes with the bell boy with rugs and asking if I wanted to switch rooms.",N
2267,"We had our September 24, 2011 wedding at the Marriott on Michigan Avenue and I cannot say enough great things about the staff we worked with. From the inital planning stages of our wedding to the day of the big event and even days later, I could not be happier with the service we received from everyone we crossed paths with. The bellmen were friendly and helpful. Maintenance and housekeeping accommodated all of our extra requests, the bartenders and wait staff were quick, courteous, and efficient. Special shout out to Amy Stage and Kristina Cappazoli from the Event Planning team. They are both so great at their jobs and they made the process of planning a wedding painless and ENJOYABLE. their knowledge, expertise, and willingness to go above and beyond made our wedding so spectacular. We still to this day get compliments from guests on how wonderful the food was at our cocktail hour and reception. People who say wedding food can't be elegant and delicious haven't eaten at a wedding here. We had four dinner options and all were fantastic and delicious - the horseradish crusted salmon was succulent, the filet of beef was perfectly cooked and paired with the most amazing red onion confit, the cranberry cornbread stuffed chicken breast was juicy, and the vegetarian paella was a hit with my vegetarian and vegan friends. SERIOUSLY, the entrees and sides were the best I've had at a wedding to date, and i'm not just saying that because it was my wedding. One last shout out to Cheryl B, the amazing and talented pastry chef. She made the most beautiful and delicious 5 tier wedding cake with three different cake flavors and fillings. The cakes were moist and tender while the fillings and buttercream were light, fluffy and delicious.",N
2268,"Had a great weekend in Chicago; hotel location is perfect, but that's about all it has going for it.  Room wasnt ready till 5pm on check in day.  First room was moldy smelling; walls are paper thin, lobby is bright, loud, and uninviting, pool is fun, but tiny. room AC not up to par.   Bill- the GM - appears to have no sense of customer service/customer satisfaction skills.  WIll definitely try another hotel next time, and would not recommend this. I expected more - Very disappointed for a Marriott",N
2269,"We stay in a Marriott over 200 nights a year and this is by far the worst we have been to! We were checked into a dirty as well as awful smelling room. Then we called to get a new room and it took them almost an hour to find us one and kept telling us to wait in a room that smelled so bad I was getting a headache. Then they only activated out keys for one night so we we went all the way up to our room the second day for the key to not work. We took it down and the manager was extremely rude!!!! The only thing he could say was and I quote ""I hope it gets better for you."" Everyone here is rude but the manager was by far the worst. we would never stay here again and we would never recommend it. The rooms weren't even that great. Next time we are in Chicago we will definitely be staying at the JW Marriott.  This place doesn't even deserve 1 star.",N
2270,"We stayed here last weekend for the IGI gymnastics girls meet and they catered to us very well.  The staff was great - and I mean everyone I encountered or talked to were very attentive and responsive to any needs we had.  They not only answered our questions but they also engaged in real conversations like real people.  Very impressive. The three star rating is only because I have been to much nicer, bigger and newer hotels.  One thing that really did bother us was that the pool smelled very strong of Chlorine.  I know they have to keep it at high levels but this burned my nose and throat just walking onto the floor it was on.  It was so bad we decided to not let our daughter swim in it. Valet parking was expensive but then again this is Chicago and it was expected.  The Valet service is super at this hotel. I ordered a pizza from room service and while it was not the best pizza I have had it was also not the worst.   All in all this is a nice place to stay.  Just don't swim.",N
2275,"If you're not use to city noise,this might not be the best choice for you. You could here sirens all night long. Also no WIFI in the room... Really? It's 2011 Marriott. this is a dated property for Marriott but you can't beat a location on the Magnificent Mile",N
2355,I've stayed here a couple times and had good experiences. That said I've only stayed on the HHonors floor which is almost like a mini hotel inside the big hotel. It even has a separate check in area on the floor itself so you don't have to deal with the main check in area. The only thing I don't like about the HHonors floor is that the free breakfast is continental only while you usually get a free hot breakfast at most Hiltons with the HHonors floors. The hotel itself is in a great location and has all the usual amenities you would expect. The rooms themselves are average sized but look to have been very recently updated. The views from the lakeside ones are great although I don't think they are worth the extra money they charge.,N
2356,"We used Priceline to get a deal here - this was the most expensive hotel on my vacation, and it wasn't worth the extra cost, but everything costs more in Chicago anyway.  Internet charges, bag hold charges, insane parking charges... these things are pretty standard for an expensive hotel (I'm paying more, so give me less! Logic!)  Cheaper parking is available at surrounding garages for about $25 overnight. We did however LOVE that our two-bed room had two bathrooms.  Greatest thing ever.  We also got a decent view of the Sears Tower.  If you get a good deal here, go for it.",N
2357,"*Extremely disappointed* I booked the Hilton solely because of the University of Chicago shuttle deal, where you can stay and get a free shuttle to and from the university. I knew I would be going to Hyde Park quite a few times and the shuttle was worth it. When I arrive, they tell me that because I checked off the AAA rate, they can't give me the U of C deal, which they did not state on their website. So, I tell the agent I will pay the difference in rate. Nope. It's an ""online only"" deal. Fine, then I want to cancel and rebook online. Nope. The front desk agent Morgan was extremely rude and rolled her eyes while talking to me. If you hate your job, get a new one! ---- The room itself was fine. Clean, soft towels, king sized bed, flat screen, good bath products... Also did not like the $2 per item coat check. But I did like the coffee shop in the lobby and the general liveliness.",N
2358,"The staff here is awesome. Honestly, so nice and good at their jobs. I cannot sing enough praises for this group of people who graciously handled 4000 Harry Potter fans running a muck for 4 days. The rooms are nice and really clean and the location is awesome, right across from Grant and Millenium Park and just a couple of blocks from the lake.",N
2359,"Stayed there this weekend and was impressed with the service, everyone seemed to want to make my experience memorable.",N
2360,"I'd recommend asking for a room on floors 9 and above.  These are the newly renovated rooms which are very modern.  They also have rooms with two bathrooms so you could request these if you are sharing and prefer your own bathroom.  The hotel is across the street from Millenium Park, a few blocks from the Magnificent Mile and close to tons of restaurants and bars.",N
2361,This place is mega gigantor. It's like a city within chicago. Some towns dont hold this many people. For the price performance value it's hard to beat for a large city. $125/night with weekend stay is pretty solid. The location is another plus. Being near the lake on Michigan ave within walking distance to a ton of things and near public transit. Im sure that's why they are popular with the conference crowd. For me a decent bed and clean bathroom is the gist of what I need and this hotel delivered that. There's tons of shops and eating joints within the hotel too so if you really want to just hole up and not go anywhere that's also a choice. No free internet is a bummer though.,N
2362,"For 280 a night Internet should come with the room, not separately.  Also, a fridge didn't come standard although I was able to get one when I asked. Usually I would give props for a clean room, but the blood stained towels the first day kind of ruined that. The last straw for me was trying to change my checkout day.  They wanted to charge me for a night even though the hotel is full capacity and they won't lose money from my not being here.  They did come down by half, but I still feel ripped off.",N
2363,"I appreciate that this was the cheapest standard hotel option (i.e., no hostels, b&b's, inns, etc.)  to be found in town at $143 a night, and I absolutely appreciated that our 2 double-bed room had TWO bathrooms, but I found so many cheap annoyances.   First, why couldn't we have proper queen beds, which has become the standard in most American hotels?  These were definitely doubles, and can be a bit cramped for two.  Also, how much is in-room internet?? The room includes a computer with some pre-loaded tourist information, but why not offer up internet if you have it installed? Finally - greatest pet peeve -- $2 to check a bag with the concierge?? That is incredibly unjust and makes this ""Hilton"" feel so cheap! Other than those complaints, I had a good night's sleep right across the street from the Art Institute.",N
2364,"This was my husband and I first visit to Chicago and we really did not know what to expect, but we had a blast and relaxing stay.  The Hilton Chicago is a gourgeous and elegant hotel.  Our room was huge, clean, comfortable, and with a breath taking view.  We had four windows in our room with a view of Lake Michigan from each.  We also had a view of Grand Park, Soldier Stadium, and the museum.  Not only was the hotel a beautiful experience, the staff was amazing.  Everyone we encountered was friendly, accomodating, and professional.  Although all the staff was great, there were two staff that was outstanding and went over and beyond to make sure our stay at the Hilton Chicago was the best.  The first person we encountered when we arrived was Alicia, guest service agent.  She is the sweetest person with a welcoming smile.  We were so tired after our early morning travel, but Alicia put a smile on our faces that lasted throughout the trip.  Words can not describe her beautiful and warm personality.  Thank you Alicia.  The second person we encountered was Antonio.  Antonio is an energic young man who is full of life.  He assisted us with our bags and you can tell that this young man takes great pride in his job.  That was refreshing to see.  I would highly recommend this hotel, because it is truly a 5 star.  I have read the other reviews and it is unfortunate that some did not share my experience, because in my opinion a bad experience is not the norm for this beautiful hotel and the warm, beautiful staff.",N
2365,"US Presidents have stayed in this hotel. This is a good place to stay if you're more interested in going to Grant Park and the Museum Plaza. We chose this hotel because of its location to be close to the museum but far enough from the hustle and bustle of shops in the Magmile. This hotel is part of a history and the decor was dated but I think that's what makes it a little bit charming that its not all linear and too modern on the public areas. I loved the view of the Lake. One thing, they need more concierge on their staffing. They had one concierge on a Friday evening and I thought it was just annoying that we had to wait for over 15 minutes just to get a small map of downtown. Our stay here was great and we always had service in our room so there wasn't much to complain since we were out most of the time.",N
2366,Terrible experience. The hotel was on strike which made it even worse. Would not stay here again.,N
2367,"I would have given it four stars, but the nickel and diming just got to me. There is no reason to charge 25 bucks a night extra plus tax for an executive room and wifi and fitness equipment access when I can get free wifi at a holiday inn and use fitness equipment too.  This was just a ripoff. Don't park at the hotel.  There are several self pay places right behind the hotel.  You can pay 45 bucks a day at the hotel, or you can pay 22 bucks a day.  You choose.  And it's a short block. I prepaid for the hotel via hotwire, but they still asked for a card for incidentals and put a $300 hold on it.  They could have at least told me what they were doing when they were doing it.  I found out in checking my balances online. The room was nice, but some things unnecessary.  My room had a huge flat screen, two double beds, and two full bathrooms.  We didn't really need two full bathrooms, though it's a unique touch. Newly renovated rooms.  The metro train runs and is audible from the room.  This might really bother some people, but it didn't bother me or my son.  We sleep like rocks, and there's something about the sound of trains that I actually find kind of soothing.  We are also night owls anyway, and the train stops running after like 2 or 3, so it didn't impede our sleep. The inside of the hotel is great.  The place is is like a titanic ocean liner without the sinking.  This is a grand dame hotel with a lot of history, celebrating its 85th year this year.  I't's decorated very nicely.  Presidents and celebrities have stayed here.  The penthouse suites are something like 2700 square feet.  It's a splurge place.   I got a lower price on hotwire.  I think because it's so big (1544 rooms), they always have some rooms available and so need to go that route.  I almost booked it on http://hotels.com, was thrilled to get it for much cheaper on hotwire, though the wifi/fitness equipment charge took away some of the discount (http://hotels.com had various packages that included different things such as parking or wifi, many different head spinning combinations to confound).  Anyway, I think I still got a bargain. I'd recommend it to any first timer to Chicago, so they can have a grand experience. For subsequent visits to Chi-town, stay at a place that offers free wifi and free or more reasonable parking.  But we really enjoy the grandness of it, and were happy to be there.",N
2368,"Got our room here from HotWire as one of those ""surprise"" choices where you don't know what you're getting - and it paid off. Stayed here for our first visit to Chicago. Room was great (16th floor). Staff was friendly. The level of decadence doesn't quite equal something like the Paris hotel in Vegas, but it was solidly elegant and comfortable. Great location for what we wanted to do (to tour the loop and museums basically). Easy train access about two blocks away. We walked most places. Major plus being right across the street from Millenium Park. The only negative I can think of was parking. The night we got there the self-parking lot filled up so we had to valet park (which was expensive imo, $57/night). I know parking is just plain expensive in the loop, but $57 seemed extreme to me. The skinny? I'd stay here again provided I got a good rate again.",N
2369,"Alright, friends.  I'm going to be as straightforward as possible.  This place is a dump.  It's just gross.  I'm tempted to leave it at this, but I feel obligated to let you know why this place is an avoid-at-all-costs establishment. The premise of my stay at the Hilton was a work trip for BF about a week ago.  His firm paid for his room, and I got to tag along (yay trip to Chi!).  I usually stay at Embassy Suites (another Hilton chain, ironically), but since one cannot argue with a free hotel stay, one goes where one is told. As I mentioned, this was a business trip, and the convention was held in the hotel, so it was packed. We walked in and pushed through the barrage of company polo shirt clad attorneys, and wives that stepped right out of a Talbots catalog, to the reservation desk.  I noticed a few people taking photos of their kids in the lobby, which is sort of a grand foyer kind of deal.  I presume most people think that this is a gorgeous area; I'll just say it's not my taste.  Were it 1984, and I was Janet Jackson on tour, I probably would have been a little more impressed.   We make our way to the reservation desk, which appears to be reminiscent of a Cedar Point queue line.  After our long and strenuous quest, we make it to the desk, where we are asked for BF's credit card, for the purpose of ""holding the room,"" and the card was not to be charged. Keep this tidbit in your mind, folks.  Since the room was supposedly prepaid for, we were a little confused, but obliged, so as not to hold up the line any longer. (Insert ""That 70s Show"" transition with BF and I dancing in acid washed jeans and over-sized shirts) We return to check into our room. Whoa! Throwback. This place had obviously not been updated since the 80s. Not to mention the fact that I don't think the AC had been serviced since the 80s, since we walked into a brick wall of heat immediately after stepping off the elevator. Once we actually get into our room, I acknowledge the small amount of nostalgic charm, and since I had just rode back from Wrigleyville on the El, after many beers, I head to the bathroom. It's fair to mention I'm quite a germophobe.  I spray everything with my TSA approved bottle of Lysol, and whip out Clorox wipes.  This place was enough to make BF (the complete opposite of me) cringe. First off neither the drain in the sink, nor the tub, worked.  The toilet was a push-lever model, straight from the industrial building store. Nothing appeared to be cleaned well, as I noticed water marks everywhere. The towels were dingy and some had dirty spots.  Shudder. Like the drains, the AC didn't work either.  I had called maintenance, who was supposed to send someone up ""right away,"" however they were a no show.  Perhaps they were attending the soiree that the housekeepers were having in the linen room down the hall.  Everyone was having a grand time... laughing, being merry, being obnoxiously loud. It reminded me of the sort of party Gatsby could pull off.   Day 2, and our maid, who, I think may have both been deaf and not an English speaker (honestly, not trying to be mean here), came to clean.  Except the fact that I was in the room. Sleeping. One would expect the housekeeper to leave a sleeping guest lie. Not so. She carried on with banging things around in the bathroom, and then discovered the drain. She apparently couldn't clean the bathroom with the malfunctioning drain, so she decided to tell us we needed to call maintenance right then. BF was trying to explain that we were napping and would call later, but she was insistent to the point that she came into the living area of our room, picked up the phone, and tried showing us what she wanted by dialing a bunch of numbers and then slamming the phone down. We politely tried to shoo her out, and she finally got the hint that we were trying to rest. Day 3, maintenance finally comes, and explains to me that the AC is not broken, but rather there is a secret trick to making it work!  Alas, my troubles are solved!  How stupid of me, I should have known that you have to press two buttons down, while turning the thermostat down, waiting for the screen to say something, and then releasing the buttons. Very user friendly.  He also fixes the drain at this point, but makes a huge mess. I called to have them clean it up, but again, nobody came. Checking out was the highlight of the trip. Until we realized that BFs card was charged for the room. They proceeded to ""fix"" the problem by transferring the charges to his boss's card, until two days later, and a charge is showing as an overdraft. They had not fixed anything, and we find out that not only did they charge BF's personal card, they charged the firm card, and the partner's personal card. That's quite an amount, mind you. After many phone calls and excess time spent, everything was adjusted finally. Needless to say we will not be staying here again.",N
2370,"We stayed here one night using a deal we got on Expedia. A parking package was included which really came in handy. the hotel was absolutely lovely. It has such a classy vintage feel throughout the whole building. In the lobby there's a really cute cafe that serves Starbucks. We stayed on the 8th floor which conveniently was on the same floor as the pool. Unfortunately the pool and hot tubs were run a muck with children, but the deck outside of the pool is absolutely amazing. the view is breath taking. We originally ordered a room that was a single full-sized bed. THe man at the check in counter upgraded us to a room with 2 beds no charge because he said it was a larger room. The room was very clean and so was the bathroom. No complaints. The location of the hotel is totally perfect. A 10 minute walk to millenium park and the museums. Grant park is right across the street.",N
2371,"We stayed here a few nights for a graduation in Chicago. It was a great location and quite nice being so close to all of the Chicago attractions. The room was clean and quiet, and the check-in process was quick. My only gripe is that it is an older hotel and you just get that old vibe from the place. But if that doesn't bother you, it's a great place to stay.",N
2372,"Talk about Historic.   Just taking the elevator to my room, the tv screen is spitting out all these facts about the hotel....   Quite impressive.   I walk into my room (which has a double bed), and its the size of a small apartment.   The receptionist told me that some of the double bed rooms are twice the size of king sized beds - and although I like King beds....   This was nice.     The new renovations have added some new technology to the room - and this computer which is all ""High Tech""... is annoying as hell.   First off - the internet is NOT free.   They don't tell you the price, but a small warning comes up saying very sneakily that you agree that all charges can be placed on your room....     You can clearly tell that this software is just another ad revenue for the hotel since most of the ""recommended"" places to visit also happen to advertise on it.... Hmmmmm  interesting.   The parking situation is stupid expensive!!  I understand you are in Chicago, and it's a freaking commodity, but $50 per night!!!    I was there for a week!!!!   Great room, nice views, friendly staff..... TOO expensive!",N
2373,"I will admit it, the Hilton in downtown Chicago is not my usual go-to for accommodations in the city. It's the place that, when on vacation there I would always see it and sigh and think, when I have enough money I would love to stay there. So, this past weekend, while in town for a wedding, my fianceÃÅ and I decided to treat ourselves and get a room here. Now, let me say up front, that the entrance lobby is very impressive. And the suites that the bridal party were in were absolutely gorgeous. Even our floor and room were rather tasteful, if you like modern-chic. Also, it is very clean, as one should expect of place with such a high reputation. Hence why I gave it two stars instead of one. Now, the bad. First of all, a lot of these have to do with price. I am stating this up front because yes, we did understand that we would be paying quite a bit. Hence the whole ""we decided to treat ourselves"" bit. What I didn't know, and wish I had, was that despite the fact that you pay twice, even three times the amount on a room here compared to most places, our money only went about half, even a third as far as it does at those other places. 1) There is no included wifi. You must pay for it, and there is no wired connection option. Considering the cost of wifi or a wired connection, this seemed extremely tacky and cheap 2) No breakfast. Of any kind. You either pay the overly extravagant prices of the restaurant connected to the lobby, which is mostly a bar and dinner place to begin with, or have a coffee and breakfast at Starbucks. Not very classy for a place like the Hilton. 3) The room, despite being exorbitantly expensive, was incredibly small. We were so cramped, we had to pack our stuff away in the silly wardrobe/closet they give you, or risk several stubbed toes or possible broken bones from tripping over our weekend suitcases. (Note, these were small enough to be airplane carry-ons). 4) This size issue was also an issue in the bathroom, the shower of which was so small that if you dropped something, you would have to open the door to bend down and pick it up. 5) Yes, it was clean. In a there's-no-mold-or-bugs way, but the ceiling was dusty and full of cobwebs. 6) View. Even though this hotel is in the center of Chicago, right across Michigan Ave from the park, we got to look at a brick wall...and our neighbors. 7) Without telling us, up front, at the desk or otherwise, they overcharged our credit card to cover a per night deposit. I don't have a problem with this in principle, but it's a good thing we weren't close to our limit because not knowing that that would go on there, even temporarily, could have caused some major problems. 8) No help with parking. I know that most hotels charge for parking, especially in downtown Chicago, but several I have stayed at give a discount or some sort of thing for their guests. Or at least a price that is competitive. However, this didn't end up being a huge problem, since we just saved $20 a day by parking in the Millennium garage instead. Good thing we did too, because apparently the extra cost of parking at the Hilton didn't make your car any safer as one of our family member's had her car broken into while parked there. Basically, the hotel was rather nice. But expensive. And I don't mean in a ""you have to pay to get nice things way."" We actually got much less for our money all around than we do at our usual vacation spot (the Embassy Suites). Basically, you stay here if you have so much money you enjoy spending it unnecessarily. Your money buys you the location, and the prestige of telling cab drivers ""The Hilton, please.""",N
2374,"Gorgeous public spaces! The history of the building was fascinating. My room was on a recently renovated floor, and everything looked brand new - except the bathroom door which apparently hadn't been repainted since the '80s. It's a pet peeve of mine that when you're staying at a nice hotel and the TP in the bathroom is the cheapest, lowest possible quality. For almost $200/night, you'd think they can afford Charmin. Anxiously awaiting the day upscale hotels enter the 21st century and offer free wi-fi and simple printing options.",N
2375,Turd. Super cheesy decor. Bad clientele on our stop. Wouldn't recommend to anybody. Concierge station was closed for some reason.,N
2376,"I got the opportunity to stay here for a night and was quite impressed. Everything from the touchscreen computer in the room to the lobby to the comfy bed to the staff made my stay memorable. When we first got into the room we ordered some room service (grilled chicken sandwich) which came very quickly and turned out to be delicious. The bathroom was a little bit outdated and dusty, but the shower was great and the shampoo/ conditioner products they had were amazing! The view from the hotel room was beautiful. We were in a corner room on one of the top floors looking onto the lake and down S Michigan Ave. If you can choose your room I definitely recommend this side of the building. i would stay in the Hilton again if I ever need to!",N
2377,"Old school but great.  Or should I say old school and great.  Had the privilege of staying here for four nights for a conference.  I come to Chicago a lot but have never stayed here.   Love the history of the place.  In the elevator, the small screen has a rolling quiz about the history of the hotel.  Queen Elizabeth was there, it was housing for soldiers in WWII -- tidbits like that.   The room was nice and cozy...not small, just comfortable.  I had a wet bar that I used just for leftover pizza.  No microwave but that's okay.  Bathroom was fairly small but the windowsill was perfect for a place to keep my many toiletries so that was good.   Had a great view of the lake.  The executive lounge for breakfast and snacks was wonderful.  I fell in love with the multi-option coffee machine!   It's a bit of a walk to shopping and a lot of the restaurants around Michigan Avenue.  Kind of a hike from the river.  In any season but winter, no problem.  However, there are other places nearby including the great Lou Malnati's on State Street just a couple of blocks behind and over -- go there!",N
2378,Here for the Cub's Convention. Did not get to see or stay in a room...........but I can say that the interior of the hotel is amazing. Consider this a museum and just walk around and LOOK. The Grand Ball room is extraordinary. Try the Irish Pub here..............ask for Paddy.,N
2379,"Great hotel, clean, modern, full-service hotel in perfect location. No complaints at all!",N
2380,"The interior in this place expired two decades ago.  Peeling paint on my bathroom ceiling.  The ice bucket is right out of 1980's as all the decor.  Charges for everything.  Internet @ $15 dollars a day.  Seriously, I get much more modern accomodations with everything included at a Red Roof Inn....  The Red Roof would even have a Fridge and microwave.  This place just has an empty cabinet where the must have one been a fridge... It is clean even if used up.  However, it is 3 times the price of equal or better accomodations around.  The TV's are at least modern...  If the convention I am attending wasn't being held here I would seek better accomodations for less money. Pathetic compared to what someone would expect fron a Hilton....",N
2381,"Wow, what a view we were treated to! I chose the parking package and upgraded to a lake view room, which was well worth it! Aside from the M.C. Escher like parking lot, everything else was superb. Our room was on the southeast corner of the 19th floor it had a gorgeous view of the lake and south down Michigan Ave. The room had a 42"" LG flat-screen, king size bed, and plenty of space. It also came equipped with a touch-screen computer that acted as a guide to area restaurants, attractions, and hotel service which made getting information easy and convenient. We ordered room service that evening, and as always, the service was impeccable. One little thing that stands out, and it's such a small one, but Hilton Hotels chose Peter Thomas Roth skin care products for the bathrooms and if you haven't had the opportunity to try any of them out, then do so! I cannot say enough how clean and fresh the products make your skin feel. I know, I know, this was supposed to be a hotel review, but hey!",N
2382,"This hotel was great for the location - our room had a partial view of Grant Park and Lake Michigan. However, the hotel and the rooms were in dire need of a remodel when we stayed here in November 2011. it looked like there were some renovations going on in the lobby, but our room was pretty dated. Luckily we booked this place through Priceline and got a good deal, but if I were paying the regular rate for this hotel I think I would have been pretty disappointed. The hallways were kind of dimly lit here, so overall it just wasn't a very inviting hotel. One thing that I did like was that the room actually had two bathrooms, which was something I hadn't seen before. The beds were only double beds though, so I would probably rather have had bigger beds than a second bathroom. I don't think I would purposely book this place on my own, but if I got a good deal on Priceline I wouldn't object to staying here again.",N
2383,"I stayed here this past weekend and had a room facing the lake. It was a nice and cozy room. I had access to the Executive Room for a continental breakfast which was nice. The staff members were friendly.   I like  the location of the hotel, across from Grant Park and I enjoyed the view of the lake and the city.   I didn't get a chance to experience the in-hotel restaurants so I can't comment on them but I will the next I stay hear.",N
2385,"Don't stay here.  This hotel overbooked and sold our reservation to someone else before the check-in period was over.  We called and asked if we could check-in late, Customer Service said no, and that we had to be there before check-in was over to get the room.  Our rehearsal dinner went late and we had people to drive home, so we knew we were most likely not going to make it in time.  My then-fiance rushed to the hotel to check-in (and arrived prior to check-in time ending), and they had already given the room to someone else.  You would think the Customer Service Rep. would have the insight to see if the room was still available before sending us on a wild goose chase, or agree to hold the room for us!  After discovering that the room was given away, they refused to give us a refund because we didn't cancel 48 hours in advance!!!   Thankfully, we booked through Expedia and they thought what had occurred was ridiculous and processed the refund.  I would give this hotel 0 stars if I could.  This reservation was for our wedding, and the Customer Service Rep did not care.  We were not pleased - we took a cab home and slept off our hangovers in our own bed.",N
2386,"They were repairs done on the hotel (outside), I believe. The noise woke us up very early.",N
2389,"I was a guest at the Rainbow Push Coalition Women's Luncheon yesterday.  The purpose of the luncheon, the panelists and the guests made it a superb event.  However the food was less remarkable.  The starter was a warm cream soup which no one could identify but did look like there were shaved pieces of mushrooms but the broth was non-descript - so agreed my tablemates.  The entree was a chicken breast salad - breast atop a piece of arugula filled with cous cous, a slice of carrot and zucchini and cubed parsnip with a vinaigrette which I poured over a few greens.   I am allergic to chicken which was fine since the breast was scorched beyond recognition - which my table mate pointed out to me since I was not eating it - I reassurred her it was no big deal due to my allergy.  The rolls were quite generic.  The saving grace of the meal was the raspberry sorbet and I am guessing the flavor here - cherry ice scoops with a few frozen blue berries.  Absolutely delicious!  Frozen solid but once melted enough well worth the wait.  The banquet staff served the food and cleared in a timely mannor in a robotic fashion - no smiles, no indication I could ask for anything else I might like - like decaf coffee.  But all in all it was about the essence of the luncheon and not the food - thank goodness.  So if you are thinking of a banquet at the Hilton and Towers I would say that if price point is an issue, this could be your place but be careful to do a tasting and try to keep it simple.",N
2390,"the husband had a conference in the city, and his organization picked up the tab for the hotel and the parking.  rad.  ""free"" instantly makes a lot of things better.  this hotel was no exception.   the parking garage was ample enough to accommodate our car every night of the week we stayed, which included st. patrick's day weekend.  even with the hotel being booked to capacity, we still had a spot.  this has not always been my experience in downtown hotels, even if it isn't a holiday weekend. the front desk staff were very pleasant and helped us liked they loved their jobs.  that was impressive alone.  my husband and i are hilton honors members, and that made a big difference at check in.  there was an enormous line of probably close to 40 people waiting to check in at the normal check in desk.  we were able to bypass it all, and go right to the honors desk.  we were up to our room in minutes.   the room was nice.  a little dated, but nice.  we were unable to book a room with only a king size bed, so we were in a room with two double beds.  the room had two full bathrooms too, which was pretty rad, because if i don't have to share a bathroom with my husband... it's a great day. there are several pubs and restaurants in the hotel and a snack bar that is both open early and closes late.  it's nice for a quick bite or a cup of coffee.  it serves starbucks coffee.  if you prefer caribou, there is one just down the block though. all in all, this is a nice hotel.  about standard price for spendy downtown hotels. if you're not from chicago, and don't know the city -- i'll tell you, this hotel is located in an awesome tourist area.  it's well within walking distance of the lakefront.  i am a runner who took advantage of that during the visit.  (there is a path that runs from the south loop to loyola unversity on the north end for runners and bikers.)  you are also walking distance from adler planetarium, the field museum, and shedd aquarium.  if you are looking to go out or get a decent dinner, the south loop is not what it used to be.  having lived in chicago for many years, i am always surprised how neighborhoods change and evolve.  in this case, the south loop is very different than it was even 10 years ago.  there are a lot of bistros, cafes, and bars for all kinds of different tastes.  going to the northern tourist destinations, like water tower place, will involve a fairly hefty hike (but it's through the city, so if you don't mind a trek, it's a nice walk).  the el is within blocks of the hotel though, and is so easy to navigate that there is no reason to pay ridiculous cab fare.",N
2394,"This place has been totally remodeled. The rooms are awesome, and there are nice views of Grant Park and the lake. This is now nicer than most of the hotels on N Michigan Ave. that cost twice as much. They just need to get some more restaurants and shopping nearby.",N
2400,"Stayed here last February and again this New Year's Eve eve for a friend's wedding. The reception was at Zapatista a few blocks away. The good news for us is that they allow dogs, even big dogs. For a fee of $50, we could take our 50lb+ Labradoodle (or so the rescue said) puppy with us.         I know from our last visit that the hotel gym is great, the biggest gym I have seen in any Hotel, a real gym, not just a universal machine and a couple of treadmills. It had power racks, rowers, full range of dumbbells and plates (more but my memory of a year ago is faulty).        We had the breakfast buffet in the morning. It was free and ok, but not exciting. I get excited about a good breakfast buffet. I think any calories consumed before 11am do not count.       The location of the Hotel was great for our purpose, but it is a little south of the real downtown. It is right across from the park and very close to the Grant Bark Park, which we used.       The rates were great for both stays; $80 for the first stay through Priceline and $180 for the second stay (that includes the $50 dog fee).",N
2402,"for the 280 a night we paid (includes taxes), not really a great value.  kind of dated interior, noisy being right above the train lines, old crappy hvac.  not to mention 45 bucks a night parking.",N
2403,"This Hotel is Not great at all. Shitty staffs, well RUBEN and his fat security Anthony. Along with some geeky Asian guy. They gave me and my family a hard time checking in. So we still manage to get a room there and the room was horrible. Double tree is far more nicer than this crappy hotel.",N
2421,Stayed at this place for a week. Everyone was super nice and I was extremely happy with everything. The only complaint is that they make you pay a lot for parking.,N
2445,"close to everything...service is nice, will come back again.",N
2537,"Besides seeing a LARGE Mirror fall on someones head. I had an ok time.... It was super shocking to see a mirror that was about 10 feet + leaning on a wall, at one point and young man was dancing and and the mirror fell forward and laid him out. Like a cartoon flat, when I realized they it had glass over the frame I completely freaked out. Kinda ended the night. Let's rewind to 2 hours earlier. No line, apparently we walked in on an 18+ over night (womp womp),  but we stood on the 21+ side. We were having drinks and dancing and were actually having a decent time. There was a Bar back...Latino Guy....his name was marvin, mario? something He got really aggressive with my gf because apparently she was in his way, when I told him there was a better way to talk to people he yelled at me. I asked the bartender his name and the bartender said ""Don't worry that guy is on his way out he won't be working here for long."" I HOPE NOT.",N
2612,"It was a spectacular stay all around. The location was perfect, right by the shops on Michigan Ave with plenty of restaurants to choose from. The room was spacious, modern and clean, with comfy beds and a nice lounge chair and seating area. Aside for all that, what I really liked was the shampoo/conditioner/body wash in the bathroom. They provide large bottles that are locked into the wall so you can use as much as you desire. This is always a problem for me with the itsy bitsy travel size products that most hotels provide. I have long hair and one bottle of conditioner just isn't enough. If you're making a trip out to Chicago, definitely stay at the James if possible.",N
2613,"I'm surprised at anything less than a 4.5 star review of this hotel. While we didn't have much to look at, our room was absolutely perfect complete with a huge bathroom, (yes, the sliding door was annoying, and why do hotels refuse to install fans? It's a no-brainer when sharing!) small sitting area and two tvs. We would have surely paid triple the price to enjoy the same thing in NYC or Miami (newly opened) but not in good ol' Chicago. Pretty central location to dt; perfectly air conditioned. Wonderful bed with three types of pillows if you need them. Nice, clean, small gym perfect for working off the popcorn, steak, tacos, alcohol and all of that amazing food offered in Chicago. Steakhouse was pretty great as was the free drink upon arrival. Don't forget to read the free time out mag if you have time and if you need ideas. (but I'm sure you've arrived with many.) Extremely helpful hotel staff and probably the best maid service I've ever experienced. It always helps to leave at least a couple of dollars daily! Turndown service was an added bonus as was the little sweet treat that we'd save for the next day. Sb coffee was great if you don't feel like going down the street in the 100+ degree heat first thing in the am. Daily water refill was a bonus, as was the mini-bar fridge that we used--no questions asked. Great for yoghurt or leftovers! Door guys were helpful...just don't be caught carrying one of their umbrellas with you like we did for a couple of days. Because apparently, in Chicago, ""you only believe it when you see it."" How different from Vancouver! Honestly, if you can't afford the trip to NY, this is the place to go and this is the place to stay. You won't be disappointed!",N
2614,"Boutique Wanna-be  - Horrible Air Conditioning - Not family friendly Small room.  Barn-like bathroom door impossible for my 11 year old to open.  NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY.  No ice on the floor.  No vending machines.  Not even a closet!  Cheap Patio like table. Most irritating was the lack of adequate air conditioning.  Outside temps were in the low 90's but inside, the low 80's.  We moved rooms and found it equally uncomfortable.  Management and the service dude told us to keep the metal access door to the a/c closet open to help them along.  Didn't work, and the excess noise was ridiculous.  Really? A few times I went across the street to the Sheraton 4 Points lobby to cool down (and get a Coke) so don't tell me Hotel's in Chicago can't handle the heat. Uncomfortable and unacceptable.",N
2615,"Horrible Air Conditioning... was there for a wedding last weekend and reception was stifling. Our server Diana was the best, she made sure were had enough water and drinks! I talked to people staying at the James hotel and they also complained about the Air Conditioning saying even free drinks would not keep them there. The staff in general was nice so that why I gave two stars. But they need to fix the A/C",N
2616,"Good location. Better than average hotel gym and great breakfasts. The parking is nonexistent so you'll have to valet every day, so I'd border on rating it a 3.5  overall if I could. Decent clubs and restaurants in walking distance.",N
2617,"The James Hotel was the primary hotel for our out of town guests for our downtown Chicago wedding and the venue for our morning after farewell breakfast. We would have held our wedding reception at the James because we liked the design of venue's event room, but it was not big enough for the amount of guests attending our wedding. The weekend of our wedding was chaotic due to Chicago hitting record high temperature levels and causing havoc on the hotel's air conditioners. While there were moments of stress, significant praise is warranted for the special events director Sinisa and the head concierge Krista - always keeping their cool and ensuring that all of our guests received excellent service (including moving them to rooms with functioning a/c, and if this was not possible comping rooms at comparable hotels in the Magnificent Mile area). The guest rooms are the size you would expect for downtown chicago and the bed and finishings was extremely comfortable (we are in process of purchasing one for our new home). The amenities were amazing and we found the modern bathroom to be near spa quality.  We had a suite on our wedding night and it was very spacious and well designed.   The breakfast catering was superb and the service was top-notch.  They were kind enough to let us serve leftover items from our dessert buffet at the wedding reception.   Overall, the James proved to not only be a great hotel for a vacation stay, but also held up to the high-stress of a wedding and Chicago summer heat to provide our guests with a great experience.  We would definitely recommend the James to anyone looking for a luxurious getaway in the city or a special event.",N
2618,"Hidden Gem! Did not stay at the hotel just had a 2 day meeting! The banquet Staff was very accommodating. Breakfast, Lunch and breakout beverages were great! The location was perfect for getting to Michigan Avenue and walking around to see the sites! The team was amazed by how beautiful Chicago is!",N
2619,"Ok The James Hotel is your place to go.  Nicely sized clean rooms in the middle of downtown... what more could you ask for?   Front desk, bellmen and concierge are all wonderfully helpful.  There is a Trader Joe's across the street (which to be honest you could put a Trader Joes across the street of a hovel and I might consider staying there), and you can rent bikes to visit the city if you are too lazy to walk. Oh and did I mention a 2pm checkout?  Yes that's right my friends no waking up early to pack up your crap you spread all over the room to make sure you are out by 11 or 12.  Relax.  Grab a mimosa at brunch and enjoy your last day. Would possible deduct 1/2 star for the amenities if Yelp would let me be more precise though.  Booked expecting Kiehl's (understandably a HUGE fan) and instead  took a shower with what felt like some crazy blend of Organic, Paraben free ICY HOT.  Had to walk across the street to Trader Joe's to buy soap and shampoo. Seriously, Mr. James Hotel....bring back the Kiehl's...that stuff burns!!! Anyways, with the exception of the unpleasant initial shower everything else was wonderful.  Will definitely return.",N
2620,"I stayed at the James a year and a half ago and LOVED it. Don't know if its just aged or if I had a better room last time, but this visit the place felt like it had aged ten years. Carpets in elevator, halls, and room feel dated and tired! Location is still superb and the overall vibe is good. Could not get spa to call me back to schedule a massage, which was also sad. Otherwise, location is good and it is a fine alternative to some of the other larger chain hotels.",N
2621,"I stayed at The James Hotel during a recent weekend trip to Chicago and loved everything about the hotel.  First, the location was perfect -- walking distance to almost everything or a short cab ride.  Second, service was excellent -- everyone from the bell hop at the door to the associate at the check in counter to the concierge was really friendly and helpful.  Third, I really liked the overall feel and decor of the hotel.  The room itself was small but clean, cozy and comfy. The furniture is modern and the bed was perfect.  The hotel also provides its own bottled filtered water in each of the rooms and free wifi throughout its premises. Note that they no longer provide Kheil's bathroom products.   I highly recommend The James Hotel and would definitely stay here again the next time I visit Chicago.",N
2622,"I booked this hotel after blind bidding on Hotwire. It was fine, but definitely not great- even at the bargain basement price that I paid. The bathroom doors are heavy sliding doors that don't close all the way- about a 1/2 inch gap. That was not wonderful. They provide turn down service complete with dim lighting, some music playing quietly, etc. It really wasn't necessary for me when sharing a room with my mother. Parking is pricey- $55 for valet. However there is a garage on the same block for $35. The beds were super comfy and the location was great. Overall, the hotel was alright, but I would definitely try someplace else next time.",N
2623,"I booked this hotel on a whim via jetsetter's flash sale event. As a pessimist, I always tell myself to expect nothing from those promotional stock photos. But once I got there, the greeting, the service, the chicness, etc, i find that this is where value meets quality at right in the middle. I loved the design and the ""it is what it is, and its good"" attitude. I also love their full-sized Intelligent Nutrients products in the bathroom. It makes me feel like i'm staying at a cool buddy's house instead of a stingy hotel. And cudos to their speedy wifi. many hotels offer free wifi, however, 80% of them are dial-up speeds. The James is an exception. The minibar and the ""help yourself drawer"" is another thoughtful thing they've done. from tequila to heneiken, from contact solution to chapstick.. if you weren't thoughtful enough to bring these essentials yourself and got too cozy to go downstairs, do help yourself. but I'm sure they'll charge you for anything you grab though. but that's fair enough. the bed is so comfyyyyy!! beware once you land yourself on that mattress you will not want to explore the city. but c'mon. the hotel is at the center of everything right off michigan ave. so exploring the city doesn't necessarily mean taking a long hike.",N
2624,"Light sleepers and those who like to sleep-in beware! The doors and bathroom walls are pretty thin. I woke up at 7AM to the shower noise upstairs which sounded like a giant sprinkler system. I ended up closing my bathroom door to muffle some of the sound. Woke up at again around 9AM after a family was talking outside my door. Woke up again around 10AM to someone shuffling plastic bags. Sigh. Bring ear plugs. Just walking down the hall you can also hear people in the room talking. The doors might as well be made out of paper. Not no great things about the hotel: - soundproofing - 2 tiny elevators. Each can fit 6 people like sardines or 2-3 people with luggage. Staying on the 5th floor, I ended up taking the stairs for most of the trip - stairs are located on the 2nd floor. - the Audi car service is never able when you need it. For a 2 mile radius of travel, I can probably walk the distance in the time I'm waiting for the car. - toilet paper was a little over a full arm lengths away at an awkward distance. I ended up taking it off of its holder and putting it on the bath tub instead. - TV's sound goes in and out every now and then And the great: + Check out is at 2PM!! + good location near Michigan Ave, Trader Joes across the street, Walgreens another block down, and a small movie theater a block away. Then again, there are other hotels to choose from in this area too like Four Points by Sheraton across the street. + nice spacious one bedroom apts + nice shampoo and conditioner that makes lots of promises like non frizzy, volumizing, moisturizing, color protection, gluten free, etc + free wifi + brownie and cookie treats for turn-down service. + free water in the bedroom which is basically filtered tap water. I can't get over the taste of tap water in Chicago, but with a lot of ice it tastes great. There's a ice machine on the 4th floor. + comfortable couch + soft bed that just eats you up. I have to add another star JUST for the bed. Otherwise I would rate the James hotel 3 stars.. but after I stayed the following week at a Hyatt, then a Marriott, then at home, I HAVE to agree that James hotel has the most comfortable bed of all hotels. All-in-all, not bad, but I don't think I'll be back. I don't want to deal with the small elevator and the thin doors/walls. There are plenty of other hotels to choose from at the same price point.",N
2626,"This hotel is suuuuper nice and in a super convenient spot to everything. Walking distance to millennium park, the pier, sears tower, bars, clubs.   $10-15 cab ride to lou malnati's, united arena, and sh*tloads of the tourist spots. Doormen and concierge are super helpful. Heard the bar goes off on Thursdays, but was only there from fri-mon. I'd stay here again the next time i visit chicago.",N
2627,"We stayed the James Hotel over St. Paddy's Day weekend while in town for a wedding, and the place is very nice. The staff is super helpful, the rooms are great, and overall we had a great experience. Perks: - They have fresh water in cute little jugs in your room when you arrive. - Chocolates in the room - Super nice/upscale furniture and beds. - Really close to Michigan Avenue and tons of great restaurants. Downside: The Valet Parking was $52 per night, so if you are renting a car just take note there are plenty of parking garages in this neighborhood so it might be a little cheaper to park in one of those. Overall, I'm a fan and would definitely stay here again!",N
2628,"I booked this hotel on a whim and had never been there before. I must say, quite the lucky strike! This hotel is amazing. From the doorman, to the reception, to the room, itself, this hotel has it all. The location is in downtown very close to everything you'll need: shopping, eating, or site-seeing. We had booked a queen-size room. The room size wasn't that large, but the cleanliness of the room and decor was what gave you the homely. yet contemporary feel. There is a mini-bar in the room along with a small sitting/study area. Whenever we needed anything, all we had to do was step outside the hotel and everything was in reach. The staff was very helpful and professional. Very clean, very quiet, and a great experience.",N
2629,To be fair I did not stay here..........was here to meet up with an Aussie mate. I did have a beer ($10)..............Leffe Blonde. Will try the rooms some time. We did eat at David Burke's (see review). We could get right in on a Friday night at 7pm???.........what does that tell you?,N
2630,"We managed to finally get a few days off, and after some browsing and checking other user reviews, we decided for the James. One of the main attraction is the location. It's perfectly central, 100m from Michigan av, and a few mn away from some excellent places to have dinner, or even breakfast/brunch/lunch. Central location means also easy access to most attractions in Chicago. So going back to food, we took advice most times from the concierge, who each time gave us an excellent address depending on what we wanted to eat. The bedroom itself is very good. It took us a bit of time to get use to the switches for the lights which were not always located at the right spot. Also wifi was very very slow. But for the rest it was as needed. Comfortable bed, small bathroom with all amenities (and good quality soaps etc.), and when coming back in the evening late, there was always a little cookie on the bed to welcome us :-)",N
2631,"I can't recommend this hotel highly enough.  The staff is great, the rooms were spacious and really cool, and the food / bar are outstanding.  The details in the decoration and food presentation make this place really stand out.  Chic and modern while also cozy and welcoming, the decor is really to die for.  Finally, the music played in the lobby and in restaurant was really nice.  The people here really try to make you feel welcome, and they obviously take a lot of pride in their work.  Overall just a really fabulous hotel.",N
2632,"Oh yeah. Now THIS is a hotel.  I will dream about The James until I have another chance to stay there.  My husband and I stayed here when we decided, rather randomly, to hitch a flight out to Chicago that weekend.  It was Thursday, we booked to arrive Friday.   When we arrived and through the whole stay, the staff was friendly, courteous, professional, just fantastic.  The room was clean and gorgeous.  The bed was absolutely the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in.  The bathroom, so pretty!   There was a turn-down service that came in after we had left the room both evenings, turned down the sheets, emptied trash, filled our ice bucket with ice and put delicious little cookies on the pillows.  We called them our ""Room Ninjas"". The concierge was incredible.  He helped us track down the location of a club that didn't seem to be listed in the phone book or online.  He made several phone calls and within just a few minutes he had the address and a cab waiting.   I'm not sure if the bar in the lobby is more affiliated with Primehouse (the restaurant on site, FANTASTIC as well) but I had the best mojito I have ever had in my life in the lobby of The James.  I will never forget that, as I am a total Mojito nazi. Our ONLY complaint about the stay is that the room was incredibly hot, and we had to call to have a fan brought up when we woke up sweating at 4 am.  Otherwise, this was just a perfect stay.  We were treated like royalty, which made us tip like royalty.   I would go back in a heartbeat.",N
2635,"Great location, helpful staff, beautiful rooms with comfy beds. Wasn't a fan of the bath products, but that's just me.  Trader Joe's is right across the street, we took advantage of that for sure.  Parking is really expensive and elevators are tiny",N
2636,"Talk about value! My husband and I were thoroughly pleased with our two night stay.  The staff was just the friendliest group of young folks I've ever encountered in hospitality. The lobby was a tad small and easily got congested  However, the room was immaculate, and at the end of the day, that's all you really care about.",N
2637,"My wife and I stayed at the James hotel to celebrate our anniversary.  All the hype is true.  The service was phenomenal, the hotel room was beautiful, the view was magnificent, and the room service was delicious. I arranged ahead of time for my wife to receive an in-room deep tissue massage from an on-site massage therapist.  The massage therapist arrived on time, was incredibly personable and polite, and had my wife glowing by the end of the massage.  This was an excellent point-earner. My wife and I are also a bit crazy when it comes to room temperature.  We like it cold.  So when we got into the room and it was at 72*F we were a bit uncomfortable.  But you get complete control of the temperature.  We were able to put on the air conditioning in the middle of January and get it to the 65*F we like.  We were tickled. I have seen in many of the reviews that everyone raves about the beds.  If you were reading this review to hear otherwise, you are out of luck.  My wife and I have a terrible time sleeping in any bed besides our own, but after a long day of shopping and shows, we fell asleep quickly and easily.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable and comforter soft and warm.  I have never slept in another unfamiliar bed so easily. The room was cleaned twice a day as well.  This was an excellent treat.  We would leave to go shopping and come back to an immaculate room once again. Finally, there is a Trader Joe's right across the street.  So if you ever feel the need to get groceries it could not be more convenient. All in all it was a majestic stay.",N
2639,"I just did a staycation here for Valentine's Day since they were recently on http://jetsetter.com, and with our gift certificate (I love when I get them!!), we paid $40 for a room, bonus! The room itself was comfortable, spacious enough, and quiet, which I loved.",N
2646,"I stayed here on a stag weekend. The rooms were exceptional. The bar in the lobby was very nice, and the attached restaurant was excellent. The service was very friendly and the atmosphere was classy and social. Parking is kind of expensive, there hotel provided valet service. We used a garage across the street and used cabs to get anywhere we couldn't walk. There is plenty to walk to, so we didn't have to put much effort in.",N
2647,"I visited the James yesterday for the first time. I was in the event space where David Burke's Prime house catered a tasty array of meats aged anywhere from 28 days to 55 as well as the sides. I thought the main dining room space was nice (nothing terribly special or unique). I thought the library, a room a few steps away from the main room, was awesome. Multiple tvs, dark hard wood decor, large comfy couch, full bar, and pool table. What more can a guy ask for? Apparently the James has taken the comfy rooms of houses (libraries and dens) and recreated them in their event space for a unique twist to any party one may be hosting. However, for me these rooms, although very cool, did not sell me on the James for events.",N
2653,"Our stay at The James was great! It's a smaller hotel than I'm used to staying in, but it was fantastic. The room was a nice size. The bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in away from home. Very clean. Very quiet. Great customer service. If we needed new towels, they were rushed up. Every night they have turn down service where they offered to turn down your bed, get you ice, and they bring you cookies. Only a few negative things during our 3 night stay: The room service was pretty average, but expensive per usual. The valet parking was $48 a day which is nuts!! We were on the top floor, and our room was always crazy hot. We had to have the thermostat at 55 degrees so that we wouldn't sweat. The whole place only has 2 elevators, and at 2am after all the New Years parties were coming to an end we came back to the hotel to find a HUGE line to get in an elevator.   All-in-all, I'd stay here again.",N
2680,"This Place rocks! its so quaint, clean , quiet and private and smack dab in the center of everything! just steps from Bloomies which I loved! I had a friend in town and they needed to be in the city  what a perfect spot. The staff is exceptional and the gym is great. I loved the decor. and the bartenders were attentive and fun.",N
2684,Stayed for three nights this week. The hotel was very clean and the staff very polite and helpful. The hotel is conveniently located to Michigan Avenue and downtown. We will stay here again.,N
2792,"This is review of the N. State Street Embassy Suites in the heart of beautiful Chicago. It is based on my stay here from July 28 to August 3, 2012. The review is broken into categories. Location!Location! Location!: 4 stars     The location is in the heart of downtown Chicago on busy N. Street halfway between U.S. Cellular (Comisky) Park and Wrigley Field. It is convenient to public transit. The El runs underground along State Street. It is near to Chicago icons including the Magnificent Mile, The Chicago River, The Loop, and the Navy Pier. The nearby dining choices are commendable. They include Weber Grill (I rated it 4 stars), Rock Bottom Steak House (I rated it 3 stars), Pizanos Chicago Pizza (I rated it 4 stars), Pizzaria Uno, and a dictionary worth of others. Suites: Its a suite not a room-3&1/2 stars   Embassy Suites rents 2 room suites. They are spacious, yet not perfect. The Maids did a remarkable job maintaining the cleaniness of the room. The beds were comfortable. There are two beds in the master bedroom and a couch that converts to a bed in the secondary bedroom. The refrigerator allowed me to load up on healthy snacks from the nearby Trader Joe's.  Just like the two other Embassy Suites, I stayed in, bathroom ventilators were nonexistent. Being a suite, a closet is more justified than a cabinet. East-facing rooms have a natural alarm clock. Owing to the fact that the drapes fail to close all the way, I found myself rising with the sun. The suites shut out the noise from the adjacent room at the same time there is noise exposed from the adjacent suite into the secondary room. Amenities: This ain't Motel 6- 4 stars   Staying in Embassy Suites satisfies my vacation philosophy of coffee by day and alcohol by night. The Manager's Reception has got to be the greatest amenity happening in the hotel industry. From 5:30 to 7:30, the base floor of the atrium turns into an open bar. Drinks are unlimited, with the exception that you can only pick up one drink at a time due to state law. After 2 hours at the Manager's Reception, my stress was momentarily history.  In the morning Embassy Suites provides a freshly made breakfast buffet. And it is good. However, it gets crowded. The hotel gets taken over by guests carrying around plates of breakfast. In my case, I use the other breakfast amenity, the Starbuck's downstairs, and the Starbuck's stores within a couple blocks radius of the hotel.  For people wanting more than coffee and alcohol, there is a swimming pool and hot tub. The water temperature was satisfactory. They stay open to midnight. Nearby to the swimming pool is a gym.   In the atrium is a business center. I never failed to get a computer. The business center comes in handy on account of the fact that wifi is an extra charge and a high phone signal is sporadic. Conclusion: One more 4 star Embassy Suites.   Embassy Suites-a Hilton division- has yet to let me down. This is one more Embassy Suites that I recommend.",N
2793,"There were pros and cons.   Pros: Location couldn't be better.  We stayed at the lakefront location last year and even though that hotel was in better shape and the stay was an overall better experience, we preferred the centralized location of this hotel.   Check in was efficient if not overly friendly. Room was up to date, clean, and boasts very comfortable beds.   Breakfast was well cooked and of good quality, although often a little on the chilly side. Reception drinks were well-made and the line moved quickly.  Excellent snacks. The attached restaurant (not run by Hilton) was *wonderful*. Cons: (Small complaint) No automatic upgrade for Diamond members.  I didn't bother to ask because this was a weekend point redemption and I was pretty sure they were sold out by that point. It's nice to be recognized for loyalty. Breakfast seemed incredibly understaffed.  Tables sat waiting to be bussed for 30 minutes or more.  People were wandering around with trays looking for places to sit while 1/3 of the tables were piled with garbage and dishes. The floors were sticky and dirty.  The service area was sticky with spilled food and sported balled up napkins and discarded cups. Food was chilly even as it came out of the back because I'm guessing they had to make it way ahead of time.  Breakfast was regular-weekend crowded, not line-snaking around the atrium crowded, so I can't imagine why the cooks and bussers seemed to be so overworked.  Maybe everyone called in sick that day? Price was bad.  Granted we came for a weekend in the middle of summer, but the price on this hotel for that weekend was the same or more than Conrad, the Drake, or the Wit.  I opted instead for a rewards redemption, but I had to bust out the same number of points I would have for anything in Hilton's luxury line.  So my expectations were enhanced and as a result, I was less than impressed. I love the Embassy Suites chain in general and as we travel and move around a lot, I've stayed at 30-40 different ES properties over the past 15 years or so.  This one was middle of the road.  The price was exhorbitant in comparison.  If you are staying with kids and you can snag a price of say, $179 or less, then give this place a shot.  But if you are trying to get away as a couple, there are better choices.  Much better.  Please don't EVER pay the $349+ dollars they wanted for last weekend.",N
2794,"Great for a group looking to be in a prime tourist location! Five of us shared a room on a Friday night in May 2012.  As far as the room goes, beds are soft and comfy - I slept so well!!  Had everything we could need (hair dryer, fridge, table, couch, etc) except free internet.  Interesting room layout - windows overlook both the outside of the building and the walkways on the inside - a little strange, but understandable as the center of the building is filled with light secondary to the big atrium with skylights and a decorative fountain on the first floor that surrounds the seating for brunch. A nice bonus to the hotel - free drinks between 5:30 and 7:30 and a free breakfast in the AM.  The breakfast was delicious - made-to-order omelets, potatoes, bacon, sausage, fruit, yogurt, coffee, juices.  Definitely a good deal for a big group like ours who were looking to relax and have a few drinks. The location is ideal.  We don't mind walking so we took a hike to Navy Pier, down the Magnificent Mile past the Trump Tower and Wrigley Building to Millennium Park and Buckingham Fountain, west to the Sears Tower, ending up at Giordano's (my favorite deep-dish pizza place in Chicago).  At night we went out on Hubbard Street, a place with many bars/clubs to choose from.  There are lots of restaurants nearby, making settling on a place for dinner difficult.  We settled on Volare as it's not a chain and people on Yelp love it.  :) Oh, and while the hotel parking is expensive (over $40 with no ins-and-outs), there was a small lot on the corner that let hotel guests park for up to 24 hours for only $25.  Nice deal, but so small that it probably can't be depended on to be available. Overall, great location, nice perks, and comfy beds.",N
2795,"A pretty good place for the family to stay. The hotel isn't as up to date as the other Embassy Suites near Navy Pier and wears it's age a bit. Room was typical Embassy  Suites. Pool was okay. Great location, blocks to either River North or Michigan Avenue. Had a great view of the Tokyo Hotel though. Breakfast was a bit of a disappointment vs other locations I've been too. The staff wasn;t exactly friendly except the bell hop. Biggest gripe, as with all the entire chain, is that they do not offer free internet access-though plentry of networks to log into that were unsecured",N
2799,"Great location, above average room. Comfy bed and pillows, great free breakfast, pleasant staff. Dinner in the Italian restaurant in the hotel was great and reasonable. About 184.00 for a saturday night for room $75 per couple for dinner with wine and tip!",N
2800,"We were here thanksgiving week for 2 days and enjoyed our stay here. This was in an excellent location with the weber grill restaurant right across the street.We checked in and had a nice suite on the 9th floor with a great view off of state street(street noise was not loud either).The room was very spacious and it had 2 tvs in the room and one was a flat screen.One plus to this place was the free breakfast & cooked to order eggs. They also have a happy hour in the evening with free drinks & snacks also.The indoor pool was no real big, but nice enough to swim in. Me & my honey also enjoyed the hot tub and the jets felt good on my back.You do have to pay for the internet in your room & in the atrium area.They do have a business center with 3 computers that you get on the internet for free.All the employees here are very friendly & helpful and they answer all your questions.Parking here is pretty expensive so you might have to look around to get a deal in this area.I would definitely stay at this place again. Its close to navy pier,and all the good dining. Its also nice because you can hop on the train close by and all the buses.",N
2801,"A new fan! Family friendly and truly a gem in downtown Chicago! Our stay was brief but unforgettable. The best was the phenomenal complimentary breakfast and great parking. You can actually check out and leave your vehicle till 3:00 pm allowing you to continue to enjoy all of the wonderful shopping, eating and sightseeing nearby without the worry of ""Omg where do I park?"" Loved it, love it! Pool could be bigger but hey, who needs a pool when you got a whole city to explore??!!.",N
2802,Hands down one of the best/friendliest hotels in the Chi!,N
2834,"I loved my stay in this hotel.  Check-in took too long, but was worth it.  That's because the friendly staff member worked hard to find me a great room, and found a way to get me free wireless during my stay.  Good start! On the other hand, the first (well-earned) cocktail i had was a $14 disaster.  A martini in a (not-cold) wine glass!  Come on.  Despite really enjoying my time in this hotel, i'll get the negative out of the way first - mediocre overpriced restaurant.  LOUSY lattes in the coffee shop. The room was small, but clean.  Nice furniture.  Nice view. Good location.  Just enough removed from the Magnificent Mile that it wasn't loud at night.  A perfect spot for watching the lights of the skyscrapers and reflections on the river.  Easy walk to the L. Easy walks or cabs to about any restaurant in town.  I took an warm afternoon stroll through Navy Pier. On the river boat Chicago architecture tour, i learned that the Sheraton i was staying in was designed to look like a cruise ship.  Finally...  it all made sense.  In fact, i was proudly staying at one of the structures featured by the narrator during the super-informative, beautiful look at the city.  (Maybe i should be reviewing that.) I stayed here over St. Patrick's Day weekend.  I couldn't believe that i was able to select what type of view i got (especially since i booked my room Shattner-style - bidding on Priceline...  woo hoo - did i get a bargain!).  I got lucky with the river-view, that just happened to include a front-row view of when they turned the river bright green.  That, and the 80 degree weather, made for a particularly upbeat end to a quick business trip. Great Irish pub next door on the riverfront.  Great riverwalk/river-jog location!   I noticed there is a liquor store one block away, so there is a solution to the lousy drink. And a Starbucks graces the entry of a grocery store that is only about two blocks away. As you can see, i recommend staying here.",N
2835,"I've stayed here a few times and its been great every time. I live in the suburbs but sometimes its nice to stay in the city. Super comfy rooms, personable staff, excellent views of Navy Pier and the Chicago River and just steps from Michigan Ave. Starwood Preferred Guest members enjoy upgraded rooms, complimentary bottled water and other extras. The drinks at the bar are a bit pricey ($14 on average) but are plenty strong enough to make up for it. The hotel is also walking distance to Chicago favorites like Gino's East Pizza, Northwestern University and Piano Bar. Best part? Its in the exact same area as the Trump Hotel with rooms at 1/2 the price or less.",N
2836,"This Sheraton is a total Monet - the good old ""good from far but far from good"".  There is a rather grand lobby entrance - circularly shaped.  Behind that is an enormous area with couches and a lively bar.  This has all the hallmarks of a potential good stay.  The goodness stopped there. While the service was friendly, it took more than 10 minutes to check in - I had already worked a full day and traveled hours on a plane, sat in traffic from O'Hare, and I simply wanted to get to my room.  When I finally made it to my room, I entered to find someone's shoes in a plastic bag on the dresser - not a big deal on its own and I know that other people stay in this room on a nightly basis, but I don't need to be reminded of this fact.  It was 92 degrees that evening and the climate control was set to 75 - I changed the settings to 65 but the ac didn't turn on all night.  The iron in the room was broken and the hair dryer was on its last legs. Overall, it was a subpar experience for me.  While the gym was excellent, the room I stayed in was in desperate need of renovation.",N
2837,"Absolutely the worst hotel experience I've ever had around the world. They screwed up our reservation by breaking our 4-day stay into a 1-day + 3 day, locking us out. We were traveling with an infant so we specially called ahead to make sure there would be a crib set-up, which we re-confirmed when we checked in, but they didn't get that taken care of until after midnight. We ordered room service but that never showed up. I will most likely never stay at a Sheraton again in the future.",N
2838,"We stayed here for our fist night in Chicago - GREAT Location.  The rooms are adequate - somewhat out dated and the valet parking is ridiculous expensive - $51 for 24 hours.  It was a short visit and for location it is a great hotel. But if you are looking for comfort, there are other nicer and more hip hotels closer.",N
2839,"I have been a fan of Sheraton hotels and this is one of my favourites. I was here for a conference twice and we've also stayed at their suites as well. We enjoyed their thorough service and the beautiful space which is great for any business needs. You can't beat the location either. It's just by the Chicago River and if you are lucky, your hotel room might be facing a scenic river view which is especially gorgeous at night. It is also a short walk away from Michigan Avenue shops and other touristy places in the loop and restaurants in River North. I highly recommend this hotel for tourists who is looking for a wonderful place to spend the night.",N
2840,"I'm only judging this place based on it's conference space. I came here for the recent APS conference this past may and it was extremely well organized. The place feels so clean and the location is great; it's near major bus lines and shopping areas. The place is also near the Navy Pier, which was a great plus. The doormen are super polite & service in general at the lobby seems very welcoming and friendly, not to mention there are so many places to lounge around! The interior decor is nice as well. What I love best are the bathrooms. They keep them so well-kept and it smells nice and not disgusting despite so much foot traffic. I know that's kind of random, but hey, nice bathrooms are nice bathrooms.",N
2841,"Room was dirty when I arrived. Water still on toilet seat from cleaning crew. Mold in shower grout. Paper thin walls. I could hear every door close all night long. Every five minutes a door would open and close and I could hear it from the bed. Phone conversations in the next room were easily heard. Surprising for a Sheraton. Three times during my stay, the key stopped working. I had to wait for an elevator down, walk to the lobby, get new keys and try again. Many people in our party were having this problem. It got old quickly. Mini bar cost more than was advertised on my final bill.",N
2842,This place is a nice find in Chicago.  I love Starwood Brands and Sheraton in particular because they allow pets.  The rooms are what you would expect.  The best thing about the hotel is the location.  You can get pretty much anywhere you want to go downtown by walking.  Cabbing it is easy too.  The hotel has a spacious lobby and a few restaurants if you feel lazy and dont want to leave the premises.  The staff were very friendly and it was a breeze to check in and out.,N
2843,"If you're using Google maps, it will probably direct you to the service entrance. The main entrance is fairly obvious, but you might have to go around the block to find it. Really nice view from most of the rooms, either of the river and lake or of the city. If you're someone who likes to exercise, this hotel is literally one block from the paved lake-side trail. The trail goes all the way down to the museum campuses (and the yacht club and Navy Pier). There are also rental kayaks and bikes available just below the bridge...so you can literally find stuff to do right outside your hotel door. The hotel gym is ample and there is evidently an LA Fitness nearby, which I saw pop up on my Yelp app. I walked by one other gym. I was disappointed in the quality of the towels, but the bed was fantastic. Spacious suite, with not only bedside outlets for your phone (and desktop outlets for your laptop) but TWO ipod/phone radios so I was able to listen to my own music. The stars were lost due to cleanliness. In the hallway (26th floor) there was a half-eaten cookie and TWO dental picks which stayed on the ground for well over 24 hours. That is just foul. In our room, there was a gummy worm on the floor. We only brought gummy watermelons. Again, foul. However, we did not receive any bug bites, which I always worry about when staying in a pricier hotel in a large city. Valet is quick, taxis are always right outside the door. Lots of restaurants within walking distance.",N
2844,"On the lower end of Sheraton hotels. The lobby and public areas are nice. The rooms are dated, though some of them do have a nice view. The concierge lounge only does continental breakfast which is kind of a bummer. Location is pretty good, close to Michigan Ave and Navy Pier. All in all, not a bad stay, but don't expect to be wowed.",N
2845,"Review is for the hotel as a conference center. It was fine and functional. The setup with the escalators to go between the various floors is confusingly laid out, all the up escalators are on one side and all the downs are on another. Kept going to the wrong side. The lobbies were fine and comfortable. The staff at the bar were pretty brusque though. The wi-fi access is poor in many of the conference rooms, which was very frustrating. The bathrooms are nice, meeting rooms were standard. The downstairs rooms for exhibitions were set up very poorly for cleanup - major exhibition with about 100 different tables giving out papers, brochures, food, and in the end there were like two small trash cans for the entire room, so there was trash everywhere.",N
2846,"I'm with most of my fellow reviewers... I have very mixed feelings about this hotel. The bed was super-comfortable.  I really wanted to take the pillows home with me.  The view from my room on the 20th floor was incredible!  That's about the only positive thing I can say. The bell service was supposed to deliver some important items to co-workers who were staying at the hotel... they didn't get them on time, but I was still charged the $2.50 to-room delivery charge. *sigh* Internet - both wired and wireless - is $12.95 a day! What a rip-off!! I would expect wired service to be free of charge. My room key cards would not stay activated.  They demagnetized the minute I put the card in the purse.  So, every time I came back from leaving my room, I had to call security to let me back in.  That was getting old really quick!  They suggested not putting the card in my purse, so I put it in my pant pocket... same issue.  I guess I'm supposed to carry the card around like an Olympic torch? Breakfast was ridiculously expensive!! To eat IN the restaurant was even more expensive than the same items for room service.  I had coffee, 2 eggs and toast, my bill was $24 (there goes my per diem... guess I'm skipping lunch). I have to say the valet guys out front were great! And the hotel is very clean and very pretty, but for a hotel of this size and status, I was expecting the little things to run just a little bit smoother...",N
2847,"I enjoyed my stay here. One thing stood out above all, go to the breakfast spot downstairs and get the $24 all-you-can-eat buffet. It's pricey, but it's one the best breakfasts I've ever had. They got it all...and it's all unbelievable.",N
2848,Room: Nice. View: Very nice Bed: Excellent! Towels: few and thin Location: great Internet: $14/day (unacceptable!) Seems to be a convention oriented hotel which isn't optimum for vacationers (lobbies packed with business people etc.). Short comings could be overlooked if there weren't several really nice alternatives nearby. No free Internet is horrible in this day and age.,N
2849,THE BEDS ARE AMAZING!!! Had a night downtown here & I want to go back!!,N
2851,"We stayed here at the beginning of December after attending a family wedding at the Trump Towers... we should have stayed there instead... our mistake. This was our attempt to stay close by, but to have our privacy.... We pulled up for valet, and a rushed man came over and took our keys and asked if we needed any help with bags. ""Yes, we do."" was my reply. You should have seen the look on that mans face when he saw we only had one bag.... I was in an evening gown and heels while my fiance was in a tux for a winter evening reception in Chicago. Why would we risk dirtying ourselves for a bag? As if the attitude wasn't enough... we waited... and waited... for our bag to be delivered. We finally had to call down 3 times... The last time I called. I told the rude boy on the other end it was a red bag. He replied with ""Well... hmm... we have A LOT of red bags down here.... so I'm not sure.... what... to do..."" Finally I said I'd be down there in a short elevator ride to pick up my bag... and suddenly... eureka! The bag was found. WHAT A JOKE!",N
2856,"My hotel room was mostly clean (accepting the candy wrappers half way under the tv cabinet that were there when I checked in & when I left) and sort of run down, chipped sink, peeling wall paper.  The bed was really comfortable and the internet was pretty speedy. (But really $15 a day for wifi? Glad my conference included it.) The meeting rooms were mostly easily found and the coffee shop & cheaper breakfast/lunch place were fine.  So why 2 stars?  Normally I would leave it at 3 but c'mon. My room was over $250 a night. Yes, I realize I'm in downtown Chicago and that my room rate subsidizes the meeting rooms, but for that you can glue down the wall paper and give me towels that don't seem so tired.",N
2861,"Had room reservations. Arrived at 11pm to be told that they are oversold and I needed to be put in a room with a pull out bed. NO other rooms in the hotel, I ask. Nope, the reply. As if I had a choice at 11pm after 6hrs of flight tugging 60lbs of luggage. Got to the room, and I use this term loosely. The pull out mattress (use that loosely as well), was about 60 yrs old and 3 inches thick. Would have woke up with wire marks permanently gouged into my back. Called down and asked to be moved to a new hotel... Oh, suddenly the manager found a room with a king bed. Well that's nice. Pretty sure I asked that 30 minutes before. Then was told that I would need to move rooms tomorrow. Going to claim squatters rights. Will give it 2 stars for the nice lady at the front desk who was very apologetic and understanding of my grief.",N
2862,"This hotel is situated in a great area of Chicago, right next to the river. It is in prime location because you can walk to Michigan Ave for shopping or any restaurant that you want to. The layout of the hotel and cleanliness is great as well. The rooms of this hotel are small, even if you get a queen-bed room. The main reason I was unhappy with this hotel was because of the staff. From the door-man outside to the reception desk inside, they are not kind or professional. They all seem like they hate their jobs and are being forced to work there. My friend left my shoes that I needed for the evening at the front desk with my name and room number. When I sent my wife to ask them for the shoes, the man working there was very rude and didn't even listen to what she was asking for. He said there was nothing there. When I went later and spoke with another person, my shoes were there the whole time. Later, when I asked the front desk for a cab, they told me I would have to call-in for a cab or wait for one outside. I decided to walk outside and find a cab myself. When I finally flagged one down and asked it to pull into the hotel driveway, the bell-man (door-man) was so rude to me and treated me (31 yr old male) like a 10 year old child telling me that it was his job and I should have told him. Then why did the staff inside tell me I would have to get one myself if there was a bell-man outside for that job? After treating me like a child, he went on to embarrass me in front of my friends stating that he should get me a uniform so I could work there with him since I'm more pro-active than he is. WTH?! Does anyone treat guests that way? If this is how you want to be treated by staff at a renowned hotel chain, then this is the place for you. No professionalism, no courtesy, no spacious rooms. Would you take a chance with that kind of money?",N
2866,"We stayed here four nights. First room we had was very outdated and cramped.  Due to some major issues with room service, the manager upgraded us to a newly renovated room. It was slightly larger, had new carpeting, updated bathroom and a great view of the river/city. Ate breakfast here twice. Got the full breakfast buffet the first time. It was pricey at $24, but good. I wouldn't rate it great. The second time, I got the Continental for $19. Found a dead bug in my dish of fruit...they comped my meal. Bistro / patisserie has good coffee and a small selection of pastries, etc. A bottle of Fiji water will set you back more than $5 - more than most airports I've been to. Stock up on snacks and bottled water at Walgreen's nearby. Yolk is a good breakfast / lunch place, and it's near the hotel if you don't want to drop $20+ for breakfast. I wasn't very impressed with Sheraton although their location on the river and their city views were terrific.",N
2869,"Rooms are small. We arrived after midnight to find they didn't have a room, even though we had reserved - not cool! Nice location though. I'd recommend Weston michegan ave instead.",N
2884,I went to the Sheraton with my friend and her mom for an event. My favorite thing about the Sheraton has to be the fact it's right by the Chicago River.,N
2889,"I got a great deal from http://priceline.com. The hotel was beautiful, everyone was nice and helpful and they gave me a late checkout; 1pm without any problems!",N
2899,"I came here with a few friends for a wine tasting. We didn't stay, so this review is strictly for the decor and loby service. This place is clean, has plenty of bars and lounges on various floors, and valet. One thing about the valet service, they have a very confusing system. I was sent around the front entrance and down into the parking garage, after I had specifically asked for self park. When I pulled up to the attendant down under, he wanted to valet my car and when I asked him for self-park, AGAIN, he waived me off and down the lane without direction or courtesy. Needless to say, I ended up leaving the endless underground garage and parking at another facility across the street. Yes, the other facility charged me the similar $26, but I was happy to give them my money instead of you know who. The experience was festive and the lobbies are artfully fun. In the future I may venture to stay here, but I'll surely remember to take the train.",N
2942,"I'm so sad to give it such poor rating since my husband proposed to me here...however when my family was here it visit me for a week I had an awful experience with Sheraton. As soon as I checked my family in, i realize that they did not fully clean the room. There was wet, used coffee packs and some items were missing in the room in which they actually charged us. Also the service downstairs to get a taxi was pretty awful. There were two families in front of us and no hotel help at all to get taxis. It's very expensive and the rooms are not great. The only nice part is the lobby. We made a complaint about the experience and they were nice about, but I would  not come back again.",N
2946,Average rooms with a nice view of the city and river.  Restaurants in the lobby are very overpriced.  Within walking distance of many nice restaurants and bars.,N
2982,"My husband took me to stay the night for a fun date night one year and I'm finally getting around to writing a review of this place. Well, it's the W hotel, which obviously means it's stylish, cool, trendy, all in once place with an exceptional location in Chi-town overlooking Lake Michigan. We were there in the winter so I can't speak for spending time outside the hotel facilities so we definitely took full advantage of the inside. The people at the lobby were super nice, the decor was fab-u-lous throughout and the actual hotel room was spacious, clean and had a very chic feel to it. We left as happy guests. The best part of the hotel is that it houses Wave restaurant which is like Mediterranean tapas and it's absolutely delicious and definitely cost effective. This 4 star hotel is a great location to stay for both tourists, locals and even if you're on business trips, the concierge will be friendly and polite and the bar is definitely worth checking out and if time allows, make a reservation at Wave. And I have to mention that I got a really good night's sleep when we stayed our one night, bed was super comfy and those pillows, I was seriously contemplating taking them home with me.",N
2983,"stayed at the property over the weekend, got a fantastic rate on priceline. We took the blue line to Clark/Lake and then took the taxi to the hotel. Check in process was smooth, we had a wonderful room with a view of buildings across the street. Room was nicely furnished, flat screen, high beds, window shades between bedroom and bathroom. The room smelled nice and the furnishings were in a fine condition. We got a glimpse of the rooms with a view from the elevator waiting area - it looks our directly at a beautiful beach with Navy Pier to the right. I can imagine how amazing it must be to wake up with that view in the morning. It was raining on Friday night, we asked to use the hotel umbrella when we went out for dinner but apparently they were all out. The agent at the front desk offered us her personally umbrella but we declined (I think her name was Arianna - great service). We also had forgotten the charger for our iPhones, although they weren't able to send us one for our room, it was no problem to stop by the front desk and leave it there to charge in the back. We did that for 2 nights. The welcome desk was a little chaotic the two times we needed to speak to them, and when we did their attitude wasn't entirely pleasant. That was the only minor flaw to the hotel besides the unusually slow elevators that seemed to stop at every floor every time we needed to go to the lobby. We had plans all weekend, so didn't get to use the pool, restaurants or bars on site.  We rented a zip car for 2 hours for our little excursion on Hot Doug's on Saturday morning. The car was parked a block away in a lot, very convenient. Other times we took the Red line (Chicago), explored the city on foot, and at the end of the night we took the taxi to the hotel. The W Lakeshore is located a bit far from the river and Michigan Ave. but the lake view is simply breath taking. If the weather was warmer, the pedestrian path by the lake and the beach is just across the street. Perfect for someone who wants to go for a jog or just relax by the water.",N
2984,"Overall, I think I'm less and less a fan of the W concept. This hotel has both good and bad. The rooms are very updated and comfortable, but- the soundproofing stinks. Had to swicth rooms and still was awakended by noise the next morning. The staff is very friendly, but- they are so friendly it takes them forever to check you in, so the folks behind you get to wait. The location next to the lake is great, especially if you have a lakeview, but- it's also far from everything else, with few amenities in immediate walking distance. Probably will hit up the Westin on my next stay. But if you're in the mood for the hipster scene, this might be your place to stay.",N
2985,"I'd like to make a confession. I don't really like W hotels all that much, but I REALLY don't like this one. Whatever. Whenever... though personally, I'd like to put a little more emphasis on 'Whatever'. I don't like walking into what looks like a club with blasting music and $16 martinis in the morning. I don't like feeling like you have to be sexy at 8am, 2pm and 4:00am in the morning after you've been rained on all day/night and the concierge at W hotel has the nerve to recommend the Hangge-Uppe as a decent after hours bar... for that cruel joke I should actually give 1-star but I'll be kind regardless of what my ovulation cycle is telling me. I will say that I do enjoy the quirky rooms at most W locations, though I feel like this W is lacking the quirky and leaning more towards stuffy. I don't like being ignored by the bartender or being carded by the same one twice in less than hour after not moving seats. Never has there ever been a more invisible neon orange-haired person than at the W Lakeshore's bar. I know most people probably come here from out of town, but my experience was for a weekend-long and God-forsaken bachelorette party so I was more than non-plussed when I found out that parking here over the weekend would cost me close to $200... a price that I simply can't afford, and would refuse to pay for parking anywhere regardless. I ended up hitching a ride with the bride and husband-to-be so that worked out, but then we'll get into the nitty-gritty of paying what the room rate for this hotel is vs what you get. On a typical rainy, chilly and windy as f*ck Chicago day, I wouldn't consider the W Lakeshore to have much of a view. Looking out the windows to the stormy, grey Chicago days outside was like taking a photo of depression and charging people $400 a night to look at it. No thanks. Waiting for a cab at their cab stand was brutal. We basically had to add 15-20 minutes onto any of our travel times to accommodate the long lines here, and the car service they had was never available at any point from Thursday-Sunday, sooo don't count on trying to save any scratch or be able to take advantage of any of of the perks. The front desk told me that the best way to be able to get a reservation in with them was to come down a half hour before the concierge opens and wait in line to try and get a booking. Uhm, I don't know about you, but getting up and going down to the club atmosphere lobby at 7:30am and waiting in line for 30 minutes to ask for a ride. F*ck that noise. Oh and for the price of the room on weekend, I was expecting a bowling alley in there or something, not just 2 beds, very little room and a bathroom with ZERO privacy that actually has a window you can open to see people on the toilet. Kinky... but not totally my thing. I just don't dig it and I don't know that I ever will.",N
2986,"The good:  the view; location The bad:  service non-existent (or rude when you get someone's attention) Dirty, dingy, tired rooms (stains on sheets, walls, really foul) Cheap furniture Air conditioning erratic and LOUD Poor lighting (don't even try to shave in the bathroom); dimly lit elevators Constant barrage of music. Very dated atmosphere. So many better choices (and cheaper).",N
2987,"Great service, beautiful hotel and rooms! The lobby felt like a nightclub! Very hip!",N
2988,"You cannot go wrong with a W Hotel. It is stylish, fancy, cool, chic, all in one. In addition, it is in a great location in Chicago, overlooking Lake Michigan. The hotel itself counts with a great swimming pool, excellent fitness facilities and a great restaurant in the lobby. While most of front desk's staff is very friendly, there were occasions that I had to deal with arrogant ones, as if we were doing a favor in staying at the hotel. One last reason for not receiving a five-star is that, on some occasions that I had stayed there, the floor of the room would be wet or the internet would be extremely slow that I would just give up using it altogether. All in all, it is a great hotel. With its brand, we would expect nothing but perfection. That is why, a five-star is not granted just yet.",N
2989,"Pro's Water views Navy Pier Views Rides via Acura service Nice Room Con's $30 for wifi for two night stay $55 for parking LOUD tecno music at 7:30 AM when everyone is hungover is not necessary.  I get their trying to be hip, but no one wants to hear it in the morning.",N
2990,"Amazing views and location.  The room was nice, though the shutters in the bathroom over doors were a little strange for sharing the room with someone.  The valet was $55, so factor that into your price.  The concierge and front desk staff, like other W hotels, seem to be hired for coolness and not necessarily knowledge and friendliness, but they at least tried to help somewhat.   You can't be the location or the views though, and it's a clean and updated hotel with excellent amenities.  Also, the Whiskey Bar has a fantastic view.",N
2991,"Not my fave W:-( Lobby is just OK. Rooms are just OK. Rarely get a decent upgrade even with status! Their bar on the top floor sucks! Lobby bar is OK. And they serve bar snacks in huge community bowls. YUCK! Unfortunately, nothing to really rave about.",N
2992,"The location and the atmosphere of the hotel is nice,  The rooms were comfy and great view. However, the service is absolutely awful and unacceptable.It was hectic and chaotic and not what we would expect from a 4-star hotel, let alone the W. I am a frequent patron of the Starwood Family and this was absolutely dis-concerning. The concierges didn't even know the area, nor were they friendly or helpful. And when I finally dragged out of them a recommendation, it was probably the worst meal we ever had. He basically googled the restaurant that was closest to where we were going. Unacceptable.     The Acura car was never available and the spa was not enjoyable. The bar-tending staff was rude and slow. The elevator took forever and in a elevator conversation with another guest, they initiated the conversation on how disappointing this hotel was and chaotic and relaxing. So glad I was not the only one! I wouldn't return with all of the great hotels in Chicago.",N
2993,"I'm definitely a fan of W Hotels, but I can't say this location is one of my fav's!  As other's have mentioned, the retro-fit was poorly done and it's especially noticeable when it comes to their heating or air-conditioning.  The rooms have a tough time keeping a consistent temperature, and the hallways are either overly warm or overly cold.  Tough to find common ground. The bright side is, service doesn't get much better.  There's nothing this hotel won't do to help make your stay more enjoyable.  From great restaurant recommendations to driving you in the Acura Experience.  (which btw, is very common among W Hotels). So it's really a toss up for me....the the prices the command, I really don't believe there's room for imperfection.  As a matter of fact, try ordering a bottle to the room, and you'll probably fall off your chair - $250 bottle, $3.50 delivery, $51 bottle service, and $26 tax....WTF!!!!   are you serious!!!??? As for location, there's a great lake view, you're right by Navy Pier, and you're about 3 blocks (long blocks though) from Michigan (Magnificent Mile).  So while I'd agree there isn't all that much within the immediate block of this hotel, there are many options if you walk a few blocks. It's a toss up for me....but I think they'll have trouble getting my business again.....too many choices in the great City of Chicago to be paying top dollar and receive sub-par value.  Just my opinion.",N
2994,"Just what you expect from the W. Good customer service, comfortable room, and great location. If you're looking for a sure thing, the W usually never fails",N
2995,"W hotels and ""child-friendly"" are two terms that don't normally go together.  Usually, the trendy euro vibe, techno music and stylish bar/lounge make it the kind of place that parents used to go to. However, this W is different.  The location next to Navy Pier and all of the child-friendly parks and activities in the neighborhood mean that parents with young kids flock here, especially on a holiday weekend.   The hotel itself seems to have an identity crisis about this. Others have mentioned the poor use of the rooftop - the event-only space that apparently used to be a great restaurant.  On the pool level, a great outdoor patio overlooking Ohio St Beach and Lake Michigan is poorly utilized with a small, lonely bar and a few high tables. Where are the lounge chairs and the music that would give it a Rio or Miami-style vibe? Instead, with a small grill serving hot dogs and burgers, it had a family cookout feel, and it shut down around 8 (perhaps because the kids needed to get to bed). Speaking of kid-friendly areas, the pool area has no hot tub, but comes with pool toys so that the young ones can have fun.  It's also difficult to get food and drink service there (apparently you have to pay a 20% service charge and a delivery fee if you want anything other than the kid friendly food and limited bar on the patio.) One more gripe - in the morning, hot water was iffy in the shower - maybe it's tough to get it all the way up to the 32 floor. With all that said, since I wasn't traveling with kids, you may wonder why this place gets 3 stars? The answer? The view from a room on a high floor is downright breathtaking - get a room with a lake view if at all possible. The view can stand toe-to-toe with any ocean view on a sunny day, and is well worth seeing for yourself. The room was laid out so that you could see the view from everywhere (including the shower). The peaceful beauty of it might even help soothe you after a day with the kids. If the W starts a family-friendly line, this might be ground zero. But for the single partiers, guys/ladies nights out or young couples, I say go for the other W - City Center. For families and those that love a nice view, come on over - you won't be alone.",N
2996,"This W has a fair amount of pros and cons for me. Pros - great views of Lake Michigan, clean rooms, fresh baked chocolate chip cookies in the afternoon, Fonte coffee in the morning, very helpful concierge, decent sized gym. Cons - Not ideal for business travel since it is kinda far from everything business (and also a hike from the El), very poor a/c in the lobby/common areas/elevators.  I was there this past week when it was in the mid-90's and it was absolutely unbearable outside of the actual guest room. There is a nice lobby bar, which gets a decent amount of action at night but other than that, there is not too much within a short walking distance of this W.  On the other hand, cabs are easily accessible.",N
2997,"When we arrived we saw a sparkly huge W that made us get even more excited. We headed to Chicago for a smaller family vacation, only taking us an hour to get from the northern suburbs to Chicago, Perfect location!! The also give you Bliss prouducts, which smell very good. Now onto the bad side.... We found cut toenails on the floor of our hotel, I was thinking maybe even the cleaning ladies didn't want to clean it up so they left it there. That was on our first night so we were not pleased. They charge you for calling out of your room, and DOWN THE STREET. not happy about that either. The atmosphere was good, down the street from Navy peir, and we almost stayed because of a gymnastics meet I went to. Okay, Not recommmended, but a place stay.",N
2998,"A solid hotel, near Navy Pier. Good for business during the week, and a happening nightspot on the weekends (anticipate Vegas style noise from the drunks in the hallways Friday and Saturday nights). The bar had the usual mix of great bartenders and crappy, unattentive ones. If I recall, Mich Ultras we're $6 bucks, which seems kinda high, even for Chicago. We were there at the same time as an instagram party, which meant we got some gratis apps, and watched as people attempted to look more important than they really were, a la Hollywood style. The hotel room itself was nice, clean, everything as it should be, though as with many of the W chain, the bathroom is not sealed, rather has plantain shutters between the toilet and the bed...which when paired with the lack of a vent fan, can be awkward for a romantic weekend. The gym was small, yet well appointed. Wifi is free in the lobby...but they try to make you pay in the rooms. No surprises here.",N
2999,"I always favored the W on Lake Shore. I guess thats why I am an SPG member! The location is key for shopping, dining, beach and Navy Pier. A relaxed, enjoyable atmosphere at the lobby bar. I don't have any complaints! Thank you W for another enjoyable stay! Until next time.....",N
3000,"It is a W. And I love W's. Chic. Sexy. Stylish. Super hot staff. . Three reasons it wasnt a 5: - the location has a great view, but it is a little bit farther from the real mix of River North. I found myself in cabs more than I usually do in Chicago (though cabs are cheap and easy to get) - House cleaning is slow. If I leave at 830 and come back at 415- I expect my room to be cleaned. It wasnt - twice in 5 days. Not good enough. - I used their house dry cleaning service to clean and press a suit. The prices on the dry cleaning were what you'd expect from an in house luxury hotel service. The issue? I had a small split by one seam of my suit pants. SMALL. Asked if they could repair it (i could have with a needle and thread) and they said yes. They did, for $61! Sixty one dollars? Give me a break. $10 is standard, so $20 would have been standard for a hotel. They also just did it, and didnt tell me how much it would be. I was floored. None the less, I will stay here again. In the summer, the activity and proximity of the lake are unbeatable.",N
3001,"Love this hotel!!!! Would love it more if I was in my twenties, lol, but I can pretend.  The rooms are absolutely amazing and the views are completely unobstructed overlooking the lake! Dress cool tho when checking in, no pjs or sweats, you will look like an idiot, and that is just one of the many reasons I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!",N
3003,"Looked at this hotel for our wedding venue. The ballroom has amazing views - Navy Pier, the Lake, the City lights. We almost booked it strictly for the Saturday Night Firework Show that we would have just for our wedding (not the rest of the city of Chicago). :) The reason we didn't book here was just that the room was too dark and a little on the small side. We were told we could fit our 150 guests but just didn't feel like it would work. And we would have needed to invest in a lot of rentals (linens, chair covers, and draperies) to brighten up the space to fit our look/feel. Would definitely recommend this ballroom for anyone looking for a modern, city, stylish, and intimate wedding reception.",N
3005,"The view of this hotel is phenomenal. I have been here for both accommodation and events. Either way, I got to enjoy the scenic view of the lake shore. You can also see the Navy Pier from the top floor. It hosts great events, including one with the founders of Gilt.",N
3006,"Had an OK experience. Room was extremely small (we had to squeeze sideways between the bed and TV), bed was comfy, location was good, views were lacking. Good location as far as being within close proximity of Chicago hotspots. Nothing super memorable, though.",N
3007,"I have stayed at the W - Lakeshore many times before and always enjoyed it.  The overall vibe of the place is right up my alley.  Modern, minimalist, and cool.  From the moment the helpful and friendly front desk staff checks you in, you know this place is about details. The rooms are great!  Well, I should say that the beds are the best ever.  The 'Heavenly Bed' is just that, heavenly.  When I upgrade my own bed at home, it will be to a Heavenly Bed.  I can't say enough good things about how great I sleep on it.  Maybe they are spiking the Bliss spa products that they stock the bathroom with.  I'll steal these every chance I get! The bonus at my last stay was being able to see the Navy Pier Fireworks at NYE! Can't wait for my next stay!",N
3008,"This W was very nice. Right on LSD, a couple blocks from the Mag Mile, and we got a 14th floor view of the lake and Navy Pier. The rooms seemed pretty clean and I liked the cute little shutters you can open between the bathroom and the rest of the room. Also loved the full length mirror they provided and the robes. Staff was super helpful and I used the concierge multiple times. Definitely talk to them and get coupons and passes to things before you go anywhere. Breakfast was pretty good, but pricey if you don't have a breakfast coupon.",N
3009,"I just finished a two night stay at the W Lakeshore while job hunting and networking in Chicago.  It's a nice hotel with some minor problems, and thank goodness the rate was as good as it was (for the W, anyway).  It's a great option for those looking to stay near the Magnificent Mile and the Navy Pier.  Not so much if you're heading to the Loop. Pros: -The bed was the best hotel bed I have ever slept on: super comfortable and very plush -Hotel gym is one of the best I've seen: great views of the lake for the cardio equipment and a really nice indoor pool -Desk attendants downstairs were very attentive and willing to respond to any request -The restaurant was decent -Magnificent views of Lake Michigan and the Near North -Shower designed so that you can steam your clothes in the bathroom and not burn your hands trying to turn off the water.  Underrated but really nice feature! -Great location if you're doing business in the Magnificent Mile area Cons: -Shower itself was ok; not strong enough -Shampoo/Conditioner smelled terrible; seriously thought about going to Kiehl's nearby to get samples instead. -Wicker/Bamboo accents in the room were one shutter-slat away from being a Hollister. -Because the hotel building was rehabbed to be a W, there are some dings and older, slightly broken features in the rooms. -Desk staff RARELY answered the phone when I called down from my room.  I had to go downstairs to request anything from them. -Horrible location if you're spending most of your time in The Loop; also really far from the El -In room WiFi was kind of expensive -Ceiling in the gym was too short Overall: Hotel has some great features and plenty of room for improvement.  I'm sure there are better W Hotels elsewhere, and despite a really awesome bed, will likely stay elsewhere next time I come to Chicago.",N
3024,"My favorite place to stay in Chicago!  I prefer W Lakeshore to City Center as it doesn't feel as cramped to me.  Cozy beds, quiet rooms, yummy Bliss bath products, and the staff is great.  A bit pricey for the size of the room, but if you're able to score a deal (I usually am) then go for it!  Cheers, W!",N
3027,Bad service + dirty room with a super small bathroom + outdated techno music through out.,N
3029,"Spent the night last night as an end of spring break getaway with my husband.  Overall, we really enjoyed it. Pros Great rooms- comfy beds and the bathrooms are very nicely appointed Location on LSD is very convenient Cons Neighbors were crazy noisy, not good sound insulation Pool was way overcrowded I'd go back if the price was right.",N
3049,"Enjoyed the location, close to Navy Pier, the Lake, walking distance to Michigan Ave shopping.  Loved the gym and the treadmills looking out over the lake, makes you forget you are exercising. :-)  The staff were friendly and rooms contemporary, clean and comfy.",N
3078,I love the atmosphere!,N
3086,nice view of the lake. lake michigan? i chose the green option which means no room cleaning but extra starwood points (hooray!) restaurant downstairs had good food and lemonade (it was sparkling lemonade!). service was a bit slow. and the blue crab fritters were satisfying beds are comfy and high bathroom has a window that opens up to the room.. strange but fun to peek through?,N
3206,"This hotel was a lot of fun.  I came here for a staycation with my girlfriend.  We reserved the room online from their website, and by doing so we got free wifi - holler. but all in all it was a good stay.  We checked in around 7pm and the Tower King room i reserved were all taken so I got upgraded for free to a Tower King Suite, which was SWEET.  It was very spacious and had great views.  Windows on 3 different walls, the only direction we did not have a view of was to the west, and being that I live in West Loop, I wasn't missing much.   The windows were huge, the bathroom was huge as well, but the only qualm we had with the room was the shower was a little weird.  The floor of the shower was continuous with that of the rest of the bathroom.  It wasn't a problem, just kind of surprising.   We had 2 TVs, one in the living room and one in the bedroom.  A good variety of channels.  The bed was a legit King and was very comfortable. One other thing, there wasn't as much ""hard rock"" stuff as I would have anticipated.  We had a picture of Marilyn Manson in our room which was a little creepy but not bad haha.  But If there were more little music/rock things around the room it would have felt 'cooler.'  But all in all it was a fantastic stay.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to others and would love to stay here again.",N
3207,"I can't say I was thrilled with this hotel.  Everything was just 'meh' and at one point - gross.  The room was ok and the bed was nice, yadda yadda. Loved the horizontal mirror above the headboard. Bathroom was clean, city view was 'meh'. I was getting ready for bed and looked towards the wall near the ceiling, and next to the smoke alarm was a small towel stuck into what looked like a hole in the wall at the top. To gross and weird me out even more, there was brown stuff on the towel like the towel was plugging who knows what! ugh! I started to call the front desk about it, but it was so late (almost 1AM) I was tired and after a series of flights, I was done. I hadnt eaten either, so I decided to order room service. While browsing the menu options, the crab, spinach and artichoke dip sounded nice. Again, it was late, I didn't want anything too heavy - I had a big day ahead of me and needed to get some sleep. I placed the order and it was brought up in about 15 minutes.  While I waited, I was admiring my view of the city. What I didnt know was that there were others admiring the view too. Yes, there were gnats near the window! gross!! Needless to say, I was not the only one enjoying the spinach and artichoke dip. Oh and the dip was cold. I put the crap right outside my door. What a waste. The next morning I noticed a couple spiders crawling on the window pane - INSIDE the room! I feel like if there were others in the room, I should've been notified. Didnt know my stay would include gnats and spiders. Disgusting. I will NOT be staying here again.",N
3208,This hotel was much better than the one in San Diego which seemed a lot louder to me.   The lobby does funnel music from speakers but it isn't too overbearing where you can't hear the front desk staff (I had to yell in San Diego). The rooms are way too dark (grey walls and dark carpets) but I love how each floor is dedicated to a rock star.  My bathroom tiles could use updating.  (There are some things the darkness can't hide) When the weather is nice they have a rooftop party.  I didn't go so I can't really say how that is.,N
3209,"3 stars for the hotel overall. Minus 2 star for rooms being SUPER noisy, plumbing not working properly, and so-so staff. Upon walking into the hotel it looks like your typical Hard Rock. Very cool musical decor and modern. The rooms themselves are spacious and clean. Noisy though. WOW. I thought my window had been openend but nope....just no insulating to keep the noise from the streets out. Made it very hard to sleep at night. Also, my sink was dripping continually and the toilets flush weird and would not always flush. Overall nothing bad about the hotel itself I just wish they did a better job of noise control. Being close to the elevators didn't help either. I LOVE Hard Rock hotels though.",N
3210,so after the thrill of seeing some of the museum aspects of the hotel...jimi hendrix's outfit...you are done...the rooms are ok...i saw some janky furniture that should have been replaced...when you can tell that the desk is made of partical board covered with laminate because the laminate has peeled off...that's bad...,N
3211,"They wake you up, no matter what-- Yeah, the hotel is in a great location and has a fun vibe and does everything right except for one thing---The housekeepers literally go in and out of the doors about 20 times per room, allowing it to slam shut as they do.... So even though you have a do not disturb sign on the door, you will be woken up at 8... plus they talk to each other in the hallway (or on the phone), which is like them standing in your room talking..",N
3212,"Stayed here three nights, staff was great with fantastic recommendations. Room was nice but had a little funk to it (like someone had been smoking in there for awhile). Outside of that,  I would stay there again in a second!",N
3213,"I did not stay at the hotel, but I stopped in for a private party during Lollapalooza.  The hotel looks really nice and the AC was nice and cold (it was really blasting).  The atmosphere was pretty cool too.  I would definitely stay at this hotel if I was given the opportunity.  It seems like a pretty swanky place.",N
3214,"Nice, clean hotel in downtown. Great location.  Helpful staff.",N
3215,My husband and I stayed at the Hard Rock for 4 nights last summer. I got us a great deal that I was very happy with. Complimentary WiFi was included with our stay. We stayed on floor with the AC/DC memorabilia. The room and the bathroom were spacious and very well kept. The housekeeping service was impeccable. In fact all the staff was very courteous and professional. The location can't be beat - the hotel is right in the middle of everything. It's very close to Millennium Park and the Wendella Boat Rides are right next to it. The shops at North Bridge are only 5 blocks away. You can easily walk to Navy Pier as well. It shouldn't take you more than 15-20 minutes. John Hancock Center is quite close too - about a mile away. There are a lot of places where you can eat around. Cabs and public transportation are both easily accessible if you decide to visit Shedd Aquarium or the Museum of Science & History. I would recommend staying at this hotel.,N
3216,"Gets four stars for its location and price.  I booked this guy on Jetsetter and found a decent deal $150 a night booking two days in advance.  I was happy with that given that its in the heart of downtown and a very clean hotel.  Has a very trendy modern feel.  The lobby is real small, but has a free pool table.  My room was very clean and well kept.   Read my review on the bard downstairs - iddn't love that place at all.  But honestly, this was really just  a place to crash while I conquered Chicago for the weekend. I'll try and stay somewhere else next time ONLY bc I like to try new hotels to keep the experience fresh, but I would recommend this hotel to anybody.",N
3217,"This is a nice option when in Chicago.  Location is great.  Definitely has the vibe and decor that you would expect for the Hard Rock brand.  Room review: * Bed is nice and comfortable.  Not too hard, not too soft. * Bathroom nicely appointed / strong water pressure in the shower / nice bath products. * Due to the materials they used, some of the furniture is a bit beat up / will be hard to fix (would need to be replaced). Good electronics - big flat screen TV, clock with iPod dock. I was here for a corporate function, so I didn't pay the bill.  Good option if you can get in here for $200-300/night.",N
3218,"While it wasn't quite what I expected, my family and I had a great time at the Hard Rock Hotel, and it was perfect for celebrating my son's 16th birthday. It was a guitar-loving teenager's dream to be able to check out a guitar and take to our room! I did expect the ""rock star""  theme to be more extreme than it was, as it was a bit subdued, yet tasteful. The entrance was small, dark and had loud music blaring, which was a bit odd, but yet made us feel like we were in for a good time.  It was fun to go floor to floor to see which rock star was featured there and to see some memorabilia.   The room was stylishly decorated. However, it was quite dark in the hallway, and especially the bathroom which made it very difficult for my husband to shave and me to get ready in the morning. There is a very dimly-lit makeup mirror that did little to no good. The beds and pillows were very comfy. My main complaint in the room was the windows - they did very little to drown out the street noise and we were 22 stories high! Drawing the curtains did offer some help, but the blaring sirens that we heard throughout the night sounded like they were right in the room with us. Staff was friendly, concierge was extremely helpful, valet was professional. We had to wait well beyond check-in time for our room to be ready which was a pain, but they gave my husband some free drink tickets to use while we waited. Too bad the free drinks didn't help us as it was a family trip and we aren't big drinkers. Overall it was a good experience, made especially good by spending time with my awesome family.",N
3219,"Great location, especially for $160 on a weekend in summer. The entire staff (especially Bonnie & Zach) was very welcoming and out of sight unless needed. Rooms are clean, modern and fairly large for an old building. Again, great location. Sheets were a bit loud.",N
3220,"Very cool hotel, good location in the Loop! We bagged a Tower Suite at a great price, and man was it amazing! It was like 800 Sq. Ft and was very cool. The view was amazing! Kinda small in the lobby & stuff, but the service was pretty good. We did not have time to try the lounges or restaurants, so that will have to wait till next time. I would def stay here again, especially in the Tower Suite. It was pretty ""rock star""!",N
3223,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for Valentine's Day. The front desk staff was warm and very helpful. The room was very nicely decorated - the Rolling Stone magazine and IPod dock were a nice touch. Rock-star references all around the room included Moby, John Lennon, and KISS. I was very confused by the bedsheets. There was a non-fitted sheet tucked into the mattress that didn't even cover the bottom of the mattress. Then the naked bedspread on top - had two sheets covering it. We were confused and a little grossed out by the exposed mattress/bedspread. I can only assume that the person putting this room together ran out of supplies and we were the lucky recipient of the attempt to make the bed look nice. The bar/lounge downstairs has a great ambiance and we enjoyed the live accoustic performance. Besides the bed thing...great place!",N
3227,"The Hard Rock Hotel was among my top three choices after researching over 60 potential wedding venues in Chicago.  However, after the treatment I received while trying to see the space, it is crossed off my list and I would not recommend the hotel for any other purposes. I had exchanged emails with both the Direct of Group Sales & Catering, as well as the Wedding Specialist, and had an appointment to meet the Wedding Specialist and see the space last week.  Unfortunately, I was stood up.  I arrived 5 minutes early for the appointment and waited in the lobby for 45 minutes until giving up and leaving.  The very nice Concierge did her best to try to track down the Wedding Specialist to no avail.  After 30 minutes of waiting, another employee physically went to find her and came back to say, sorry she's in a tasting.  I'm not sure if she was double booked (she confirmed my appointment the night before) or if the previous appointment ran over, but there's no reason she couldn't have sent word to the lobby with her apologies and/or asked someone else to show me the space.  What's even worse is that 9 days later, I have yet to hear from her with an explanation, much less an apology.  I also contacted the Direct of Group Sales & Catering explaining my disappointment 7 days ago and have not heard from her either.  If this is the way they treat people during the sales process for a pricey event, I'd hate to see how they treat people who are already under contract.",N
3246,"I went here for a fundraiser last week.  The appetizers were not very good, there was one bartender for the entire event so getting a drink was very difficult AND....the bathrooms are located right next to the kitchen doors (now I know!).  I was coming out of the bathroom with a friend and BOOM a service lady plows through the doors knocks my friends drink out of her hand, her drink spills all over my fancy dress and all over and IN my Sam Edelman shoes.  I think I will be sending them a bill....",N
3254,Great place to stay in Chicago. Right on Michigan Avenue right near the Chicago River. Walking distance to many of Chicago's downtown attractions. Easy public transportation near by with the train and bus system. Cabs everywhere you turn around. We had a king bed room with a view. It was a corner room so I am not sure if they are bigger than the other rooms. Noise was not a problem. Housekeeping service was great with room cleaned and bed made daily. Didn't use any of the hotel restaurants or room service so can't comment on that. The front desk was great at customer service and Scott the concierge was A+. If you can get a good rate then I would highly recommend The Hard Rock in Chicago. We also got free wi-fi thru an online booking promo.,N
3290,"Carrie M.'s response to my review on 3/2/12 indicated that the Hard Rock Hotel wanted an opportunity to ""rectify the situation"" and suggested I send an e-mail with additional info. I did so and have not received any response in 3 weeks. I can only conclude that her offer was a face-saving exercise to provide the appearance of responsiveness to Yelp users. Nice customer service -- making a bad situation worse.",N
3302,"I stayed in the tower suite for the weekend of my birthday (Fri. 1/20-Sun. 1/22). The suite is fabulous and affordable. It's a one bedroom with the living area in the front and bedroom in the rear.  There are plenty of windows which give you a view of Millennium Park from the living room. One of the best things about the Hard Rock is that most of the staff are music fans so they are laid back and lots of fun.  In particular, Demetrius (DT), who served as a bell hop, bouncer and all around friendly face/host really made us feel welcomed by remembering our names and checking to ensure that we had what we needed. While there, I received a great bottle of wine the first night, turn down service, a comp drink at the bar and free pool games and music in the lobby. I highly recommend that Hard Rock Hotel if you are looking for a comfortable, friendly place to stay where music and enjoying life are the vibe and lifestyle.",N
3343,"I truly enjoyed this hotel and will be returning when I am back in Chicago. I came here during the NATO conference/protest and it was all smooth sailing.  Great location, great staff, cool rooms and an incredible pool. CONS: you can't really control the room temperature and there's a smalllll bathroom. PROS: everything else.  the pool was a great highlight -- a deep end, a greenhouse like atmosphere, friendly guards, etc... big beds, great location, affordable, great east around, etc... I'll be back.",N
3344,"The best thing about this place is its location.  We stayed here recently for a museum-filled weekend, and, even though we had to battle the blusterous wind and oppressive heat, the walk through Grant Park to the museum campus was always pleasant.  It's also an easy walk to Navy Pier, Willis Tower, and other attractions.  If walking isn't your thing, though, catching a cab on Michigan Ave right outside the hotel is always a breeze.  It's also just a block or two from Yolk, which is a must for early breakfasts. The pool was nice, and there's a fitness room that seemed fairly well-equipped, aside from the fact that there was only one treadmill. One thing we liked was that each floor has a Chicago theme (ours was The Art Institute), which was charming.  The decor throughout the hotel is faded art deco, and I'm a sucker for that kind of thing. If you're staying for longer than a weekend, though, this place might not be adequate.  Unless you get a suite (which we didn't do), the rooms have no microwaves and other things that come in handy for longer stays.  Also, there's no pay-per-view, and the available channels on the television are limited.  This is something I wouldn't typically complain about (who wants to watch TV on vacation?), but when you've got small kids, like I do, and their sleeping patterns are disrupted by travel, or if it rains, a movie is a good way to spend a little down time. We didn't visit the restaurant attached because it was very much not kid friendly.  There were plenty of other dining options close by, though. Overall, it was great for a place to sleep and to hop in the pool to cool off, which is all I need for a few days.  For a longer stay, I'd probably pick someplace else, especially with kids.",N
3345,"I stayed here a few weeks ago on a whim 'cause I wanted to stay downtown and go for a jog in Grant Park in the morning. I was quite impressed with how modern this place was considering the exterior and my previous experience with the Congress Hotel just down the street. The staff was very polite and bent over backwards to make sure I got a view of my favorite city. The lovely concierge even told me I could come back down for another room if the view wasn't to my liking. +1 you lovely concierge! My room was very trendy and up to date with modern fixtures and very clever use of space. Chicago has itty bitty hotel rooms in the older buildings but the Essex does a great job of utilizing what it has and the ceilings are tall enough that I can continue my tradition of jumping on the bed to christen the room. I love the view of the city from my room, the fantastic water pressure, the peace and quiet I get in my room and the awesome feel I get when I walk down the hallway. I feel like I'm in Quentin Tarantino's ""Four Rooms"" and feel glamorous when I spin around in the halls, the beautiful pool and my room. The best part is that they're close to public transportation if you're not the rental car kind of person, a Jewel-Osco, and a CARIBOU COFFEE! Ah, Chicago...how I've missed you.",N
3346,"I got a great deal from Priceline. The location of the hotel was great--right in the middle of all the touristy spots.  Unfortunate, they had just gotten rid of their free breakfast when we got there. The room was standard. Overall we were pleased by the value and the location.",N
3347,"Basically the room look nice and the housekeeping does a good job, although the sign says if you leave your towel hanging we won't replace it for good Eco friendly habits. They replace them everyday anyways it seems. Maybe they just refold them fancy but I think they replace them. My biggest complaint is that you can't control the temperature of the room. We sweat at night, sleep with the covers off, and make up melts right off our face while we're putting it on. It has several restaraunts within walking distance and one block. A sushi place, a blues bar that serves dinner and an Irish pub that serves meals.",N
3348,"This is a review of the restaurant, not the hotel.  The restaurant is Brasserie by LM and is located on the first floor.  I came here in the evening of April 28th, a Saturday night.    Looks can be deceiving - the place looks nice, inviting.  However, the food and the service were some of the worst that I've experienced.  The waitress had no concept of courteous manners, no concept of how to help diners enjoy their experience and kept pushing us to order a main entree, while not asking what we thought of the appetizer (french onion - a big miss).   The bread that came with the soup was so stale that it must have been at least three days old.   My friend and I were so disgusted by the arrogant waitress (the other service people may have been better but we have no way of knowing).   My friend and I decided it wasn't worth another bite, so we asked for the check, and asked for change to break a 20.  We saw the waitress go to the bar and make a face to the bartender, indicating as if how dare we ask for change for a 20 in a restaurant... that was the final straw.     I predict this restaurant fails, as the other restaurants in this location have.   I had hoped it would be better because I like to support South Loop restaurants.  This one gets a big X crossed off my list and I will be telling everyone not to go here.",N
3350,"I had to stay there for 2 nights. It was very noisy, it sounded like they had a washing machine room in front of mine. The noise would not go away, It took me a long time to be able to go to sleep. The bathroom was very old.",N
3382,"I was very surprised by how amazing this hotel is. It is PERFECTLY located right on the magnificent mile. Staff is super friendly and accommodating, I had both room service, went to the bar and to the restaurant and found all the service really great. I got a good deal from http://hotels.com and slept on the 5th floor, loved my room, it was not super big, but perfect for me and my luggage. There is a fitness room on the 25th floor. The elevators can be a bit slow, but the main reason for only giving 4 stars is that they do not have free wifi, you have to pay for it based on the connection speed you want. Will stay here again for sure next time I visit Chicago.",N
3383,"This hotel is in a perfect location for visitors to Chicago, in the middle of the shopping district and walking distance to the loop.  The room wasn't a bad size, things appeared relatively newish, and I got the room for a good price on a discount site, so I wouldn't complain anyway.   There are a few cons, though.  Being an upscale hotel in downtown Chicago, nothing's free.  They charge for internet, and the parking fee is outrageous.  I parked in a garage a few blocks away for far less, since I wouldn't need my car anyway.  They don't have enough elevators for a high-rise hotel, so it can be a long wait in the mornings and afternoons when everyone's checking in and out.   The hotel also charged my credit card for the room even though I had already payed through a discount site.  To their credit, though, they apologized and dropped the charge immediately when I called them about it.",N
3384,"Overall rating 3.5 stars.   Our Chicago trip was so amazing.  Hot as hell, but amazing and fun!  Hotel is very nice and conveniently located in downtown Chicago which is within walking distance of everything, shopping, eating, bars, desserts, you name it.  Staff seem to be quite friendly.  It was my first time in Chicago and it was such a culture shock for me when we arrived at this hotel.  The lobby looks big and spacious.  Then as you are sitting there waiting for the elevators to get to your room...well, that's a different story.  The elevators takes some time before it actually gets to you, hallways are super small and cramped, and the rooms as cute and quaint as they are, they are really tiny.  It's not a usual hotel that I've ever stayed at before, but at least I know now, next time I do come to Chicago, this is what to expect.  Rooms were always kept clean by the housekeepers, which is a definite plus.  Prices are ehh, could be a little bit cheaper, I think for such a small space.  The bed was definitely comfortable though, which is always a plus for me.  I'm big for lounging on the bed so I love having a nice comfy bed with soft pillows and this place had that. Keep in mind that this is an older hotel that has kept their history, so I think renovating or remodeling may be out of the question for them.   The gym is on the very top floor of this hotel, and you have to climb up some stairs in this old creepy stairwell, with steep steps to get to it.  It kinda scared me to tell you the truth, but once you get there, it had pretty much all the gym equipment that you needed, which was nice.  If you are looking for a view while working out though, don't expect it.  There are housekeepers that come and clean the gym as you are there too, so you don't have to worry about the gym being all nasty and dirty.  I know some people don't like to wipe machines down after using them, I guess you don't have to worry about that so much here because the staff keeps it pretty sanitized.   I'd come back and stay again for the convenience.",N
3385,"I hated this hotel. The husband wanted to stay at Public but I was turned off by the NYC price so we made a reservation at Allerton.  I am glad I read the reviews beforehand on Yelp (to prepare me) because most of them are true. We had a room on the 13th floor.  Housekeeping started doing their thing very early in the morning (this is both a good/bad thing). You can hear them outside of the door and they knocked on our door to clean (we learned our lesson to not forget the 'do not disturb' sign). FYI-I am also overly connected (Computer/Ipad/Iphone).  They charge for each thing not per room. Cons: Hotel is Huge/Crowded (might have been the weekend we were there) Elevators are slow Wifi-not free (charge per item not room) Right smack in the middle of Michigan Avenue (super crowded with tourists) Grandparents with their grandkids heading to the American Doll Place (creepy)-sorry I don't have kids don't understand it yet $50 parking (they are not affilated with the hotel) Bathroom needs updating, it feels like your grandparents bathroom Our room smelled like cigarettes Pros: close to Tiffany, Zara, Topshop, American Girl Place Can walk to the MCA and Art Institute (approx 1/2-1 mile)",N
3386,"We hosted our wedding (ceremony and reception) at the Allerton Hotel in August, 2012. We were beyond satisfied with the level of service and hospitality offered. At all stages of the wedding (tour, food tasting, planning, and wedding day), the hotel treated us as though we were the top priority. The event space (Tip Top Tap Room) is absolutely gorgeous with amazing views of the lake and Michigan Avenue. We received complements from everyone at how classy the event space was. The food was excellent: We opted for late night stations which were a big hit. Much of the success is undoubtedly attributable to the extreme hard work, professionalism, and responsiveness of the hotel designated even planners (Beau Buttacavoli and Katie Hultin). They are clearly experts at what they do and understand the importance of quality and customer service in the hospitality industry",N
3387,"I picked this place for me and the boy for our 13th anniversary.  This was one of the closest hotels to Navy Pier which made me go for it. The hotel was very nice and clean. I loved the way the halls are decorated. They had this modern, but classic look to it. The rooms are cool as well. The room kind of reminded me of something I saw on that tv show trading spaces. There are a couple of drawbacks to this hotel- The Internet- its like a massive deadzone when you enter this place. I have 5 bars, but yet my Internet isn't moving. I feel as if they are blocking Internet signals here to make you purchase their Internet ( Which is awful.  I'm used to Comcast Internet hunty. The Allerton charges 10 bucks a day for dial up speed Internet. # GurlBye  There is also a mini bar, but you'd be crazier than hell to use it. You should just reach into your wallet,  pull out money and light it on fire. That's how much of a waste of money it is. A bottle of water is 4 dollars, oh and the mini bar has an electronic sensor so if you move something just to look at it you will be charged. Tip- one block over you can park for 30 dollars less than this hotel charges to park! (50 bucks)",N
3388,"We went to the Allerton Bar to use a coupon for drinks and appetizers. The drinks and appetizers were fine, but the experience was so negative that if the hotel was trying to use the promotion to stimulate business and bring awareness to the hotel, it was a total disaster. We waited 20 minutes and I then walked to the bar to ask for service. I was told to take a seat and someone would be there shortly. It became clear that the server was so surly because he was one of only 2 people working the entire bar area, and he had to actually go behind the bar and make the drinks after taking the orders. Luckily, he had a busman who retrieved the food orders and brought them to the table so the bartender/server didn't have to do that. It was embarrasssing looking around the room at other patrons waiting for service, and some who left after a period of time and simply abandoned their coupon, rather than waiting the time it took to be served. Unfortunately, the management of the hotel was so inept as to allow this situation to occur. With a promotion in effect, one would think they would have staffed the room adequately to take are of the traffic brought in by the coupon. They set the hotel back for some time with this sorry show of ineptitude, and if they don't emerge from their current bankruptcy situation, I won't be surprised, but I will be disappointed, because it is a nice space and could do well if properly managed.",N
3389,"Rooms were bit on the small side but had everything we needed and was centrally located on Michigan Ave. We were literally steps away from shopping, dining, tourist spots, and transit. Front desk staff was extremely friendly and upgraded my room to a corner room at no extra cost. Our room was clean and comfy, everything to hope for. I'm sure if we were larger people or had 3 or more staying in the room it would have felt cramped (especially w/ the bathroom) but we're not so it was perfect. Bed's were comfortable and the room had several windows to enjoy the city views; also included in the rooms: 42in LCD TV, iPod dock alarm clock, & safe The property had a surprisingly spacious gym on the top floor (take elevator all the way up and then use the staircase to the next highest floor... looks a bit sketchy) with great views of the Water Tower. The gym had several TV's and cardio machines for guest use, also towels & water. Probably the only thing that's a downer are the tiny & slow elevators, figures since it's an old classic hotel that's been heavily updated & remodeled. Tips: walk over to the Avenue hotel next door to hail a taxi during busy times... a lot quicker. Buy your own water for the room at Walgreen's on the next block since the tiny Vos water's in the in-room fridge cost $5. There's no free Internet or unlocked wireless networks but there is 4G reception if you have miFi device features on your smartphone. The 2nd floor M-Lounge is open until Midnight every night.",N
3390,"Stayed there for 5 months (I think it was) two times for like $150 a month.  It was fantastic.  Great service, too.  Course this was 1968. And to think to this day I've never been to the Tip Top Tap there...very sad.",N
3391,"Just got back from our Honeymoon and both my hubby and I agreed to write an update on our wedding reception/weekend experience at the Allerton! The food = AMAZING..from our mother/daughter lunch at the M Lounge to our hordeuves, 1st, 2nd, 3rd courses, wedding CAKE (MMM!) and our brunch on Sunday in the Buckingham room...all of our family and friends cleaned their plates and had nothing but rave reviews about the food....delicious!!!!!  Even this bride got a chance to enjoy each course thanks to a fabulous happy hour where I spent time mingling with our 140 guests while munching on baby lamb chops.. We are big foodies... :) Service = best I've ever seen at a wedding reception!  The staff was on top of everything and the courses were served and removed with out anyone having to wait...food was hot and delicious and each table was eating at the same time as our head table was eating.  No one was at need for a drink either ;) Great servers & bartenders! Hotel = gorgeous...what can I say?  We had the most beautiful reception room (Tip Top Tap) and everything was how we had dreamed but MORE spectacular!!  It surpassed our expectations and I am forever grateful to Beau B. for helping our vision come to reality.  Oh and our wedding suite that night was amazing....we walked in to classical music playing, dimmed lights, rose petals leading to our bedroom, chocolate covered strawberries, delish & chilled champagne and even some slices of our wedding cake :) SO special!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The only downfall? One elevator was out of service...but it gave us an excuse to use the stairs between floors 17-21 and gave us a little exercise from all of that food. :) THANKS ALLERTON!  We love you guys and can't wait for our 1-year anniversary to see you again for breakfast in bed and a freshly made wedding cake! MMM..told you that we love our food ;)",N
3392,"I think this would be a three star review had I paid a little less money for my hotel room... but even through Hotwire, this sucker was pretty expensive. It's downtown Chicago, though, so I've come to expect it by now and usually don't mind. It's in a really great location if you want to be on Michigan Avenue... great people watching, good place to walk around, and shopping madness everywhere you look. There's also a restaurant and lounge with a nice bar that I wish I could've checked out! The staff was pretty friendly when I checked in and I headed to my room on the 11th floor. Let's just say I was shocked when I walked in... it was so small! Smaller than my bedroom in my apartment. Like... if I put the ironing board out, I couldn't really get anywhere. The bed was nice and the TV on the wall was big, and the bathroom was modern and impressive as well. This is pretty random but while I was in the shower (with glass doors), I could see through the window all down Michigan. Kinda cool! I noticed a spider web on the wall which was easy to spot in the clean, shiny bathroom, but I forgot about it... until later that night when I saw a spider crawling on it. SO gross... try getting a good night's sleep after that if you're someone who's as afraid of spiders as I am! Couple other things I wasn't a fan of: -No room service menu in my room even though there was supposed to be... had to look online. -Internet is $9.95 a day which didn't shock me (I've seen much worse in hotels) but it made me log in and accept the charge every time I opened my computer. -My breakfast (eggs, sausage, toast, fruit, coffee) was $52. I almost fainted when I saw that on my bill. -To valet your car overnight it's $50. FIFTY DOLLARS. Seriously? No matter how great the city is, I'm always going to think that's ridiculous. My car was with valet for eight hours overnight, and again, it was $50. -No cell phone reception in my room... text messages wouldn't even go through. -If anyone from the hotel is reading this, there's a drop of blood on the bathroom curtains in room 1108. I understand these hotels are designed for people with a lot of cash, but does that really make it right to charge so much for everything? I probably won't stay here again even though there were a few positives... I just feel like there are a lot better options at a similar price! And unless those eggs came from a famous chicken, there's just no excuse.",N
3393,"i love the location of the Hotel this is why I'm coming back again, I'm not familiar with Chicago enough to try another location. I've stayed here once last year for the long weekend, and planning on coming back again for the Victoria day long weekend May 19-21. the standard rooms are tiny, but its really well decorated, I felt it wasn't worth the extra $30 bucks per night upgrade if I had to pay $50 per night for parking already! They are charging a ridiculous $50 per night for parking, I called in and ask if we could get the parking for cheaper, the staffed just said I would have to use public parking and walk over, no help, didn't say how far it was either.",N
3394,"So bf got this hotel on a deal, so price was not an issue, as with nothing is...really. This hotel is located on the mile, which put us in the middle of the action, shopping, and walking distance to just about everything we needed. Heck, with all the hundreds of Starbucks they had, I was within walking distance to two Panera Breads, which was awesome! LOL. We stayed here just this past weekend for my birthday. We stayed from Thursday - Sunday. The hotel is cutesy/boutiquish to me, which isn't bad. It is a very old building with lots of character and charm. The only thing(s) I wouldn't say I did not like, but did not appeal to me, were the room sizes, cost for overnight parking ($50 per overnight stay), paying for the internet, and the cramp elevators and hallways. Now keep in mind that our room was on the 13th floor, so at any time I was waiting on the big-wheel and child to ride down saying ""redrum"", Ha, ha ha.  But those are just things that were not appealing to me. The hotel was clean, housekeeping cleaned and made the bed daily, and the staff was so nice and courteous.  I do prefer rooms with microwaves and fridges, which this room did not have.   If you are looking to get the most bang for your buck, I think you should keep looking because for most of the amenities, you have to pay for them here. BF had his Sprint wireless jack, so he did not have to purchase the internet package. It reminded me so much of a cruise, being that everything costs!!! Yes it's downtown Chi-town, but it isn't Vegas, LOL. So I guess that is why the high costs. Would I be back? Naw..I'm sure I can find something else with a bit more. Nevertheless, this was an awesome location and we even walked to the Navy Pier  and Lakefront Dr from here.",N
3395,"The Allerton's only advantage; LOCATION. It is central to everything and smack dab in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave. Until my recent experience, I had never encountered problems with this hotel. The woman, who checked us in one evening, was very rude and did not offer any room upgrade alternatives (i.e., upgrading to a king suite) to accomodate 3 adults when I discussed my initial needs. Instead, she was standoffish, short, and unhelpful, providing us with keys to room that did not fit our needs with helping to identify a fitting solution. Upon walking into the room, we realized how small it was and called down to the front desk to ask for other options from another woman, which the woman in the beginning should have suggested to us before hauling all of our luggage upstairs and having to come back down.  I was glad we got to upgrade for an additional $35/night, which is no problem. My other complaints was that Valet service was not available when I arrived and we had to double-park and go inside to get somebody to assist us. The elevators are also very small. I have been charged an additional fees on my debit card; I have called the front desk and been fowarded to the accounting center several times where I have left only 2 voicemails requesting that someone call me back. I am dissapointed and frustrated with the level of service provided by this hotel, beginning from check-in to even after the hotel stay- which I am still dealing with a week after my check-out date. No one has contacted me from the hotel yet. For the level of dissatisfaction I have experienced, I do not plan to use this hotel in the future and nor will I recommend it to anyone else.",N
3396,"Stayed here on a groupon deal. I think this hotel is such a cute little boutique hotel. They refurbished the hotel with a modern look. The rooms were spacious with a sitting area. Again, stayed here to celebrate a special occasion so I didn't get to spend much time in the hotel. Staff was very nice, rooms are clean, lobby nice.",N
3397,"The Allerton is a well refurished hotel on the Magnificent Mile.  I have to say it's a good deal for the price.  Everything still looks new and comfortable. Yet affordable. It's not as spacious as it is advertised.  I really like the decor, Modern but warm. The elevator are a little strange.  It's like they have a mind of there own. lol",N
3398,"Nice hotel.. Very clean rooms.  Very nice lounge area.  Meeting rooms were very nice as well.  When you walk in the lobby, you have to go to the 2nd floor to check in.. Also elevators are kinda small, but what do you expect from an older hotel.",N
3399,"Decent place to stay. A bit old-fashioned, but the rooms were clean and well-kept. The location is great, on the Near North Side.",N
3400,"I'd probably give this place a 2.5.  It initially has so much potential, but there were so many negatives I wouldn't recommend it. There was ZERO cell reception in my hotel room.  Because of this, I couldn't effectively take work calls and had to use the hotel phone [which didn't work when I first arrived and engineering had to come in to fix.]  My laptop operates via an aircard so wireless internet is always available, but because there was no cell reception - I had to purchase the hotel internet service for $9.95/day.  AND, the actual hotel wireless was relatively slow! I spoke with a manager who said they'd waive the internet fee, but sure enough, when I received my bill under the door I'd been charged for internet.  So had to wait in line at the front desk to get adjusted before leaving. I ordered room service the first night - an Asian chicken salad - and the chicken was so dry I had to push aside and just eat the lettuce.  For $26, it was pretty gross and disappointing.   Finally, the maid service barely cleaned the room; the bed was made but that was about it.  In fact, I'd left my curling iron on by accident and they didn't even turn it off, let alone unplug it, so when I got home that night it had burned through a bottle of lotion.  I was surprised such little attention was paid to detail here.  Despite the convenient location, I would not recommend this hotel nor would I choose to stay here again.",N
3401,"This hotel could be so much better if it was less American. First of all, pls. Give the customers the option of not changing the towels every day. It is less wasteful and more environemntally friendly therefore less American:-). It is done everywhere in Europe. I told the reception of that. For one day, it was OK. Next days again they were changing every towel I touched. The breakfast is extremely expensive for what it is. They definitly need more variety. WiFI is free in the lobby area but $9 per day if you use it from your room. Extortionate to say the least. Even if you use a phone card to make an international call, as soon as you are connected, there is an outrageous $1.50 on your bill. Lastly, if you stay long and need laundry done, it is $8 per shirt! On the brighter side, the staff is good and professional. When I told them about the breakfast at check out, they offered me a free breakfast which is nice but it also made me think about the variety. I also complained about the breakfast in twitter which means they follow social media, also positive. The location of the hotel is excellent and the jazz they play at all times at reception is heart warming. What is really funny about this hotel is that British Airways crew stays here. So every day you either see them arriving or departing from/to O'Hare which makes it appear like a deja-vu each time you come to reception especially if you stay like I did for a week. All in all, I am not sure I am returning to this hotel.",N
3402,"The Allerton is a lovely refurbished hotel situated on Michigan Ave in the middle of the Magnificent Mile shopping district. It is an independent hotel, so no loyalty programs for you to rack up points or miles! The rooms are quite spacious and comfortable. My wife and I shared a suite with a king size bed. The bedroom had a 36"" flat screen LCD TV and the living room had a 50"" one! There are 5 elevators, so you never wait too long. The room WiFi signal was strong and the bandwidth throughput (download AND upload) was much better than most hotels at which I stay. The restaurant is pretty nice. I enjoyed breakfast with a made-to-order omelet. No complaints there. What impressed me the most was the rate: $99/night. Seriously!! We'll be back, no question!",N
3404,"We were staying in Chicago for a friend's wedding and wanted a hotel in the heart of things and the Allerton definitely fit the bill -- the location was perfect for us and enabled us to do a lot of exploring on foot. Rooms aren't large but were clean and pretty. We didn't have a view to speak of BUT they did give us a free upgrade to a king without being asked, which was very nice. While I was waiting to meet up with a friend I had a drink at the bar which was very pleasant. The main lobby is on the 2nd floor so it is a little off-putting when you arrive at the ground floor and aren't quite sure where to go but the staff was pretty helpful. Also appreciated the coffee in the lobby. It was a little pricier than our usual hotel budget but for a splurge it was definitely worth it. Bell hop was very helpful.",N
3405,"The location was fantastic.  The room was great - spacious, comfortable, attractive decor.  The free Wi-Fi was nice, as the 3G signal in the area was at a crawl.  We used a Groupon and I was asked to login at the front desk rather than being allowed to use my iPhone app so we could print the voucher, which I wasn't terribly comfortable doing. So why am I giving The Allerton only two stars?  Two words: hot water.  As in, there was none at all the morning we checked out.  Not even at 11 a.m.  (Luckily, all we had on the agenda after checking out was schlepping to the airport.)  When I mentioned this at check-out, I was first mistaken for someone else that had called down to complain about the hot water situation, then unapologetically informed that 300 other people had checked out this morning.   Really?  You're a hotel.  The two very basic things you provide are a bed and a shower.",N
3406,"The staff has been very kind and helpful, the location is right in the middle of the Magnificent Mile. Some of the rooms are rather small and having stayed here 30+ times now I think I can confidently say that every room is a different shape. There are rooms I don't like and rooms I like very much and a few that are best described as ""unusual"" (which are on my list of rooms to avoid). While some of the rooms near the elevators are small, some in the corners are very large, these are my favorites. I've traveled here enough that I know some of the waitstaff in the restaurant, they are always kind and say good morning even when they are not assigned to serve my table. The breakfast buffet is good, but doesn't run every day. I'd like the wait staff to be a little faster with the check, but I've learned to judge the time. In year's past I've spend 100s of nights with Marriott so I do miss having loyalty points that I can spend when I bring the family with me. If you want a place to stay that's in a terrific location to shop and eat on  the Magnificent Mile you should definitely check them out.",N
3407,"We used a Living Social voucher for our one night stay. We had a couple issues getting here, it was hard to find while driving since the sign for the hotel is at the top of the building and not by the awning outside. We also weren't sure which parking garage to park in for our parking to be validated. We could have had our car valet  but the valet spot in front was small and taken up by taxi's. We just drove around and pulled our car into the garage ourselves. The lobby is small but nice looking.  The diner was closed each time we came by the front desk. There is a bar right there and it was warm and inviting.  All the staff we encountered were friendly. The standard room is just that, standard. The room was tiny, no coffee pot and certainly not as clean as I would have expected it to be. At first glance, the room looks clean but the bathroom looked like the only thing that had been done was fresh towels added. The counter that runs along the top of the sink was dirty, not dusty but dirty. There were pieces of ""something"" just laying there, not even wiped off. The same with the floor, didn't look like it had been swept. We spent most of our time in the city walking around and seeing the lights. Therefore, the lack of cleanliness wasn't a prime factor in our visit. We were here long enough to get dressed for dinner, sleep and dress for the next day. We took advantage of the late checkout to keep our bags in the room instead of walking around Chicago with them. The Living Social voucher also came with 2 free drinks. We had to ask for the coupons because they were not given to us at the time of check-out.  We asked the bartender for the two free drinks and it turned out that it was a fruity drink with Malibu rum. Not bad, but not what I was expecting. Overall, for the price and location on Magnificent Mile, I would stay here again. I would probably ask for  a bigger room this time and would like my bathroom to be clean.",N
3410,"DO NOT PAY THIS PRICE FOR THIS HOTEL!!!!!!! We stayed at the River hotel from 1/2 the price we paid at Allerton!! Do NOT waste you time here! This hotel is easily comparable to a 2 star hotel NOT a 4 star one! Parking is $50 a night! No fridge. The best service was the bell hop and valet. Again, NOT worth $300 -$500 give your money to Trump if you want what you pay for! Room was small, ice machine was broken, stains all over carpets, closet too small and couldn't hang long clothes inside. Internet is $10 per 512kb. Check out all other hotels first.",N
3412,"Standard room is very small and basic and comes with some bare-bones amenities. I did my homework beforehand so I wasn't expecting much more than a centrally-located place to crash. As other reviews have noted, don't touch the mini fridge unless you really want something in there, it runs on sensors and will charge you automatically if you fiddle around with it. Elevators are small and slow. Mixed bag of a crowd. Didn't bother with the restaurants or breakfast because of other reviews. But for the online bargain price and location, it's a perfectly serviceable hotel. I also avoided the valet because of what other reviews said and just threw my car in a nearby ramp and I could go and get it on my own time.",N
3413,"I stayed at this hotel last weekend and it was a mixed experience.  Perhaps I should have done more research before choosing to book here but my family had had a good experience a few years back so I trusted their opinion. The valet parking was more than we would have liked to spend.  Thankfully, I knew of a parking structure a few blocks away that was less expensive. The elevators were so tiny and besides the lobby, the whole place looked old school to the point of run down. I like a good old school hotel but this was to the point of it looking like it wasn't well kept. The bedroom was fine but had a lot of window dressing in my opinion.  The bed was comfy but the carpeting had some issues.  The shower had rust spots and made me question the cleanliness of the bathroom. Overall, it was a decent experience but I think we would either upgrade our room or look for other options.   I can't give it a great rating but won't give it a horrible rating either. PRO'S: Proximity to Michigan Ave Lobby Area CON'S: Check in on the 2nd floor (fairly confusing) Cleanliness of the bathroom Price of Parking",N
3420,"Upon arrival at the Allerton the check-in person at the desk completely ignored I was there, standing in line to check-in and skipped me and took care of a guest that was standing behind me.This was very rude and very upsetting to me. Although, I was using a groupon, I am a paying customer. The room was the size of my living room, super tiny. My  other complain would be the quality of the room; in the middle of the night as I was adjusting in bed and pulling the sheets to cover myself, I discovered the bed had a huge hole on the side of the mattress!!! For a so-called four star hotel to have old, worn out, torn mattresses is unacceptable! Needless to say, I will not be staying here in the future.",N
3421,"Nothing beats the location to Michigan Avenue!  The hotel was kept up very nicely for being an older hotel. Our hotel room was right in front of the elevator, and we could hear people if they were talking in the hallway but we were fortunate it was very quiet.  The rooms are very small, and with a double bed it was cozy.",N
3424,"My suite was nice and clean, I received free WI-fi, I get the historic nature of the property and liked it, great margarita in the lounge. No coffee maker or microwave in the room was a downer. Over all nice stay & staff. More personal than the Marriott types.",N
3425,"I had a great time here. The rooms were small, but I live in the Northeast, and it's comparable to a New York or D.C. hotel room. I wish they had free wifi. I don't understand places that do NOT have free wifi in today's day and age. But I was able to pick up a rogue signal, or go down to the lounge with my laptop. The staff was very nice. The hotel had so much character. I would definitely stay here again.",N
3429,i've been in better four star hotels than this with the money i paid for. I wished wifi was free. a little cramped.  fantastic location.,N
3432,"Hello- I sent the following complaint to your hotel on February 12th and still haven't heard back. I am getting very frustrated and would like a response. Yesterday (2/11/12) I used my Groupon for the Allerton Hotel in Chicago. From what I understood, there were a lot of Groupons redeemed this weekend. However, that should not affect my stay. At first I was not going to say anything, but I decided to write because I really do not feel like the value of my stay was worth what I paid for it. When I first arrived, I had to wait more than 25 minutes to check in, in your lobby space that is not equipped for long lines. After I checked in, I had to wait 20 minutes for an elevator because this hotel is NOT equipped for large groups. By the time I finally got to my room, I had already been in the hotel almost an hour. Everytime I had to take the elevator (I was on the 24th floor..stairs were not an option), we had to send someone into the hall first to press the button because it took at least 10 minutes. I understand these are complaints you probably hear often and I know the Allerton is an older hotel. However, because of this, it seems to me like it would be a bad idea to allow all of these Groupons to be scheduled on the same weekend. Other hotels I have used with Groupon have made sure to limit the number redeemed each weekend and that seemed to work well. Our room had not been properly cleaned after the last guests. We wanted to purchase from the mini-bar, but when I opened it there was almost nothing in it. The mini-bar was full of empty wrappers and candy canisters left over from the last guests. I called the Front Desk and was assured I would not be charged for this, but that did not make me feel better. To me, that shows they did not take the proper care in cleaning and makes me wonder what else they didn't clean. From that point on, I felt uncomfortable in the room. Also, whoever was there before us set an alarm for 4am and the housekeeper must not have re-set it or checked because the alarm woke us up at that time this morning. After that, housekeeping came to the room at 9:00am to clean. This made no sense to me, because we only stayed for one night and check out was at 12:00pm. Why would they come that early? This morning, I called ahead for my car at 11:15am. I understood it could take up to 30 minutes. The car didn't arrive until after 12:00pm. Other people in line said they were waiting for over an hour for their car. During this time I waited outside. At no point did the doorman or any of the valet ask me which car was mine or if I had been helped. I am someone who uses Groupon all the time and this was my first bad experience. It will definitely make me think twice before purchasing a Groupon again and I will not be returning to the Allerton.  After telling my parents of this experience, they called and cancelled their reservation as well and will be contacting Groupon for a refund.",N
3441,"My partner and I recently took a road trip to visit family in Ohio and decided that we wanted to spend a few days in Chicago before heading home.  The Allerton caught my eye not only because of its reasonable prices, but also the historic nature of the building.  I found the Allerton to be charming and cozy in a way that ultra-modern, sterile feeling hotels just can't be.   We arrived on a Sunday afternoon with our luggage and a helpful gentleman right inside the street-level entrance offered to have our bags taken up to our room before directing us to the second floor to check-in.  (We did reserve a spot in a parking garage a couple blocks away simply because it would've costed twice as much to park at the hotel.  Some may say that's cheap; I say its common sense).  We had reserved a Specialty Suite through Allerton's website and actually received a nice advanced-purchase rate.  Upon check-in, we were told that we would be upgraded to a Magnificent Mile Suite at no charge -  score!  The bell-man delivered our bags quickly after we arrived to our room and was very helpful in getting us situated and answered our questions about the hotel and the immediate area.  I was very pleased with the service we had so far received.  If I could remember names, I would definitely give a shout-out.  Either way, the staff between 5/27/12 and 5/30/12 were very helpful.   The room on the 24th floor was very nice and spacious.  The decor was modern but cozy, which continued the theme from the rest of the hotel.  Our view from the living area was nothing to write home about about,  however, from the bedroom we could see all the way down the street and Lake Michigan in the background.  Very nice!  I must say that cell phone service was nearly non-existent in the room, but honestly, this was not a huge deal.  We of course did not spend all of our time in the hotel, and not being glued to my phone was kind of nice and allowed for some quality time with my partner. And to the folks who complain about the internet fees, room service prices, etc.:  There are no surprises.  All you need to do is a little reading either before you book or when you arrive to your room.  Everything is clearly stated in the hotel information book in your room.  If something is unclear, ask!  We are very laid-back guys and I have had a difficult time understanding the things some people choose to complain about.  The only conclusion I can arrive to is that some people are simply just picky, high-maintenance whiners.  If you expected the Ritz-Carlton, then you should pay many times what the Allerton charges for its lovely accomodations in an excellent location and spare everyone your grief in the process.  We had a wonderful time in Chicago and would stay at the Allerton again, no questions asked.",N
3447,"Stayed here on Dec 17th, to be close to MagMile shopping experience.  Great location, easy walk to shopping, dining, entertainment venues.  Hotel was great, very clean, all personnel was very nice.  Yea, the elevator is slow...and small, yea, some of the rooms are smal tool, but it's a very cute, clean, budget friendly boutique hotel.  I'll go back there again, maybe we even started a tradition of Chicago Christmas shopping?",N
3449,Enjoying the petite room.  Perfect for a one night stay & single user.  Very helpful & accommodating staff.  Will be back!,N
3483,"This hotel was disappointing. When we arrived in our room, we were bummed to find out that there was no coffee maker in the room. We ended up getting room service for coffee in the morning for that reason. Upon checking out, the concierge informed us that there was coffee on the second floor! If we had known that, we wouldn't have gotten room service, which totaled about $75 for our 5-day stay.  Nothing in our room indicated that there was free coffee in the hotel, which I felt should have been very clear.  One evening, we also asked the hotel if there was a microwave we could use to warm up some leftover food from the night before to save money, and they acted like that was an absurd request. There are plenty of other hotels in the area, and if I returned to the area, I would stay elsewhere.",N
3485,"I loved this hotel...when my niece and I walked in we didn't feel worthy enough to be here. We thought we would get kicked out and be told the Super 8 was down the street. It was super classy, chic, and sophisticated. From the door man, to the concierge, to the bellhop, to the desk clerk, everyone was super professional. The room was fantastic, the bedding awesome, the flat screen with cable, even better. I ended up getting a Groupon for some reason and received 4 glasses of complimentary wine at the hotel bar. That place was great. They serve you a little bowl of snack nut mixture while your laying on the couch watching all the guests walk by. Now the downers, renting movies at night $15 per movie (and not the dirty ones), wi-fi, you had to pay a fee per day. I think it was like $8, the room service cappuccinos, 2 for $16, uh hem...and the fee to park your car $50 per day, holy sh*t I say! But other than that I loved it. It was right on Michigan Ave and an easy walk to everything..yes I would come back :)",N
3515,"Checked into this hotel after staying at Hotel Indigo for a few days.. I enjoyed my stay! Started off a little rough, I checked in at noon and of course no rooms were available and they just told me to ""check back later"". I left my bags, had lunch, and toured the city. Came back at 5 pm only to be told that a room was still not ready... After looking at the lady w/ a crazy ""You can't be serious"" face... she says ""But... we can upgrade you"". That turned my frown upside down :)   I was upgraded to a one bedroom suite w/ King bed. I walked in and thought ""All this for me? ""  LOVED the room. Bed was comfy, plenty of space. I was on the 25th floor so I didnt hear the ambulance sirens that i read about in other reviews. The furniture/decor isn't great but everything was clean. Granite in the bathroom. Aveda products. The location was absolutely perfect! Right in the heart of the mile. I was able to walk everywhere. I was also able to walk a block over to Michigan/Erie (or) Huron/Fairbanks and catch buses to South Michigan Ave, Navy Pier, and beyond.. As a female walking alone, i felt completely safe walking the area at night/early morning. I also enjoyed visiting the Starbucks down the street. Its located inside the hospital and its 24 hours! Several food choices on Erie/Ontario/Superior. Grocery store on Fairbanks. Garrett's popcorn on Ontario... all of these places are walking distance. The service was also spectacular! Everyone I encountered went above and beyond to assist me. Sunday morning, I went up to the rooftop pool to watch the sunrise over Lake Michigan...it was awesome! My only suggestion...I know its on the 50th floor but... those windows could use some scrubbing.. I didnt use w-fi, gym, or the pool.. I was too busy sightseeing. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",N
3516,"Great hotel in a great location. Walking distance to so many things like Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier , Hancock Observatory, and some great restaurants. Rooms were clean and spacious with nice views (we got upgraded - ask for one too!). Staff was helpful, especially the concierge who booked excursions for us and had some great recommendations for food and drink. Sadly, they charge for Wi-Fi access. Price was really good for a long weekend compared with a lot of other hotels in the area.",N
3517,"Clean, friendly staff, GREAT LOCATION. Didn't eat there as Corner Bakery has a location a short block away   We got this thru Hotwire, yet they still upgraded us to a larger room. Negative - wifi is $10 per day",N
3518,"Pros: Great location Comfy beds Clean Helpful bellhops Cons: Amanda at the front desk wanted to put a $50 a day hold on my DEBIT card for incidentals for my 5 night stay in my prepaid room. I know she was just trying to do her job, but when I questioned the large amount she said there was nothing she could do. One of her co-workers overheard our discussion, came over and said to just put a $50 hold for the entire stay. Amanda's eyes lit up and said, ""what if something happens""? Um, hello, I'm standing right in front of you! Her very nice co-worker said it was fine, helped her set it up and walked away. At that point Amanda was PISSED!!! I asked for two keys, she just glared at me and angrily grabbed another key. I went up to my room and that was it. I did t see Miss By The Book Amanda until I was checking out. I understand there are rules, but c'mon a $250 hold on my debit card, which will take 7-10 days to fall off- I don't think so. Other than that issue, our stay at the Avenue was fine. The water pressure was pretty good and when the shower wouldn't drain, they fixed it immediately. Despite Amanda, I'd stay there again.",N
3519,"I really liked the bed and pillows. I slept like a baby last night which is unusual because I generally cannot sleep much on the first night in a strange bed.  I wonder if all of Crowne Plaza's properties get their bedding from the same vendor. If so, I'm going to make it a point to book their properties henceforth.   Kudos to the housekeeping staff as well. My only complaint is that the hotel gym was really sub-par.",N
3521,Very impressed by this hotel.  We were given a complimentary upgrade when we arrived!  The beds here were the most comfortable I've slept on.  I didnt want to get up in the morning!  Customer service was excellent.  The location was great with the exception being that there is a hospital nearby and we heard ambulances off and on all night one night.,N
3553,"We were here for a wedding in the Gold Coast Room... o-m-g!!! Exquisite, grand, beautiful and royal are the first words I thought of as I walked in. The room is smaller than most banquet halls, I think it could hold upto 200 people. The wedding we attended transformed the room from a ceremony setup to a sit down dinner with DJ booth, center dance floor and dinner tables on each side of the room. Food was average to low - but not sure whether this was catered in house or through a catering service.",N
3554,"I stayed here a few months ago and I thought it was a pretty good hotel. I know the Drake has a lot of history to it and many celebrities have stayed here over the years but that does not make a superb hotel IMO. The room I had was a King room facing Oak St Beach. The room was very clean. The bathroom was great with a wonderful shower head. The bed was really comfy. No complaints about the room. It was nicely decorated, clean, and had comfortable beds. Some things that did not endear the Drake to me: 1) No free wifi in the rooms for the regular Joes of the world. You have to be a Hilton Honors Gold or Platinum member to get free wifi in the room. Otherwise you will incur a cost of $12.95 per day or $7.50 for 1 hr to access their wifi. 2) Valet parking was an astounding $55 for overnight parking! 3) It cost me $249/ngt for a standard King room during a slow time of the month. 4) I thought the lobby was not all that others claim it to be. It was nothing spectacular. Many other hotels have a more appealing lobby. The staff are very eager to please and are all friendly and hospitable. Also, I did enjoy the gym. The gym is huge with 3 rooms filled with lots of free weights and machines. I love the location of the hotel. It is steps away from Michigan Ave. And it is right across the street from Oak St Beach! I would stay here again for the location alone.",N
3555,"Ah, the minute I witnessed the the entryway to the Palm Court of the Drake Hotel. The words spoken by Mr. Bryan Adams started singing in my head: I'm findin it hard to believe that we're in heaven!!! It was absolutely a magnificent Experience! Of course, the cost was staggering but this is something you should expect from a place like the Drake (which empowers them btw so that they may do no good, but that's why we have reviewers, right? :)) I had the palm court black tea...great choice. Then the little sandwiches and scones came out.. The best thing was that these sandwiches that would normally get me sick of eating for a while (roast beef being one example) were served in small finger size portions. Just delicious! Oh, and did I mention that a harpist was playing right behind me???? Whaaat?? :D One thing that they  could improve on is including an ingredient in the egg sandwich that could make the taste more strong and palatable. As it is, it did not live up to its companions. But I was in heaven for a few hours...it was a Mid Summer Day's Dream.",N
3556,"The Drake is a beautiful hotel.  But, I feel like for the type of hotel it is, the service should be better.   My husband and I stayed here in the middle of our honeymoon.  We were on an ""adventure"" honeymoon and had been camping through all the national parks in the West before coming to Chicago--and of course splurging on a nice hotel because it was our honeymoon!  Is it because I rolled up in my dirty honda civic that was extremely full and had bikes on the back that made them think that they didn't need to be helpful?  Someone did take my suitcases, but then afterwards didn't really help me out.  Since he seemed to disappear, I ended up just taking them myself because he just left them on the corner of the sidewalk.   The concierge and the front desk were very nice and helpful about what to do in the area, although we couldn't get any kind of upgrades (like so many I hear about) for being on our honeymoon.  I didn't necessarily expect that, but was hoping.  The view from our room was beautiful still--view of Lake Michigan.  The bed was super amazing and comfy.   When we were leaving and the valet brought my car around, I talked to the guy driving it and tipped him.  Got in the car and saw that a plant I had brought with me was completely tipped over.  There was soil all over the passenger side floor and the plant was uprooted.  I know, it's weird to bring a house plant on a trip with you.  But the fact is that it was there and it was totally a mess....  The driver could have at least told me when I was talking with him.... did he not notice the soil everywhere??  To be fair, there happened to be one guy that noticed I was upset about it.  He took my floor mat, shook it out, and helped me get everything back together.  He was SUPER nice.  I wish I knew his name, because he seemed to be the only one that cared.   I know my complaints seem picky, but the fact is we don't splurge on expensive hotels that often, so I was expecting a bit more.  No one really seemed to go out of their way. (on our wedding night we stayed at the Boston Harbor Hotel which DID go above and beyond)  The hotel was gorgeous and comfortable, but the service wasn't really what I was expecting.  Maybe when I'm older and better dressed?",N
3557,"High end quality hotel, great location - on the water, but at the top of the miracle mile.  Leave the car at home. Plenty of shopping and high-end places to eat. You can hike to the navy pier but I would cab it.",N
3558,The Drake is now our home away from home. Not only can one walk out the door and arrive at Oak Street beach or the hub of Michigan Ave. you can stay at the Drake and listen to the Cabaret sounds and shtick  of Nan Mason and Terry Higgins.  The Drake is the city...an intersection of old & new Chicago.  Our room which looks out onto to water is open and full of light and makes our stay full of possibility.,N
3559,"It's rare that I dole out five stars to any establishment, but The Drake Hotel earns every star. An iconic hotel in every way, from the architecture to the decor - you find yourself ensconced in old Chicago style. The Drake wears its age well, and everything is immaculate and updated without being modern or boutique-like, which would ruin the historic vibe. We stayed in a Deluxe King, with fantastic views of Lake Michigan and the Gold Coast. The room was large, with plenty of space for two to sit and relax. The bed was comfy and the duvet was up to par with more modern hotels. The location couldn't be better, just off Michigan Ave. The common areas in the hotel are spectacular, from the chandeliers, lounges, lobby, and even the hallways are warm and rich with history. We'd absolutely stay at The Drake again. NB: valet parking is a steep $55 a night.",N
3560,"Gorgeous hotel, nicely appointed rooms, missing in-room wifi.   For a historic hotel, this one doesn't really feel dated or old.  The rooms are nicely updated and of good size.  The bars and restaurants are excellent, though pricey.  The workout facility is large and updated, with a nice variety of equipment spread out over several rooms.   The staff were all friendly and helpful.  The only complaint I had was the lack of in-room wifi.  Otherwise, this is a very comfortable, well-located hotel.",N
3561,"Staycations. I never do them. But when it came to the Drake, I was all for it. Ever since I moved to Chicago, I'd been wanting to know what it was like. So, I decided to surprise my husband with a little down-time at the Drake. How fun! I thought I just booked a room but this was definitely a suite. There was a large sitting space, if I recall a fireplace, an incredible view of the lake and the drive. Also, I wish my bathroom looked as spacious as this one. When we walked into the suite, there was jazz playing. Peel Me a Grape. Need I say more. The little bar on the ground floor was cozy, though we only stayed long enough to get a bottle of wine to take back to the room. The elevator had old wood interior and must have been a refurbished original. So glad whoever was in charge of restoring this hotel did. What a great piece of architectural history and a great exception if staycations seem not high on your list.",N
3562,"Spent my one-year anniversary here with my boyfriend - beautiful view, upgraded executive suite room... it was more than I could've ever asked for!!  We were treated very well while we stayed there, it was QUIET, enjoyable and very welcoming.  Also, they had AMAZING food when we ordered room service.  It was so good!!  We would LOVE to go back again really soon!!",N
3563,Excellent mix of classic elegance and modern comfort.,N
3564,"Talk about the essence of Old Chicago. This hotel is absolutely GORGEOUS. The front desk agent was super helpful with suggesting places to eat and upgrading our room for a view of Lake Michigan. The concierge was even MORE helpful with bus routes, subway routes and best ways to get to certain sights to see. Sitting at one end of the Magnificent Mile and right on the banks of Lake Michigan, this old historic hotel offers so much if you want to experience a luxurious, elegant visit to Chicago. From the high ceilings in the lobby to the live music in the lobby lounge to the breakfast at the Drake Brothers restaurant to the track record of amazing celebs and royalty that have stayed beneath the roof, this hotel can in no way leave you anything but breathless. Definitely a must-stay hotel at some point ... in your life. :)",N
3565,"Beautiful hotel (a little old - but that is part of it's appeal) and an even better location with the beach and Lakefront Trail right there - of yes, N Michigan Avenue in all it's glory also.",N
3566,"We stayed here for four nights in January and had a wonderful stay. We made our reservation through the hotel's website for a regular King bed room and they upgraded us to a junior king suite when we checked in. The room was on the 7th floor and we had a wonderful view of Lake Michigan. The hotel itself is historical and it has retained its charm through the decor and rustic style furniture. At the same time, the bed, linen, bathroom feels clean and does not look dingy or old. The suite was huge. There is an entryway when you first come in which opens up into a sitting room with a couch (which I believe could be made into a queen bed), two arm chairs, desk, TV, and closet. This is connected to the bedroom with a King bed, another closet, and another TV! My only complaint was that the tub drained a bit slowly and they were not really able to resolve the issue even after I had asked them to clear it. We were celebrating a special occasion and the girl at the front desk was very nice to acknowledge this when we were checking in. The general manager also sent us a cake and a bottle of champagne the first night to help us celebrate! The hotel is located towards the end of Michigan Ave so it is a bit further from the Loop and restaurants but there are plenty of buses that stop just a block away from the hotel. The closest Metro is the Chicago Red Line which is about 4 blocks or a 10 minute walk away. On the other hand, the hotel is really close to Oak St beach, which seems like it would be a great place to enjoy the lake when the weather is warmer.",N
3568,"My fiance surprised me with a proposal and a room here! Loved it! The hotel is historical and gorgeous, as expected. The staff is impeccable. The room was old school, but had an amazing view, great amenities, and obviously was perfectly clean. Perfect location to walk on Mich Ave, or shop in the gold coast and feel like a million bucks. Had the breakfast buffet-was good but I'm a brunch fanatic and have had much better in Chicago. The bar downstairs has really cool historical drinks, but the crowd was really eclectic, so not so romantic for a date night. Also, I think they have 1 waitress working the entire thing. Overall, loved the hotel and the restaurant/bar were okay.",N
3569,"I was so excited to have booked a room here in anticipation of our visit to Chicago after the Flying Pig marathon in Cincinnati. But we started bad and it went downhill from there. The building was having some renovations so there was some scaffolding in the entrance which sort of took away from the experience of ""arriving at the Drake."" We were greeted with half smiles by the reception. Room on the first floor, city view. I had not done enough research to know to request a lake view, so I kept my mouth shut. We entered our room which was spacious, with a king bed and couch. Bathroom with tub, but on the smaller side. About 10pm, some construction or maintenance along Michigan Avenue started. It was a loud drone of machinery, the kind where you feel incredible relief upon its cessation. But it didn't cease. Not past midnight. Not past 1am. We finally called the front to see what could be done, the best they offered were these cheap earplugs. And the bed was too soft for my comfort, I woke up every couple hours to pain in my back. I know it wasn't the hotel's fault, but having paid $360 for ONE night, i really expected more than first floor, street noise, spongy earplugs, and back pain. It's a beautiful hotel, but I will never again stay here.",N
3570,"BEST authentic ""powder room"" in the city BEST brunch EVER - we had vouchers, so make that a free brunch-wow. The eggs were perfect and potatoes seasoned with dill were incredible.. BEST old school charm BEST gold coast location My boyfriend and I used priceline for a last minute weekend getaway, spent about 100 bucks for the cutest little room ever in the most charming boutique hotel ever. The whole time I felt like I was in a old new york city black and white movie. Great for romance for sure, maybe not very kid friendly. If I had one single downside it could have been no pool but I barely noticed. Guys will love the bar downstairs, it is so old school but also has great drink selection, appetizers and big screens for the game.",N
3571,"Hello fancy The Palm Court Afternoon Tea, you made me feel so adult and pampered.  Your chairs are plush, your harpists are sparkly, and your service is wonderful. Next time, we bring the fancy hats.",N
3573,Staff at the hotel were pleasant and friendly. Very nice room and great bed! Loved every night we stayed there!! Great location to Miracle Mile and surround restaurants.,N
3575,"A wonderful hotel, very classy, very charming, very much out of my price range, but along came Priceline and this is where we ended up on our first trip to Chicago. I always prefer the more mid range hotels because they have a few little things included like breakfast, wi-fi, etc. I know that if i stay at a higher end place these things are gonna cost, and it always makes me a bit grumpy. We ended up not eating a bit of food in the hotel because it was just so far out of our price range, and the free wifi in the lobby was in hot demand (not only by us). Our room wasn't all that tiny, I was expecting much worse, but it was a typical big city hotel room. I was very thankful for clean towels that didn't stink like bleach and for a decent room darkening shade so that I could actually sleep in a bit. We stayed 2 nights and even though our coffee cups were replaced the coffee and tea was not replenished. Not that big of a deal since we got coffee at breakfast outside of the hotel, but I do enjoy a cup when I am getting ready. Located at the very top of the Magnificent Mile, we were actually very thankful to be there because it forced us to do a lot of walking, which we definitely needed after eating tons of great food. This is the ideal hotel if you are visiting Chicago and going to the American Girl store, tons of girls with creepy dolls everywhere, and I imagine we'll be back very soon with my daughter. I would give 5 stars, but the lack of any breakfast option included and in room wi-fi being included is a star to me.",N
3576,We stayed here the weekend of the 28th. Our room was lovely. I checked in at 2:00 and reception was accommodating and got us 2 rooms that were close together and we were able to get in before the normal 3:00 check in.  This is truly a 5-star hotel that I am proud to have in my fair city!,N
3578,"The High Tea at the Drake is an amazing experience. We loved our time spent here. We enjoyed a three tiered lunch with a variety of amazing culinary delights. The egg salad has a mango chutney in it, it was so yummy! The pastries and desserts were also amazing. Each table received home made strawberry jam, lemon curd, and cream, and all three tasted amazing on the pastries. The scones and banana bread were made fresh in house, everything was made fresh, and all of it was delicious. I ordered the Bombay Chai to drink and it was literally the best cup of tea I have ever had. For thirty six dollars per person, this is a treat, however, it was worth every penny, the service was amazing, and I loved the experience. There was a harpist who performed during the entire tea service and the fountain and flowers were beautiful. On our way out we stopped at the Ladies Powder Room, each bathroom stall had its own sink and seat to freshen up one's makeup, what a luxury! Definitely will come back the next time I want to do something special!!!",N
3580,"Old style Chicago at its finest. Not a detail left unpolished or a pillow unfluffed. Small rooms with every need thought of. Its a  warm and cozy decorated hotel if you like smoking rooms in country clubs. There isnt smoking at the Drake but it has that ""I bet Al Capone stayed here"" vibe. Id say 4 star but no turn down service. Great location, not far from Rush street martini bars and shopping. Highly recommend. My ex even had the dragon from the drake tattoed on his bicep. Its that cool of a dragon carved into the outside front stone entrance to the hotel.",N
3581,"i spent two days with my girlfriend, last week end. The location is perfect and there's a great view of the lake. The hotel is gorgeous, the staff very helpful especially at the concierge. The amazing part is the bar downstairs, pretty cool. We spent a pleasant night on the dance floor with live entertainment. A must to do, if you go during the week end, it's so much fun and relax at the same time.",N
3584,"I really wanted this hotel to be better than it was, but we were a little disappointed. Being such a Chicago landmark, I thought it was going to be as neat as the Intercontinental. The Drake has really old, impressive finishes and the workout room is super impressive (weird comment, I know, but there were wood arched ceilings in there and it was HUGE). But we were really hoping there would be a hot tub (which there wasn't), the fridge in our room was smelly, and they don't let you open the window. Plus we had room service knock on our room twice while we were there, which made us feel like they were trying to hurry us out. Overall, if I were going to pick an old Chicago hotel to stay in, I think I'd still pick the Intercontinental.",N
3585,"This has got to be one of my favorite hotels in any city. Perfect location and great views of the lake, looking North, it is special in many ways. The front desk and all the staff are first rate, and the rooms are the right blend of ""old world"" charm, but with all the required modern touches. The food in all the hotel's restaurants is excellent. From the fancy ""Cape Cod Room"" to the ""Drake Brothers"" restaurant, and the ""Coq D'or"" bar (with a more casual menu), you really can't miss. The lobby is very impressive with an amazing central flower arrangement and be sure to spend some time in the ""Palm Court"" with its' own water feature and flower display. ""High Tea"" is served every day from 1 to 5PM. Tip: it is worth it to get an executive level room as you will then have access to their executive lounge on the 10th floor. Very good selection of breakfast food and evening appetizers with an amazing view of the lake and the bustling North Lakeshore Drive.",N
3586,"This review is only for the tea.. been here twice for afternoon tea, and it's fantastic. What's better than an afternoon sipping bottomless tea and eating scones and miniature sandwiches with the sound of a water fountain and harp music in the background? It does cost something like $38 per person, but you get what you pay for - the ambiance, European made China, service, and a perfect hangout place with good friends for a few hours.",N
3597,"Historic, well-maintained hotel in a good location.  Definitely has the quirky random-sized rooms you find in older hotels.",N
3610,"An incredible experience! I recently planned a business conference at the Drake, and could not have been more pleased with the service, staff, and facilities. In both planning and implementing the event, the staff was attentive to our needs, personable, and accomodating. The facilities were beautiful, the presentation elegant, and the experience impeccable. Our attendees were impressed and delighted, and I would wholeheartedly recommend the Drake for both professional or personal events. Many thanks to John, Eric and Lauren.",N
3619,"Attended the 2012 12th Night Masque on January 28. We had 2 rooms that were both fantastic great views of the lake and Michigan Avenue. Hotel staff was WONDERFUL, doormen, reception, security. Brunch the next day in the Drake Bros. restaurant was delicious.  THANK YOU for a GREAT Party Drake!!!",N
3646,Ordered Ardberg in the bar.  Smallest serving of single malt that I have ever seen.,N
3724,"I stayed here for two nights last winter due to an overnight layover with Amtrak.  It was a unique building, that's for sure, like being inside a giant fish bowl.  I was up pretty high, floor 19ish, with the floor to ceiling windows overlooking State Street.  In fact, you can feel the vibration at times from the subway.   The room was posh and ultra-modern and had one of the oddest bathrooms I've ever seen, almost completely glassed in with a window in the shower looking out into the rest of the room, which means your traveling companions would have a birds eye view of the shower and pretty much anything taking place in the bathroom, it is not suitable for family members, college buddies, or anybody else you might be rooming with, and if one of em happens to be a perv they can peak through the shower curtain which will be on their side, not yours. Also keep in mind that if your in a room with the floor to ceiling windows, the condos across state street will also have full view of your showering activities and binoculars would not be necessary, it's close enough that you could almost have a conversation with someone if you knew sign language or could read lips.  I was in a corner suite and the neighboring buildings on the other side were about a block away so at least I could have the shades open and not feel like I was giving somebody a show unless of course I forgot to pull the strange sliding closet door shut.   Someone else commented on noise in their review, I didn't make any myself, but I did hear a couple somewhere on my floor partaking in extracurricular activities, mid-afternoon mind you, and it sounded like they were trying to kill each other.  I seriously thought somebody was in pain and thought about calling the front desk.  I don't know if it was the all glass aspect of the place, but noise travels in this building so if this is what you intend to come to this place for, keep in mind you will be heard by everybody on the floor. I had to blast the heat because it was winter and had all that glass, and I suspect cooling the room would be an issue in the summer, but I was still very comfortable.  The bed was fantastic, wifi worked like a charm, and the mini-bar came in handy, just be prepared to not have much room if you bring your own provisions, it was so packed in that one of the wine bottles fell out onto the hardwood floor, fortunately it didn't break. I used the steam room in the ""spa"", but was disappointed at the lack of a sauna, I never did see the fitness center and not sure there even was one.  I did not use room service, the staff of the hotel was accomodating and professional, I found the desk clerks to be a little too stiff, but nothing terrible, I'm just used to Hilton and Hyatt and wanted to try out a boutique hotel for a change of pace.  As a construction worker I felt pretty out of place, you would definitely feel at home if your a Rock Star or some other artsy fartsy type though. Bottom line, I think this sort of place is fine for honeymooners that can't stand to be apart for five minutes, hence the always visible toilet/shower.  And it's probably ok for singles such as myself too, but families and groups or businesspeople trying to save money and doubling up, you're in for some awkward moments.",N
3725,"Where to begin. After reading some reviews we actually wanted to stay on the highest floor (under the club) so that we can be loud or at least listen to some music on the ipod dock the hotel PROVIDES. So one minute into a song we get a knock on the door about it being loud. It was 9pm. So we decide to go party upstairs and realized we have to go down to the lobby to take a separate elevator to go to the club. Thats fine but at least tell us instead of us trying to figure out if the elevator is broken or instead of trying the stairs etc it was so stupid for a while. Club was very cool though and staff excellent. We tried the tequila from Entourage. Not my fave but shots were free. Also we went to the restaurant Argent and had an awesome chat with the waitress who gave us great tourist advice. They took the term cake in crab cake a little too literally, I felt I was eating a birthday cake. The sushi was very good. We were happy the hotel/resto/club carry sugar free redbull and they even have discrete redbull art written on the elevator doors. The room was very nice. Sadly we didnt get any of the two upgrades we had requested a month earlier but the room was ok. The rainfall shower is AMAZING. Probably my fave part. Keep in mind the only ice machine is on the 5th floor. A maid told us they have free ice delivery but to request it in the morning. We didnt know this until check out. What a downer. All in all, staff were great, valet guys are awesome and helpful. The rest is nowhere near deserving any luxurious term. We will stick to our usual Conrad or Hard Rock Hotel.",N
3726,"The rooms here are nice, really nice. Great style, great bath products, amazing mini bar and snacks - repeat, amazing mini bar and snacks. Bed is super comfy and you get about 8 pillows. Great views of the city, just be sure you close both sets of blinds/per window to avoid giving the surrounding buildings a peep show. Went to the rooftop bar a few years ago and the drinks and apps were great, but i can't comment now if this is still the case. Everyone who works here is really buttoned up, nice and helpful. The elevator situation is a bit confusing, but who cares. I think the price per night is actually pretty generous.",N
3727,"Nice place, decent prices. I snabbed a deal with hotetonight for $114 (I had $25 in credits), we got a corner king with a balcony, whiich was nice. I loved the showers and everything is clean and modern and good to look at and the bed is super comfy. It is a nice, quiet hotel and vertigo is right upstairs, which is awesome and has very nice views! Great location too.",N
3728,Stayed here for 4 nights and was very happy with it. The location is great. The staff was nice and friendly. The room was set up nice. The Bed was comfortable. A great thing was the room service was 24 hours and reasonable and the food was good. They have a lounge on the 1st floor and an upscale louge/ club on the top floor called Vertigo. Both were great.,N
3729,"Not what it used to be... We are locals who venture downtown once or twice a year to play tourist.  We have frequently chosen The Dana Hotel for these staycations.  Our first visit a few years ago was awesome.  We were in love with its simplistic design and the great views from the corner rooms.  Last year, we noticed the upkeep had started to slip a bit, but figured the hotel would quickly address them.  Our visit this past weekend was just sad.   Not only is the hotel due for a renovation of sorts, but it is in need of some mega upkeep.  The bedroom furniture is all banged up and scratched.  The hallway carpeting on our floor was peeling back right in front of the elevator bank.  We noticed this when we checked in and it was not addressed the entire weekend.  This is ugly to begin with, but a huge trip hazzard to boot!!!  We began inspecting the entire hallway carpet one morning while waiting for the elevator (more on that to come) and noticed none of the lines in the carpet were lined up and there was a ripple effect all down the hallway.  The carpeting needs to be replaced...plain and simple. One thing I have always hated about the rooms is the bathroom.  It has an open shower which means that you can see the other person showering.  Fine...whatever.  This also means that you can see clearly the other person using the toilet.  Come on.  Absolutely nothing sexy about that.  The flimsy ""shower curtain"" which is located on the bedroom side outside of the shower is just ridiculous and doesn't fully cover the glass. The elevators blow!!!  I wish it was as simple as blaming the party goers to Vertigo Sky on the top floor, but the elevators are an issue when Vertigo is not opened.  You wait FOREVER for an elevator and when it arrives it is jammed pack full of people.  We got so fed up that we would just take the stairs down.  We were on a floor in the 20's and though we only took the stairs down I can barely walk today due to my calves hurting so freaking bad from the many ventures down the stairs!!! The majority of the staff are very friendly and helpful.  The only real odd encounter was one of the times we actually got an elevator ride.  The elevator stopped on a floor and an employee got half way in the elevator and decided to talk on the walky talky while the elevator doors kept trying to close.  We were all just staring at him.  Not once did he apologize or say excuse me or whatever...nothing.  Just held us all up and then eventually got in and rode up with us. One of the positives about this hotel is that the mini bar/fridge items are fairly decently priced.  A big plus if you want a quick beer, bottle of wine, or quick snack.  Another plus is its lcoation...you can walk to tons of restaurants/bars, etc. Doubtful that we will return to the Dana unless we hear that they have done some sort of overhaul.",N
3730,Very peaceful hotel. We really loved this hotel. The location could not be beat and the rooms were cozy. Great little balcony on our room which sealed the deal. Although we didn't eat at the hotel during our stay we did head up to the rooftop bar a couple times. What a spectacular location and view. We will return.,N
3731,"It was sure nice to be greeted by Luis as my taxi pulled up on a toasty 97 degree day.  I didn't have to touch my heavy bags anymore thank goodness as he promptly intercepted my luggage and led me to the second floor lobby. I know previous yelpers quibbled about having to take an elevator to get to the lobby, but this is not atypical in city hotels.  Besides, it adds another level of security, when it prevents any Tom, Dick or Mary from the street from gaining access. The lobby was small but well appointed.  Typical of a ""boutique"" style property. I was a bit nervous that at 9:30 a.m. I was going to get the ""That's a bit early to check in Ms. *****, and we have no rooms available.""  But alas my fears did not materialize and I was on my way, key in hand,  to my 14th floor room.   The double double was super clean, cozy, and had floor to ceiling windows.  It had a good feel, and I was happy with the room and the little extras like the Keurig coffee machine, robes, slippers, and trendy toiletries.  The rain shower was also kind of cool as it had a large panel of glass as its wall so you could shower with not only views of the room but the outside as well.  Perfect for exhibitionists or voyeurs.  If you happen to be a bit prudish, of course, there was a drape that would give you the privacy you needed. The service here was top notch.  I had some special requests that were carried out immediately and with great care and concern.  The location was perfect in many ways.  It was close to great restaurants, sightseeing, shopping, etc, and it also had convenient places nearby like Starbucks, CVS and WholeFoods. Folks interested in this property should note it is not categorized as a 5 star property in hotel terms, but the experience you have here could certainly be rated that high.",N
3732,"Awesome from the beginning....all the staff was very accommodating and GOOD LOOKING...I thought I was in the twilight zone for a second.  Our luggage got to our room in a timely manner.  At the time of our stay the elevators we messed up so the poor employees had to come get every guest whenever they called.  They were always there fast.   The rooms were modern with free wi-fi.  The peek-a-boo shower would have been great if I was not there with my best girlfriend.  The view from our room was awesome. We didn't get a chance to visit the spa but we did go to Vertigo Sky lounge.  Great patio that you can get room service, bottle service, or just drink if you want.  The staff made us all feel very comfortable and gave spectacular customer service.   I would recommend this place to anyone.  Great service, vibe, food, EVERYTHING!!",N
3733,"Great staff, clean rooms, awesome showers and great views!  The free WiFi is nice, others don't offer this.  Perfectly situated for good food and shopping.",N
3734,"I was recently at the Dana for my sister's bachelorette weekend. First, we went to the Dana spa and that was AMAZING. I had the aromatherapy massage and fell asleep it was so relaxing. My sister, who usually feels uncomfortable at spas, got a facial and LOVED it. We stayed in a corner suite at the hotel which was SO luxurious! IT had 2 balconies, a plush king bed, sofa bed, a wine fridge, hardwood floor living room and a shower for 2! The staff was very accomodating, bring our luggage up and down from our room and also bring extra things as we needed. They would call when our friends came to visit the room and let them into the elevator for us and  even brought up our friends shopping bags for them! The Dana is also right in river north so we could walk to all the fun restaurants and bars. Check out the Dana Hotel for sure. It has a modern, clean/new look, is right where you want to be in Chicago and is DEFINITELY above all the usual chain hotels.",N
3735,"Wonderful! The staff is so attentive and friendly. We felt welcomed from the moment we stepped up to this great hotel. The decor was contemporary and industrial. The ceiling in our room was concrete. The room service menu may have been a bit pretentious for late night. Raw bar? Beds were awesome and the shower was spectacular! The roof top bar was gorgeous, but the pumping techno was not really conducive to chilling over drinks and the amazing scenery. Half of the lounge was closed off which cornered us in and eventually led us right to the elevator. Other than that, we absolutely LOVED this hotel.",N
3736,"I decided to make an appointment at the spa on my day off, to treat myself.  I originally booked a massage using the online system, which was super easy.  I changed it to a mani/pedi after a ridiculous sunburn left my skin feeling pretty sensitive. I wish I'd just stuck with the massage. I typically stick to affordable (less than $50) nail salons.  I've never had a spa mani/pedi before, but I had one done at a salon before (Anna George) and loved it, so I figured the treatment would be similar. It was pretty much the same service I've received at my cheap salons.  My technician was friendly and the equipment was clean, but I wasn't blown away by anything.  I was getting a spa service, but I wasn't shown into the relaxation room or given a bathrobe and slippers, like other customers.  There's no drying station, so I sat in the reception area for about 15 minutes while my nails dried. I don't think I would come back for another mani/pedi.  I paid $80 (plus tip) and my manicure chipped within a day.  My pedicure chipped within a week - and my pedicures usually last 2-3 weeks.  I've had the same type of service at my cheap places, so I think I will stick to those spots.",N
3737,"My fiancee and I stayed here for 4 nights for an amazing Birthday getaway! From start to finish The Dana definitely made our stay amazing! As we pulled up out front the bellhop boys eagerly greeted us and took our luggage into the hotel. We arrived around 10:00am because of our early flight so the bellhop said he would tag our suitcases and when our room was ready he would have them delivered. Check in is actually one level up, you can either take the cool glass elevator directly there or walk up the short window encased beautiful stairwell up. The concierge pleasantly greeted us and advised our rooms were not ready and told us she'd alert us as soon they were. We inquired about upgrading our room and she graciously offered us a room on the quieter side of the building at a discounted rate. Room 2114 - Serene King The room is gorgeous, long & spacious with dark wood floors and a magnificent floor to ceiling window with views on the city and street below. The bed was very plush and comfy and the bathroom included a rainfall shower head and bowl sink. FYI the shower's back wall is glass and is exposed to the bedroom but covered by a curtain. So if your in the shower, someone in the bedroom could pull the curtain aside and take a peep at you. It's not an issue if your a couple but if you have privacy issues you want to keep this in mind. You also get free wifi in the hotel and complimentary use the in room keurig coffee machine. The mini bar is well stocked with affordable items. Our room was cleaned everyday and kept spotless with fresh towels replaced everyday and we had no issue with noise level at night. Dining Room service is sooo fast! Our meal came up in about 15 minutes hot and fresh! We had breakfast and dinner at Aja (on site restaurant) and both meals were exquisite! Vertigo (on site club) was amazing! They have a heated patio with fire pit and great drinks! Service Everyone from the doorman, to concierge, housekeepers, waiters, and managers were sooo kind and helpful! The concierge manager helped my fiancee arrange for flowers to be delivered to my room on my birthday, the concierge told us to have a free bottle of wine from the mini bar on the house to celebrate our birthday, the doormen were great on giving us tips on how to navigate the city and where are good places to check out. Everyone we encountered greeted us with smiles and graciousness. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel to others! The Dana made our Birthdays very memorable and enjoyable! This hotel is in the perfect location walking distance to many great restaurants and even the Magnificent Mile! FYI If your concerned about noise just ask for a room on the quieter side of the building away from Vertigo",N
3738,"Introduction Lobby/Check In: As per other reviews, check in is a bit different in this hotel. My bf and I were greeted by a GREAT and NICE doorman. He explained to us that check in was upstairs, got the elevator for us and explained briefly that there was a main restaurant and lounge should we want to have a drink and a bite. Check in is a floor up and when we got of the elevator, that's when the impression of the hotel dwindled a bit. The guy, slouched in his seat, looked like he just wanted to go home. He asked for credit card and passport, then spewed of gym this, lounge this, bar that and pointed to the elevator. Excellent doorman ruined by the mediocre check-in guy. Room Number 1215: Awesome room! It's modern with hard wood floor (or look alike). The room is small, but I have to give credit to the design team that efficiently uses the space. It's a very intimate room so definitely go with someone you are comfortable sharing space with. The bathroom is spaced in such a way that the shower overlooks the room and is covered with a curtain on the outside. Such that, if you are taking a shower, someone could just pull the curtain aside and ... By the way, I loved the rainfall shower head which I have always wanted in my bathroom. There is a balcony, but the room we got, it was very small and slanted. So don't expect to be sitting and lying down outside. Besides, buildings everywhere, so not the best atmosphere to be sunbathing. Noise-Level: NOISY! This hotel is in the heart of downtown Chicago, and because there are glass windows (top to bottom), you can hear the sirens, construction, honking, etc... Light sleepers beware. Extras: Concierge. There is one man who sits at a table across from the check-in desk and he is okay. We asked him many times to recommend restaurants of various cuisines which is fine, but never offered to make reservations, or provide alternate restaurants to the ones he selected should they be busy. The concierge I envision makes reservations, provide alternatives, and seems to go to the ends of the earth to make things happen. Just me I guess. FYI. We asked the concierge for late checkout and we were told that you can only request that the morning that you are leaving...""May the odds be forever in your favour"" (YEAH HUNGER GAMES!) Vertigo Sky Rooftop Lounge. This hotel turns into a club on the weekends which makes the hotel turn into chaos. My bf and I returned from a late night movie and by 12:30AM, we could see the line of people trying to get into the hotel. The club (penthouse floor) is accessed by a card key which one man has (the bouncer I presume) which is hard for guests who just want to get up to the room because you have to wait in line too. What should have happened was to dedicate one elevator for people who wanted to go to the lounge, and the rest for guests. My bf and I were checked for ID's and were told to get to the back of the line, and we retorted that we actually were hotel guests and had to show our card key. It really is a hassle, and because of this experience, my star rating dropped. Doormen. These people are really great. The first one we encountered was excellent, and the last one on our check-out day was fabulous too (apparently, he won the best doorman award...) He stated he would get us a taxi to Mid-way airport for a flat fee of $35 because it could be more expensive with traffic, etc... He hunted down 3 taxis to get us the assured rate which we appreciated. By the way, as of today, flat rate from downtown to Midway is $35 USD. Conclusion. I'm glad we stayed at this hotel, but I don't think we will be coming back here again. I want to try other hotels in Chicago and my experience here was just A-OK. However, I can't fault the location as it is walking distance from the CTC, Magnificent Mile, and Millennium Park. 3 night stay, starting Thursday, was $640 and change including all hotel taxes and fees.",N
3739,"We had done extensive research on where to stay, location of the hotel, prices and etc. The reviews were and -'s.. but the positives outweighed it and we gave it a shot and were we impressed! Positives. *Decor is undeniably exquisite which added value to our overall experience. *The door staff is courteous from beginning to end of our stay.. anywhere from offering to take our bags to our room, to opening the door (chilvary isn't dead here), to hailing cabs, directions, you name it.. they were there. *Front desk and concierge were helpful for all of our needs including a change of room, which the front desk provided the day after our initial stay which we didn't mind as we came to check in at 2am and weren't even thinking about relocating. *The rooms were great, the showeris definitely a conversation piece with the clear glass dividing the shower and the bedroom. *The bed and pillows were super comfy! We wanted to take it home along with the bedding. *Big flat tv, Keurig machine with coffee and tea cartridge, affordable mini bar, ipod/iphone player, alarm clock, office desk. *Bathroom necessities always plentiful. (Shower gel, Shampoo, ear buds, towels) *Vertigo was a nice amenity *Great location - right in the heart of downtown. Close to restaurants, transit stops, theater, etc. *They kept our baggage in storage for the last few hours we were in Chicago to sightsee! That was very helpful of them. *Housekeeping was very attentive and when there was a request.. they were right behind it. *Free use of the in room safe was definitely a reassurance. *We were staying on the 14th floor which didn't seem to hear the reminants of the Friday and Saturday night partying up on the roof, any further up I would reconsider, but the hotel front desk are really conscious of it at the time of booking. Cons. There were a couple of mis-design, but nothing too major. *In the first room, 11th floor (no floor to ceiling windows, but it did have a balcony), there was a shower door that leaked into the bathroom.. there was a good half an inch space between the door and the wall. We were switched into the comfy king due to personal request, we were situated into an upgrade of a room located on the 14th floor -which was excellent. *I particularly did not like the fact that there was not an entrance solely for Vertigo. The bar patrons were using the same elevators as guest who were staying at the hotel. Could be a security flaw, but we weren't particularly bothered but you never know. *The walls are thin, but it didn't seem to bother us at all. *The city sounds were serene to us, but for some could be bothersome. *The window blinds would be one solitary blind as opposed to three different un-overlapping blind that would let sun through.. not good for those that only sleep in complete darkness. N/A. Did not have any experience in the following. Room Service Pay per view channels Exercise Room Aja - In house restaurant. MiniBar - did not purchase. I would definitely favor this hotel on our next trip back to Chicago.""",N
3740,"Review for event space: we hosted a 10-person all-day meeting at the Dana's boardroom this weekend and while the space and food were good, the service was quite weak. We never received the tea and coffee refill mid-morning and there was not a soul around to remind. When we finally asked about it when the person charged with our event, he said he'll brew some in a bit, which he never did..",N
3743,"The Hotel is beautiful and the amenities are great so if you're looking for a trendy yet peaceful get away, the Dana Hotel is a decent option, much better when you consider the price and the comparables.  HOWEVER, DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU BOOK THROUGH A THIRD PARTY!!!!  I realize this is partially my fault for using Expedia and not the Dana Hotel directly, but I did not realize that the $700 I spent on three nights through Expedia would warrant the incredibly rude treatment I've received since check-in, and I haven't even been here for 24 hours yet.   First, there is absolutely nothing any of the staff will do when room is incorrect or you have other routine check-in issues.  Obviously--according to the demeanor of the girl I initially checked in with--people who prepay for their rooms and book through third parties are undeserving of quality customer service.  HOWEVER, if you're willing to take a downgrade (which I reluctantly agreed to) they will happily move you, but don't expect reimbursement for the difference in price.   In Dana's defense, most of my actual problems stemmed from booking through a third-party site (wrong room, no prior notification of 150 incidental).   My complaint about the Dana Hotel specifically is how rude the staff has been in response to the fact that I booked through a third party.  I understand how it might be preferable for hotels to have their guests book directly through them, but they still obviously gain something from allowing third party reservations, or they wouldn't allow them.  THEREFORE, I see no reason for the Hotel Customer service to treat me like a pile of dog shit, especially because this whole ordeal ended up costing me more than if I had just booked through Dana directly.  If you don't like Expedia, stop accepting third party reservations.  Otherwise, don't take it out on your guests.   Before I checked in, I was so excited to have a few days here (I live in Chicago but am staying here while in the process of moving).  I was glad to have found a place that was nice, relaxing, and reasonably priced so I can stop sending my friends and family to dingy Comfort-Inn type places when they come to visit.  But at least at dingy-Comfort Inn type places, you're likely to receive a welcoming smile upon check in, which is a lot more than I can say for the Dana.",N
3744,"Baffled by the 5 star reviews and comments about good decor...I would never stay here again, although the location was good for me. The most annoying thing about the hotel is the elevators. We stayed with a baby and were using a stroller and you must take an elevator up 1 floor to get on another elevator to get to your room. There are 2 or 3 other elevators that go from street level throughout the hotel that are empty, that they reserve from the rooftop bar only and staff only. These elevators remain empty, while the others are overcrowded and make many stops. Once on that elevator you must insert your card into the slot to press your button and hope the elevator has not already started moving. Most other people in the elevators were confused and annoyed by this. In addition they put us in a room next to the elevator that was noisy and you could hear the club music coming up from in from inside the room. In addition one night there were (what sounded like 20) drunk people hanging out in our hallway, talking really loud for at least a half an hour, which isn't really the hotels fault, except the rooms were not sound proofed. Whoever designed this hotel is an idiot. ALL of the design elements are completely disjointed, and do not go together. The style over thought, all over the place and is in poor taste. These is nothing inspiring or calming about it. Less is more people!",N
3745,"I was a guest at Dana for two months while searching for a new home in the city. This places me in the unique position of seeing the entire ebb and tide of customers and the manner in which the team at Dana served them. The Quickie Review: AMAZING. Absolute Fabulocity. Danalicious. Book 'Em Dana. Wow. The Detailed Review: I'd like to start off by disclosing that I travel way too much for work. Like up to 100 nights a year in hotels much kinda much. I have stayed in hotels that are much  more expensive than Dana and ones much less expensive. So at the high-end of this spectrum we are talking Bellagio suite and at the low end Embassy Suites. (each a fine player in their market) Of ANY hotel I have ever visited, Dana is simply the best experience ever. Hands down. I have to admit that I read the less than favorable reviews first because I knew pretty much what the huge number of  the 4+ Star crowd reviews would say already.  Of the few negative reviews, I tossed out about 50% for the guest just being whiny or unrealistic. For example, one reviewer was a classic example of an all around 'all about me' classic bitch about her stroller issue. NEWSFLASH Princess: You are in River North...basically down freakin town Chicago. This ain't West Goatscrew, Nebraska. It's a stylish neighborhood in a densely populated urban area with a demographic that is largely single, trendy, well-dressed and still a size six. No matter the demographics, any idiot knows that this - and many other neighborhoods close to downtown - are totally stroller inappropriate. In fact, it was quite rude of you not only to bring one but to expect special treatment for using one. It ain't all about you. There. Wha??? Somebody had to say it. You know you wanted to. Yes, the elavators are slow on busy days and nights. A bit of a design flaw. But if it takes me an additional 5 minutes of my day to get to heaven then I'm still in heaven. Yea me. As for the elevator to the elevator design...oh good LAWD (have mercy) we're talking ONE FLOOR in a sparsely used glass box of bliss. Really honey..it adds like 2 minutes tops to your journey towards Valhalla. You can also use this brilliant invention called 'the staircase' which is even stylishly staggered just for your personal comfort. This adds about 15 seconds tops to your journey. Woo. You carried the thing for 9 months and now reject it for 2 minutes work? Way to go Mommy Dearest. The smart money is on Dana. For the prices, the professionalism of the staff, the thoughtful amenities provided and the kickass location. Perfection.  Honestly, you don't see this type of total package at this price level. Add 200 more per night and it's common. It's expected. At Dana, it's just another reason to fall in love with the subtle and not so subtle ways they work to make your visit special. There is a door to the bathroom; you ARE NOT exposed in the shower. If standing in front of the opening into the  bathroom, Look just to either side for some highly polished wood. Now touch the wood and SLIDE It either right or left to maintain bathroom privacy and reveal your closet and safe. The showers are to die for. Oh if mine could talk. (zip it!)  Thankfully what happened at Dana stays with the doorman. (TIP them people...they deserve it and are your best source of info in the city. And darn nice people too.) Staff is brilliant. Never had an issue. I've watched them when slow and when slammed. In every situation,  I witnessed polished professionalism and grace. Sure, there may be some moments that some visitors have where something went wrong. Every hotel has that reality. Dana just handles it better; I can almost guarantee that based on seeing them in action day to day. Rooms rock. Beds are like sleeping on a dreamy cloud made of porn. Wonderful. The day I moved to my new house I actually shed a tear in leaving Dana. I've even gone back for a weekend just to see my muse. 6 Months later she still remembered my name. Class act guys. I miss ya.",N
3746,"This hotel is in a good area close to some of Chicago downtown's magnificent mile shopping and restaurants. The room was small with a little balcony overlooking the city, which was nice since it was cool out, we just kept that door open. The only thing that was a negative for me is that the room was very dusty. Looked clean otherwise, but dusty. The staff was very helpful and courteous. Overall I enjoyed my stay and would stay here again.",N
3747,"What a view!  Stayed here last night and it was less expensive than my stay @ Hyatt Place in the 'burbs.  Very attentive service starting from the bellman waiting for the cabs to help you check in to the breakfast crew servers.  I also got a $10 credit to the spa or restaurant when I checked in, not sure if this came with every room or reservation. The BEST part is the breathtaking views from the balcony.  Request a room with a balcony!  As many times as I've been to Chicago, I still paused just getting out of the elevator and admired the views.  It reminded me of the Signature Room on the 95th floor.  Besides the floor to ceiling windows, the room includes free wi-fi, a 24 hour fitness center with a cool TRX-ish weight pulley system, ipod dock with good speakers, and Keurig machine.   If they could do something about the noise level, it would be 5 stars.  Yes, the hotel is in the city so you expect to hear trains, sirens, etc., but the noise I heard was the ice machine and people walking in the hallway.  It was loud enough to wake you up at night but not constant enough to keep you up.  I met my co-worker for breakfast (their 3 ingredient omelet and potatoes are very tasty) and he mentioned how loud the hotel was too.  It's still an awesome hotel.  I usually stay at the Public hotel and will pick Dana hotel next time.",N
3748,"The rooms are small and minimal, the decorating is nice, the food was disappointing, the location is good. For the price, I think there are many better options in the immediate area.",N
3749,"The Dana Hotel is absolutely beautiful.  The location is great close to pretty much everything. The rooms have a very modern yet comfortable feel. The hotel staff is great from arrival to check-out. We had a corner king room. The floor to ceiling windows made for an excellent view. There were only a couple of reasons that i am giving the hotel 4 instead of 5 stars. 1 is that it is extremely noisy and makes it hard to sleep, I do realize this is not fault of the hotel but if this is something that may concern you just know its loud. Another reason i deducted a star is because i was given a handicapped room so we didn't get the cool peek-a-boo shower and i was really actually looking forward to that by the time i got to my room and unloaded my stuff i realized it and was not going to change the room.  Also, it is complete chaos on a Saturday night in their lobby and when you have to go through a sea of people just to get to your room it is kind of a pain. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would love to go back and stay again.",N
3750,"I celebrated my 30th birthday here and spent about $2,000 with the hotel. I booked a large suite, 6 appointments to in room spa service ($150 per service), Dinner at their restaurant aja for 12, and $1000 worth of bottle service at their club (Vertigo). Everything was totally mismanaged and disorganized. None of there services (spa, restaurant, hotel) communicate with each other. Nothing coordinated properly. However, most of the staff was friendly and they tried to be accommodating, but just could not figure it out. I forgave them for this. However, I could not forgive them for the following events: I had a small group of friends meet me at my suite around 9:30 on a Saturday night before bottle service at Vertigo. Our party was fairly conservative. Friends actually told me they thought the party was at a room across from mine, because they saw tons of people pile in and loud music. Given that at least three other rooms on my floor were raging, I figured my party was pretty tame. At about 10:45, just as we were about to go up to Vertigo, my friends decided to sing me Happy Birthday and make a toast to me. I was so touched, but I could not enjoy it because as soon as they finished two very irate and intimidating security men barged into my room and escorted me to the hallway. My boyfriend followed me out because he was concerned for my safety. The two men bullied him back in the room stating that they would physically remove him if he continued to follow me. One security man yelled at me for having people in the room while the other one stared at my body. I asked the security man to please stop yelling at me and that I planned to escort my guests to Vertigo where my $1000 table waited for me. All the while, I was being visually raped by the other security guy. So then after much embarrassment, I asked my guests to follow me to the lounge upstairs. Instead of getting the VIP treatment that Vertigo promised me, my guests were made to leave the hotel, go around to the other side in the cold and wait in line. I talked to the bouncer and told him I had bottle service. He refused to let me up to the club and refused to let my friends in. So, I bribed him with $40 to let me and my friends up to my $1000 table. He obliged me after the bribe. Once I got to my table, my waitress and hostess were actually really nice and accommodating. I had no problem tipping them an extra $100. However, the remainder of my late arriving guests were repeatedly harassed by the hotel management and security. Several of my male gay friends were forced to wait outside as women passed them to get in. After my really fun party at Vertigo I decided to go back to my room. The parties were raging hard  at other rooms on my floor. I just wanted to chill with a few of my close friends. We were sitting on the couch, eating, and talking. No music was playing nor were we talking loudly. In fact, we could hear the party going on next door from our room. 10 minutes later 3 aggressive security men barge into my room. They begin to yell at my guests and tell them to ""get the f%#k out"" of my room. The man whom I bribed with the $40 was the only nice one (I wonder why). Even though there were about 12 people in the room earlier for my spa service with no problems, the security guard commanded that only 4 people could be in the room. Shaken and crying by this point, I told my boyfriend that I just wanted to go home. He calmed me down and said we should just get some sleep. So, Dana Hotel basically ruined my 30th birthday and took all my money.",N
3758,"From my countless stays here- relaxing in my all time favorite Tranquil Suites, to being transformed into pure bliss at the spa, to the best times here posted up at Aja's bar to rant with Justin and team to always being blown away with the over the top events & spectacular city views up at Vertigo Sky Lounge  - Dana Hotel Resort & Spa is even better defined by their team of unforgettable and legendary people..From the street to my favorite faces checking in & concierge rock stars, to bar staff to the masterminds in sales (Maureen) and events (Sandi), to their always evolving food & bar menus (Aerial & Matt) to HR (Kristen) responsible for keeping this team together.

3771,"i know this is really lame, but refer to Shane H.'s review below. ditto to literally everything he said...esp the part about being unaccustomed to the midwest hospitality that is so absent in LA. unlike the 3-star ratings that complain about bad service here, we found the staff to be very attentive and helpful especially if we had questions about certain places in the city we wanted to check out. we stayed here for two nights during our four day stay and found that the location was perfect as everything--magnificent mile, the field museum, john hancock observatory, a lot of the highest rated restaurants in the city and even millenium park were all within walking distance.  i actually noticed my clothes sagging a bit towards the end of our trip and later discovered that i had actually LOST a considerable amount of weight during our week in chicago despite eating copious amounts of bad food because we walked everywhere. it was actually so refreshing to be able to walk to our destination as opposed to always being stuck in a car (ugh, another thing about LA i detest).   another plus that i don't see mentioned was the gym. albeit small and limited in terms of equipment, they had these awesome state-of-the-art kinesis machines! i know it's lame to be so excited over workout equipment but they were so cool :) all in all, we really enjoyed our stay here and were kinda sad when we left to our second hotel. ps. MAKE SURE YOU TRY QUARTINO ONE BLOCK AWAY! we almost didn't but thank GOD we did!",N
3776,"Er its OK but for the price I would expect the furnishings to be a little better.  Detail Detail, the place has a bit of a worn feeling to it.  Room was Ok, lampshade stained, bed super comfy.  Shower only - no tub, and get this glass to the bedroom so your lovely can watch you in the shower or on the potty .  There is a curtain bedroom side but still...kind of tacky.  Grouting and painting in need of overhaul.  Minibar - lots of snacks, and a selection of wine and champagne but no spirits.  All reaonably priced.  We went up to Vertigo - it was OK nada special.  Hotel Location was good for our needs and staff were fine, rustled me up some safety pins for a wardrobe malfunction.  We did not partake of any food or libation.",N
3778,"perfect place for a romantic getaway! ;) stayed here with my boyfriend for valentines day and we were pleasantly surprised. the room was very romantic and modern. large space, great view, ceiling to floor windows and a very comfortable king size bed. everything about this hotel we loved, yet there were a few minor suggestions we think that the hotels website should mention before booking. would not say this is a family oriented hotel. i would not recommend this hotel for people that are not open with sharing, hearing, and seeing everything that would normally go on behind closed doors. this is because the bathroom door in the room did not close fully which made it kind of awkward to use the bathroom. also the shower did not have a door, which means if you don't have the heat on full blast you will freeze to death. yet, since i did stay with my boyfriend this room was very romantic and perfect for couples. will be back :)",N
3779,"Beds are comfy but our bathroom had a weird Amsterdam red light district vibe to it. Glass walls between the shower and the bedroom and the curtain was on the *bedroom* side. Kinda creepy. Also, avoid getting a room outside the elevator. The doors are paper thin.",N
3783,"Pretty cool. Decent rooms, but very pretentious. Odd system of going to the upstairs club, even for hotel guests- take the elevator downstairs and ask to go back upstairs, ask the hostess to let you go to the club, walk through a shady coat check room to the same elevator you just got off and go upstairs again. WTF? Anyway, pretty people and pretty cool rooms. Overall not bad, but not as special as they would like you to think they are.",N
3785,"This hotel definitely isn't family friendly.  If you're in the bedroom, you can look right into the shower (glass window from the ceiling to the ground).  Why they have this setup I'll never know.  The remote control didn't work, and after saying something to the front desk, they said it's a problem with the TV.  The phones didn't work either (the cordless phone was a PITA).  The breakfast restaurant downstairs is a complete joke - don't go here hungry because you'll leave the same way.  I'd suggest finding another hotel to be honest.",N
3790,"Ignore the service whiners. We were treated like kings in every area: bell hops, front desk clerks (you get to sit down and relax as you are checking in), wait staff, concierge, bartenders....etc.  But that wasn't even the highlight....our room was freaking amazing (ask for room 1716).  Awesome corner room with spectacular views and ceiling to floor windows.  If you are a fan of contemporary boutique hotels, you will have a difficult time finding better options in Chicago.",N
3810,"Maybe the staff at the desk read some of these reviews;  they were friendly and helpful during our 3-day visit.  My complaint about this hotel is that, under the trendy and slightly pretentious veneer, there's an air of neglect.  A case in point would be the remote that didn't work, and the two phones ditto.  The impact of the ubiquitous granite everywhere is undermined by cheap furniture underneath.  The amazing views are obscured by the big TV, desk lamps, and a truly horrible tangle of wires below.  Not pretty at all. But we got a super deal and we liked the staff, the bedding, the bed, the view, the shower, and the location.",N
3813,"The Hotel... AMAZING!!!!! Walking into this boutique hotel (2nd floor) you're taken back from the beautiful modern decor, swanky!!! Look around, the interior decor is phenomenal, you recollect your memory ""Am I in the right place for the price?!"" This hotel is one of the most affordable and upscale in Downtown Chicago. I booked a regular guest room, I was sooooooo impressed! The rain shower which was glassed to the entire room view was so inviting, amazing, relaxing, spacious and so sleek. You can shower 5x's a day! No worries if you share the room with a guest, there is a curtain to hide your sexiness from the room view lol! Floor to ceiling windows were breath taking with semi-dark shades, your choice. High end speaker system (bring your iPod/iPad) to connect to this jammin radio! Flat screen tv. The best part..... THE BEDS. HOLY DANA its like sleeping on clouds - Heavenly!!! I slept so well!!! Soft and cushy, everything feathered!!! Sleek dark wood floors. Minimal storage for clothes and seating. All they need is the bidet and toilet seat warmer hehehe Jk Jk. Everything was amazing!!! You must stay here! I always do when I'm in Chi-Town :)",N
3815,It's 2:00 a.m. and instead of sleeping I am writing this review because it is so loud in our room. We are staying on the 25th floor which had great views but they neglected to tell us that there is a club on the 26th floor that plays house music until 2:30. I called the front desk and all they did was apologize for the noise and then they hung up. For the amount of money we spent for our room I would expect more. We definitely won't be back,N
3883,"I don't know if I would normally give this 4 stars...maybe 3 1/2, but I feel obligated to try to raise the Yelp score a little bit. It's really not that bad, people. Our double-bed room was up on the 14th floor, the top floor. From the reviews, it sounds like we lucked out, and maybe some of the more unkempt rooms are on the lower floors. Try requesting a higher room. Ours was way bigger than expected. The bed sheets were clean, the mattresses were firm. It was quiet. The TV was small but worked just fine. The bathroom was huge. We thought the a/c was fine - but we were also in Chicago for a stretch of amazing mid-70s days. Staff was always courteous. Sadly, no ghosts greeted us during our stay :( Even when we peeked onto the 13th floor. (Yes, they have a 13th floor.) Yeah, the hallways are a bit old-fashioned. But they aren't as badly lit as I was led to believe. They just seemed like...well, the hallways in an older hotel. The outside window-view from the hallways is definitely Shining-esque, though. But we thought that was cool. Location could not be better, right on Michigan Ave across from the fountain, easy 10 minute walk to Millennium Park, even easier 25 minute walk to Soldier Field. Please note: we didn't have a car with us, so I can't comment on their valet situation. We were also two people in a two double-bed room, so I can't comment on their efficiency in bringing up a cot, extra towels, etc. (Our room was equipped with four towels, and the towels were replaced after house-cleaning even though we didn't request it.) We requested a mini-fridge, and they brought it up promptly even though it was after midnight. I don't know, maybe my opinion on ""old"" and ""dirty"" has been skewed after staying in some rotten New York apartments. But I thought the Congress was fine for the price, and I would stay here again without hesitation. And yes, people are still on strike here. But the group is about 5 - 10 people, and they never once hassled us when we saw them. A note to business travelers: there is a daily charge for Wi-Fi.",N
3884,"Where do I start? My favorite part of this fecal hole was the pubic hair bubbling up from the slow shower drain. I also liked the mold smell wafting through the entire building. This place is seriously bad. It is in need of a wrecking ball like no building that I have seen before. Bullet point list of things that suck about this place: Red AstroTurf carpet in room with stains Mold smell 100 decibel a/c system that could not be turned off Carpeting on the wall of the elevator Plaster falling off the walls in the shower Fluorescent lighting in the bathroom Screaming drunk 12 year olds running around at 4 am This place sucks. The wife and I stayed here over labor day weekend. The one star is for the location, that is the only thing going for this place. Spend the extra 30 a night and stay somewhere else.",N
3885,"This is a large old hotel that still retains its old school ""charm"" or lack of repair, however you want to call it. It sure could use some new wallpaper and carpeting for example. Having said that, the bed was very comfortable and the location is great. The bathroom was a bit small and could have used a few more shelves but otherwise it was fine. We went for a wedding here and they did a great job with the wedding. Both the ceremony and the reception rooms were beautiful and private. The convention rooms were on the other side of the hotel so the guests enjoyed the entire wedding area to themselves. They made good drinks.",N
3886,"Room was alright. A little overpriced but the view was great. The room had a musty smell like it hadn't been stayed in for quite sometime. Air conditioning was really weak and could barely keep the room cool. Valet parking is a joke, the line Sunday morning in front of the hotel was so long they recommended that we go directly to the parking garage ourselves. When we got there we had to wait in a 45 minute line to pickup the car. Overall horribly disorganized.",N
3887,"The architecture is very nice, and the hotel is huge, but is clearly in the middle to advanced stages of falling apart. There are strange smells in the rooms, the carpeting is definitely showing its age and squishy in strange places, etc. Worthwhile only when location and price are more important than any other considerations.",N
3888,"My experience at this hotel was significantly better than the 2 stars it currently has. We were able to check in several hours before the listed time without any issue. The clerk that checked us in was very friendly and polite. We stayed in a room accessible via the north elevator (even numbered rooms) on the 10th floor. Our view was not great, but the room was very clean. The air conditioner seemed to work fine, although it was not extremely warm while we were there. The hotel had a very aged feel to it, but my expectations for an 1890's era building were far surpassed. The housekeeping staff was very nice. They quietly knocked at the door around 8 am every morning, but we had to turn them away as we were preparing to venture out into the city. Each of the 3 days we stayed, we returned to find things tidied up and cleaned very well. Nothing was out of place in anyway. We dealt with two separate concierges and another desk clerk who were all friendly and helpful. There were only two things that distressed me about my stay. The Mountain Dew LiveWire button on the soda machines returned Orange Crush and my expectations of being creeped out by a haunted hotel were not met. This place is definitely a deal in the heart of downtown. Great access to subway and buses. I would stay here again if I return to Chicago.",N
3889,"What.A.Shit.Hole. Note to self: Make sure you reserve your own hotel on trips! I don't know if this place was ""haunted"", but it was disturbingly disgusting. The rooms are dark, dingy, smelly and just plain gross. The beds give you the creeps because of the recent bed bugs out break. I literally changed clothes in this room and that was it. I actually slept at a friends neighboring hotel. The service was also sub-par. Just an all around epic failure! Oh, and who doesn't have free wi-fi in a hotel???",N
3890,"When I opened the door to the room, I immediately smelled mildew.  It was so humid in the room, you could see water damage to the picture hanging above the bed.  The bed was also horrible.  The mattress was shot.  When you sat on the edge it would make a loud creaking noise and you just sunk in it.  The bathroom was in bad shape too.  Tiles were cracked and broken.  The shower head shook so bad while the water was on, the wall plate came loose from the wall and fell around the shower head.  The staff was unpleasant as well.  While we attended an event in one of their event rooms, a server stole our camera off the table.  They have a security department, and apparently this happens all the time.   It's a great location, so if you are going to get drunk and rowdy, don't plan on sleeping, and don't own any valuables, this is the place for you.",N
3891,"I usually go to Chicago every June for an annual show, one year I left booking late and couldn't get my usual Marriott Downtown room and this hotel was my only geographically desirable choice. I stayed on the top floor corner room right across from Grant Park with a view of Lake Michigan. Other than the view, this hotel was awful especially the room. The rooms are not up to ADA code, they are dirty and old. Here is the rundown on my room: The bathroom door at a 45 degree angle opens out and hits the front door You step up to go in the bathroom (dangerous and obviously not ADA)...the architect was smoking something when he/she designed this. The shower pipe in the bathroom wet wall was missing a strap and moving and shaking when using the shower and the drywall was coming apart from the wall. Bathroom sink very small pedestal and no counter top Acoustical T-bar grid ceiling was very high and the tiles were stained from some leaks There was a very small leak and I had to ask for extra towels (I had the last room in the hotel) to put on the floor The hotel has some nice historic elements in the lobby, it just needs to be totally renovated and possible new plumbing throughout! I'm giving 1-star for the view, but I would of preferred to camp out in a tent next to Buckingham Fountain....:-)",N
3892,Old. This place was decent priced for location. It was indeed older and small room but pretty clean besides hair I found on the bed. The walls are paper thin here so expect every conversation to be heard. No sightings of bugs or anything breaking . Would stay again if they get some new comforters that I can be sure are cleaned properly first.,N
3893,"It's obviously an old, classic hotel from another era.  Inherently is not the most modern  offering in the area.  For my needs, it was clean and conveniently located to downtown.  It was interesting to stroll through the halls where so many interesting things have happened in the last 100 years.  It was just fine for 2 nights, but any longer and I probably would upgrade to a Marriott.",N
3896,"When looking at the price of this hotel as well as the LOCATION it is AMAZING! The red line is right down the street and you can basically get to many different places in chicago from this hotel. It is definitely a plus. The staff is super friendly (except for the people on strike outside...but whatever haha!) I am not giving 5 stars based on the quality of the rooms that they have. They are very worn down and the hallways are extremely creepy. BUT you get what you pay for so it wasn't a big deal. My friends and I were staying here for only one night so we didn't mind it at all. I would NOT recommend staying there much longer just because it really isn't that nice of a place and when I woke the next morning I was ready to get out of there. If this place is in fact haunted we didn't have any issues with the ghosts that reside here haha. So I really wouldn't worry about it. Stay here if you need a cheap, one night stay...really not much longer...",N
3941,Yuck.,N
3945,"AVOID THE CONGRESS PLAZA HOTEL AT ALL COSTS! When we arrived there, the building architecture was undoubtedly fascinating, it soon became obvious that the hotel is not being properly maintained. Setting the dirty carpets and dark, dirty, hallways aside, our first disturbing discovery was an unlocked door on the 7th floor next to the vending area. This unlocked door opens into a shaft used for plumbing and other infrastructure, however, one, especially, a child, could easily fall down to the lower floors and be seriously injured or killed. It shocks me that the hotel can remain in operation with such serious safety hazards. At approximately 11:20 p.m., we discovered a BED BUG in the bed in one of our rooms! We immediately gathered the evidence, took pictures, and called the front desk. The front desk did not seem surprised by our discovery and acted as if we were inconveniencing them! The front desk sent a security officer to the room at approximately 11:40 p.m., who also did not act surprised. The officer had us fill out a security report and took pictures of the bug. The security officer advised us that the manager will move one room. Since we had three rooms on the floor, two of which were adjoining rooms, we went to the front desk, with the bug, to request that all of our rooms are moved. Again, the night manager acted as if we were inconveniencing him. He first advised us that the hotel was almost to capacity and that we would not get three rooms together on another floor. Like magic, however, the new rooms that we received were all in the same hallway, on the same floor, two of which were again adjoining! We checked our new rooms thouroughly for any bed bugs and did not find any. We then went to bed, but did not get much sleep with the thought that bed bugs could be just feet away. What a way to spend New Year's Eve! The next morning, I called American Express Travel to report the issue. After an hour of busy signals and getting disconnected, I eventually spoke with a supervisor, explained the issue, and requested a full refund for our three rooms. The AmEx supervisor called the hotel's manager on duty, Francine, on a three-way call. Francine said that she would call me back shortly with more information. She never called me back and I went to the front desk to follow-up. She said that she was authorized by the hotel's general manager, Shakeel Siddiqu to refund one room and I reported that it was unacceptable. We asked her to call Shakeel back and explain the situation again. She went into the office and supposedly called him back, however, I do not believe that she did. She again said that they would refund one room and would need to call American Express Travel to discuss the issue further. I then asked for a copy of the security report that was filed the night before. She told me that the security office would not give her a copy, but they would give me a copy. I proceeded to the security office in the basement of the hotel and was told that they would not give me a copy of the report until it was reviewed by the director of security. The security personnel is a total joke and more concerned with pointing out wrongs in their colleagues than helping customers. They provided the report number only and said that they would fax the report later. Ultimately, it is obvious that the hotel's lack of concern for its guests stems directly from the hotel's shady owners and all the way through the incompetent management. I do not think a single member of their staff has any idea was customer service is. I also doubt they know they are working in a service industry! After checking out of the hotel, I performed some due dilligence on the hotel. I wish I would have done so before our stay, rather than trusting American Express Travel. I found that our story is not by any means new or isolated. Members of UNITE HERE Local 1 working at the Congress Hotel have been on strike since 2003 after the hotel decided to freeze wages and slash benefit. The Congress Plaza Hotel simply does not care about its guests or employees. The hotel, its owners, and its management ar",N
3957,"absolute DUMP!   Dirty, terrible service, do not stay there.  Run don't walk.",N
3977,"Great hotel and location. The beds are very comfortable and the rooms are good sized. Unfortunately there is no fridge, so leftovers from restaurants is not really possible. Also the gym is pretty tiny, enough though it looks like they could have made the gym bigger if they wanted to. It has all the essentials, but space is tight for free weights. Besides that, everything was great. Especially the breakfast buffet. Absolutely incredible. It had an omelette section, fruit, pastries, salmon and cheeses, and a generic breakfast section (eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes). Service was excellent and to top it off, you can eat in an area surrounded by water with flat screens with ESPN. Overall, great stay and highly recommended!",N
3978,"I stayed for a 3-day conference at the hotel.  I have stayed in other downtown hotels in NYC, SF, and London - the urban hotel is not a foreign experience. Summary: *  Bed.  Felt like a thin mattress sitting on a wooden board, and angled with feet higher than head; *  Noise.  Room was very poorly insulated from noise.  On the last night, we heard our neighbors arrive after midnight, argue - though only speaking loudly and not screaming - for several hours.  We could make out phrases and words fairly clearly  Additionally, the previous neighbor, we could hear clear words when spoke on the phone; *  Housekeeping cleaning neighbors at 7.30 am.  Given poor noise insulation, this woke me up on Sunday morning.  Not appropriate to be cleaning rooms at 7.30 am, unless some kind of emergency; *  Storage shortage.  No dresser, only few drawers in nightstand.  Heard fellow conference goers complain of the same experience in their rooms, respectively.  Bathroom had a tiny, glass shelf above the toilet and about 4-6"" of flat space next to the sink basin.  Towel bar - only one in the entire bathroom, and two, small, rob hooks; *  Parking.  $52/day!  Really?  Yes, I've paid that amount in Manhattan.  But, it seems steep for Chicago.  Even on Wacker; *  Taxi cab shortage.  On a rainy, Friday night, the cab line took about 30 min.  It was reportedly this way for much of the afternoon / evening.  Really?  If this is the City's largest hotel (as they told us when we checked in), and it positions itself as a premium property, shouldn't it make sense that they'd have relationships with taxi companies to try and get better supply on occasions such as that?  If it's rainy, and a Friday night, there will be city-wide shortage - so, what's the contingency plan for your hotel patrons?; *  Gym.  Finding the gym was a work out.  In the basement and down a fairly long hall, and past grandma's house did I go.  Not central to the room areas;  and *  Lighting in large meeting space.  Much of the conference was in a large meeting room in the West Tower.  The lighting in there was not so great, and difficult to see the people speaking from the raised platform/stage.  Needs better spotlighting. I will say that all of the staff that I met were very nice, and willing to help.",N
3979,"The service here? Pretty good. They were pretty helpful, and not considering weird rules for the convention we were at, I'd say they were very nice. The rooms were OK, nothing special, but at the price, they were not up to what I expected. The food was GROSSLY over-priced, even for hotel food. The breakfasts were especially expensive, even the buffett (though the Oatmeal Pancakes were awesome!) The best part was the view, which the worst was dealing with things like poor elevator performance (this can be a problem at large cons) and a layout that was at least a good deal more complicated than I expected. Still, cost and food knocks it down a good deal. And there were spiders outside the windows. Giant. Scary. Spiders...",N
3980,"This hotel is hugeeeeee. Stayed here for my anniversary trip with my bf. Got a good deal thanks to travelzoo, $99/night? Hell Yes! Had an awesome view of downtown, room was spacious and clean. Had a working safe (a must for when I go on trips). The hotel was in close walking distance to Michigan Ave. and the River. We used the gym, it was quite a walk but I guess that's because the hotel is enormous. Overall, great hotel!",N
3981,Great location. Big size room and reasonable price. Just like any other Hyatt Regency in big city. This is where I usually stay for business trip.,N
3982,"My friends and I decided to meet up in Chicago for a weekend and ended up getting a room at the Hyatt Regency from priceline.  Not a bad deal for a pretty primo location near most things that you would want to do. So I showed up a few hours later than my friends and went to find the room on my own.  Be sure to ask which side your friends are on (West or East) as there are two separate buildings across the street from each other.  Naturally my friends were in the other tower so I had to truck it across the street.  But no worries, it is fairly easy to navigate. Rooms: sensor locks, HDTV, coffee maker, decent sized bathroom, blow dryer, etc.  Beds were comfy and I love the pillows.  The room had pretty thin walls - we could hear the neighbor's conversation and TV show through the bathroom walls, and people walking down the hall could be heard very well.  Just bring earplugs which, to me, is mandatory to get sleep in any hotel anyway.  If you stay up high enough you will have really good views of the city.  Oh and they have the blackout curtains like the ones you get in Vegas hotel rooms.  This is the BEST.  All places should have these. Hotel itself had a bar, a huge spacious lobby, a little market with Starbucks, ATM, gift shop, etc.  Cabs were easy to get and there wasn't really a line.  You can walk to the Pier and to the Magnificent Mile.  Nothing wrong with that. If you are looking for a great hotel location with reasonable rooms and amenities, you can do a lot worse than the Hyatt.",N
3983,"This hotel is kinda hidden so we had a difficult time looking for it, but it is close to everything.  Walking distance to Magnificent Mile and Millennium Park. The room is very modern and a decent size. Yay! Flat screen TV! However, the bathroom is terrible. I'm not complaining about the size, but the design is so stupid. Geez, can a girl get some counter space? While we're at it, can my boyfriend and I get some toilet paper without pulling a muscle? The toilet is right next to the shower so the holder was attached to the tiny corner between the two so you can't reach it. We ended up just putting the toilet paper roll on the floor.   I was also excited about a fridge listed as an amenity, but I opened the cabinet to find it empty. Sucked they didn't have free wifi either! I'll probably try a different hotel the next time I'm in Chi-Town.",N
3984,"Too big and impersonal. Also, they put a $70+ ""hold"" on your debit card for incidentals and CANNOT remove it until you checkout, even if you ask them to put it on another card. WTF?",N
3985,"We are big Hyatt fans and Gold pass members so it pains me to write this.  However, our experience as this located was below average.  The front desk is way understaffed.  They had a total of 2 people working on a Friday afternoon.  Needless to say, it took us 1 hour to check in.  The valet was equally bad.  We called down to have our car ready 15 min. in advance and of course had to wait an additional 20 min. each time we picked up our car.  Not very good service for $52/day valet. The room were okay and clean, but nothing special.  The only good thing is that the location is perfect and convenient to everything.",N
3986,"I love Hyatt! Im a gold member for a reason. You get perks if you're a member, such as late checkout, room upgrade, and free nights :) If you are a member sometimes they award you with free passes to their spectacular breakfast buffet which is usually just as fancy and expensive as the rest of the amenities. I have loved the Hyatt in any city I've stayed. Always very clean, and modern. This specific place was perfectly located close to everything. Of course with that said, it was packed and they couldnt accommodate us in our room when we arrived, therefor we had to wait around town after arriving from the airport until the occupant for the room wanted to leave. To make up for the inconvenience, they offered me and my mate one of the prestigious hotel's suite on the top floor. Too bad there were only two of us to enjoy such a treat because that place had room for about 4 families. lol it was def a good night! And there is a bar in the hotel, so you dont have to go very far If you dont want. Every Hyatt ive been to has been superb in all aspects; customer service, appearance, & top of the line comfort.",N
3987,"Better than I thought it would be.  In fact, overall, I really don't have a big complaint about this place. Stayed for a conference at the same time Lollapalooza was going on and the staff did a good job keeping the groups separate but happy. They added cell phone coverage to the basement conference-level floors which is a huge help so kudos for them for doing it.  The Big Bar served nice drinks and was a good place to sit and watch the thunderstorm roll in.   Other plusses? Good breakfast buffet. Comfortable bed. Downsides? Street noise (right near a fire station) and slow internet.  Lobby is a little bit of a mess with renovations ongoing.   Would I come again? Sure, if the conference were staying there. The problem is that there are so many other great places to stay nearby (eyeing the Radisson Blu) that its hard to seek this one out. But it was A-Ok in my book and a solid place to stay for business.",N
3988,"Beautiful and luxurious hotel. Central Location, within walking distance to Navy Pier, Millenium, and Manificent Mile. Huge luxury hotel. Expensive parking (but its Chicago). Wi Fi charge for the room but free in lobby on the 2nd floor. Love the connection to Houlihans at Michigan Avenue...open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Small Grocery store one block away. Sensor locks on the hotel doors. Booked with third party retailer and never felt like it. Ipod alarm clock, coffee w/maker, flat screen, and the most comfortable bed that I have slept in. In room-safe. Instead of the amazing riverview, I had the view of the Fire Departmnt and the amazing looking Radisson Blu hotel. Greeted by name when I made a phone call. Offered a free USA Today because I passport member....many conferences going on but did not feel crowded. Bar is a little pricey, but hey, it's Downtown Chicago. I was more of a Houligans gal with the drink specials and plate specials.  I have stayed at this property in the past and could never afford to at the non-third party retail rate, so I appreciate that they offer a gal like me, ""caviar and champagne lifestyle"" on a ""sardines and Tang"" budget. They will continue to offer this, I will cross my fingers EVERY TIME for the Hyatt.",N
3989,"My home during my first visit to Chicago. Nice staff, very clean and great amentities. The location was perfect for where we wanted to go. The room was a good size with a nice view. The bed was heavenly. And, don't forget to check out the Big Bar! I would give it 4.5 stars because there was no pool on site, but I'm rounding up because I wouldn't have had time to spend there anyway!",N
3990,This was a great hotel and we had an awesome view from our 19th floor room. It's in a perfect location only minutes from Navy Pier and all the other hotspots in downtown Chicago. This is a VERY busy hotel and the staff handles it perfectly. No complaints!,N
3991,"Excellent location: Convenient to Miracle Mile, Millennium Park, Navy Pier, Garrett's Popcorn, shopping, and the train. I mean, most everything is literally right around the corner. Gorgeous lobby - the layout of the hotel amenities were a little disheveled though. Also, in addition to no free wifi in the rooms, apparently there is a also fee required to use the business center as well -  the rude employee at the door made us very aware of that. All of the other employees were amazing... except that chick. Nice rooms and ridiculously comfy beds - so much so that I overslept for an outing with a friend of mine, geesh! I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the area.",N
3992,"Writing this review after a sleepless night so I'm a bit cranky. Bed was one of the more comfy ones, but the ac was excessively loud and the room dry, city traffic and neighbors noisier than what I've experienced in Manhattan even though we are on the 27th floor (thin windows and walls), and the toilet makes a loud squeaking noise each time it's flushed. As for the rest of my stay, pros were the views, the location, and the service. Other cons were - the hotel common areas were freezing in the middle of summer and the hotel pub stopped serving food and drinks before midnight. May come back if there is a great deal, but need to be armed with ear plugs, sweaters, and sleeping pills.",N
3993,"Just checked in (we'll be here for four nights) and the staff has been excellent so far!  Smooth check in (at noon none the less), comfy bed, got free internet with the word of the week and now we are getting ready to head to some museums!!   Looking forward to a great stay here in Chicago! I've stayed here before and it's always great!",N
3994,"Missing a fridge, otherwise would have given 4 stars.",N
3995,LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION Here during St Patricks Day weekend. Even Prez Obama was in town.. Great room rate via Priceline. Can't touch anything for less than twice the $$$. Too bad the Yellow WaterTaxi was shut down for the weekend. Crazy weather... no snow. People are running around with just shorts and t-shirts. Saw the Chicago River turn St Patty's green.,N
3996,"Tired, smells, bad restaurants, full of conference, avoid at all costs.",N
3997,"Was lucky enough to be put in a room w/ a fantastic view of the river and the Hancock Building.  Nicely appointed room w/ a very comfy bed.  Great location w/in walking distance of some stellar shopping, subway and Millenium Park.  Was a bit shocked at the $52 per night parking for my $40 a day rental car.  Good thing I had had some wine when I learned about it, the sticker shock just made me laugh!",N
3998,Excellent service and staff. Can't say enough good things about this location. Top notch for an event. The service managers are amazing and will bend over backwards to get the job done. Catering was great as well!,N
3999,"I was privileged enough to experience Chi town for the first time in only a one and 1/2 day/short stay for a work convention I was coordinating. Our event took place at this hotel so how convenient is it that we got to actually stay here? :) I absolutely LOVE the location of this hotel because it's right smack dab near all the best restaurants and touristy spots in Chicago. And since we didn't have a rental car, my coworker and I got just a tiny bit of downtime to enjoy a nice stroll downtown and have my very first deep dish Chicago style pizza for lunch! And we had this event in May so Chicago...wasn't really the ""Windy City"" that it normally is. It was like summertime. My room here was amaze-balls! I had a huge comfy King-sized bed all to myself and I remember the pillows being marshmallow heavenly snuggle bunnies. The bathroom and the room itself was very modern contemporary, just the way I like it. The BEST thing about the room was the actual view that I had. Such a gorgeous view of the city and the water! I also liked the bar they have here. It was a pretty happenin' spot. I actually enjoyed a few strong drinks here with coworkers at the time (mind you, I don't think I turned 21 yet then...sssh!). They had this HUGE fishbowl of a margarita that came out and after sipping down more than 1/2 of that, I was quite impressed with the rest of my stay. ;) I also like the promptness of the customer service here. Especially when ordering room service. They brought up some late night snacks for me so quickly since I was straight buzzin after that margarita. LOVE me some room service baby. All in all, a pleasant stay here. It would have been nice if I to stay a few more nights and explore. Oh wells, next time I have a huge amount of random cash rollin' in, I'ma make my way back out to this city and hopefully get to stay here!",N
4000,"Jennifer K., I don't care whatsoever about Facebook and and I certainly don't need to be blasted with Hyatt Regency ads the rest of my life to get some stupid deal of the week.   If Starbucks can provide free wifi with the purchase of a $1.95 cup of coffee, why can't the Hyatt provide it when folks are paying $195.00+ per night for a hotel room? AND my friends who did pay for wifi said it was extremely slow and not worth the cost. I recommend that you hire some consultants and get your network working properly. There are tons of hotels in Chicago that are right within the vicinity, for example, the Sheraton, Radisson, Fairmont, W, Westin, Marriott, etc.  It is a huge assumption on your part that I would ever stay at this Hyatt again, so, thanks but no thanks for seeing you for some special deal.",N

Mind you, it's 3:45 pm in the afternoon, and I feel no desire to get out of bed anytime soon.Their bed is probably one of the comfiest things I've ever slept on!!! This is a massive hotel right in the middle of Chicago. I got a great deal online and could not be more pleased. The only drawback is that they charge for internet, but if you ""like"" them on Facebook, there are sometimes free internet specials. Also, their business center is closed at night so that's also kinda annoying. Otherwise, nice large room, wonderful location, perfect location. I would highly recommend this hotel! ----------------------- UPDATE: I just received the sweetest gift of delicious toffee candy and a sweet card wishing me good trip from the Hyatt about 30 minutes after writing this review. Yes, I'm still in this amazingly comfy bed. It is certainly the little touches that makes this a great hotel!",N
4002,"I've stayed at the hotel multiple times with the most recent being April 7-8.  We booked through http://Hotels.com and received a king size room with complimentary valet parking for $137 including taxes (valet parking alone is usually $52).  I've also found great deals on Priceline in the past as well. We arrived early on Saturday morning since we were attending the Cubs game.  We knew the rooms wouldn't be available, but checked in and left our luggage at the bell desk.  We received a call an hour or so later informing us the rooms were ready.  We stayed in the West Tower and had a beautiful room with a great view of Lake Michigan. The hotel is always crowded, but it's always been quick and friendly service.  The bar is great with good drinks and food. We were checking out on Sunday morning, but wanted to take advantage of the beautiful day and bum around the city.  We were told we could leave the car in valet parking until 6:00 which was great - most places will typically charge for another day if you keep the car past the check out time.  The bell desk was very accommodating and even suggested we head down to the lower level and the parking attendants would bring the car around so we could preload and then park it until we were ready to leave so we could avoid the lines picking up our bags later. The hotel is centrally located - great restaurants, Millennium Park, Navy Pier and so much more in walking distance.  We also discovered the water taxi stop across from the hotel and took advantage of the $4 ride back from Navy Pier.",N
4003,"Booked this hotel using Priceline's Negotiator app. Payed less than $100 all in. Great deal, clean room. The only thing that sucks is parking. It was $52 at the hotel and there's a lot (that's almost impossible to find) nearby that's $32. But you have to expect that you're going to pay that much for overnight parking downtown in any major city",N
4004,"I have never seen such Small 5 star rooms and we paid a junior suite with no view.  Upgraded to another suite in West side of building, this one was much nicer and more spacious with a wonderful view.   The hotel has 5 star service, but the rooms are average and don't offer that luxury or classy feeling for the price (beds are super comfy).  Room service food was good, we especially loved our breakfast. Our room was quiet and felt like we were in a different hotel, until ppl checked in next door, we heard their entire conversation (luckily it didn't last long, unfortunately their snoozing of the alarm at 3am did). I would book again if I was a business traveler, visiting or having family in, but not a romantic (it was my partners bday) stay.  Also avoid Nataly at the check-in desk.  Shes a bit grumpy, rude and needs some sleep...but i guess we all have our off days",N
4005,"The beds are really comfortable, but that may be one of their only redeeming factors.  At 7:30am there was a really loud knock on our door that woke us up.  Confused, my friend got up and opened the door.  For some reason a maid decided to bang on our door and walk away.  Really?  We went down to the front desk and complained, which got us 2 vouchers for brunch at the bistro.  Their buffet was not worth the $22/person, and we would have been very unhappy if we had actually had to pay for it.  There's nothing special about it at all, but at the same time it wasn't bad.   The location is good, and the people at the front desk are nice.  It's also super busy, because it seems like huge groups on business choose the Hyatt Regency.  I only stayed here since my friend was visiting for the weekend and didn't want to trek back to my apartment.  In the future we'd definitely book somewhere else.",N
4006,Stayed here for my recent conference and overall not a bad hotel. Scored a great deal off Priceline. Standard room with a decent view if you're on an upper floor facing the city. The location is pretty close to major occurances in the city. The bar is open late with good food. Room service is nominal.,N
4007,"We bid on a room in priceline so we got a great deal plus this hotel was close to everything we wanted to go to at night so that was perfect. I didn't really expect much because I was happy just to be in Chicago. When we drove into the hotel, it look pretty nice and very big. First thing you notice when you walk inside is the hugh space that have and the restaurant right in middle of everything. We got our room and walked upstaire and it was pretty good w/a nice view of the lakes. Our friends got another room 10 rooms from us so we were pretty close to each other. I am glad we got to stay here. ***the only drawback is the $60 overnight parking but lucky we got the front office to waive that for us. Also our friend didn't have a good nite sleep because of people partying in the room next door but lucky they move room because the noise level was too much for them.",N
4008,"""The largest Hyatt in the world,"" according to the desk receptionist.  This is a fantastic hotel, definitely a highway robbery of a deal I got on Priceline at the last minute.  The gym is absolutely state-of-the art.  I would even venture to say that it may rival stand-alone gyms in many cases.  For example, the treadmills can not only estimate your BMI, they can also give you a rough estimate of VO2 max as well.  While this technology is state-of-the art, think about how often you see something like this at a hotel gym.  There is also a wide selection of free weights as well and plenty of TVs. The room?  Also pretty nice.  The key cards don't need to be slid through the door; they are just tap onto the door and you're in, which I've seen at only one other hotel (Flatiron Toshi in Manhattan).  I had a fantastic view of the skyscrapers from my window.  I noticed that by the bedside, there weren't electrical outlets at least by the tables, but you had great flat-screen TVs. There's plenty of food options that are available.  A Starbucks in the building, a small cafe type area and also a great looking place for dinner, though I can't comment on the food as I have never had the time to eat there. Check-in and check-out are also out of this world.  You can check-in with a reeptionist, or you can check in completely on a kiosk, like you're an airport.  The check-out is also handled on the kiosks as well, as well as a drop off box before you leave as well.  The doormen are very helpful and courteous.  If you're staying for business or pleasure, see if you can snag a room at this amazing hotel situated on Wacker and not far from Michigan Ave and Grant Park.  http://Hotels.com say that many of these rooms are at least $200 a night, but if you get lucky and Priceline it, you can get yourself a great bargain.  Perfect for a romantic weekend if you're looking for a good hotel to stay the weekend in Chicago.",N
4009,"Great hotel! For what we paid (Priceline, HOLLA!) I thought this place was a steal. The location is perfect, too! Chicago winter aside, it was within walking distance to Millennium Park, the Art Institute of Chicago, Sears Tower, and like 50 million pizza places. Also, there's a bar downstairs and it's called BIG. You do the math on that one. ;)",N
4010,"My review might be biased, based on what I feel is a FANTASTIC price that we got for this hotel on Priceline.  We didn't expect to get such a great location downtown for our budget.  Wow, this hotel is huge.  It's a little old, so the design of the structure itself and the layout of the lobby areas feel outdated, sort of early 80's high-end business-modern.  That was probably the biggest drawback. Seriously!  If you like to feel like you are entering a posh hotel from the moment you drive up, this probably isn't the right hotel.  Otherwise, the room was updated and comfortably appointed, no complaints there at all.    We were placed close to the elevator, so I was concerned about noise.  We didn't hear a peep!  Impressive.  We LOVED this location - right on the river, JUST off Michigan Ave. (which I view as a positive, cutting down on street and pedestrian traffic outside of the hotel), it was perfectly positioned to walk the river, the magnificent mile, and Millenium Park.  Will return!!",N
4011,"My boyfriend & I stayed the weekend 7/6th-8th for a small getaway before he leaves for military training. I must say I loved our room. We had a beautiful view, beds were comfortable and had some good carrott cake!! Location is perfect...near navy pier, AMC & Lucky Strikes and of course Michigan Ave! Good times!",N
4012,"For the price we got this place for on Priceline, this place was wonderful. One of the more centrally located hotels in Chicago that's still affordable (at least in the off-season). It's not right in the middle of everything, but it's just a couple blocks up from Michican Ave. right along the Chicago River. We had a partial view of the river from our room, which was pretty cool. The bathroom was probably my favorite part of this room. I really liked the backlit mirror for some reason. I know it was cold outside, but the water did take a very long time to heat up (both the sink and the shower). The bed was comfortable and the room was clean, though there was a small towel on the floor in front of the bathroom when we first arrived and one of the pieces of art on the wall looked like it had some grease/fingerprints on it. Not a big deal, but attention to detail could have been a bit better. The walls weren't particularly soundproof either - there was a baby that was screaming for a good hour or so in the room next door to us, and it was pretty audible. Luckily it wasn't until around 9am and we were already awake anyway. Although we did get a great price on the room, there's two primary reasons I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of four: $9.95 per day for internet, and $52.00 per day for parking. I know it's the middle of the city, but come on now. Also, the business center is only open until 5pm every day so you're basically forced to pay for the internet if you need to print something. The girl at check-in was nice though and in general we were very satisfied with our stay here. Hopefully next time I won't be bringing my car if I stay here again.",N
4013,Great room for the price. Room service was good. Location was awesome. Nice interior design and I especially loved the bathroom decor. Great mini-bar and nice conference room. I would definitely stay again.,N
4017,"I stayed here on St. Patrick's day, so I paid a little more than usual on Priceline, but it was expected because the city was a madhouse. We parked in the underground parking garage, and that went smoothly despite the huge crowds. We got downtown at about 12:00 p.m., and the nice front desk woman told me a room wasn't ready yet (understandably, because we were early), but someone would call me when it was. Now the problems start.  There was an area where we could leave our bags while we were waiting for our room.  We brought the bags over to the guy, who was very busy because the hotel was nuts, got a tag for them, and started to walk away.  The guy muttered ""seriously"" as we walked away, so my friend said ""sorry"" and ran back and gave him a $5 tip.  I was thinking that we would tip them at the end, but if he wanted it now, fine. We went out to the parade, had some fun, and came back a few hours later for our bags.  There was a different guy running the bag check area.  We got our bags from him, meaning we pointed at them, and he moved them about 5 feet to where we were standing.  He didn't bring them to our room or anything, he just moved them 5 feet.  We started to walk away, and this guy yelled after us ""no tip!""   Ok, I've worked in the service industry.  I realize that people want tips, and often depend on them.  We gave bag check guy number one $5 for putting a tag on our bags.  I do not think it was necessary to give bag check guy number two another $5.  Further, when is it ever appropriate to yell about tips at your customers?  There were about 1000000000 people getting their bags from these guys.  How much money is enough for them? That whole incident kind of ruined the hotel for me.  The room was fine, but someone needs to do something about that horribly rude behavior.",N
4019,"This hotel has a great location across from the river, just off Michigan Avenue (Magnificent Mile), and walking distance to other attractions like Millennium Park and the Navy Pier. The people were frantic, which is kind of annoying when trying to relax on vacation. A big negative was the hotel hosting a LOUD party in the lobby that impacted every paying customer. I thought this was a Hyatt, not a spring break hotel.",N
4020,"Book your room on Priceline. I named my price and got a killer deal on a room. This Hyatt is a symbol of luxury and fine hospitality. The staff are extremely helpful and will accommodate most of you needs with in reason. Check in is usually around 3:00 pm but since my flight came in at 10 they let me check in at 11 am and also gave me a late check out till 2:00 pm the next day (fyi: if they're not fully booked, they will do this for you as well). The rooms: extremely warm and welcoming with comfortable beds and a clean toilet. However I do wish there was a little more lighting available in the room. Food/Room Service: highly expensive. Michigan Ave is a block away and a lot of restaurant in the neighborhood so I would not recommend eating here if your looking the save a buck Parking: don't drive. take the cta",N
4021,"Perfectly fine, even with thousands of men attending IML. The staff held it's own.  Modern clean rooms, and loved the extra perks from Gold Passport Platinum.  The Big Bar was a tad $$$.  Hey, is it too much to ask for a GLASS when paying $11 for wine?  Plastic cups?",N
4022,Average Worn rooms No Frills 14.00 a day internet No free Bottle Water My room had a roll out murphy Bed -  ARE YOU FOR REAL?  My back hurt for a week after from all the springs. GETS SUPER BUSY WITH CONVENTION PEOPLE/ VERY BUSY HOTEL,N
4028,"Great location, good bar area. Rooms are nice & well-decorated. However, major downgrade because of wifi cost. Should be free",N
4030,"I am a 'frequenter' and after the 20th time staying here,  it's consistently ranked among the best hotels I've visited for: comfort, responsive staff and comprehensive services.  It is a HUGE hotel compared to what I am used to yet I feel comfortable here. Show Me: The Hyatt is very central, I can catch the El , catch a cab, walk anywhere and it's close to great great restaurants.  So I have the food situation down by staying here.  As far as visuals, my favorite places to walk to are Millenium Park and the Art Institute of Chicago when I  am here over the weekend- two stellar attractions in the city.  Downtown Chicago is about architecture and no where in our country can you witness amazing styles from Frank Gehry to Art Deco to modernist Chicago (I like to call it because I dont know the name, LOL).  I am not an architecture person but you cannot avoid admiring this beautiful city, the structures and how it evolved to an utopia of American life.   From atop and street level of this hotel you can witness Chicago during rush hour:  a marvel of orderliness and efficiency.  People queue up to get on public transportation 24x7.  Where in the world do you see behaviour like this?  It's not like NY where ""it's every man for himself""   The subterranean roads for trucks/deliveries  separate from city traffic is genius!  Whoever thought about this solution was way ahead of her time!  I am constantly amazed that such a huge metropolis functions efficiently day in and day out, chaos minimized.  There's still traffic yes but somehow rush hour 'feels' organized here. Stay & Work: Pan back to your personal space.  Rooms at the HR are modern, very comfortable but not spacious by Cali standards.    Be prepared these are Euro/ NY-sized rooms.  I've received faxes (delivered when requested), I've sent faxes, received packages, nothing lost.  I've requested printing services, messengering, even paper and what sets the HR apart is I don't get the ""No you can't "" vibe here.   Service is prompt.  I bring a data card everywhere I go so WIFI is not an issue. I can work here and request a service and in 10 minutes max, bingo!   Gym facilities are up-to-date and clean.   I love the workout/cardio machines here more than any of the other (""Big 4"") hotels  and depend on them regularly.  I especially appreciate who ever thought about the shape of the Hyatt gym towels, they're super long enough to wrap around your neck..... long enough to lay on a machine to cover the back of your head down to your back.    If you are concerned about hygiene at the gym, you know what I am talking about.    The heating/cooling systems are efficient and never had a complaint.  Hyatt is truly making an effort to be distinct.  They're checkin process is different from most hotels.  I feel the lodging experience here is about comfort and personal service. Leave Me Alone: When you hang the DND tag on your door, they will not knock even if its after 1pm.  The will expect  for you to call Housekeeping when you want your room to be serviced or not at all.    No accidental knocking from housekeeping.  In the morning hours, housekeeping staff tend to work in the background, unobtrusively.  I like that.......Lemme sleep however long if I want to! Feed me: Food-wise, I can order a perfectly grilled steak (not cheap) or surf and turf made in the same style as a superior steakhouse like Gibsons (a mile down the block).  Oddly almost any restaurant closeby, high-end or not, will deliver to the Hyatt, no extra charge.   I use my trusty Yelp app to monocle a restaurant closeby.   I've done this before a few times...........  in the dead of winter when there's absolutely no way I'm going out there!!!.  Not even to walk 4 steps into a cab.  No way, ah- ah....LOL! I can survive in this hotel without leaving it's premises. Visits:  20+",N
4034,"Pretty nice hotel. Attentive staff, expensive restaurants and they don't tell you but if you go to the basement of the West tower and go into the building next door there are restaurants and a Dunkin Donuts! Since we don't have one at home that was a real treat! The location is fabulous for so much within walking distance, and if you get really tired, which we did the last day, taxi's are inexpensive to get back to the Hotel. The only complaint was the water pressure which wasn't good in our room in the sink or the shower, but since this is our biggest complaint no worries. Oh also the lack of a pool, would have been nice for our child to be able to swim a bit, but I noticed that not a lot of hotels offer a pool o okay I guess.",N
4037,"The hotel is nicely located downtown, the cost is also very high so expectations are then high I have som complaints The hotel itself is somewhat dated You feel like you are walking into an airport or train station when you walk into the lobby They will charge you $52/night just for parking They charge $14.95/night for Internet, this is the cheapest and slowest package they have. The breakfast scrambled eggs were oh my god horrible ""almost powdery"". Their fitness center is shameful and there is no swimming pool. Given the cost and their approach of nickel and dime you,  I would not recommend it.",N
4042,"The boy and I stayed here on a recent mini-vacation to Chicago (for me, to get away from work; for him, to get away from school). We got a great deal on Priceline and stayed for 5 nights. We ended up getting a corner room with a king size bed on the 24th floor in the West Tower - beautiful view, big room, and comfy bed. I really can't complain. The staff were all exceptionally sweet and wonderful, the check-in process was painless, and we didn't have any issues. The young woman checking us in even made sure to give us a room as far from the elevators as she could, since those rooms tend to be a little loud. I liked that it had immediate access to the Pedway (though there's not a whole lot down there unless you know exactly where you're going), and was really close to both Millennium Park and the Mag Mile. Great location! We signed up for the Gold Pass (or whatever it's called) and got our internet for our entire stay free. It showed up on the bill - we were warned it likely would, as they had just switched over their internet system - and it was just taken off before we checked out. I really can't complain about our stay here. Everything was wonderful! We got our room for $70/night because we named our own price on Priceline. I think it's worth checking that out before striking the hotel off the list!",N
4052,"You had me at ""NYE""...We searched high and low, all over the cit,y and once we landed in your lobby I knew this was to be our final destination.  We search no more when it comes to NYE parties. You are the best of the best.  The hotel package includes a beautiful suite, friendly staff, and amazing room service.  When in doubt for a downtown Chicago New Years Eve package, search No more! They offer party tickets $199 or package for two with suite for $399. Trust that once you do New Years here you will continue to return.",N
4060,"We stayed here for the National Restaurant show which was in town. Yes the hotel was quite busy, but is that an excuse for terrible and downright rude service?? The only hospitable person was the guy at the front desk, Michael I believe who gave us a great room, he gets one star. Our room was on the 33rd floor, it was well decorated and had a great view. The bell men were beyond rude!!!! The only one who helped was Miguel who was very courteous, another star. When we tried to check our bags so we could explore the city, the bell men argued that there was no room? WHAT!? This place is huge Jesus open a closet and throw it in there! Whats worse is that we could see the room's interior which was only half full!! I really didn't want to tip this guy but i was obliged so i gave him $2 for my ONE piece of luggage and he blatantly gave me a dirty look! This guy really ruined my experience at Hyatt.",N
4093,rooms were nice but the hotel itself was toooo big and confusing. will stick to the small boutiques from now on.,N
4133,Beds too soft.  One coffee for two people. No place to put your stuff in the bathroom.,N
4165,"Great, well-trained, efficient staff.  Always on top of their game!",N
4167,"My wife and I made a reservation and because we were meeting a friend in town, called ahead and were assured that they would have a room for us with two queen beds. At checking, we were informed that this was not possible, but that we could have a room with one king bed or a rollaway could be brought to our room. We took the rollaway option so that our friend would not need to sleep on the floor and were told we would need to wait in the room until the rollaway arrived. After 90 minutes of waiting, I called the front desk and was re-routed to an operator who informed me that there would be a $25 charge for the rollaway and that she would need to connect me to the front desk. After five more minutes on hold, I was connected with the front desk. I was assured that they were very busy and the bed would arrive without charge. Pressing them about our dinner reservations that we would soon miss, I was then informed that if we did not place the privacy sign on the room door, the bed could be delivered in our absence. The Hyatt Regency seems unable to keep up with their current level of demand or is extremely poorly managed. We will not stay at one again.",N
4170,"The first room they gave me had absolutely no view, it overlooked the atrium and some ugly rooftop of the hotel. I asked to be moved  and they were very accommodating, which I give them credit for. However I have some major issues with this hotel thus far. The room looks worn and is not up to my standards for almost 200 a night. I ordered room service, and the food was good, but I had an issue with the service. I asked if the guy who brought it up if he had change, he said no. I gave him 40 for a $32.00 meal expecting him to return with my change but he never did.  Needless to say I am not pleased. And I also cannot seem to find any information in this hotel room on the amenities. The booklet on the desk has room service info, but nothing about where the gym is located, is there a spa, etc etc. I expected better from a Hyatt.",N
4171,"If I could give 3.5 stars I would.  Let me say, my fiance and I really love the Hyatt hotels.  We're getting married at the Hyatt Lodge in Oak Brook, and have their ""frequent stay"" card equivalent.  I was super excited about staying here not only because we were going to collect some points we can use for future Hyatt stays, but also because it's right downtown and close to where we were heading out to dinner that night.  I upgraded to a King Deluxe on a high floor, so we had a great view of the river and some of Navy Pier.  Our bed was comfortable and the room was dead quiet.  The bathroom was nicely upgraded and everything was very clean.  However, I still think the room was still a little too pricey.  I did add valet parking to my bill, which was over $50 for keeping it overnight (OUCH!!!!).  Also, I love ordering room service, but $17 pancakes aren't my thing.   Staff was super friendly, though, and checkin/out was a breeze.",N
4248,"I've been watching reruns of Boardwalk Empire and think this hotel lobby is the perfect place to live out my Margaret Schroeder fantasies (except for the making-out-with-Steve-Buscemi part, no thanks). First off, the place is massive! There's a whole shopping arcade in the ground floor level including the righteous Merz Apothecary. Ascend the glorious staircase to the extravagantly decorated lobby and admire the decor while sipping a cocktail at the turn of the century bar. If you're really feeling opulent, there's high tea on the weekends. The location can't be beat - it's right in the heart of the Loop, close to the historic Marshall Fields building (now sadly a craptastic Macy's). Whether you stay here or just stop in to admire this architectural gem, you'll be transported back in time. Maybe you'll meet your own Jimmy Darmody here....you never know.",N
4249,"Absolutely beautiful, elegant and amazing hotel.  Super accommodating and great views from some of the rooms. Here's all the details: The hotel is just gorgeous inside.  The main lobby area has a really high ceiling and you can tell that a lot of time and detail was put into this hotel.  There is a bar and lounge area which is just as nice.  This is not a modern and trendy hotel, it is an elegant hotel.   Service is phenomenal as well.  The front desk was so kind to me and understanding that I was freaking out because it was my boyfriend's 30th birthday and I wanted everything to be perfect.  I called to ask them to put some more ice on the champagne in our room because dinner ran late and they did, no questions asked!   The rooms are really nice and you can tell that everything is of good quality.   It is a large hotel, so sometimes the elevator may take an extra minute or the line to check in at exact check in time might be long, but it is all worth it.  It's in a great location as well, right in the downtown loop area.  Walking distance to almost anything your hear desires.   Take a cab everywhere that's far if you're from out of town so you don't get lost on the wrong train.  :)   I have been here for a wedding before and that was amazing as well.   The hotel is a bit pricey, but worth it.",N
4250,"This place is in a great location and is beautiful, but that's about it.  It is way too crowded, long lines at the check in and check out, people EVERYWHERE and really long walks to the rooms.  Riding the elevators in the morning took longer than my commute to work.  It is just a big hotel with way too many people staying there.   Oh, and my key quit working, which create about 20 minutes of logistics in the morning and made me late for the meeting I traveled to Chicago for in the first place.  Palmer House, while beautiful, has bit off more than they can chew with this monstrosity of a hotel.  Not a good place to stay if you are on business travel.",N
4251,"I would say just OK. Way too long of lines for everything, check-in, concierge etc. Bars close too early. Elevator shaft was next to our room so it was constantly making noise. Decent lobby but it is too small for the amount of people everywhere. Some areas near are a little sketchy also.",N
4252,"I returned last weekend for the Chicago Fire game. Our rate, thanks to the entertainment book you can buy from a local school, was 50% off. For Labor Day weekend, our room rate was $143/night, which was not bad for the location of the hotel (1.5 blocks from Millennium Park). The three stars is because of the bathroom. The bathtub drain didn't work! I had to unscrew the drain and started pulled out hair and a sponge clogging the drain. GROSS. I saw a bandaid in the drain too, but I didn't bother going any further. But worst of all, the maid knew the drain was clogged. When we returned to the room, I noticed the drain was unscrewed and left in the bathtub; we had left it screwed into the bathtub. So I thought, ""Oh good, the maid unclogged the drain."" WRONG. If it wasn't for the location and excellent service right outside the hotel, I would give this hotel two stars. The front door guys are very helpful with directions. They also recognized after our second trip to the hotel, and they always hit the open door button for us. That's service. The checkout process took 10 minutes, since video checkout wasn't working. The ""zip it"" line you call that states you cannot leave a message actually transfers you to someone instead of confirming automatically you're checked out (which is the impression I received). So, keep this in mind when it's a busy weekend!",N
4253,"This place double booked my hotel and gave me a voucher to use in a future stay oops, they will never let you use the voucher.  They always have space until you tell them you have the voucher.  Total joke I was just on hold for over 10-15 min trying to get approval again a huge disappointment! I would never stay at this hotel in Chicago and would let everyone else know that the management talks out of both side of their mouths.  What a total joke!  Find a better hotel anywhere but here",N
4254,"Got a great deal on this hotel using http://Priceline.com and couldn't have asked for a better place to stay while visiting Chicago. Our room on the 18th floor was clean, but the bathroom was a little small. I love that they use Peter Thomas Roth toiletries as oppose to generic hotel brands. The hotel is conveniently located in downtown Chicago near popular tourist spots (with the exception of Navy Pier), great restaurants, and shops.  My boyfriend and I did more walking than we did public transportation.   My only complaint was that this hotel doesn't have a complimentary coffee maker and you have to buy coffee outside of the hotel or the Starbucks in the lobby.   Also, be sure to check out Balance Spa & Fitness at the hotel if you want to get a massage, nails, and hair done for a day or  night out. Online booking available at http://www.balancespachi... There is a health club there too, but you don't get any discounts for being a hotel guest. Fee to use their gym is $10.  You're better off walking and wandering around Chicago if you want to get exercise.",N
4255,"The only thing this hotel can offer are elegant interior decors. Lots of room for improvement. 1. Took me 25 minutes and 3 phone calls to have a bellman help me take my luggage from my room. I'm surprised by this inefficiency. 2. As early as by 830am, I have a maid knocking on the door yelling ""house-keeping"". Seriously? People are still sleeping! 3. Now this one really kills me. We upgraded the room to be on one of the highest floors. Guess what view we have for paying the extra? Another building's firewall. Seriously? There's no reason for the extra charge if you get the same crappy view, just on a higher floor. 4. Walls are thin, you can definitely hear the hallways and neighbors. Not an entirely horrible stay if you're into interior decor. Otherwise, not much to expect.",N
4256,"The best hotel lobby I have ever seen!! Not many hotel lobbies can compare to the Palmer House lobby. It is breathtaking. An architectural masterpiece! This is my favorite big hotel in the country mainly because of the history, lobby, excellent service, and location. The hotel has three exits/entrances that give you access to three different streets so you are steps away from public transportation, the Berghoff, Millenium Park, and basically anywhere else downtown. The rooms are hit or miss. I have stayed in rooms that were updated and modern. I have also stayed in rooms that were old and dreary-looking. I will say that all of the rooms are very clean so that is always a major plus. The only reasons this hotel doesn't get a 5-star review are because they don't offer free wifi in the room (they charge $7.50 per HOUR to get access in your room), they charge $10 per day to use the fitness center even for hotel guests, and not all of the rooms are renovated. These are all major shortcomings of the hotel but I still love the Palmer House. The Palmer House will always be my preferred place to stay in the city because of the aforementioned benefits that this hotel provides.",N
4257,"This hotel is BEAUTIFUL! It has the most beautiful lobby and check in area I have ever seen.  Also because of this and the fact that it's historic.. it's incredibly expensive.   When you first walk in there is staff ready and waiting to help you.  It has an elegant entry way, 70+ foot ceilings, plenty of luxury seating, chandeliers, and golden elevators.  Even if you aren't staying here it is worth a visit.   The staff is incredibly helpful and the front desk is more than accommodating if you forgot something or need directions.   It is located right off the L and the parking is incredibly expensive.  What I did was park by Loyola University on the street for free (the campus outside of Chicago) and then took the L downtown.   The restaurants provided in the hotel are very delicious but expect to pay for what you are getting.  It's quite expensive.  There is however a Starbucks located on the ground floor that has normal pricing.  But it is packed in the morning!",N

4259,"Currently staying at the Palmer House Hilton during a conference and as old as this building is, I am very pleased with my stay. You can tell that the staff is proud of the hotel because every single staff member, I had the honor of meeting, was very friendly and eager to assist and the hotel is beautifully maintained. The lobby was exquisite...if you appreciated art the way I do, the art on the ceiling will have you walking straight while staring at the ceiling...needless to say, I bumped into a lot of people. Check-in was pretty smooth. Tyler took good care of us allowing us to check-in a few hours early and was happy to answer all of our crazy questions. Our room was on the Executive Floor. Key entry to ride the private elevator to heaven :) The elevator even had a bench for those people who are to lazy to stand lol. We arrive on the 23rd floor and excitement sets in. Let me tell you, Exective level is where its at! Snacks, soda, water available 24/7, Hot hor d'ourves available from 5-7pm, Complimentary contiental breakfast available every morning (not talking bagels and juice...Cold cuts, boiled eggs, plain yogurt, granola, breads, muffins, cereals, juices, coffee, hot oatmeal...sheesh What a spread!!), The room was very clean with a pleasant scent. The bed linens were plush which made it very difficult for me to leave each morning. Only gripe I had was it took me at least 5 minutes to at least turn on the shower each morning....I even had to call the maintence man one morning to demonstrate how to turn it on....he mumbled something about a German design...blah blah. Also, enjoyed a wonderful and filling lunch at Lockwood Restaurant in the lobby.  Try the Ahi Tuna burger and fries.....do yourself the favor, you deserve it! :)",N
4260,"The only reason this hotel is not getting 5 stars from me is the price. Normally my work pays for my trips, and did on this occasion, but I respect the folks out there reading this who may not be flushed with cash. This is a pricey hotel, and is probably a little bit more expensive than it needs to be. The building is old, and thusly, the rooms are not quite as spacious. However, my room did have an attached ""living"" room with chairs and another flat-screen tv, which helped stretch things out a bit. The lobby truly is spectacular. You come up from ground level by way of escalators and find yourself floored by the cathedral-esque painted ceiling and detailed architecture. Since the room was not ready by the time of check-in, the hotel offered $50 in hotel services for the wait. That $50 was used towards the amazing high tea they offer daily in the grand lobby - best high tea I've EVER had! Lots of food and you could also get a glass of champagne to boot. There was one gentleman with thick-rimmed glasses who would work the desk and he was just so helpful and delightful. He was extremely knowledgeable about the city and could provide both flashy and mega cheap-but-awesome places to go.",N
4261,Beautiful and well maintained hotel. Great ambiance and professional staff!,N
4262,"This is a historic, nice, and pricey hotel in the heart of Chicago. The good:  helpful concierge, clean, complimentary drinking water near all entrances, central location right on the El Train line, rooms equipped with mini-fridges, and beautiful lobby, bar, and restaurant. Could be better:  room size, price, and parking cost. Overall, if you are willing to pay around $170 a night minimum, don't need a lot of room, and prefer to be centrally located, this is a decent proposition.",N
4263,"This hotel is like the Waldorf Astoria of Chicago.  Its oppulent, its grand, its a Hilton, but its a tad bit musty.  The location is fantastic and the its huge.  The lobby is gorgeous too.  The housekeeping staff is friendly and efficient.  The front desk was hit or miss for me (one agent was less than happy to check me in, the other was incredibly gracious).  The rooms are nice.  The decor is cool and modern, but in line with the existing style of the hotel...sort of Hollywood glam (but in Chicago).  The beds are comfy...but my bathroom was tiny....I mean, extend your arms and you are touching the shower and the door with the sink in front of you and the toilet behind you...TINY.  Elevators can be a bit slow, even though there are like 10 of them...perhaps a few were in repair?   Bottom line:  If you can score a good deal.  Stay here.  I'm not sure I would splurge on this hotel though.",N
4264,An absolute stunning hotel. The details are superb. The staff is curteous and helpfull. I love the restarant and bar in the lobby. It has such great energy. The bed and linens were so comfortable. Check-in was quick and efficent. Our bags arrived to our room with in 5 minutes. The location is perfect right in the heart of the theater disctric. You can walk to everything including millenium park. We will be back.,N
4265,"The hotel was a good one.  The lobby looks great although I only spent time walking through it to and from my room to the city streets.  It is based on an older building so the fixtures and decor are of a different era which is a good change of pace if you're looking for it.  It has a decent fitness area although they charge for use of it.  Just a couple blocks front Grant Park with is good and close to a number of good restaurants.  When coming back to the city, I'll definitely will consider staying again.",N
4266,"This is a grand old hotel.  Grand in the sense that the lobby and common areas are sort of spectacular.  But it's like that person at the bar before last call....at 2:00 am after a few beers, he or she may look very good.  But peel away the beer goggles and the 10 you went home with suddenly becomes a 6, 6.5 tops.  Of course, I'm happy with a 4 so I'm not really complaining. Having said that, this isn't a bad place.  The staff is nice,  beds are super comfy, the place is very clean (though some of the areas are a bit worn) and the location is awesome.  This place is giant...with so many wings you may get lost going to your room.   You are very close to Millennium Park, the waterfront, theaters, even the Miracle Mile is a short walk away.  The lobby is truly breath-taking.  But it's not all lollipops and unicorns....the breakfast offered on the Executive Level is incredibly weak.  Oatmeal is the only hot food offered and the set up is almost aggressively inefficient.  Speaking of inefficient, you'll spend more time waiting for the elevators than sleeping in your bed.     I've stayed here twice and my first room was very tiny, but my second room was nice and spacious. If you get a good deal, it's definitely worth staying here.   I also think it's funny that the Palmer House is located a few blocks from Wacker Drive, but that's just because I'm incredibly immature.",N
4267,"I had a hard time trying to figure out if this was a good hotel, not good hotel, or a very good hotel.  In this instance, I'm going with the middle of the road because the negative and the very good offset each other.   First, we booked this hotel through Priceline for $140/night for two nights. I thought that price was pretty good for early summer.  It's located right near the blue line (easy to get to after you arrive at the airport) and it's between most other loop lines (easy to get around the rest of the city).  The place touts itself for its history within the city and the performers it has hosted.  This is to say, good first impression. Upon checking in, we were offered an upgraded room with a king sized bed for $49 more.  We opted not to upgrade and they gave us an upgrade to a queen sized bed for free-- nice touch!  Our room was spacious, though it had one chair, a desk, and a TV stand along with the bed in the sleeping area leaving it looking empty.  The bathroom was on the smaller side, but it had some nice Peter Thomas Roth bath products.  However, the bathtub was majorly clogged.  Sad.   Outside of that, the room I had faced east, and the room filled with sunlight no matter how tightly I drew the blinds.  It made it hard to sleep past 7am.  As far as the rest of the hotel, the staff and front desk were friendly and helpful.  Checkout was easy, and we were able to leave our bags with the hotel for a couple hours before catching our train to the next destination.   So, the Palmer House was nice.  I wasn't blown away, but I was happy most of the time there.    In all my traveling experiences, I think it's worth staying if you can get it for under $150.",N
4268,"The room I stayed in on the 13th floor was quite comfy. 2 of the 3 nights I passed out in the king size bed with various items (ie room service menu, cell phone, etc) scattered around me. The sheets were clean and cozy, the pillows aplenty & satisfactorily poofy. The room appeared recently redone in an art deco style. I can dig. No peeling wallpaper to complain about whatsoever, not even in the bathroom. Yes, the bathroom is compact to the point that closing the door is awkward. Not so great for couples hot hotel seduction, but I was here for a conference. The raised sink as literal wash basin on counter was obnoxious. Also low. I'm tall, quit annoying me with sinks at my knees please. I did not find I was lacking for towel-hangage space, though yes the toilet is like a space rocket. So, too, are people next door if you happen to be so lucky. Very thin walls. Like, hearing people's entire conversations over HBO at midnight thin. All that is redeemed by the Food. The Palmer club is turkey, tomato, Gruyere [chorus of angels], bacon, and a black pepper mayo on multigrain bread. With truffle potato chips. The Sweet corn soup has chorizo, is light, tangy, carries a touch of heat. And, oh, yes, Bertha's brownie. I know not who she is, but I am proud of whoever created this dessert in her name. The brownie, with its fudge syrup and nuts, was good. Maybe not as good as the chocolate ice cream that accompanied it. Definitely not as awesome as the chocolate mousse. Omg. Also, eggs benedict. Not absolutely mind-blowing, but pretty near perfect. Only downside to the room service is that the 'late night kitchen' closes at midnight. At first, I did not realize this when I returned much later from my romp around the city.",N
4269,"It seemed like a great Priceline deal, nice-sounding hotel in the Loop... until I check in and discover that parking is an astounding $62/night. The desk clerk says ""well after all, it IS Chicago."" I asked him to have my car stolen; after all, it IS Chicago. The walk to my room was reminiscent of the Big Wheel scene from The Shining.  The room is Grandma-fancy, along with Grandma-pathetic electricals circa 1983. Is that really a double bed? I didn't know hotels had rooms with just one double bed, other than maybe the Y. The room is clean, but tired. Room service shuts down at midnight, again kind of Grandma. I'm sorry - I am a guest here but I have to pay extra to use the fitness room? Barf that. Would I book here on purpose? How many stars am I holding up?",N
4270,"I really go back and forth between three and four stars for the Palmer House. On the plus side: - Beautiful Lobby - Friendly Staff - Good price for the location On the downside: - AC in the summer and heat in the winter is not quite enough for what you need - I ordered breakfast off the menu on the last visit and it took almost 45 min to bring out anything (this includes the orange juice) Rooms are fine and comfortable. The hotel is very large and the floors can be a little bit of a maze. Overall I would stay here again based on the price, location, and acceptability of the rooms, so I guess I will go with four stars.",N
4271,"We stayed here for 2 nights on a weekend trip to Chicago. Good location right off of Michigan Ave. Small rooms and poor layout (TV to the left of the bed) but we didn't spend much time in the room so it didn't matter too much. Nice bathrooms with Peter Thomas Roth products. The second floor lobby is beautiful. The hotel is historic without looking/feeling dirty or old. We booked the hotel through Priceline and weren't treated too great upon check-in. We were told we were in a smoking room and that it was the only room available. When we expressed our displeasure, he found a non-smoking room acted like he was doing us a favor, when really he just lied to us at first. This has happened to us at other hotels too, and it's something I just don't understand. I wouldn't mind staying here again.",N
4272,"Getting nickel and dimed is an accepted reality on domestic airlines, but now I can announce this trend has made it to the hotel industry, too. They have a fitness center, but it costs $10 per trip and closes at 9:00 pm. WTF? Others have mentioned the extortion they charge for parking. You might not be surprised that they charge for Wi Fi, too. The lobby is ostentatious, the ceiling more Staten Island than Athenian. The rooms are on the small side, ugly interiors, and no apparent thought to the arrangement of furniture, TV, etc. The elevators are excruciatingly slow. If you're on the 19th floor or higher you have a choice of 3, so you can imagine how quick that is. The bathrooms were OK. There are a few stores in the lobby. Location is solid. You can do better.",N
4273,"What a no brainer. This hotel is the right place for a family visit, a romantic visit or a business trip.  This is a fantastic hotel that has great charm. The hotel and service will blow you away.",N
4274,"I'm feeling slightly charitable by rounding up to 4 stars for our Memorial Weekend trip. I'll break it down. Where I always start... Bathrooms: This one was fairly clean - a solid 8/10 but it loses major points for being the size of a brook closet. It was difficult to get in and out of to close the door, and there was no good place to put wet towels after our showers. I'm smaller than an average size woman, and I had some trouble maneuvering. The updates that were done to the bathroom did give it nice modern appeal. Toilets and shower were extremely noisy. The middle of the night bathroom trip could have woken the dead from their slumber! Room: Decent size room for the price. We were told we had a queen bed, but ti felt a little snug for a queen. The bed sunk in the middle a little bit (I would assume with a bed that size that typically only one person would sleep in it at a time). Linens were comfortable and enough pillows. Decor was nice and looked as if it had been recently updated. I liked the modern color scheme. The wallpaper on the walls was peeling in multiple places. Seems like such an easy fix that just wasn't done. Location: Just a few blocks away from Millennium Park and Grand Park, steps away from all color el stations and a block away from State Street shopping. I have no complaints with it! We actually walked almost everywhere the whole weekend because of the nice weather. Overall, the hotel itself was beautiful. I wished they would have cranked up the AC a little bit more in their common areas with the highs in the mid to upper 90s in Chicago. And their lobby is on the second floor which I found to be strange and somewhat frustrating as the signage wasn't terrific when we were checking after walking with bags on a warm day. Plenty of elevators (they are split in sections of rooms which was nice for a building that size - never waited more than 60 seconds). All common areas were neat and clean, the staff we did encounter was quite pleasant. Worth the money we spent on a hotwire deal, but I'd never pay full price for this place!",N
4275,"The s/o and I made the Palmer House our home during our week long vacation in Chicago and although we only stayed for a week, it was difficult to leave behind...Chicago and the Palmer House! Location was key for the both of us as it would be our first domestic vacation where we relied solely on public transit.  With that said, the PH was just around the corner from the Red line and one block away from the Blue line which can take you to O'Hare...saving you lots of money on cab fare! Stepping into the hotel was a little was odd as it was a cold, stale looking interior until we took the escalator up to the lobby where a ceiling mural of luxurious art greeted us; eat your heart out Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas.  The lobby alone was rich in history and grandeur.  Check in was quick and friendly. There was just one elevator bank with eight cars, unless you were staying in the Executive floor and you had your own exclusive elevators to use.  Our room was located on the 8th floor, where the fitness center was located as well.  The room was of decent size and the decor although fairly newer, was kept in style of the hotel.  The bathroom was very small, but functional.  It could've used some ventilation system as it would get quite steamy during a hot shower so, we had to always prop the door open.  The room had a walk in closet and safe big enough to hold a laptop. However, our room did have a connecting door to each room on both sides of us.  One night, we could hear deafening cries from an infant in the room next to us.  I wanted to complain but I felt sorry for the parent who had to deal with it.  Then on the Friday night, we could hear music radiating  from the Ballroom (not sure how many floors below us) for a wedding or something.  But all things considered, noise wise, I would consider ourselves majorly lucky as we were placed in a room facing other rooms (Imagine a ""U"" shape, we were on one side of the ""U""), otherwise we would be hearing cars and the above ground train on Wabash. A couple other pros I should mention was the HSIA was complimentary, which is pretty rare for full service hotels, not to mention, the signal strength was excellent. The other pro was having a Starbucks on the ground floor. Overall, our stay was very pleasant and made our trip to Chicago totally enjoyable knowing we had a comfortable room and cozy bed in an amazing hotel!  Chicago was an awesome city and when we come back, we're staying at the PH again!",N
4276,"The location is super, just a quick walk to Millenium Park and a few blocks to an El that brought us right back to Oak Park for $2.25 each. We had scored a great deal on an Orbitz-type site so we decided to take a mini-trip with two kids (ages 10,12) to The Palmer House. Everyone here mentioned the ""wow"" factor of the lobby, which was lovely. But, the room, the view and the bathrooms were surprisingly ho-hum. Our 10th floor room overlooked a fire escape and the metal sides and roof of the pool. We couldn't see the street at all. The bathroom-aside from a posh sink-was similar to my grandma's. (No offense, grandma) Very old-school 1950's with old tile that needed a good scrubbing, old tub, very small. The indoor pool is small but it has a deep end that went to 8 feet and a hot tub, which the kids loved. We basically had it to ourselves at 5 pm, but by 9:00 in the morning it was near capacity. The only other thing we didn't like was the maid knocking on our door at 8:00 a.m. to ask if we were leaving yet. We said, ""No, check out isn't until noon so we planned to stay until then."" And she said, ""No, check-out is at 10:30. 11:00 at the latest."" We called the desk who said that it was actually noon.",N
4277,"This is an incredible hotel.  With an expansive conference center, a basement Starbucks, and nice rooms, the Palmer House is an incredible place to work and stay. They have everything from nice single and double rooms (I got to try a double room for 2 nights) to giant suites (which I didn't see, but I did see one of the suite-getters get a free bottle of water, so score there).   The hotel is also convenient to the Miracle Mile, Lake Michigan, and Millennium Park, so scenery. Overall, Palmer House is a massive win.",N
4278,"Stayed here while attending the IRCE2012 conference.  This as one of the 4 or 5 hotels recommended by the conference and also the most expensive.  Probably b/c it's located in the middle of downtown - walking distance within about 15 Starbucks in a 1 mile area! Location: 5 stars Rooms: 2.5 stars (thin walls and doors - so I could hear clearly the conversations happening in the rooms around me).  I paid $300 per night, but had a view of scaffolding into the brick walls of the building next door.  Probably still better than my coworker whose room faced the train tracks. Layout: 3 stars - it's confusing - multiple buildings of various heights and my 8th floor room had 3 different elevator locations I could take. Decor: Rooms are very dated (dated, not classic mind you) - well maintained, but dated in decor and layout. Amenities: 3 stars.  Good water pressure, bright / clean bathrooms.  But you have to pay for use of the gym?  That really sucks. Late check out will cost you extra!",N
4279,"Attn: Mr. Todd Temperly What happened to the GOOD OLD DAYS?  When Hospitality meant something... When you call yourself ""THE Palmer House"" you are creating a allegiance to your brand.  You are failing to live up to the brand that was built for you many decades ago.  The fact that movies stars of years past would flock to your hotel simply based on the name and the brand that was built on SUPERIOR HOSPITALITY.  The hospitality recevied by those customer is absolutly a thing of the past.  Unfortunately, you have failed miserably to accomplish anything other than outstanding luggage service.  What a shame?  You are actually calling yourself, ""THE Palmer House"".  Boo Woo Woo, you are embarassing THE CITY OF CHICAGO. Just a note on how our company's corporate travel policy works.  Each week we are assigned a client to visit for 5 days.  We're generally given notice sometimes 3 days, sometimes 5 to7  days and sometimes weeks in advance notice. We're given a budget for just about everything, air, hotel and car + a daily food allowance and other incidentals like dry cleaning, fuel etc.  As contractors WE HAVE A CHOICE!!!!  The key is to create a pleasant and enjoyable experience for yourself in your home away from home. I am a contract technical trainer for a company that employs 15,000 other contract trainers.  (Notice no large caps in titling as it is not that important to me.  The important thing is to get the job done, and I am proud to say we do that!!)  In the 18 months of nonstop travel week to week all across the country I have only experienced the feeling of being so belittled and unwelcomed by a hotelier in the hospitality industry one other time and they will not get my repeat business either. It is a shame that I would have to interact with your hotel front desk via phone and front desk managers via phone and in person (Kim over the phone and Vera in person)  5 times and miss my check in and revise the reservation 3 times to accommodate your staff in the handling of a corporate preauthorization to pay for my stay (at your oh so fabulous facility).   When I told the front desk manager to note that I would pay for the first night or two out of my pocket was a moment of insanity for me.  After experiencing this cavalier attitude in person, I recall that I HAVE THE OPTION TO CHOOSE.  Thank Goodness for that.   Thank you for giving me the OPTION TO CHOOSE!!!  I'll work as diligently as I can to stick with my normal policy of patronizing the local boutique hotels who live and die by their level of hospitality.  For example Kimpton Properties, YOU ROCK!!!     Vera, your front desk manager was so arrogant as to tell me she would have been doing me a favor in accepting the preauthorization.  However, as she put it, she couldn't even accept the preauthorization from me because it wasn't on 'your form' and the form wasn't turned in 1 week in advance of my stay.   I don't know if I received this treatment because I'm a professional busines traveler and you don't work with business travelers. I don't know if I received this treatment because I'm a woman busines traveler and you don't work with women business travelers. I don't know if it's because I'm a human being with a heart and soul that should be treated with courteousy and respect, an you don't work with human beings. I don't know if it's because I'm a black travelers, and you don't work with black travelers. The Palmer House is definitely not my kind of place.  Your staff is cold, cavalier and fails to provide a business class of professional hospitality.   Good Luck!!! cc: Hilton Corporate HQ 7930 Jones Branch Drive McLean, Virginia 22102  USA cc:Yelp.com",N
4280,"I stayed here for 5 weeks on a business trip. Had a total blast! The rooms were outstanding and it's in a great location for people who are working with businesses in the loop. Spent way too much at the Starbucks in the lower level, as well as the bar in the lobby. The architecture here was unparalleled. Internet not included in rooms and neither is the fitness center, which are both pretty big cons. I would definitely stay here again! Even if I had to pay for it myself.",N
4281,"Old hotel so the bathrooms are a little dated, other than that it's great.",N
4282,"I wanted to enjoy this hotel so much, because I love classic architecture and the location of the hotel is amazing. You walk into the hotel and the lobby is gorgeous, with an outstanding bar area and shopping area downstairs. However, after my 2 days I have to say my stay was completely miserable and at least Chicago had enough to offer to save my trip. The rooms are tiny and whoever came up with the design to put the tv at a 90 degree angle to the bed wasn't thinking very clearly. The bed was apparently a king, but definitely felt more like a queen. Now, a small room with a strange design doesn't get you 1 star, but watching an inch long cockroach walk around your bathroom at 7am in the morning after you wake up tends to ruin an experience. After spending 5 minutes smashing it with a metal trash can and STILL not fully killing it, your day just can never be the same. I went to the front desk before leaving for my business conference and the front desk person said that they would have a technician check the room for holes / infestations and would get me a new room set up. When I came back from work, the front desk had no record of me ever filing the complaint and no record of there being a cockroach in the room. So I had to retell my story and show them the picture of the massive insect. What scares me the most, is that how can you let a possible infestation just leak through the records? What if it was bed bugs (which if you google the hotel, clearly they have had issues) or something nastier than a cockroach? The front desk person went back into their managers area (for 15 minutes I was standing there waiting) and came back to let me know they had given me a new room further away from the elevator (as if that somehow means less chance of bugs or something) and 50 bucks in food coupons which only work at this EXACT hotel. The new room was nice and spacious, with a great view of the ventilation system on the 8th floor and a wall blocking anything else. To finish it off, I woke up the next morning with hives, either from something in the sheets or due to stress (I wonder what could have stressed me out). I literally and figuratively am allergic to the hotel. The rooms have nice amenities, but it can not hide the fact that the infrastructure is old and needs much better maintenance. The lack of customer service and hospitality, after knowing that I dealt with a miserable morning was also saddening. No way I will be spending another trip at the Palmer House.",N
4283,"I stayed here and the rooms were ultra tiny.. I couldn't believe how small they were... They were very dated as well. If you like being taken back to 1940s style.. Than this is the place for you. The lobby is grand and has a lot of character.. Service was nice, for what I used..",N
4284,"The Palmer house is the epitome of  posh and outrageous glamour.  The 60-foot ceiling lobby is dripping with ornate baroque decor: golden winged angels hoisting chandeliers, lavish elaborate carpets, marble archways, and full-circle velvet sofas at the hub of a bank of golden-doored elevators. The hallways of the rooms promintently display black-and-white photos of the stars of the ""golden age"" - singers, musicians, actors of all kinds grace the silent hallways. There appears to have been some renovation based on other reviews and the curtains of other rooms I noticed from my window.  My room on the 17th floor was quite lovely - art deco furniture, lovely colors, ""Hollywood-style"" decorative bathroom and closet door handles were a reminder of a past golden age. A few minor annoyances - no coffee maker in my room (big, huge boo for a business traveler.)  The buttons on the phone didn't connect to... well, anywhere (wake up calls, etc.) No free internet except in the lobby (which seems to be pretty typical these days.)  The instructions for the check out process are incorrect and you can't set a time for checkout.  So, I accidentally checked out when I wasn't ready to leave for a few hours (in conference meetings all morning.)  The phone operator didn't understand this predicament and kept forwarding me to non-answering numbers. Besides that, the desk staff and concierges were all very nice and professional. I really didn't have a problem with the hotel being on the second floor.  With a Starbucks on the 1st and easy access to 3 main streets, I was pretty happy. Having a martini in the hushed, lavish lobby was dreamy... We'll be back!",N
4285,"I will not stay here if we go to Chicago again. Rooms are dark and need updating. Bathrooms are well lit but tiny. You can hear EVERYTHING   Seems like the walls are made of paper.  I knew every time our neighbors went to the restroom & when they left.  Lobby is beautiful but does not reflect the quality of the rooms. However, the sheets & bedding were clean & nice (the only reason I gave 2 stars). don't stay here.",N
4286,"We loved our stay at the Palmer House Hilton.  The location is superb, quick access to all sorts of public transport (El, subway, bus).  The hotel has a great historic feel.  Rooms were comfortable and well kept.  Staff was very nice.  Lobby is a gorgeous place to sit. Being historic, the walls are a tad thin, but we slept fine, neighbors didn't keep us up.  Everything in our room worked well and the products are nice (Peter Thomas Roth) Overall, great experience and I'd definitely go back.  We booked with http://Hotels.com and the rate was fantastic, billing was quick and easy.",N
4287,"One of my favorite places to stay in Chicago.   Location 5* Architecture 5* Lobby Bar 5* Rooms 4* I love this hotel.  First of all, as a person that stays at the Hilton a lot, this works for keeping my Hilton status up, but that being said, this is an awesome hotel. The building is beautiful, with ceilings covered in paintings, reminding you of the glory days, where people dressed up to go out, and lavish lifestyles prevailed.   The lobby bar is a great place to hang out for drinks and watch hundreds of guests and even locals come to quench their thirst.  Their is a high end restaurant in the lobby as well, but I never did make it inside - it looked good. My morning Starbucks run was simplified, since there is a Starbucks on the first floor.  No, it wasn't one of those fake Starbucks that just serves some, it was a full fledged store.   If you are looking for a very reasonable hotel, located in a great location, you have to try the Palmer House Hilton.",N
4288,"The Palmer House is one of the most famous grand hotels in Chicago. The lobby on the second floor is gorgeous; there's lavish furnishings, majestic ceiling, and of course, impeccable service by their well trained staff. As far as location is concern, it can't be any better. It's in the historic Chicago loop, close to corporate office buildings, Michigan Avenue, the Art Institute, theatre at Randolph Street and State Street shopping. But come evening, this area can be a little quiet but walking north from the hotel will get you to Grand/Chicago Ave where restaurants and clubs are. The executive rooms have wonderful perks such as private elevators to the rooms and all day snack bar offered to executive guests only. However, the rooms are a bit on the small side though. The room that I was in, had two bathrooms but the bed took up most of the bedroom space. Despite that, Palmer House should be on your places to check out in Chicago, especially if you like grand old hotels. Be careful not to walk past the hotel though because I find it hard to recognize it from the street level since loop buildings are so close one another.",N
4289,"Do not stay there. Service was rude, they only provided a smoking room, refused to provide a non-smoking room, rooms were knob & tube, no free bottles of water, expensive food downstairs, and overpriced on the whole.",N
4290,"After reading some reviews about this hotel I was a bit apprehensive about staying here. But, I must say that the Palmer House was a pleasant surprise! Nice historic hotel with a great location near the loop and the Art Institute. The lobby is beautiful and retains a certain grandness that can't be replicated. Check in was smooth and the rooms and bathrooms were very clean. Housekeeping was quick and efficient...and Holy Margin Erosion Batman, FREE wifi. I would give this hotel four stars even if I had paid double of what I did. Looks like this hotel has deals going quite a bit through various travel sites. I found that booking directly with the hotel got me the discounted rate without prepaying the entire amount. When I return to Chicago I will certainly stay here again.",N
4291,This place is truly a gem...I stayed there and the reservation had gotten screwed up. The staff was extremely nice and upgraded me to the Executive Duites. Staying here gave us access to their free apeÃÅritifs. We also were given free breakfast vouchers,N
4292,"I stayed at the Palmer House for my wedding last weekend.  The experience was just fine, but not outstanding. If it were just me and my husband for a weekend, I might give it 4 or even 5 stars, because -It's beautiful -The rooms are lovely and clean, albeit a bit dark -Beds are super clean and comfy -Great location -Friendly, helpful bell staff -Great room deal However, I was arranging lodging for my wedding party with 5 rooms. The very cool and detached attitude by the staff left me nervous that my older/international guests would have problems with the impersonal service or that the end of my stay would be marred by a billing problem . We booked 5 rooms for myself and my wedding party and our guests booked another 6-7 rooms. When we booked and paid for the 5 rooms, I asked if any of the rooms had  a mini-fridge (for my cake) and the front desk agent looked past me and said, ""no that's an extra $40/night""  After spending $2500, I felt a little put out.  Later, I was checking a room quote for a friend and noticed that the rate for an executive level room was just $15 more a night. I wrote the concierge and asked if I could upgrade. I was initially told that I would have to pay an extra $40 to upgrade. Unless of course I cancelled and re-booked. I had to write 3 emails to get a response to this. I would have paid for upgrades for all the rooms at $15, but that was not an option. The final resolution was a free upgrade for myself and the assurance that the concierge was available to handle any needs I had.   I needed to change the names on a couple rooms and each time I called the Front Desk, I was on hold for 20 minutes.  Each conversation started witht he agent telling me they couldn't change it because I booked it elsewhere, then I would insist that I confirmed and PAID at the Palmer directly, more time on hold, and then changing the name. Finally, I emailed a list of guests to the concierge a couple days before the event, in case people got lost or had a problem with their reservation. It was met with radio silence. All in all, everything worked out. But it was nerve-wracking! Great hotel for a romantic weekend, but try a smaller one for a group.",N
4293,"This place is great and bustling with people. Staff is friendly so be prepared to hand out lots of $2 tips. The beds, bathrooms and living space was greatly decorated and comfortable. Amenities were good as well as in the nice pool lounge, Tea room and the gym was great. Be prepared to pay $10 each day you use the gym eh j the hotel fails to tell you over the phone. The hotel is very well maintained considering its age, and maintains the lavish look even tho the rooms ate greatly reduced on priceline. There is a Starbucks downstairs which pleased all of us in our party and it's not far from Michigan ave. great shopping and eateries nearby as well. I would def come again and stay. Happy hoteling!!",N
4294,"I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel,the location is awesome! It's in the middle of everything! On block from Michigan Ave,The Library and Museum all within walking distance.   There were no double rooms available by the time we checked in so a king would have to do for my son and I,they did offer a rollway if needed. We had a pretty large room it was a corner room with windows on two sides and quite a bit of room. The lobby itself takes your breath away and it stays busy it's full of energy. I will return and this will also be a hotel I return too.",N
4295,"I was able to get my room for $95 during St Patrick's day weekend and there is so way I could have topped that. The location is so convenient! The Art Institute is a 5 minute walk and there is so much to do just within a 2 mile radius. The entire weekend the entire staff was so nice and so hospitable. This was m first time staying in the loop and the next time I'm in Chicago, I will stay here again. In defense of the nay-sayers: -Parking is expensive but it is the loop in Chicago, so no matter where you are staying you will have to pay an arm and a leg. If you don't use the valet, your car is parked across an empty street in a secured building and it is a one minute walk. -The rooms are on the smaller side, but  for a weekend in Chicago, who really spends too much time in their hotel room? You still get a bed, a desk, a closet, and an extra chair. -The entire weekend I was able to connect to the wifi from the Starbucks around the corner and I was on the 15th floor.",N
4296,"Treat me well and I'll come back. Treat me bad and I'll yelp on you! Find somewhere else to stay. At check-in, I was lucky enough to be helped by an arrogant, entitled gentleman who didn't find it worthy of his time to share with me how I could find my room, where the pool was or even how to access the elevators. I couldn't even get the jerk to smile.  I didn't think much of it until I was checking out (more on that later) and heard another staff member graciously and cheerfully speak to patrons. Now, I have a lot of respect for housekeeping staff. They undoubtedly work very hard... but what I did not appreciate was 1) how late the rooms would be cleaned. I got back to my room at 4pm once and it was still in the state that I left it in 2) when I would leave my room in the mornings, how my housekeeper would ask me if I wanted my room cleaned. When I answered yes, she had to make sure I was certain of my decision and would then be disappointed. What the hell?! I get that it would be nice to have one less room to clean, but isn't that your job? 3) noisy and inconsiderate staff. Because the walls are paper thin at this hotel, I could hear EVERYTHING going on in the next room.... including the HUGE fuss the staff made about the room next door... at 7:30AM!!!!!!! Apparently, when my neighbors checked out of their room, they left behind quite a bit of broken glass and furniture. The staff cleaning up IN the room thought it appropriate to YELL OUT to other team members down the hall to come see the wreckage. I could distinctly hear the chatter, the furniture being moved around and even the noise coming from their walkie-talkies.... all at such an ungodly hour. Unforgivable. Plumbing was a nightmare. Not only was the flow from the shower head poor, but, if a housekeeper was cleaning next door and turned on the water there, my water pressure got even lower!!!! Did I mention that the bathroom is tiny?! Don't rock back and forth as you brush your teeth - you might just fall into the toilet! So here's my biggest gripe....an hour before check-out, I review my invoice and there's clearly an erroneous charge. I never dined in the hotel's restaurant. I try reaching the front desk SIX TIMES and no answer. I ask concierge to connect me and still no answer. Finally, 15 minutes later, I try again and get a live person on the phone. I explain that I never dined at the restaurant. No problem, he says, he'll remove the charge. Says I need to come down to pick up a new invoice.  I gather my belongings, head downstairs. A new staff member prints out my invoice and the charge is still there. I contest it and make reference to my call earlier. This dude says that there's nothing that can be done. In fact, because I didn't get the name of the person who said he'd waive it, I'm stuck. The charge needs to be ""investigated"". So hold on... I just spent over $900 staying at your hotel and you're gonna squabble with me for $17?!  Of course, I asked to speak to the manager. So Ms. Rasha comes out and says I should go home. If the charge isn't legit, she'll credit my account. I tell her that's not going to fly with me. This is my company card and each charge needs to be substantiated. I know I didn't dine at the restaurant in the hotel. IN FACT, I wasn't even at the hotel at 9:30pm last night. So she tells me, that 9:30pm must have been when the charge posted, I must have eaten there earlier and just simply forgot. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!? I tell her no, I haven't dined at their restaurant PERIOD. She offers to go through last night's receipts and get this, if the name on the receipt matches mine, I have to pay for the dinner. Why would I try to get out of a $17 charge if I had actually authorized it?!  She says to come back after 30 minutes. I go back after 45 minutes, and a new staff member tells me she's still looking through receipts. Fine. I go make myself useful and come back 25 minutes later.  The new staff member goes into Rasha's office, comes out, and prints me a new invoice without the charge. No explanation. No apology. Nothing.  I asked her what happened and she says ""The manager removed the charge. It was posted to the wrong room.""   Does the manager not know anything about customer service? Does she not have the human decency to come out and tell me this in person after she had me wait over an hour?  I ask her to call out Rasha and the latter comes out with an indignant look on her face. I tell her that I'm appalled by her customer service and thank her for inconveniencing me. Her reply? ""You're welcome"".",N
4297,"Oh how I wanted to enjoy my stay at this historical Chicago hotel. I really hate to write a negative review of this place, but I call it like I see it. My wife booked our room on http://priceline.com. That was probably our first mistake. We ended up getting a room that was fit for a stowaway on the Titanic. Our section of the hotel must have been undergoing renovations, because it was dark, dingy and not well maintained. Our room was small with a beautiful view of the fire escape and alley. To make matters worse, they gouge you for a $10 fee to use the fitness room. Not cool at all. I'm sure the Palmer house was the picture of elegance in the 50's. Unfortunately, the part of the hotel they stuck us in was dingy, poorly lit and outdated. I guess they treat their http://priceline.com customers differently. I doubt if I would ever book another room or even recommend the hotel to my out of town friends. Yes! It was that bad.",N
4299,"When I walked into Palmer House, I felt like I was walking into a movie set. It was so luxurious and beautiful. Grandiose and amazing. I paid a pre-negotiated rate for $85 and never was I treated like someone who paid a negotiated rate. I took advantage of an upgrade to a double room in the executive suite on floor 23 for an additional $55. The room was wonderful. I am a HUGE fan of two beds/two baths. The room had two closets, safe, bathrobes, a flat screen and IPOD clock. Amazing showers and pressures. The beds were very comfortable. The only thing that could have made the room better was free wifi.... HOWEVER on the exec floor there were computers available. Also on the exec floor was a bartender, free non alcoholic beverages, snacks, appetizers, and breakfast. The parking is ridiculous but we paid overnight parking up the street for $12. The hotel is next door to Miller Pub which had great food for the value and a wider variety than I thought for pub food. Location.....wonderful for sites and shopping. I DEFINITELY will stay at Palmer House again.",N
4300,"Amazing lobby! The room was beautiful as well but it's hard to compete with the splendor of the lobby. The only thing that was problematic was the wait time for the elevators every morning...you must plan at least fifteen minutes for this. We waited and waited and then finally gave up and took the stairs. However, twenty-three flights of stairs with luggage is not optimal.",N
4301,"Let's run the numbers on the Palmer House: * 2 Hilton staff at the check-in desk * 6 dudes with walkie-talkies in $60 suits, pacing the lobby area and leering at customers * 20 minute wait to check-in Bravo Hilton. I'd suggest that a historic Chicago property deserves better.",N
4302,"Giving this hotel only two stars breaks my heart. I have a big old soft spot for the Palmer House, as it was the hotel I stayed in on my first trip to Chicago nearly 20 years ago. Back then I thought it was the most luxurious hotel in the world and will always remember that trip fondly. So I was excited to go back, and there were elements of my stay that lived up to my great memories. Fabulous location. Gorgeous lobby and common areas. Unfailingly polite and cheerful service from check-in to room service to housekeeping. Good-sized, relatively quiet room on a high floor. Nice lounge with tasty drink selections. Three big disappointments, though: 1. My room, albeit spacious, was tired and dated. I was surprised at how annoying it was to have an old tube TV stashed away in an inconvenient armoire instead of a flat screen on a more accessible bureau-top. 2. Hotel wireless was expensive and slow. I don't mind paying extra for premium wireless service, provided I actually GET premium wireless service. But I didn't see any real difference in what I got for my $19.99 at the Palmer House than I would for free at any Courtyard by Marriott. 3. But the real reason for the two-star review: My bathtub was a deathtrap. I am not kidding. The liner had separated from the tub frame and was all warped and spongy, so every morning it felt like I was taking a shower on a trampoline. It kept me so off balance I had to shampoo with one hand while clinging to the soap dish with the other. I could not imagine being an elderly person trying to navigate that dangerous enclosure. It's a wonder someone has not fallen, broken a hip, and sued them. My colleague, who has more Hilton points than I, stayed on one of the renovated floors and told me his room was really nice. He also snuck me into the concierge lounge, which was very comfortable and served up great wines and tasty hot and cold appetizers. So maybe the moral of the story is...stay at the Palmer House but on a concierge floor. That's a solution I could live with.",N
4303,"Architecturally amazing hotel...this place is the epitome of the word grand. Some hotels are beautiful, and modern, which is nice...but a beautiful hotel with history and old time charm is priceless. The service, from the check-in staff, to the bartenders in both the outer lounge bar (which I loved), to the bar just down the hall inside the hotel is super friendly. The open sitting area near the bar is comfortable and welcoming. There are bar tables off to one side with iPad's in upright holders, for anyone's entertainment. Bonus...they lowered their valet prices, which is nice, since the hotel rooms are quite pricey. At least you don't have to take it up the yin yang from all directions. I can't forget to mention that there is a Starbucks in the building as well...this is a definite plus for coffee drinkers like myself. The rooms are a nice size, but most importantly...clean! I recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to experience a beautiful Chicago hotel with old time charm.",N
4304,"I was able to negotiate my way to a decent deal for a three night stay in Chicago at the Palmer House Hilton. It was my first time negotiating on Priceline, and I believed it to be a great deal on a long Summer weekend that would get me out of Cedar Rapids.  The Palmer House proved to be a great experience, and not just because its a Hilton either. After doing some research I found there was certainly some history to the location, and I have to mention that they have done a decent job at preserving it. I was given a room clearly meant for one person, partly because I told them it was just me and also because I didn't mind not getting extra space. My first thought after entering the room was more a long the lines of ""This is the most perfect 1 bedroom you could find""! One could argue that another perspective would be- ""This is an extra store room""! Don't get me wrong, it was a small room that I greatly admired...clearly for one person. Other than that, the amenities and everything else was pretty good. You do notice the age of the property at times, but it does sell itself as a historic venue in Chicago. The lobby itself is quite a beautiful! The ceiling tapestry, the swanky bars, and the excellent decor makes it a place to be on any given night! Definitely a great place for a few drinks with friends to start off the evening. The service was very good and attentive, although I hardly needed anything after my initial check in. And you cannot beat the location that the hotel is in! Fairly close to the CTA lines, and being right in the Loop is a big plus!",N
4305,"I love the Palmer House Hilton.  Love, love, love it.  But let me be clear: staying elsewhere in Chicago is not a live option for me, as the only time I'm in town is for a philosophy conference that is hosted at the Palmer almost every year.   I imagine one can find an equally beautiful hotel with larger and fancier guest rooms for $185 (plus $30 occupancy tax) elsewhere in the city.  But the lobby!  The friendly service!  The location!  The excellent lobby bar and restaurant!  The street-level Starbucks!  The free internet in the lobby (both floors) and the elevator waiting area of each floor! So I'm a fan, although one can see from reading the other reviews that there are good reasons not to be.",N
4306,"I tend to stay at Hiltons when I travel for pleasure for two reasons: 1) They are usually very clean and nice at all levels in the chain 2) A friend works for a property and I can get a deal. However, the Palmer House is exceptionally awesome.  Located in the loop only a block and half from Millenium Park its less then a 10 minute walk to Cloud Gate aka: The Bean which just mesmerized me finally seeing it in person.  I was a bit obsessed with it. The hotel lobby ceiling is amazing and the overall decor is great and the room was clean and recently remodeled.  The only downsides were: 1) No fridge in room (I am sure I could have gotten one of if I asked) 2) No Coffee maker in the room 3) No HDTV I didn't realize there were hotels without these anymore Also, the concierge Phillipe is top notch.  I had mentioned on Twitter I was looking on best way to get to the hotel and places to eat around there with good beer.  Not sure how he found my tweet but he did and within minutes we emailed back and forth and he provided me with great choices.  His service and knowledge of the area is impeccable. Bottom line is this is a great hotel, that is clean, nice and has a world-class friendly staff.",N
4307,"We were extremely happy & satisfied with our stay at the Palmer House Hilton!  We got a GREAT deal through http://hotels.com on the room rate.  The rooms were very clean and nicely decorated.  The location was perfect...we were within walking distance of everything (shopping on MI Ave, Millennium Park, Art Institute, Aquarium, Field Museum and train stops).  Also, the concierge was super helpful with recommendations for restaurants and directions.  The hotel itself is beautiful (the lobby is amazing) and there are lots of areas to sit and meet up with friends.  There are two bars located in the hotel...Potter's Lounge was our favorite spot to grab a drink before dinner.  There is also a Starbucks on the street level with has a lot of sitting area as well.  Honestly, a great hotel!",N
4308,"I booked a room for my mom as a surprise so she could come downtown and enjoy the night not worrying about taking the train home to the suburbs.  The Palmer House is old, but the rooms were still very nice.  There was a White Sox convention in town which I thought would pose an issue with noise/crowdedness but actually it was no problem at all.  I met her at the hotel with my brother and checked out the hotel room.  It was a pretty small room (double beds) but the deÃÅcor was really nice.  I liked the colors and the peacock themed decorations.  The paint on the doors was thick which showed its true age but all in all I think the room wasn't bad.   The one issue was the elevators didn't work too well.  We had to walk from the pool floor on 7 to their room on 15 using the stairs because we waited and waited for elevators and they never came.  My mom and bro enjoyed some time in the hot tub and relaxed.  The Palmer House is in a great location - centrally located downtown and near anything you could need in the city.",N
4309,Good place to stay and convenient to anything you want to do.,N
4310,"Beautiful hotel with a beautiful staff! I checked in at the odd hour of 4am, granted their computer system was down, but that did not stop them from providing me with my room immediately and making sure i was completely satisfied. The room i was in was perfect! I have never felt so comfortable in a hotel bed. 4 pillows of heaven were surrounding me! After catching up on my sleep I got ready for the day. The concierge gave me 20% off at Macy's, after I told her that i felt like shopping. The hotel doorman got me a cab immediately and soon enough i was knee deep in the shoe department at Macy's! I could go on and on about how wonderful this experience was but its too much to re-cap on! A++ I will return!",N
4311,"So so nice. The staff was professional and wonderful, room service was prompt and delicious, the lobby was magnificent. The only thing I missed was a coffee maker in the room, but with Starbucks in the lobby, it all worked out. I didn't like having to pay $16 for wifi every day or pay to use the gym. If they weren't nickle and diming me, I would easily give this hotel 5 stars.",N
4312,"Wonderful, venerable Chicago hotel.  Stayed here for three nights in early June.  Great location near Millenium Park, Grant Park, Michigan Avenue, the works.  Not exactly a steal of a deal but not too bad for a solid downtown hotel.",N
4313,"Experience a part of the rich cultural history Chicago has to offer by staying at the Palmer House. There are tours of the facility available, but simply walking around and taking in the beautiful architecture and style of the hotel is a memorable experience.  The lobby alone is worth just walking through if you're passing along the street.  Grab a drink and sit a spell, you probably won't regret it.  This is Chicago - live a little! It's an upscale property, but look for seasonal specials if budget is going to be an issue. The rooms are beautiful and surprisingly spacious (our room even included a walk-in closet), and tastefully appointed. There are iPods available for guest use in the lobby for internet browsing, express check-out, even reservations. The location of the property great and walking distance to the Art Institute of Chicago - also a highly recommended place to visit if you haven't before.",N
4315,"Rooms are super small and the service is eh... I've stayed at quite a few hotels and this one got me irked enough to jump on Yelp for a review. (1) I called before my flight to put my wife on the reservation since I was coming in 4 hours after her. They assured me this was done even after I asked them how they would do it since they didn't ask for her name. They take the name but I am skeptical. I land in Chicago and sure enough, my wife has been wandering around in 30* weather like a hobo in California clothing. They apologize but that's about it. (2) The guy at the desk was a smart ass. He asks for my ID, I give it to him. He then asks if I go by an alias, I tell him I use my nickname (DJ R***) often (my name is D*** R*** Jr). He finally says, OK, why are you using a different name? I'm a nice guy and will accept it, but most hotels will not. Really? I've been traveling frequently for the better part of 10 years and have never had a problem. (3) I get to the room and damn near hit the bed with the door... THE ROOM IS THAT SMALL. Heel to toe (size 13 show) 4 steps to the door from the bed and 1.5 steps from the wall to the bed on the other side. ARE YOU SERIOUS? Yeh, they put a desk but it's so close to the foot of the bed that it's more intrusive than useful. There is a dresser and TV but it's tucked in a corner rendering the TV unwatchable. (3) The bathroom is tiny and using the toilet necessarily puts you into the wall. When I got here, I immediately started looking at other hotels (like the Wit where I stayed a couple months ago) but was talked down by my exhausted wife. I wanted to complain and probably will... never again Palmer House, never again.",N
4316,"The lobby deserves a 5, but the rooms have a Hilton feel to them.  I loved hanging out in the lobby with a drink (and scoring the only wifi I could get).  Service was really good tho once they forgot about my order and, to apologize, brought me a free glass of wine as well as a little snack, and the manager came out to apologize.  I wasn't even upset, I just reminded them that they didn't bring my order.   My room was quiet and well-appointed with a large closet, but the lobby looms large in my memories.",N
4317,"The Palmer House is very beautiful and has an impressive lobby- so 1st impressions were great!  The restaurant and bar in the lobby looked great, although we never ended up dining there.  Location was fantastic, we walked everywhere and found great sites and restaurants.  $250 a night was about right for the cost per night, much higher and it wouldn't be worth it. Our check in was great, the staff person was fantastic, offering us great food recommendations and was very friendly.   He offered us the option to upgrade to the executive tower/room.  It was $45 more per night, it included a bigger room, that didn't look straight at another building, a DVD player, WiFi, and the executive lounge that offered free continental breakfast each day, non alcoholic beverages throughout the day and happy hour appetizers and snacks each night.  We went for it and I think it was worth it.  The room was comfortable, the lounge was great to pop into to grab a drink or snack.  It would have been better if a drink or two was also included, but the bar was open from 3-11 each night, so it was nice to have access to that.   The executive floors have their own ""express"" elevators, a business center and some cozy couches/chairs with TV's. The only downside that I can mention is that they ""concierge"" was non responsive and even when we left a message on their line, we were NEVER called back.  Really?  That seemed strange.  But we let it go.  Also, the maids were not the greatest.  They made the bed but failed to take our breakfast dishes (they just left them all on the tray), and they didn't change out our towels, instead, just folded them back up and replaced them (we could tell, because one of them had corn flakes on it from a spill we had earlier).",N
4318,"Over all it was a nice hotel, but nothing special in my opinion. The hotel appears to be fairly classy with a swanky lobby. The hotel floors are reminiscent of a maze, having to pay close attention to signage in order to get to and fro. The rooms are nothing to write home about, at least the standard room. 2 beds, dresser, closet, tv, etc. The bathroom was exceptionally small, but it is an old building, so I'll over look it. During my stay I didn't try the either the bar or restaurant, but it is close to plenty of other options one can choose to eat and drink at.",N
4319,"Two weeks ago I celebrated my birthday in Chicago and had the great fortune of staying at the Palmer House Hilton for five days. There are many adjectives that I could use to describe the Palmer House but the words elegant and character are at the top of my list. This is an absolutely terrific hotel and if you have never stayed there, at least do yourself the favor of dropping by for a drink or lunch. This hotel has it all and the overall rating of three and a half stars on Yelp is ridiculous. I have travelled the world and if this is not at least a four star hotel then I do not know what is. From time to time unfortunate things happen, but some of the reviewers gave this hotel one star. Really, one star, are you kidding me? This is what one would consider to be a ""grand"" hotel. The second floor lobby is exquisite. The furniture is lavish, the ceiling will invite Sistine Chapel comparisons (ok, I am exaggerating), and the famous Empire Room will make you say ""Wow"" out loud. The hotel is replete with beautiful pictures of the great performers that once performed in the Empire Room. I saw pictures of Jack Benny, Pearl Bailey, and the most beautiful picture of Dorothy Jean Dandridge I have ever seen. Make sure that you take the time to see all of the beautiful black and white pictures. The second floor lobby also has free internet and plenty of tables and chairs if you want to avoid the internet fee, which, by the way, was very reasonable. My room was beautiful and classy. The bathroom was old-fashioned yet bright and the Peter Thomas Roth toiletries added a nice touch. The color combinations used on the curtains and bed linens made the room look elegant and I immediately felt that I received a bargain. The service was amazing. A very classy lady named Tatyana from Bulgaria checked me in. I told her I was excited to be there for my birthday and after a brief chat she upgraded my room. Two days later when I returned for the evening there was a nice bottle of wine with a wonderfully hand-written note thanking me for visiting and wishing me a happy birthday. I thought it was so cool that I saved the cork and the card is part of my screen saver collection. Efficiency accompanied by courtesy is a rare combination in today's world. The courtesy extended by Tatyana was impressive because of its rarity and its genuineness. The hotel is centrally located near the blue and red subway lines obviating the need for you to take a cab from Chicago's O'Hare airport. You can walk to Millennium Park, the Navy Pier, The Chicago Art Institute and there are good restaurants nearby like ""The Gage,"" the upscale ""Russian Tea Time"" or casual Bennigans. For your morning coffee go around the corner and have Dunkin Doughnuts! This is a fantastic hotel and I look forward to spending my next birthday there!",N
4320,"I will never ever ever again set foot in this hotel ever again.   I don't even know where to begin. I came here in hopes for a relaxing spa day with my girls.  I know parking is crazy expensive in the loop, but they have 24 hour valet which is much cheaper so its fine right? No.  I get to the front and the bell man says no valet.... I point the sign that says 24 hour valet in confusion.... man says no... and i think to myself- WTF? ??  so... I end up having to park in some garage across the street and the bell man assured me I could get my parking validated. So fine.   The elevators are SO small.. and old... and seriously I thought I was gonna get stuck in one.  But that is not why I am giving this hotel 1 star.  I am giving this hotel 1 star because I have never experienced such nasty service at any other hotel before. I had to get my parking validated after our time at the spa.  The spa sent me downstairs.  First I got to the concierge.  They can't validate it.  So then I am sent to the front desk... There's a crazy line of people checking in so I thought - well- validation takes 30 seconds so let me just ask someone to validate it.  I go up to someone real quick and ask politely... he responds with a sarcastic rude tone- ""you want validation??? stand in line and you'll get it""   Are you kidding me? I did not respond because I just didn't know what the beep to say to his rude a$$.  How do you seriously talk to a customer like that???  I'm still in disbelief.  Then I stand in line.  After 15 minutes, I finally get to someone and ask him to validate it.  He informs me that since I was not a guest at the hotel, I cannot be validated.  I told him about their valet service not working and he said that its not working today bc the president was at their hotel the day before- what does that have to do with anything?!?! I told them the bell man dude in the front of the hotel said I could be validated, but again I got attitude from this front desk guy.  Then I told them that the spa said the front desk could validate me-- he said go back up to the spa so they can validate me-- but hello they are the ones that sent me downstairs!?  He said he needs proof from the spa... I offered to show him my receipt from the spa but he wasn't having it.  I mean, did I look like a young illiterate teenage punk to these people or something? I'm a freakin 30 yr old physician. WTF. I have NEVER experienced this type of stupidity and crappy service and disrespect of customers from any hotel in chicago before-- not the elysian, not the intercontinental, not affinia, not sofitel, not the W, not the Wit, not the Dana, not the Amalfi, not the Trump, not even the freakin comfort suites!  And also, I kind of was a guest at the hotel--- how bout the fact that I was a guest at the hotel's sorry excuse of a spa and each of my friends got 2 services done and we spent half a freakin day at this crap hotel.  I was fuming but left.  Got to the parking garage and saw that I had to pay 30 some bucks for parking, which would have been around $14 or less if they had their ""24 hour valet service"" working, OR would have been zero dollars if validated.  That's just not the point tho, I have money to spend, but after the responses and attitude I got from these highly untrained workers, it was just really disappointing.   There is SOOOO much more to this story but I have lost the energy to tell any more of it.  All I know is that for a hotel to make themselves out to be so prestigious, they sure do treat their guests like dirt.  I will NEVER be back here.  I would never recommend this backward hotel to anyone ever. OH- and their SPA SUCKS btw.  NEVER AGAIN... stick to the Elysian (Waldorf Astoria) people.",N
4322,"Good located, large hotel with all the service you need. Stayed there on  a business trip and did badly miss the free wifi - come on, that is a must! you loose a star on that one. But the hotel gets the back from the very helpfull Congolese.",N
4323,"Bedbugs! We stayed here for a week but found a bedbug the first night. We demanded they move us to a different room on a different floor and wash/dry clean all our stuff, which they did. But they didn't even offer a discount on the room! Besides the bedbugs, the room generally was run down and didn't feel clean. Would never stay here again.",N
4333,"So I didn't say here, I just attended a conference.  As far as conference facilities go it seemed nice.  The rooms were generally clean, there were clean glasses and water for the discussants.  When there was a coffee bar set up, it was replenished.  Same with food at receptions.  Over all it seemed on par with what I would expect from a hotel's service during a conference.",N
4334,"I stayed at the Palmer House for a couple of days last week. The hotel is old and beautiful. The rooms are on the small size for the price. I had to close the bathroom door to get to the mirror. The location is great for access to State St. and nearby restaurants and shopping. I was not overly impressed with the hotel food service, but the hotel staff was very friendly. The cleaning lady for my floor asked my how my day was going and if i needed anything. The room was clean and well kept.",N
4339,"I've stayed at many Hilton properties.  This one is good, but definitely dated. The biggest complaint is the bathroom. It was remodeled but the sink was so small that I could hardly find room for my razor and toothbrush.  Also, the view from my room was non-existent. A wall.  That said, the bed was comfortable and the normal Hilton Honors perks were provided.  It just doesn't excel in any category.",N
4347,"Location is great.  I got upgraded to an exec room where you take a special elevator, it made me feel cool, so maybe that's why I give 5 stars :)  The inside is very pretty and fancy and the rooms are your standard hilton type rooms which are nice.",N
4348,Beautiful hotel even if the executive rooms are a bit small.. just adds to the charm!,N
4350,"Do you like small, confined areas? I have a deep appreciation for the Palmer House for its historical significance, but not for the insignificance of the size of the rooms. The interior of this hotel is something to truly marvel at. The rooms are small, so get ready to get packed in if you are staying here or plan on spending your time outside of your room. The hotel is in close proximity to most everything downtown, so you will not have trouble getting around. I'd suggest stopping for a drink at Potter's or dinner at Lockwood restaurant, but not actually staying at the hotel.",N
4353,Beautiful hotel. Perfectly located. The rooms although stunningly decorated are a bit small. This is a hotel to visit if you want the extravagant atmosphere. It is very large and although there are many entrances and exits (it covers an entire block) it is a bit like being a hotel hostage. There is a starbucks and many other shops to enjoy which is nice.,N
4357,"Went here for tea.  We had a groupon.  Of course, who doesn't go ga-ga over the lobby at the Palmer house!  What a beaut!  So we sat up on the sort of balcony and had a tray of finger sandwiches served to us.  Most were really good.  The tea was a nice selection.   I got an excellent pot of jasmine tea.  Then we got a tray of delicious desserts.  We were stuffed by the time we left.  Nice ambiance, nice food.  Fun!",N
4360,"Really nice hotel. One block from Millenium Park. We stayed here for 2 nights and it was a really convenient location. Close to a bunch of subway stops. In the Theatre District, you will be able to soak up a lot of history just walking around the hotel itself. The hallways are filled with pictures of performers from days gone by. The furniture is all really nice and fits the decor of the hotel. There's a couple restaurants that we did not get to try, but I'm sure they're pretty good. I'm sure they're probably pretty expensive as well. All the staff was really nice and would not hesitate to stay here again.",N
4362,"The lobby is gorgeous and was beautifully decorated for the holiday season. great location, central to many things and easy to get around on foot. you have to pay for parking, which is about $20 a nite, which adds up. the hotel rooms arent as grand as the outside of the hotel. the first nite, we had problems with the bathroom sink. but the beds are comfy. there's a starbucks down below.",N
4363,"We recently hosted our daughter's wedding at the Palmer House Hilton, in their Honre Ballroom.  Jane Himmel, Senior Catering Manager, is unequaled in her professionalism.  The event was wonderful thanks to her guidance and the food was out of this world!  Everything was handled from the beginning and we were able to enjoy the event, confident that all the details would be handled.",N
4393,"No one can question the beauty of this location, but when trying to get some sleep for the 1 night of vacation that I had, I was woken twice by the noisy drunks in the hall. No, Palmer House is not responsible for their behavior, but they are responsible for the entirely non-soundproof doors!   Beds were lovely, tv was very nice, etc, but there were a couple things that were broken in the bathroom.",N
4394,"I am so disappointed by this hotel. The rooms are small, the food is bad, and the lighting is fluorescent. All of which I was willing to overlook until I tried to get a bottle of water. There are no mini-bars in the rooms, the vending machines on my floor were all broken, room service wanted to charge me $10 for a single bottle of water, and when I called the front desk to complain they said that I could go down 12 floors to get a bottle of water from them if I wanted one. Water should not be so hard to come by.",N
4467,i was pleasantly surprised that i had fun at the nye party - i was expecting it to be overcrowded and the bartenders to be skimpy on the drinks. but we had a great time! beautiful building.,N
4475,"Let me start by saying we got our room for free for the weekend because I had free night certificates from Hilton.  Upon arriving, we valeted the car but got no assistance with our bags or the door for that matter.  There was plenty of staff waiting to help us at the desk.  They let us check in way early for their policy, but put us in a room where I could touch the tub, sink, toilet, and door all at the same time.  Maybe I don't quite appreciate the history of the place, but this was ridiculous.  I called and they moved us to another room in about an hour.  Not too shabby considering it was free; however if I were a paying customer I would have been disappointed.  The executive lounge was great and we enjoyed snacks and breakfast there, but I didn't appreciate the pretentious lady at the desk up there who looked at us like we didn't belong when asking for a map of the area.  GET OVER YOURSELF!  The second day we waited for over 30 mins for the car- only to figure out that they had forgot to go get it!  No biggie if it's nice out, but quite a different story when its 20ish. We did enjoy our stay, but like I said, if we were paying the normal rate, we would have been disappointed.",N
4489,"My friends and I attended the New Year's Eve party here yesterday. I had never been inside the place before then but had heard great things about it from friends. The lobby area is very ornate and elegant. It literally feels like you're walking into a gold mine or something. The rooms are a different story, however. It was very small, the beds were full size, which is something I had never seen in a [Hilton] hotel before. The bathroom has the be the smallest bathroom I've ever seen in my entire life. One person couldn't really be in there comfortably, forget about having two! Motel 6 has bigger bathrooms than this. The lighting is super poor and the view was terrible. What really turned me off was the staff at the hotel did not allow alcohol in the rooms. They made up some BS about licensing agreements and other legal mumbo jumbo, but really it was just an excuse for them to get more money out of people, because they said if they found alcohol in a room they were going to charge a ""cork fee"" of $60 per bottle. So, you're meaning to tell me that after already paying for a night in your hotel, plus paying to go to the party, you're going to charge me for having liquor that I PAID FOR MYSELF??? I don't think so! If I come back here, it won't be to stay. The event itself was very nice and the restaurants and lounges seemed posh, so I'd come back for those.",N
4498,"I booked this room for New Years Eve  a month ahead of time.  For the price I paid I believe I got a great room with a 32in LG LCD.  The location is excellent being at the center of everything and the room's were cozy but still comfortable.  The King sized bed was soft but was still able to get my full 8 hours and I own a Tempurpedic King at home.  The room size was more than what my girlfriend and I needed.  The only thing that was not so great was the view but that could be from my specific part of the building I was at.  I could not hear my neighbors and I know that my entire floor was booked.  I had excellent customer service from the front desk.  Beautiful lobby!  The security at night was tight but this was understandable since it was New Years Eve.  I just showed them my key card  and was let in no problem.  There so was much anger for those not allowed back in without cards.  They seemed to have quite large egos and made huge scenes as if they were not allowed on a life boat during the sinking of the Titanic.  I I turned around and said ""First class passengers and women and children first only my good man"" then I got flicked off.  No Humor in people anymore.   The toilet was powerful enough to take down a spicy Thai dinner and the toilet paper was nice and soft.  Great water pressure and warm/hot water for the shower.  All around a great stay.",N
4567,"The one star is merely for the beautiful lobby and the fact that this is a Chicago landmark. I stayed here for the NYE party this past weekend and I was astonished by  the poor service and rudeness we received from the staff. They oversold the event so it took waiting in line to do almost anything. I went to the bathroom right before midnight and the men guarding the doors refused to let me back in. They said the room was at capacity. How can that even happen? If you were responsible enough to only sell enough tickets that the main room wouldnt be at capacity then I wouldnt have spent $ 140 to be standing in a hallway by myself on new years stone cold sober. They wouldnt allow alcohol in the hotel rooms and if they found any reminants they would charge a $ 60 corkage fee. So greedy! Now back to the staff and maintenance. The conceirge had no idea when check out was, the starbucks staff yelled at me for no apparent reason and when we checked under the bed to make sure we didnt leave anything behind we found dirty dishes with food still stuck to them,an empty ice cream carton, and a bunch of used glasses. DISGUSTING!!!!  Who knows long those dishes had been there. I will urge out of town guests never to stay in this digusting terrible place.",N
4586,"Hotel Felix has managed to make a small hotel room stylish. My room was only slightly larger than the queen bed in it, but by using creative lighting and utilitarian design, it felt comfortable and hip as opposed to claustrophobic. The hotel front desk attendants were a bit stand offish, and they ended up screwing up the bill a bit, but all in all it was a very pleasant stay. We booked on Priceline, so the price wasn't bad, but the list price of booking through the hotel is a little steep for the space and amenities. If you can get a deal and want a trendy hotel experience, I recommend giving it a try.",N
4587,"the lobby is cute and the rooms are decent size for a boutique hotel, but this is where the compliments stop... drill buzz, drill buzz, drill buzz. scrape, scrape, scrape. hammer, hammer, hammer. this is the noise going on right outside my window as i write this review (literally, *right* outside on scaffolding. the construction worker can probably read this over my shoulder as i type it on my hotel bed). i understand that construction has to happen, but not once was i warned about the loud, dentist-esque noises i would be waking up to during my stay. the service has been completely lackluster. i called to give them a heads up that my airline had messed up my connecting flight to chicago and that i might miss my first night's stay at the hotel, but not to cancel my room. the woman i spoke to a) seemed confused, b) didn't seem to care, c) took 5 mins for me to convince to add a note to my reservation simply stating that i would still be arriving the next day. the room service experience is also a mess. i was really looking forward to a quick bite in my room before i had to leave for work events. i called to order from the menu in my room, but apparently it was out-of-date, so i had to have the room service attendant read me the current menu over the phone. 20 mins later, my meh romaine salad with chicken arrived, sans my iced tea or the bill that i was supposed to sign upon delivery. i asked the delivery guy where they were and he mumbled something, then had to run back down and get them. i ordered an oatmeal for breakfast this a.m. and it tastes like the knife that was used to cut the bananas was also used recently to cut an onion or garlic -- not a taste that i want mixed in with my steal cut oats and brown sugar... i'm sure the hotel felix either was at some point, or is under construction in order to become a great, centrally located boutique hotel, but something's not right right now.",N
4588,"if you like really small and i mean small as 2 people cant walk at the same time, book this hotel !!!!! i was't expecting a dorm room to be that small, i mean a hotel room... sorry but the customer service is great their and the people are nice that they credit us for the other night as i paid less what i paid over there and moved to a better hotel with higher star rating / Hilton and it was few blocks away , i believe they are over pricey and expensive for that type of a room....",N
4589,CONS:Rooms are Tiny. (queen room) Walls were fairly thin as I could hear loud talking in the next room. PROS: Free Wifi is nice! although not fast- the hotel Is clean and Modern as well as in a decent location. Staff was good. Other thoughts: I feel like I kinda overpaid @165 per night. Would look elsewhere if you're close to 200 dollars. I would say it's on the low end of all the 4 star hotels.,N
4590,"I read all the reviews and thought, ""hey, I'm a New Yorker, it can't be THAT small"" but it was.  Also the front desk staff on check-in (after our 13+hour drive from NY) were so completely rude and un-welcoming.  We entered our room to find the TV on and no remote at all to turn it off.  I found random hairs on the white bed cover and the q-tip package in the bathroom was open.  Weird.  Seemed like someone was hangin' in there before we got in. We ordered a new remote sent up and it came quickly, all the other staff was so, so friendly including the valet.  But the ridiculous room size (only stay here alone, not with someone, no matter how much  you love them!) makes this place a total rip-off.  The h20 products are nice but there is no space in the rest room for a lady to put out her ""stuff"" without knocking a toothbrush into the trash.",N
4591,"Traveling through Chicago for business, they booked a coworker and I a room at Hotel Felix for the night.   When we arrived, valet came to greet us and parked the car (for $44).  The hotel staff was prompt, but seemed slightly less then friendly, more like pleasantly bothered?  You can tell the building is very old, which is why the rooms are probably so small - two double beds practically took up the entire room - it was pretty cozy...I think it would be better if you stayed here on a romantic occasion with one queen or king.  Nice amenities, very clean.  If you are looking for somewhere upscale to stay that isn't in the heart of downtown, this is a great option (Not too far from Wrigley Field either).",N
4592,"I had Hotel Felix on my radar for a while since it was the first LEED Silver certified hotel in Chicago... or something like that. At first I was a little taken aback with regard to the size and configuration of the rooms, but then I remembered it was just remodeled not built new so it's not really set up for some of what I'd call more 'modern-sized americans.' My issues with the room through were three-fold. First, the air filter hadn't been changed in a while, so it was dirty and would bang back down onto the ceiling after the unit shut off. Easily fixed. Second, the apparent lack of storage. Yes there was a tiny closet, but where do I put all of the other crap I had with me for a week long stay? Then I discovered the dresser drawer hidden below the bed (I had a king room). Neato! Third, and this was the one issue I couldn't correct, the lighting. Argh. It was so 'energy-efficient' that it was nonexistent in certain parts of the room... like on the desk! Not cool when you're here for a work trip. And yeah there are LED task lights on the desktop but it didn't improve the situation any... so I ended up doing most of my work on the bed itself - though not without banging my knees on the wood sideboard a couple of times. I didn't spend a bunch of time in the room, but who wants to do that anyway when you're in another city? Other than those qualms, I really liked Felix, and the price we got through Priceline ($99/night, I think) made it much more manageable. I really enjoyed the location, within easy walking distance from some awesome restaurants, public transit, and whole foods, and just a generally relaxed vibe with nice staff. Next time I'm in Chicago I'll definitely stay here again.",N
4593,"My boyfriend and I nabbed a room here at a great price (thanks, Hotwire!) to celebrate Valentine's day. Pros: - lovely room, lovely view - giant bed - H20 bath products. Score! - fantastic location - complimentary coffee and gourmet tea in the morning Cons: - miscommunication between management and staff about room availability. In other words, it was annoying when some random mechanic walked in, thinking it was empty. Get it together guys! - NO CABLE. This must be the hotel's way of trying to squeeze more money out of customers: offer terrible options on the TV, force guests to pay for something decent. Not cool guys!",N
4594,"Here is a rare, 5FF non-food review on our 3-day, 2-night stay, someplace near every touristy shindigs in Chicago. I booked this 15% off, transient deal via http://hotels.com at about $99 per day for Easter weekend.  I was warned that bringing a car to Chicago requires lots of spare change, where Felix's nearest self-parking structure (at Clark St & Huron) costs $30 for 24 hours, & $44 for valet, & word-of-mouth free if a hybrid is driven.  DL & I decided to park our non-hybrid rental car, lodge at the 5th floor, and end up with a paid-what-we-got, eco-friendly, & elegantly modern & ""minimalist"" weekend... First I want to point out some advantages.  If you are pro-green, OR you--and a ""friend""--don't mind a SMALL (albeit forewarned), tight yet warm space *_*, Felix welcomes you to this.  They carried H2O+ bath-&-body travel products.  We had a safe & booked a queen sized bed, which had clean & medium-firm cushioning that we fell asleep easily.  Thank goodness no other room noises were audible.  FREE (unsecured) wifi is my over-the-top priority, which was why I thought this hotel convinced me enough for this amenity. This could be a con to some individuals, but the wall-supported LCD TV had mediocre screen quality, & the cable channel selection wasn't that numerous: no Disney Channel or Food Network.  Though they did have Discovery Channel, Travel Channel, TBS, ESPN, etc. The disadvantages are things that require a high tolerance of change.  What do I mean by that?  One, we rested on 4 perfectly squared pillows, rather than the quintessential rectangular-ish ""clouds.""  Two, our get-what-we-paid-for deal came with a view of shanty buildings on the Erie [Street] side... Three--and personally the most important factor--was our bathroom.  I didn't mind the stand-only, curtained shower or the open-faced cabinet hovered above the toilet.  However, what felt awkward & quite frustrating were our atypically rectangular designed sink & our towel hanger.  Perhaps this minimalist approach would be a sink, shaped like a massive appetizer platter, that realistically one person can comfortably & conveniently set his/her ""minimalist"" toiletries on the available space?!  And perhaps this methodology encourages the showered, soaked guest to walk to the opposite side of the shower just to snatch that thick, not-so-soft white towel?! Oh, almost forgot number four: sleeping surely was a breeze, UNLESS one religiously needs to use a noisy A/C.  Yes: sounds like Felix is dead serious when it comes to being eco-friendly ;D. One last advantage was quick & to-the-point service without rushing us.  Specifically, they informed us that our 2 hotel cards were required as our ""key"" to use the elevator after 9pm.  For our very first trip to Chicago I conclude that my arrangement with Hotel Felix was not too shabby, yet it would be a Plan B or Plan C decision for the average tourist who has minimal essentials & can leave a little extra room for ""souvenirs.""",N
4595,"This hotel has a European flair, by which I mean there is no superfluous space. The lobby, elevator, hallways, and rooms are all small. That said, the decor is nice & the beds are comfortable. As I had no problems, my interaction with the staff was limited, but pleasant. The location is great; it's just far enough off of Michigan to be in a quiet area but quite close enough to walk to almost all of downtown's attractions (those who are aiming for a location south of the river might opt to take a bus).",N
4596,"I came to know Hotel Felix via Priceline's ""name your own price"". I typically aim for 4+ star hotels, but being that I was only in Chicago for 24 hours, a three star would suffice. I 'won' Hotel Felix on Priceline for about 70$ - I'd never heard of this hotel and decided to look it up. I honestly wasn't impressed when I finally read about the hotel and viewed the pictures.   Upon arriving, I was instantly greeted by the bellman who helped with my bags. He was nice and eager. I was pleased until I got to the front desk. I gave my information to check in and was told my room wasn't ready. After a 10 hour train ride, this wasn't what I wanted to hear. I had to 'wait', and sat in the lobby until my boyfriend came to pick me up. The lobby was nice - its a very small boutique hotel, not spacious at all. I noticed the water fountain near the elevators. The lobby sitting area boasts a mod, yet chic decor. After lunch, my boyfriend and I returned to check in. The hotel staff customer service was 'ehh', and so was the room. If you just want a clean, decent place to lay your head and shower - then this is it. Rooms are very small, but you have everything you need. Clean room and very clean bathroom  - which is good! One perk,  is that you can open the window and fall asleep to the city sounds. Oh! and wi-fi is free! This isn't a bad hotel at all - but its not the best either. Its very much in the middle. For 70 bux, I cannot complain. Would recommend for a very short stay in the city.",N
4597,"Hotel Felix differentiates itself on style. A self-professed ""eco-hostel,"" the zen interior isn't limited to the spa - it's everywhere. In the lobby, there's a pool of water and a stack of logs (along with the requisite modern furniture). The rooms are also styled in a clean, almost Japanese style. Overall, very stylish. It's in a great spot, too. The hotel is close to Gold Coast shopping, River North galleries, and - should you choose - the tourist traps near Lasalle and Ontario. But, while Felix managed to differentiate itself through style, it still hasn't distinguished itself in service. In fact, service is pretty poor. Whether it's the nonchalant staff at the front desk or the ambivalent cleaning staff, customer service could use some help here.  Upon arrival, the hotel lost (and then found, without apology) my reservation through http://hotels.com. Upon entering my room, a dirty towel and used soap remained in the shower. I checked in at 6 PM, giving the cleaning staff plenty of time to tidy up. The room is also pretty small and the oversize furniture doesn't help the situation. The saving graces are there, though. First, there's price. For the location, the price is unbeatable. My total bill was still only in the double, not triple, digits. The business center and gym are convenient and well-equipped. The restaurant - Elate - is first-rate. The bar's not too shabby, either. But, the question remains: what's the point of a few perks when you drop the ball on what you're supposed to do best: serve the guests?",N
4598,"Stayed here for 2 days with my boyfriend this last weekend when Chicago was blasted with 8 inches of snow. Pricelined for a reasonable price others have quoted below for a 4 star hotel in the River North district. This eco-friendly boutique hotel is more of a 3.5 star hotel (due to small room size) overall but I had a great experience and would gladly stay again. Pros: - Impeccable service. From the doorman opening the door and greeting me warmly every single time to the maid redirecting me to my room b/c I was lost, everyone here was wonderful. - Great location in River North just 5 minutes away from the Red line. The 22 bus is right outside the hotel door. - Amazingly, comfortable bed. Trust me, I spend enough time in it to know! - FREE WIFI! - Cool, trendy, modern restaurant ELATE next door. Beware that they do not have the late night menu during the winter. I hear they do unlimited mimosas for $20 on the weekends. - Really nice bath products by H20. My boyfriend couldn't stop smelling my hair! They even included make up removal toilettes, cotton balls, and Q-tips. - Gym on site with 3 treadmills, some elliptical machines, a cycling machine, and some free weights. - Nice looking lobby with a fireplace to warm you up after braving the cold streets. Cons: - Size. Rooms here are ""cozy"". We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a king sized room which still had very little space for us to store our luggage. - Bathroom had very little storage space to store toiletries and such. - Didn't have a fridge or a coffee machine. Things that you would expect from a Priceline 4 star hotel. However, they do serve free coffee downstairs in the morning. - TV remote control didn't work very well. I had trouble changing channels.",N
4599,"Meh, not as happy this time around and like many other yelpers mentioned, I feel as if we got not just the short end of the stick, but the sh*t end. (Pardon my French) First, when we checked in the folks at the front desk seemed to have some 'tude. This was a significant change from last time I stayed here when the service was impeccable. Even when I asked them for toothpaste and some safety pins, it seemed like a huge chore. Apparently when you ask for safety ""pins"" that also equates to just one. As far as service goes, there were a few redeeming factors, like the 'tender at the lobby bar, who was very fun, nice and energetic. Second, the decor is still chic and eco-friendly, but you can tell it's taken a hit over the years. Maybe it was just the room we were assigned (an ""01"" room right next to the damn elevator) but it was falling apart. It was way smaller than my room was the first time (read: a glorified closet), a huge chunk of decorative tile have been broken off the sink and another random part had fallen off and just placed on the counter. Really? You can't fix that before you place someone in probably your least desirable room in the entire hotel? The bedside lamps looked like they'd been knocked over at least 17 times. You could tell whoever cleaned the room prior to our check-in did a half-assed job. We even got a call from some friends who were also staying there who mentioned someone had taken a #2 in their toilet and they found it when they checked-in. Wow... The saving grace here amongst the elevator dinging and loud chatter all.day.long. was whoever cleaned our room for the rest of our stay. He or she fixed the pieces-parts in our bathroom and really made the place shine. I actually wanted to call the front desk just to give the house keeper praise. And, I realize I'm in Chicago, but $44 per day for parking is out of control. I'm pretty sure they're able to keep this hotel running based on that revenue alone. I now know better than to drive to CHI anymore. I am keeping Hotel Felix at 3 stars because there are still some great things about it, like: they're leed certified, eco-friendly, their 24hr fitness room with filtered water (I brought a cup and kept filling it, bringing it back to my room and enjoyed not paying for the water bottle in our room), the hotel resto is fab (but pricey), the beds are a dream to sleep in, free wi-fi and a great location to pretty much walk anywhere. Word to the wise: If you stay here, tell them at check-in that if they've placed you in a room next to the elevator, to move you--now.",N
4601,"First off, I really like smaller, unique little hotels as opposed to giant chains as a general rule so Hotel Felix definitely fit the bill. The biggest plus for me with this one was the location. During my stay, I pretty much walked everywhere and only needed to take a cab once because it was late. The staff was super friendly and accommodating.  And the bed...ah the bed. The bed gave me the best sleep ever! Ordered breakfast as well a couple of times and it good both times but really big servings (I underestimated so I ended up with more food that I can eat. Ooops.)   The room itself was super small but for one person, I didn't think that it was a problem at all. The bathroom was teeny tiny as well but hey, I wasn't going to go be doing any jumping jacks in there anytime soon. I would have rated it higher except for the fact that the toilet overflowed with a lot of stuff on my last day. A tad gross even for someone like me with a strong constitution. I did notify them right away but I was on my way out already so I am not sure if they fixed immediately. Overall, it was a pleasant stay and I wouldn't mind staying there again.",N
4602,"My parents stayed here for one night and had to move because the air conditioner was just too damn loud. Be forewarned, especially staying in Chicago during the summer, you can't go without A/C. The lobby was nice, if somewhat over-perfumed, and the room was nice except for it's tiny size. Also right now, there is building construction going on right next door and that was the view they had from their room... It seems like a good hotel for your money, but if you're willing to spend $20 more, it'll make all the difference.",N
4603,"I wanted to give this place a 4th star but I couldn't. There were just enough simple little things that bothered me enough to keep me from giving it that extra star or two. And frankly, I feel I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt by giving them 3 over two stars. However, i did like the place, it just had really dumb problems. Got this place through priceline and paid a cheap amount, like 75 bucks or something. Good deal. It only costs a little less than 30 bucks to get here in a taxi from Midway so that was a good deal too. The hotel itself is really nice. Boutique hotels are funny in general to me. They are usually old buildings that have be renovated. This follows that path. Being that it is an old building, everything is small. Also with boutique hotels, they always try to be trendy and minimalist. I like more grand and luxurious hotels but that's my opinion and doesn't count against this place. I like that it is also LEED certified to be a green hotel. I'm all for saving the planet and stuff. The lobby was very nice, although small. Bellhops were friendly and helpful. Desk people were helpful and friendly as well. The room was very nicely appointed. Traffic outside could be heard even on the 9th floor but it wasn't horrible. And its a downtown hotel so again, this doesn't count against the hotel. The room was fairly small but again, that follows boutique hotels' style. The bed was comfy and the wall hung TV was cool. All my really problems with this place took place in the bathroom. The bathroom was nice and very spacious, almost as big as the room, but had major flaws. First, the sink was too trendy and didn't serve its purpose. The faucet was WAY to close to the bottom of the sink. To the point where you couldn't wash your hands without hitting your hands on the bottom of the sink or the faucet itself. pointless. Second, the shower curtain was too small for the shower. It only stretched 1/2 to 2/3 of the way at most. This made showering difficult as to not get the bathroom floor wet. I don't know why this was like this but it bothered me. I posted pictures of both these problems, check the photos. The hotel restaurant looked pretty cool and had a big bar. I didn't get a chance to go check it out in detail but it sure did look like a good time.",N
4604,"Friendly staff, prompt, courteous. other reviews have it right, i'll be returning to the Felix when i come to Chicago. very convenient, i'd rather stay here than one of the mega-hotels for twice the price. used priceline, got the room cheap.",N
4608,"I loved it. I work in Kentwood, Michigan right, and this guy comes in just randomly and I tell him that I'm visiting Chicago in a week. He's like, ""Dude! Reserve a room at the Hotel Felix!"" So I go home that night and I am looking around at hotels in Chicago and sure enough Hotel Felix seems legit. Fast-forward... I get to Hotel Felix and it is awesome. Fountain follows the revolving doors as you enter. Dark granite and contemporary furniture are all very welcoming to the eyes. Front desk is very gracious and helpful, and get me checked into my room a few hours before check-in (Major Plus, master hospitality). The rooms are great in terms of looks and comfort. Even the shower has a very comforting home away from home feel. Everything they advertise on their website is there at your disposal. I don't recommend it at all though because I want it all to myself. ;) Enjoy. Have fun! I will DEFINITELY be using this restaurant as my home-base whenever I visit Chicago in the future.",N
4609,"Stayed here on a ""staycation"" for a few days after picking up a deal on Priceline.  I've lived in the city for 14 years now and can say I had never heard of Hotel Felix until after my ""winning"" bid, so I was a bit weary. Is Hotel Felix a 4-star hotel?  Perhaps a stretch. Having said this, however, I've bid on and won other 4-star hotels on Priceline in the past, and Hotel Felix was nicer than many of the other 4-star rated hotels I've reserved. This is a decent little hotel.  Modern, clean, with friendly staff, and a decent location.  No, it's not on the Magnificent Mile, and I don't like that priceline groups River North & Mag Mile together, increasing the odds you'll end up in River North over Michigan Ave with a low bid offer, but hey, that's the risk you take, and its River North location is great for proximity to family tourist destinations such as Rainforest Cafe, Ed Debevic's, Hard Rock Cafe, etc. Free Wifi was a bonus, rooms, though small, were quite nice.  Ordered room service for dinner one night, and the food, especially the gourmet burger, was absolutely delicious.  I know the hotel is small, but with a family, the only other missing piece was a pool, but hey, you can't have everything, especially for the price. Are there other better choices?  Sure.  Would I recommend Hotel Felix to anyone asking?  Absolutely.",N
4612,"Yes, the rooms are small, but not intolerably so.  Staff was friendly and its in a good location.  Just far enough off Michigan Avenue to cut the crowds down. Rooms were clean and comfortable. The gym needs work.  All in all, a good hotel, depending what you pay.  If you are paying much over $100 p/night, you will probably be disappointed.  I pricelined it but fees were higher because it was spring break, so it was a bit over priced.",N
4623,free valet parking for hybrids!,N
4624,"Lovely staff, nicely furnished, and great service.  Great location, one of the cheaper valet service I've encountered ($42) and that's with in & out privileges, and cozy rooms.",N
4638,"I booked this hotel through Priceline and got a very, very good price.  When reading the reviews I was a little concerned about the size of the rooms.  Much to my surprise, the room I received was very adequate.  I have been in several other river north hotels and was familiar with small rooms.  This room had a full bath.  I was told it was only one of ten in the hotel (out of 120 rooms).  My experience was great.  The rooms were very clean.  The location is great (only 3/4 blocks from Michigan Ave).  The service was great as well.  I parked across the street and saved about $30 over the two nights we were there.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",N
4639,"DO NOT STAY HERE! Last weekend we traveled to Chicago for celebrating a bachelorette's party. We booked this hotel via Priceline's name your own price. Upon our arrival, we were notified that we were only able to stay in two rooms with a single queen size bed in each room. Okay, we have EIGHT girls in our group. We were unable to change the room------In an extremely rude and awful manner, the front desk receptionist insisted that it was the rule because we booked via Priceline and they were all sold out that night. Okay. We asked for adding an extra bed. They said they did not have any rolled bed option. Fine. No apology at all and the receptionist spoke with us with a poker face and as if we owe her 100000000 bucks. That night , we then asked for some extra blankets and pillows for making our own ""bed"" on the floor. Yes, three of us had to sleep on the hard floor. The other three of us had to squeeze on the queen size bed in an uncomfortable way. The front desk gave us a couple (6) thin blankets  and then said ""we were out of blankets"".  The service man delivering the blankets was in an absolutely bad manner too. In the end we were offered another two thin bed sheets.......... It was chilled last weekend in Chicago.  What's more, the bathtub clotted in one of our rooms and the water drained super slow................  The technician responded and came for help very quickly (and very courteous). But he said it was probably due to a lid of the shampoo bottle......so he was not able to get it fixed. The second day, we were in hope of having some other guests from larger room checked out so that we would be able to switch room.  We called the front desk at 7:00 AM in the morning (cuz they told us to do so..............) and the receptionist said we should be able to get ""TWO"" larger rooms and he told us to call back before we headed out (so that they could get ready). We called the receptionist around 10:30ish AM and he told us to pack our luggage and drag our luggage to the lobby for moving to our ""TWO"" new rooms. When we arrived at the lobby, the receptionist said ""you were only able to get one larger room"" . OKAY, we eight gals all packed and dragged our luggage to the lobby and now you told us we got only one room changed???? The receptionist (a different one from the first day) was once again very rude and very impatient from the very first beginning. He even said ""DID YOU GET IT?"" This is totally unacceptable. Finally they gave us a new larger room (with two queen size beds)  and a new smaller room with one queen size bed.   We did not change hotel because we all traveled for a long time and very tired and did not want to pay 80ish bucks still to Priceline if we cancelled the reservation. The rooms were very small. If you travel alone, I think it totally works. However, never stay here in groups. The beds were with very hard and sharp borders. With the very limited space, you bump into those sharp borders easily when moving in the room. Three of us got bruises because of this. The AC system was pretty loud in the room and the outlet was in a strange orientation. The second night the heat air blew directly on my face all night long. Are you sure this is a 4-star hotel given the poor quality of service and all of the above?   The bellmen were courteous though and we were greeted nicely (only by the bellmen). IMHO, this hotel has serious management problems.",N
4712,"Do not believe ANYTHING on their cozy little website.... this place is a dump in a marginal area of town. In spite of what is published, almost ALL bathrooms are SHARED, without any sanitization efforts. They were never cleaned the whole time, and have no hand sanitizer, soap dispensers, toilet seat covers or paper towels. Fixtures are dirty, moldy, outdated and in poor working condition. Rooms do not have adequate door locks, floors, closets, furnishings are in dis-repair. Noisy!! Dark, dank, mouldy, depressing!! Narrow hallways and squeaky floors- you can hear everyone, and they can hear you. Outdated televisions with only a few channels. Horrible!! AVOID!!! Also, the bus stop on Belmont that they direct you to from the BL from ohare is very dangerous....esp. for tourists with suitcases!!! Do not go there!!! Dangerous!!!",Y
4717,"I will never stay at this hotel again. Definitely NOT worth the money. I guess the location was nice, but then again, when you're in downtown Chicago...almost anywhere is good location. Lighting was poor, walls were thin, and there was no fridge in the room, only a warm bottle of 'eco-friendly' water for $2.50. I am not a claustrophobic person, but after being in this tiny closet of a room for a short while I HAD to get out. My boyfriend and I stayed at Swissotel on NEW YEAR'S EVE and paid the same price as we did for this room...only it was a much nicer and more spacious room.",Y
4718,"We booked this place on Priceline by choosing a 4-plus star hotel. We stayed Sunday-Wednesday so it wasn't very busy, but of course we were given a room right across from the elevator since we bought it on discount. I really don't understand this way of thinking though - why not treat everyone the same so they keep coming back, discount or not? Anyway, the hotel isn't super fancy, but it was nice, clean and contemporary. When I got into bed, there was a big wet spot on the sheets, so we moved rooms to a handicap room, which was nice because it was bigger but the shower was too short and if we adjusted it, it would spray all over the bathroom.Our room was cleaned nicely everyday and the cosmetic products they supply are really nice, so it was definitely worth the priceline price, but I think I would have been a bit disappointed had I paid full price.Great location, nice neighbourhood, comfortable beds",Y
4719,Small small rooms. No really they are small. Nice bed but the bed is the room. I think my college dorm room was bigger,Y
4720,"Where do we start? Ok, The staff was 4 star great!! Now let's talk about the hotel it self. My wife and I thought we would use http://Priceline.com for the first time and BOY!!!, what a suprise when we got there. We got room 415 and, it was smaller than the cabin the we had on our most recent cruise. Me being over 6 feet tall and my wife almost 6 feet tall had to stuff ourselves into a full size bed. When we asked the front desk for a larger room or bed they told us that's as big as they have. DON'T LET THEIR WEBSITE FOOL YOU ALL THE PICTURES ARE TAKEN WITH A WIDE ANGLE LENS AND PHOTOSHOPPED!!! We left the hotel with severe back aches. The folks that are giving great reviews on the Hotel Felix must work there. If you are 5'5"" or shorter and weigh less than 120 pounds the place would be great. Don't order any food while you're there it's horrible. My wife and I both give the hotel 4 thumbs down. Please, Please don't waste your money at the Hotel Felix. I have to rate this crap hole now and it can't be rated as a -1.",Y
4721,I came to Hotel with great expectation as it was highly regarded by certain websites. Location was the only positive thing about the Hotel. The service was poor from most of the staff but as i was travelling on my own i didn't really want to relocate as i found driving around the city a bit daunting. I stopped for 3 nights and after the 1st night i had my card credit stollen. All my arrangement details changed and i explained this to the staff. Although things now became complicated for some reason. I had to move rooms on an occasion and the rooms air conditioning [both] were noisy and disturbing. To top things work duties commenced in the early hours of my last night just outside my window.Bad service from valet company too had to wait an hour for my car when told 20 mins.,Y
4722,"Hotel staff incredibly not helpful. The room they put us in was the size of a closet and the window, no joke, was 1.5' wide x 5' tall in the corner of the room with a view of the brick building 3 ft away. We asked to be change rooms and they would not accommodate us.I will never go back.",Y
4723,"I really liked this hotel.  The bed was VERY comfortable, the decor was functional, and the bathroom had nice storage.  The only issues I had were all bathroom based; this includes walking around the toilet to get into the shower and a faucet that you couldn't get yours 2 hands under at the same time.  That being said, I would definitely stay here again.  The location might be the best part of this hotel!",Y
4750,"The hotel is beautiful, fabulous location, and the front service staff are amazing. We accidentally booked a double, but our second day they upgraded our room to a king for free. However, the cleaning service did take my phone charger and so I was left without use of my phone for the remainder of my trip. I wish the hotel had been more accommodating seeing as it was their staff that caused this inconvenience, but unfortunately, they were not.",Y
4751,"You can get sneaked into this hotel by the always better than average pricing.  Don't be fooled. Old hotel with no updates, average cleanliness, and poor amenities.  Only plus is the location, but there's plenty of options that are better.  Even if it means spending an extra $25/night.",Y
4752,"Recently stayed here for two nights.  Took the advice of several reviewers and upgraded to the Executive Suites.  Well worth the small upcharge. The room was very comfortable. The A/C was awesome. With temps in the mid to upper 90s, I was concerned that it might never get cool enough. Boy did it ever. It was great! The appetizers at night and the continental breakfast in the morning are great. And the cucumber water right outside the elevators was so refreshing coming in from the heat. The staff was very friendly. Everyone we passed in the hall said hi or wished us a great day. There's an el stop right out the door. A McDonalds and CVS are in super close walking distance. The Art Institute is barely a block away. Never had to wait for a cab, the doorman were on top of it the moment we came outside. We did have a slight billing issue with something ordered before our arrival but it was fixed up immediately. I will most definitely stay at this hotel again if I'm ever in Chicago again.",Y
4753,"Beautiful hotel.  Great pool and workout area.  Rooms were roomy with large closets.  Very good service.  We got our rooms for $100 per night, parking was $30 per night.",Y
4754,"We stayed at the Palmer House when we were in town for a wedding.  The hotel itself was fine and in a good location, HOWEVER, our door did not latch properly and our room was broken into and valuables were stolen.  We immediately called security, they arrived and took a statement and sent someone to fix the door.  At that point it was ""out of their hands"" and reported to their insurance.  We never heard from a hotel manager or customer service to check on us or see if there was anything we needed.  After our trip I called customer service to let them know what happened and the representative said ""the hotel is not responsible for lost or stolen items"" and that if I ""believe"" I had been robbed I should have called the police.  Basically we will not get compensated or even apologized to even though it IS the hotels responsibility to provide a room with a working door.  The icing on the cake is that 6 months ago when we were moving and stayed a different Hilton our Uhaul was broken into and all of our belongings were ransacked, stolen or ruined we were treated even worse.  Not only did the hotel manager not so much as offer us a free breakfast, we were scolded for not having properly registered the Uhaul in the parking lot.  (even though when we arrived with the uhaul it was after midnight and we had previously registered our vehicle.)  So next time you stay at a hotel make sure that all of your belongings fit in the safe or just carry them around with you.",Y
4755,"A Classic. Booked a suite and it was absolutely beautiful. Tastefully renovated, beautiful white leather chairs, very nice bedroom and bathrooms, and as this was a corner suite, huge living room with and lots of windows.Great service. Ate at one of the restaurants downstairs. Food as ok, nothing special.",Y
4756,"We reserved a room with a king bed 5 months before our trip.  When we arrived, they said they didn't have any kings available.  We took a room with two ""double beds"" though they were the smallest double beds I've ever seen.  The next day, they said they would switch us to a room with a king and they said they were sending up a bellhop to move our things.  We waited.  And waited.  After 3 calls and a trip to the front desk, a bellhop finally arrived--it took an hour.  We're here for three days; we don't want to waste our valuable time because of bad service.  I would not recommend this place.",Y
4757,"My wife and I just visited Chicago for the first time two weeks ago and stayed at the Palmer House Hilton for all three days.  We both felt that it was the best hotel that we have ever stayed in and all of the staff were extremely helpful and professional.  Our room was great, the location on the Loop was perfect, and the Balance Spa was inside the hotel and we loved it.  Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone and we cannot wait to visit Chicago again.",Y
4781,Loved it!  Loved the location!  Loved the staff!  Loved the beds!  Loved the showers!  Just flat out loved it!  Even the food in the restaurant on the main floor!,Y
4782,This review is for their rooftop bar.  Was here recently on a Sunday.  Extremely overpriced with horrible service from the bartenders.  Waited almost 15 minutes from the time she took my order until she came back with 2 drinks.  Way too loud.Great views though.,Y
4783,"I have never seen a service like that in my life. The Management should be proud of their Staff!!! I stayed at Spa King Room, if you go for same, choose for a corner room.I upload some photos too, The View is AMAZING at night!!!Room was amazing too.Again and again, Service was very friendly!",Y
4784,"Was in Chicago several weeks ago with my wife. Stayed at the Wit and we loved it! Every staff member we encountered from the bell-men, the front desk to the housekeepers and the restaurant staff was very friendly and upbeat. The hotel is beautiful and conveniently located. My wife and I will definitely stay here again next time we're in Chicago!",Y
4785,BEWARE. STAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.  They quoted us promotion rate of $150 a night and then sent me a $700 bill. They claim they never quoted us this rate and will wouldn't change the rate. They have a poor excuse for customer service. This is the second time I've had an issue with them. Their front desk is unreliable and unorganized. They can't keep track of their own invoice numbers. Also no free wifi.,Y
4786,"Stayed here on business in Feb 2012.  Overall, it's fine.The best thing about the theWit for me is that it is immediately located on the CTA Brown line.  I was able to get to the Merchandise Mart in 10 minutes and the rail could take me to various parts of The Loop so I could easily get to various eating establishments.  (By the way, I highly recommend taking a short walk to Wildberry for breakfast!)Other observations:Big, warm oatmeal cookie offered upon check in.Fast internet connection.Decor and facilities are comfy and well-maintained.Didn't care for the shallow, square sink because water splashed everywhere.",Y
4787,"Gorgeous view, great drinks!!  Our waitress, Rena was wonderful and helped us with our drink selection.  Can't wait to see it in the summer.",Y
4788,"We used theWit as our ""host hotel"" for our wedding on January 7, 2012.  We also used one of the suites for the on-site hair and make-up for the wedding party.  My husband and I also stayed at theWit on our wedding night.Overall, I was very happy with theWit.  It was easy to set-up a group block of rooms for our guests and we received quick responses from the event office when we had a question about the group block.  Unfortunately, after our group block sold out (before the cut-off date), theWit was not able to add any more rooms to our group block and, as a result, several of our guests had to pay the rack rate.  This was all in accordance with the group block contract and nothing that theWit did wrong, however, make sure that you understand this if you set-up a group block at theWit.theWit also successfully delivered all of our guests bags to our guests.  Our guests had a lot of compliments on the hotel.The only reason that I did not give theWit 5 stars is because our room service for lunch in our suite took over 90 minutes to arrive.  It was a very large order, however, they stated that it would take 45 minutes and did not call when it got delayed.Other than this small hiccup, we were very happy with theWit and I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a hotel to use for a group block.",Y
4789,"Love everything about this hotel, the bar on the roof was awesome, service was great and the room was one of the nicest I've every stayed in, make sure you try to get a suite if your budget allows. great location as well, so many restaurants, shops and coffee houses all within a mile.",Y
4821,I stayed at this hotel last night with my little girl Bella.  It was Bella's 7th birthday and they made her feel so special.  I can not say enough good things about the treatment and service at this hotel.  They went over and above to personalize our welcome. I had better service than any Disney hotel . We will return .,Y
4822,"I stayed here for a business trip.  It was my first time to Chicago.   My room was clean, personnel very professional and I felt very comfortable on site.  It is near (or within walking distance) of quite a bit of things to do, great restaurants etc.  My favorite part was the fitness center.  Quite spacious for a hotel, well working and high quality machines.  Would definitely stay here again.",Y
4823,The Hyatt is amazing with a nice sized room and comfortable bed. The bathroom is also spacious with good lighting. Disappointed about about the charges for parking and internet.,Y
4824,"This was the second time we have stayed at this hotel. This time with our 22 month old child. We got a great deal on the hotel using Priceline's name your own price. In addition we used the Facebook Word of the Week to get free internet for one day (which we didn't use anyway) and a significantly reduced rate on parking. The hotel is really in a great location for the type of activities we like to do. Due to a need to have milk for our child I called ahead to see what we could do regarding a fridge for the room. They informed me that when we check in just to mention that we had a child so we needed the crib and fridge and we were not charged for either. In addition, they had no problem giving us our choice of two beds or one king. Several hotels in the past when using priceline make no special requests like this. I definitely recommend this hotel.",Y
4825,front desk service very nice .. almost a little too nice and boardline creepy. 34th floor suites are gorgeous with nice city view. huge hotel. huge general area/lounge.,Y
4826,"I stayed here for a geeky conference, and it was pretty alright, though I was not impressed at the service for the price. Beds were comfortable and the place was clear, but I would have never been able to even afford a room if I hadn't received my badge for free. Still, it's not a bad hotel.",Y
4827,"I got this room for $50 on priceline. I would have paid $100. Great room, great location, great staff.",Y
4828,"This hotel is the best ever. I loved it. It was in a great location and i was very nice on the inside. There is an underground tunnel thing that takes you into this mall-like thing that has fast food restaurants, med-fast, and sit down restraunts. Check-in was easy and the staff was great and very nice.",Y
4829,"I recently booked a reservation for a family member through a website that I will not name. On our way to the hotel, we decided to call to confirm the reservation, JUST IN CASE, and the hotel had stated that they did not have a reservation under my name. Now, I had a confirmation e-mail and the payment was already processed.I had to call the hotel again and was put on hold for 20 minutes. Then was told to contact the website I booked it through. I was then on hold for another 40 minutes!!!The three people I was put through to were all very helpful and the hotel ended up upgrading the room for the inconvenience so that was nice but I just did not understand the confusion.All in all the stay was very nice for this family member but the being on hold and calling back and forth was not the greatest to say the least.",Y
4851,"My recent stay in the Congress Plaza Hotel in Chicago was one of the worst hotel experiences I've ever had. The trip started out with difficult to understand but effective check in clerks but went downhill from there. On the way to our room we were trapped in an elevator for 20 minutes. It took that long to open it even with a hotel employee in the elevator with us to call for help; if it had been just guests in there who knows how long it would have taken. Once we were freed there was no contact from guest services to reassure us or offer a discount on the stay, just hotel security demanding our names and room numbers as if we had done something wrong. We weren't spending that much time in the hotel, just sleeping overnight and cleaning up in the morning but even that wasn't great. The mattress and pillows were poor quality, somehow managing to be not supportive but too firm at the same time. The bathroom was cramped, the shower was cold, and the facilities all looked like they had been repaired shoddily more than once. The walls didn't seem to stop much noise; I was woken up more than once by someone in a nearby room urinating (awesome). On top of that, nothing is included: breakfast , parking, and internet are all additional and expensive. I do not recommend staying in this hotel if you can possibly avoid it.",Y
4852,"Very rude staff, particularly the manager at the front desk. Completely inconsiderate of their hotel guests. Thin walls between rooms, so much that we could hear our neighbors at the middle of the night. WiFi was expensive, staff was rude, worn-out rooms-- overall do yourself a favor and get another hotel.",Y
4853,"There is one positive attribute to this hotel: locationOur room was not dark or dingy, but it was tired and worn.If you want WiFi it'll cost you over $12/dayWe kept the Do Not Disturb sign in the door 24/7 and housekeeping came in our room one day.  $250 was taken.  A security report was filed as well as with the CPD. So far the hotel has not met with me to discuss this, they have ignored my calls/emails.Use the room safe....a lesson learned",Y
4854,"Just stayed there this past weekend. The architecture was beautiful and the lobby was nice. That's where  my positives about this hotel end. The  majority of the staff was extremely rude. While checking in, I had one of the hotel porters nearly run me over while muttering ""damn"" under his breath.The room was tiny but that was to be expected seeing as the hotel has been around since 1893. I had to request a room change because the room smelled of mold and mildew and it appeared someone had dropped an iron onto the floor and left it for too long because there was still an imprint of the iron on the carpet. Our second room smelled better, but there were chips on the bathroom door. There was no fitted sheet on our bed. Just a top sheet covering the mattress and then oddly, a top sheet atop the comforter. I'm not sure if the housekeeping staff is so lazy that they can't make a bed properly or what. I noticed that there were several functions going on while staying there and it made me wonder; why if they make money on renting out rooms/dining halls for conventions or weddings etc. that they can't manage simple renovations? They can afford an automated self check in/check out machine but can't replace carpet or repair a bathroom door?? The woman at Expedia and the hotels website led me to believe the hotel was nicer than it actually was. Luckily the rooms were inexpensive but if I were to return to Chicago, this is one hotel I'd avoid. I'd rather spend more money than stay here again.",Y
4855,"Loretta R.Let me be perfectly clear. I travel a lot. Always have. But  I can honestly say that this is the worst hotel I have ever seen. Not because it's old....heck, I'm old myself. But because the website gives the wrong impression as to what this facility has to offer. The rooms are especially horrible with paint sloshed over every single piece of hardware and dreadfully beat- up  woodwork in need of sanding.  The first room with a view of nothing but bricks was so awful that I asked for an upgrade. And I was given one..... for an extra $300.The ceiling in the large closet of my ""suite"" (and I use the term loosely),  hit the floor and stayed there for the remainder  of the visit.When I threw back the bed covers, what to my eyes should appear but an ant.Since I've been known to drop my purse on a restaurant floor, it occurred to me that I had brought it in myself.Wrong!The ants, who came through a hole in the wall,  were also all over the living room carpet. When I complained  to the  night clerk, he  said I must have left the window open. Does the place have a chef?  No. Only a cook,  who turns out  truly mediocre food. My order for soy chicken was so salty that it was like chewing grit...and   the rice served with the dish was a small, rock-hard lump. I received freshly cook rice after I complained to the waitress.  The whole thing should have never happened.Housekeeping?Oh yeah. That consisted of taking a swipe at the bathroom, making up the beds and vacuuming.  Dirty cups and dishes were untouched and no replacements  were provided.  The dressers, tables and other furniture were never dusted.The workers striking for benefits?I couldn't bring myself to cross that picket line, so I had to walk an extra three blocks to get to my destination. Good reviews?They were written by the hotel owners.Bad reviews?Right on brothers and sisters. You have covered about everything else that I wanted to complain about.Is there nothing good?Of course. The concierge, the doorman  and the regular staff were just wonderful. Kind and helpful to a fault.If you still want to stay there, ask for  a room with a view of Grant Park. You will have to pay more, but it's worth it. Breathtakingly beautiful. Well, that's about it. Remember, I have no reason to lie. All the best.",Y
4856,"I can not believe all these reviews I read about this hotel.  And you shouldn't either.  This hotel has lots of charm.  I, never been to Chicago before, looked for something near sights and close to the Mega Bus stop I had to find the next day.. I completely enjoyed my stay.  I was alone, they upgraded me to a king on the 7th floor.  Almost a corner room overlooking the park.  I was not visited by any ghosts but had I known this hotel was known for ghosts, I would have chosen another.  I'm glad I did not know.Yes, the room looked old with beautiful antique furniture, a safe in the closet if needed I could vividly imagine how it was as years ago.  It was quiet and warm.  I later learned I could open the bay-like windows and my view was amazing!  I could see the Ferris wheel lit up on Navy Peer and the beautiful park across the street.  I did not need any Internet access nor did I need HBO.  My room was absolutely perfect!  I got lost in the bed because it was huge and comfortable with 4 or 5 pillows.  It felt luxurious.  The bathroom was small but clean and had everything I needed.  The Kleenex box was fluffed up to look like flowers which was a nice touch.I used to clean hotel rooms and I am in the service industry so I am probably over critical.  I would have liked a mini-fridge for my leftovers.The bell boy was so helpful.  He offered suggestions on where to go and what to see.  Told me I could catch the 26 bus on the corner which took me right to the Union Station.  He told me Navy Peer was 2 miles away so I decided to walk there along Lake Michigan and it was awesome!  I took a cab back to the hotel, hopped the bus as instructed and took a ten minute ride to Union Station where I took the Mega Bus back to Minneapolis.",Y
4857,"This hotel is a historic landmark. I feel like I'm in a old Black and White Mafia Movie! The room has a great view of Michigan Ave. The first room I had was on the third floor as well. It was very cold and I had to call the front desk and they mentioned the heat was not turned on and mentioned they will bring me a portable heater and small blanket. It took a very long time to receive the heater and extra blanket and I had to be at a meeting; so I left and when I returned to the room the heater was sitting on the dresser and extra blanket on the bed. When I attempted to take a shower there was no hot water nor warm water. I had another meeting soon and I needed to shower so I went downstairs and spoke with the manager and she changed my room to the ninth floor. As I entered the new room I noticed a big difference. The bed was a California King from a King in the room on the third floor. The furniture was newer and nicer and the new room actually had a desk and the room was bigger, cleaner, and more modern looking. The bed are still generic brand that I never heard of and the bed is not that comfortable where you can feel the springs and the linen is scratchy. The television channels are basic and the Internet is Ethernet and cost $9.99 a night. No microwave. No fridge. The heat works in this room. If your room faces Michigan Ave or the Lake you will feel the Windy City through your windows. In the new room the water takes a while to become warm and never turned hot and the water was brown at first as well. I believe it's time for my investor friends or any investor to come along and buy the Congress Hotel and tear it down like a old hotel on the Vegas strip and build a new one. Wasting renovations on the current hotel is not helping and giving 20% spring discounts for a rate of $79 per night does not assist me wanting to stay another night! I have stayed at this hotel two prior times checking in after 4a with my significant others after a long night of partying and I guess I never noticed anything not worth staying here until I checked in sober for the first time. The highlight of my two nights at this hotel was being taken care of at Enclave Friday night and having complimentary entry with PASSWORD=MAVERICK and Enclave Saturday with PASSWORD=MAVERICK then we headed to V Live where we purchased our tickets with this link: http://ticketdriver.com/...",Y
4858,"Worst Hotel I've ever stayed in.  Nothing like the website at all.  The room was completely dilapidated and musty.  Furniture was scratched and looked old and dirty.  Carpet was dingy and smelly. baseboards and wall paint were deplorable.  Bugs in the bed.  I was completely  astounded at the misrepresentation of the room compared to the photos on the website.  In addition, after moving to another hotel, the Congress Plaza management charged my credit card for four nights I did not stay there.  They refused to give me the credit and so I was responsible for paying 4 nights which I did not stay in their hotel.   I would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy.",Y
4859,"First off i'm going to start off by saying I NEVER write reviews for anything. Ever. But after reading all of the terrible reviews off of many different websites, I feel the need to share my experience! The staff was so helpful to me and some friends that stayed there 2/15 to 2/18. Anytime we needed help with something or needed a taxi, they immediately helped us out. The rooms were beautiful and had a 1920's vibe to it which I really enjoyed. it does get pretty hot in the room after a while, but its not hard to open a window and shut it when you get cold. The hot water does take a few extra minutes to come on, but I didn't find that a problem. The ONLY thing I have to complain about is how thin the walls are. We had a neighbor come to our room 3 times complaining of how loud we were, but we weren't even talking...it was our tv! Other than that this hotel was a wonderful place to stay and I don't regret it at all! So don't listen to all of the other bad reviews of the place. I believe you get what you pay for at the Congress Plaza. If you want a 5 star experience, then obiously you have to pay for it at a different hotel. No, the Congress Plaza wasn't a perfect hotel, but if you're just staying there for a few days and are looking for somewhere affordable with beautiful spacious rooms and a friendly staff, then I highly recommend you stay here! Yeah, the hotel is a bit run down, but its been in business for such a long time and I think that the history of the place is what makes it beautiful. Oh, and the strikers out front are no problem, they arent loud and they don't get in the way of anything. All in all, I highly recommend this hotel!",Y
4860,"So I just went to book a hotel for the weekend of Lolla and when I called I was quoted a decent price so I booked it on the spot. Well..... then I went to see what went through on my credit card (they run your card for the first nights stay) and it was more than what I was expected. When I called to see what was up with the total, the rude lady working the phones told me that the girl who helped me must of messed up and gave me the wrong rates. She acted like it WAS MY FAULT. My room went from being $239.00 plus tax per night to $299.00 plus tax per night. I'll spend my hard-earned money on a different overpriced hotel.",Y
4880,"I expected a great hotel but was further impressed by the look, feel and service. The look is nothing short of breathtaking, the tall glass exterior is stunningly beautiful. The feel is professional, yet manages to incorporate that human factor. They literally make you feel appreciated, welcomed and cater to your every need! From the concierge, Anderson, who welcomes you thoroughly and lets you know just how much he enjoys his job and loves the city to the door men, especially Christopher who knows the city and can give you pointers like he were describing the a neighbor hood he had grown up in all his life. Again, the service. GREAT!! I can't think of the last time I had the pleasure of being happy to be around such magnificent personalities. My girlfriend and I truly didn't want to leave. Hence, the extention.I'd mention the breathtaking lounge Vertigo a top the roof of the hotel or the deliciously snuck in yet sophisticated restaraunt Aja but they are so great respectively that they all deserve seperate reviews.Whoever wants their hotel staffers to get better training to be 5 star should send their employees here so they can understand what makes a place such as Dana, dare I say greatest thus so far hotel",Y
4881,"The Dana Hotel and Spa is a bit unconventional -- very modern and chic design, pan-Asian cuisine, etc. -- but really enjoyable.  I stayed at the Dana hotel for one night on my way back from a long and tiring trip and it was exactly what I needed at the time.  I immediately took advantage of their spa-style shower (with one of those huge shower heads that feels like you're standing in a rainstorm), ordered room service, and luxuriated in the plush bed while watching some indulgent cable programming on the large, plasma-screen TV that you will find in each room.  You could hardly ask for a better location as the hotel is only three blocks from the Magnificent Mile.  My only complaint is that their room service is supposedly offered 24 hours a day, but when I arrived at 10pm the kitchen would only serve me sandwiches or salads.  The menu is also entirely Asian-inspired, which is unique and interesting on their part, but not everyone is in the mood for sesame-soy glazes or wasabi dressing at all hours of the day.  Still, the food was of better quality than most hotel room service options and I thought my ""Chinese Chicken Salad"" was tastier than I expected.  Like Molly S. above, I also booked through a third-party company (http://hotels.com), but unlike her experience, everything went very smoothly for me and all of the staff were polite and helpful.",Y
4882,"This is a good place for single men or a brief stay.  We were there for 1 week... Too long for this room.   The bed dominates the room.  There is nowhere else to sit to watch tv(which malfunctioned) or even sit and relax.  There is minimal closet space and the only drawers are in 1 bedside table.   The bathroom is functional, but small.  In order to appear larger, the shower is totally glass... Open to the bed area, they do provide a curtain, but the entire bathroom is visible to the bedroom if you forget to close it.  (every day, as the maids must be instructed to open it daily).  There are limited bathtubs in the hotel.  Don't count on getting one.The hotel has a modern euro feel to it, but the staff is either unconcerned or clueless. The exception was the doormen, they were helpful and pleasant.   We were there for the weekend nights and the hotel turns into a party... Great if you don't want to sleep.  We could hear the music from the bar as well as people yelling and running in the halls.  We don't plan on going back.",Y
4883,"One of the worse experiences doesn't even begin to describe the experience we had. My sister Caryn, had her thirtieth birthday here. I thought wow, a bit extravagant...but really it's a HUGE birthday marker for her and she really deserves to be pampered. So I though, why not? They'll make sure she's taken care of...BOY WAS I WRONG, read her testimonial since I wasn't there with her bad experience...SO, MY bad experience she didn't mention. A week prior my sister asked me if I wanted to get a treatment and have a girls day for her birthday. Very EXCITED I said yes, and asked her to book me a facial. The night before (less than 12 hours notice) they contacted her and stated they were cancelling my appointment and gave no reason. Caryn doesn't like to complain and asked me if that was ok...I was disappointed but, didn't want to cause a problem and just let it go. Later that night we were supposed to have dinner at AJA, Dana hotel's restaurant. When we walked in the restaurant's hostess looked at us like we were crazy when we said we had a reservation with Caryn. We had to call Caryn for the hostess to acknowledge we had a reservation. The hostess told us that we HAD to wait for the rest of the party in the bar area WHICH IS NOT HEATED and it was the same temperature as the outside. My Father, who is elderly, could not sit in this cold room and we insisted to be seated. After having an argument with the manager they obliged. We sat down and the bus boy proceeded to pour water in our glasses and our laps. YES OUR LAPS. For some bizarre reason he poured the water into the glass spilling it and then proceeded to continue to pour outside the glass on the table and into our laps. And he did that to all 15 settings of the table.Caryn had not arrived and we didn't want to spoil her evening so politely mentioned it to the waiter and he apologized. We ordered our drinks and they gave us a canter (of sake) that leaked. SO half the sake went into the glass and half went onto the table. The waiter apologized and was super embarrassed. He was kind enough to give us extra napkins to clean up the mess the buss boy and the faulty canter created.We ordered our food...Which was a complete disaster and completely disorganized. One by one when our food eventually came out. SERIOUSLY EVENTUALLY, from the time we ordered the food to the first course to arrive at our table was an HOUR. By this time we were all RAVENOUS but, relieved at the sight of the first plate coming out. We were all staring at the first plate of food, like starving wolves just coming out of winter and finding a dead carcass, and thinking in relief, ""OH GREAT, my food won't be very far off behind."" YEAH, we were wrong. Not wanting to be rude the ONE person who got their food waited until someone else got their food...Which was 10 minutes later...I KID YOU NOT!  I have never had service like this. Literally only one person every 10 MINUTES got their food. The food was cold by the time the next plate came out. By this time we encouraged everyone just to eat when they got their food. The delivery of the food was to ridiculous we actually asked the staff to cancel the rest of the orders. 10 Minutes later the REST of the food arrived! Miraculously.It only took TWO HOURS TO GET EVERYONE ONE FED. I use the word FED loosely. This whole dinner was supposed to be $1000...for a $1000 dinner one would think they would have their stuff together and at the very lease feed the customers properly. After dinner here we had to have dinner again somewhere else. The portions were substandard, wasn't all that good, and the service lacked. Our waiter did what he could with what he had so, I can't say he was a bad waiter...Just everything else.After that pathetic dinner My family went upstairs to Caryn's room  when we arrived at the floor there was BOOMING music coming from all directions. I asked Caryn if she was taking us to the night club, she laughed and said ""No, Apparently this is the party floor."" The room was nice and spacious and the view was nice. The wait staff arrived to set up the room for her party (which is why I am surprised that they gave her such a hard time after we left)Overall, I am very disappointed in this whole experience and I am even more so upset that our family PLUNKED down all that money for a special occasion that was ruined by Dana Hotel. If you want your special event to be ruined go here.",Y
4884,"Booked the Dana at a super low rate with airfare on a third party site.  My husband and I stayed for a few days and couldn't have asked for a better hotel.  Perfect location to walk to Michigan Ave, State Street, catch the L, etc.  The very modern room had a rain shower, plush toiletries, extra comfy bed, and 2 walls of nothing but windows (corner king room).  We were accidentally put in a handicapped room at first and asked to be switched to another.  Once we were switched, the new suite they put us in was supposedly being ""fixed"" the next morning....so once again, we were moved to another room.  The staff was so nice and helpful however that the room switches didn't even bother us.  We didn't spend more than a couple minutes in each, had yet to unpack, and they gave us 2 complementary bottles of wine which we picked out of the decent selection from the fridge in our room.  Ask for a high floor and a room that overlooks State Street.  We were on the 20th floor and never heard any noise from the bar a few floors above on the roof. Would definitely stay again!",Y
4908,"It's a great historic hotel. And they have done some great updating. I have had family stay here and they have always been happy. The ONLY complaint are the tiny rooms. But seriously, this place is not one to miss.",Y
4909,"Small rooms, old hotel. In need of refurbishing. Doorman is useless.",Y
4934,"I was pretty disappointed with the hotel.  I discovered bugs in the bathroom and in the bedroom.  The breakfast on the 40th floor is not worth the money because the area where you eat is dirty and littered with bugs on the window sill.  My main problem is currently my trying to get back the $50 in valet fees they have charged me.  I flew in and did not check a vehicle in.  Yet, on my bill was an additional charge for $150.  It took me two separate times with two different people to get that $150 removed.  It is just this past weekend that I discovered that they still charged me $50.  I have left messages.  Called several times only to be directed to voice mail and now sent an email hoping to resolve this matter.  This is the first time I have been disappointed with a Crown Plaza and do not intend on ever staying there again while I am in Chicago.",Y
4935,"Freaking awesomeeeeee! A block..no... a half a block away from the mag mile.. pillows awesome, service great, location the best and the room was purrrrrrrfect lol. I booked a great room...all i can say is room 1505 rockedddd. Def would come back here",Y
4936,"I was upset about not being told i had to pick my vehicle up from valet by 2pm the following day. We went to pick it up at 3:30 and were charged an additional $20 (a total of $70 for less than 24 hours of parking!) The parking attendant woman kept saying their sign says to pick the car up by 2pm. We NEVER saw any signs because we used the valet at the hotel. While $20 isn't that much money it still left us with a bad taste in our mouths about the hotel. This hotel was clean, staff was friendly, but the bathrooms were very small. It's an older hotel so a lot of things weren't up to date. I can only give this hotel 3 stars at best.",Y
4958,Great location. Be advised that if you end up here after booking from Priceline that you'll be put in a 'petite' room. We were kindly upgraded to a room with a full size bed. No prices on the mini bar and it was even more expensive than I expected it to be $6-$15 for anything in the fridge.,Y
4959,"I stayed there for two days this week and I have to say my expectations were much higher. I stay in Chicago quite often for business and pleasure, and this was my first time at the Allerton. Sure, the location was great as many point out, but there are countless other hotels in the area. A couple of blocks takes at most a few minutes to walk, and in the end, staying the night at another hotel would be much better.The hotel staff was friendly enough and my experience with them was positive. The downsides of the hotel greatly outweigh whatever positives the employees and location provide. First off, the rooms are incredibly tiny. Sure, it's the city, but I've never been in a room so small in Chicago. Secondly, my room was actually dirty. The bedsheets had sand in them when I went to sleep, and I'm guessing someone got a sandy towel stuck with the laundry that day. However, the maid should have noticed the sheets were dirty when she put them on the bed. There was also mold on the ceiling of the bathroom, something I've never seen in a hotel at this price point. Finally, I had purchased a park and play package, and never received the ""play"" part of the deal, which was supposed to include a welcome kit and free wi-fi. Instead, I was told I needed to purchase wi-fi, the packages starting at $10. What really was the worst part of the experience was the bed and the ""valet"" parking. When coming to the city, I look forward to getting a good rest on a nice mattress. The mattress at the Allerton was horrible. I've never had a problem at any hotel I've stayed at in the city. The mattresses are thin and old, so old in fact that you can feel the springs when you lay down on it! I woke up incredibly sore, from my back to my neck. I would equate the beds to something you would find at a Red Roof Inn! I did not pay almost $200/night for that. As far as the valet parking goes, avoid it at ALL costs. When I picked my car up before leaving, it took them over 30 minutes to bring me my car. I thought valet parking wasn't supposed to be a headache?! The parking allows for ""come and go"" access, meaning once they park you, you can come in and out of the parking garage throughout your stay. I can't imagine wasting a half hour of my time each time I wanted to leave!I wanted to like the Allerton, but I just can't. I love the decor, and it's very modern and clean. The did a great job on that end. I'm not normally picky, but for the price I was expecting much more. I normally don't complain about hotels (it might seem like it in this review), but I have never been so disappointed. Would I stay here if the price was lower? Yes. For now though, I will be staying elsewhere.",Y
4960,"Nice enough - and we got a great price on Hotwire. It is a little cramped though. The elevators are small, the lobby is small, the standard rooms are small. However, it is very clean and well decorated. The room windows open all the way and don't have a screen, which is a little strange for a highrise hotel. Overall, a fine place to sleep.",Y
4961,Nice hotel but.....Just had a work conference here.  The internet and wifi was the worst i have ever experienced in a hotel.  I think we lost about half a day in each of the two days we were here due to this limitation. You would think that this wouldnt be an issue anymore but it was.  We will never use this facility again.,Y
4962,"GREAT place to stay.  However, we weren't crazy about the $50 overnight parking fee, and the $25 ""restocking/cleaning fee"" because we placed our (food) leftovers in the refrigerator.  I suppose it was our fault, because we didn't read the small sign on the refrigerator, so just a heads up for anyone who stays there.   :-(",Y
4963,"The best thing about this hotel is the LOCATION!  Another nice feature about this hotel is that it does have a little bit newer/updated deÃÅcor, but it does not make it ""luxury"" or 4 star by any means.  The main entrance takes you to a small lobby area with some seating and a station for the bellmen, and then a hall that leads to the elevators.  The elevators are very small, but luckily we didn't have to wait too long for 1.  The check-in/reservation desk, as well as the concierge table, bar/lounge, and restaurant are located on the 2nd floor.  I never saw anyone at the concierge table -  - would have been a problem had we stayed more than 1 night. The bellman was helpful in assisting with the few questions I did have, though.  Check-in/out was fine.  We had no problem leaving our bags with the bellmen when we arrived early/before check-in or after check-out.  They were able to retrieve our bags quickly with no issues.  We had a standard king room and it was very small.  I don't mind a small room, but I was surprised by how small it the room was.  The TV was nice, there was a desk, the bed looked nice with white bedding and navy piping.  The closet was tiny, but again, we were only staying for 1 night, so not a big deal.  I think these accommodations are ok for a night or weekend, but I would have been cramped had I been staying for an extended period of time (a week or more).  I have read this before, and I will have to agree 100% that the sheets are extremely rough and scratchy!  My husband and I both commented on the low quality sheets, which was disappointing.  I think nice sheets can make such a huge difference in a hotel.  I slept well despite the scratchy sheets.  The pillows were soft and comfy.A word of warning: THE WALLS ARE VERY THIN!!!!  During the day I heard the man in the room next to us talking on his cell phone.  He was speaking with a normal tone/volume and I could hear the entire conversation very clearly, as if he was in the room.  That being said, we woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of our neighbors...!  WHOA!  They weren't even that loud, it was honestly that the walls were incredibly thin.  Eeek.The bathroom was small and had a pedestal sink, no counter space, and a more industrial looking toilet with the flush handle similar to a commercial toilet (it's an old hotel).  The shower was nice, the marble was nice, and the shower head was actually pretty good and provided decent water pressure and a rainfall spray.  The toiletries were limited and included a bar of soap, shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion.  They smelled pleasant, but I would have appreciated a shower cap and maybe a body wash.   The towels were fine, they got me dry, but they were quite standard.  I guess if you have more toiletries and more luxury towels, the price of the room would just go up, so again, it's what your priorities are, right? I think the hotel, the room, and the bathroom appeared to be clean, but not spotless.  If I had been staying for more than 1 night I would have expected more in the way of cleanliness.Overall, I would say this hotel is average - convenient location, nice , but old.   Allerton is definitely not a boutique or luxury hotel, so if that is what you are expecting, you will be disappointed (note that this review is based on a standard king and I am unable to provide an opinion on any upgraded rooms they may offer). We were comfortable and didn't have any major issues or complaints.   I think just having softer, higher quality sheets could make a huge difference in the experience, though.  People don't always use the other amenities in a hotel (desk, TV, closet, etc.) but they almost always need a comfortable place to rest (with silky sheets!)  We probably won't stay here again, because there are so many other options and I'm not opposed to spending a little more for a true luxury hotel.",Y
4980,"We stayed here for four nights and enjoyed it.  The room was complete, clean and well designed.  It was small and on the back corner near the train - so the train makes a lot of noise about every 20 min.  So our room wasn't a top of the line room, but we still liked it a lot.  We had views and the flat screen TV in the room worked well.  The location of the hotel is first rate and the they are trying to provide a complete service.",Y
4981,"Just completed a big family reunion at this property. We had a luncheon buffet and a dinner buffet, and all of the food was excellent. The pastries are to die for. The new restaurant, which opened about two months ago has a more extensive menu than the prior. The hotel staff was attentive to every need. Rooms are small, and the bathrooms are the smallest I have seen, but when you consider you are right next to a 5 star hotel and you are paying hundreds of dollars less,  the Chicago Essex Inn will be my first choice whenever I return to Chicago. All rooms are nicely appointed, and if you can afford the upgrade to the King Suite, you will not be disappointed by the space and the view. We experienced very hot temperatures (100 degrees) on one of the days, and the A/C in the banquet hall facing the east, just could not keep up. Fans were required, which were offered. The lobby is clean and neatly appointed, and I understand it will undergo renovation after the current tourist summer season. A best kept secret is the 4th floor open air garden patio with excellent view up and down Michigan Avenue and the lakefront. The pool and weight room will satisfy almost anybody. Cabs are easy to get, and many tourist buses stop right in front of the hotel.",Y
4982,"This hotel is only ""ok"".  You may or may not have air conditioning in your room.  It is far down S. Michigan Avenue, so there is a long walk to see the main attractions.  There is a subway station two blocks from the hotel however...  I will only stay here again if it is my last option available.",Y
4983,"Stayed here for 2 nights in April 2012. The rooms are clean, but small, all of the employees go out of their way to help, but the hotel itself leaves alot to be desired, at 129.00 per night, I expect the A/C to work, the room was 80 degrees all nite long, and didnt cool off till about 5 am, even with the window open. The pop machines didnt work on 12 of the floors. We booked a room for 4 and the room had only 3 towels, the pool was closed more than it was open, and if the pool is closed the smoking area is closed as well, which doesnt make sense to anyone with an IQ over 10, so people only smoke when the pools are open? This was a 50.00 a night hotel at best, matter of fact, most 50 dollar a night hotels have A/C that works.",Y
4984,My girlfriend and I stayed here for two nights in March to visit Chicago. The bed was extremely comfortable with four pillows and a very clean fluffy comforter. The room had a nice flat screen tv with HBO and a lot of channel selections. Very clean and comfortable. Hot shower and clean bathroom. Coffee maker and refrigerator in room. AMAZING city and Lake Michigan view! You could see the Willis Tower (Sears Tower) from our window. The window also opened for fresh air.One of the fewer hotels that had a pool. It was very clean and pretty big sized pool. Lifeguard at all times and opened from 6am until 10pm. There was also a sauna and a weight room with multiple different machines to use for almost any workout. TVs in weight room. Only negative things about the hotel I could say is that the sauna wasn't working when we stayed there and the air conditioner and heater were controlled based on season and worked by water pipes hot or cold. You could choose automatic or manual fan settings. When they put on the cold air it worked very nicely. I would definitely stay here again only about $120 a night and extremely nice for the price,Y
5001,A nice modern hotel with excellent customer service from check-in to check-out. Great location too.,Y
5002,"I stayed here a few weeks ago and had a great time. Hard Rock hotel has a nice restaurant, lounge bar, and the room was excellent. If i go back to Chicago I'll stay here again.",Y
5003,"I'm actually writing this review from the hotel, so it's very freshFirst off - we drove 11 hours to get here, and by the time we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by 2 valets that assisted us with our bags and took our car to the parking garage.  We arrived right around 12:30pm (we were a couple hours early), but we were able to get a room anyway - for which we were incredibly thankful.  The $50 fee for parking was a bit of sticker shock, though!However - after 11 hours - we were really looking forward to a nice hot bath, or at least some time in a hot tub!  Unfortunately, the hotel offers neither.  (My neck still hurts!).  They informed us that we could use a third party facility about a block away for $25.  No thanks.  We took a shower in a very interesting stand-alone shower that was covered halfway by a large piece of glass, and water got all over the bathroom floor.  Since we were here for the Taste of Chicago, we spent much of the first day at the Taste, which was really great.  Then we toured the city a bit by walking around, but decided to head back to the hotel.  Upon arrival, there was a gentleman on our floor that asked if I was room 17** - and I said ""yes"".  He said he received a call that we were locked out and needed someone to open the room up for us.  I told him I had a key and neither of us called for assistance.  He was nice enough to assist me in getting in my room (I'm disabled and use a chair), but it was still a bit uncomfortable for me.My partner brought back a pizza from Giordano's, and put it in the refrigerator to stay cool.  However, he had to remove the mini-bar items first.  He put all the mini-bar items on top of the counter and put the pizza in the fridge.  Next thing we know, we get a call from the front desk saying they were gonna charge us for all the items in the mini-bar.  I explained that we didn't drink anything from the bar, and the gentleman stated that the person that could verify that we didn't drink anything wouldn't be back until the morning.  Apparently, all the items in the fridge are weighted, so when they were taken out, they automatically charged my card for the items.I've stayed in hotels all over the world - including France, Germany, St. Louis, L.A., Orlando, Florida, you name it - but I've never spent this amount of money for minimal amenities, no hot tub, no complimentary breakfast, and this much miscommunication.This was my partners first time in Chicago, and I really wanted to make it special for him.  He always tries to look on the bright side of things, and was letting me know how much he enjoyed Chicago - despite the hotel experience - but I am very disappointed.  I am not looking forward to him driving another 11 hours without a nice hot bath.  :-(",Y
5004,"Thank you so much to Joseph for the help, hot tips and good advice about quality activities nearby. Zachary and Bonnie made a great first impression and kept up the spirit throughout our stay, always happy and helpful. Great place, great location for every kind of adventure or business trip. Really a welcome surprise.",Y
5005,Awesome decor and a sweet location right on Michigan Ave. Front desk staff is very attentive and even upgraded our room for our Anniversary!,Y
5006,"We loved this place. Yeah, I know, it is a theme hotel and we originally selected the hotel because my son (15) loved the music theme and we got a good deal for downtown Chicago over Thanksgiving.Sheila, the concierge, was amazing. Besides helping with suggestions for places to go and how to get there, she was genuinely friendly and made us feel at home by greeting us by name every time she saw us and remembering what we had planned for the day. I know it is her job, but it did not seem like she was putting on an act. She asked questions how we liked the attractions and listened to my son's feedback.The hotel itself was clean, felt safe, and we had fabulous views down Michigan Avenue from our room. The room was very clean, well kept, and spacious. We were surprised the Hard Rock Cafe was a hike away. It happened to be a warm November night and the streets were filled with shoppers so we did not mind because we were window shopping and people watching all the way there and back.",Y
5007,"Had high expectations given the location and price, but the service really let this hotel down. Our platinum king room was nice, thought it was located in a dark grey, poorly lit hallway.Ice Machine- Couldn't find ice, so we called the operator. She insisted every floor had an ice machine. We spent 5 minutes looking, and called back. This time, she told us because of the business center, we needed to go up a floor for ice. Spent 5 minutes looking on that floor, and again, no ice. We called again, and she put us on hold until she finally found out ice is only on floors 5 and up.Guitar rental- Cool idea,but the first guitar didn't work, Took an hour to get one that functioned. They took 500 dollars off my card as a guarantee, and promised it would be back within the next day after departure. It's now day 3 and the money still has not returned. It took them 5 minutes to put the charge on my card, it's shady that they're holding on to my money, especially when they told me it would be back by now. Had I known how long my money was going to be tied up in the whole thing, I would've steered clear of this offer.Valet service was a mixed bag. Some of the staff was helpful, but one got argumentative with me when I told him I just needed to get some things out of my car. I called down and they told me they'd have my car ready in ten minutes. I came down ten minutes later, and they had no idea I'd called and I had to wait another 15 minutes to get my car.",Y
5008,i love this place,Y
5021,"For the price and previous ratings, I expected to have a nice relaxing time at the W. I was there for a wedding, and I have traveled to Chicago many times before, but this was my first time staying at the W. First, there is no direct shuttle for guests from Midway or O'Hare. Second, there are 4 elevators for 33 floors so there is ALWAYS a long wait (at least 10 minutes) for a lift. Third, the cleaning staff came to clean my room at 9am on a Saturday morning and never came back to clean, replenish towels, or make the beds. Forth, was charged for mini bar items that neither I, nor my guest, used. Fifth, when I checked in around 1130pm the previous Friday, there was a very loud music in the lobby lounge making it nearly impossible to hear the receptionist tell me where my room was, nor was there anyone there to help with my bag. Lots of negatives for the ""5-star"" hotel. However, there were times where the staff redeemed itself: The strap to my heel broke and I was able to call the concierge to get super glue to fix it, and the valet hailed a cab for me and helped load my bags. Also, after contacting the managers regarding the extraneous charges, they did reimburse me. However, if given the option to stay here again I would rather stay at one of the hotels down the street a few blocks down where I've stayed there before and had much better service",Y
5022,"Douchey Decor!  Super date-rape city in there.  But if you can deal with it, it's a very comfortable room and has nice Bliss products.  Telescopes in the corridors that overlooked Navy Pier were a nice touch.  Raucous lobby area in the evening that made me feel old (and went I stayed here I was 26).",Y
5023,I am a little late on my review because I just discovered this site. My wife and I spent our wedding anniversary here in October. We couldn't go out of town but wanted to get out of the house! Even though the W is close to our condo we decided to spend the weekend here since we are big W fans! I had flowers waiting in the room when we arrived so the hotel knew it was our anniversary. They upgraded our room and treated us like it was our honeymoon. They went above and beyond our already high expectations due to years of staying at W hotels. The bartenders knew us by name and knew our drinks. The food was amazing! The pool was better then our health club. All amenities were first class.The view is one of the best in the city and worth the room rate alone. The customer service was top notch.  I will have all out of town guests stay here going forward. This hotel is the overall package. There are still other W hotels I like better but as far as hotels in Chicago this one tops them all. From the min we walked in the door we know we made the right choice. Keep up the great customer service on every level and this hotel will always be one of the best and our home away from home right here in Chicago! Thanks for making our anniversary one of the best!,Y
5041,"I double booked a room for this hotel, my mistake due to misunderstanding of not accepting their offer of an ""upgrade"" on internet. I realized the mistake immediately after booking and seeing two confirmations to my e-mail. I called customer service and was told it would not be a problem to cancel the first reservation, but it would be 4-6 weeks to process refund.  I booked several weeks out and figured they would take care of it. My family and I went to check in, they said I had two rooms, I explained situation and that I did not need two rooms, they said OK they would take care of it. Again thought it would be taken care of. Two months later no refund, I called customer service and was given the runaround, representative eventually agreed to review my initial calls with supervisor the next day and get back to me. Didn't happen. I posted on Embassy's Facebook, basically the same response and lack of action/communication. Think twice before dealing with this group.",Y
5042,"We were not able to check in until nearly 4 pm but they held our bags to allow us to wander around before check in time.  This place is very family friendly, which means there were a lot of young children running around and splashing in the pool until late in the evening.  Unfortunately, we were looking for a quiet place to stay and this was not it.  Our room door was on the atrium and our window was on the street so we either heard the screams of young children in the pool or sirens, car, and pedestrian noise from the street the entire time we were there.  In fact, I rarely got any sleep from all the street noise. The floor was very dirty and had some stains on it.  The Wi-Fi, which you have to pay for only worked about 25% of the time.  And their tech support was no help for that.  On the plus side, while the bathroom is snug the shower pressure was awesome.  The king size bed was comfortable and there were plenty of pillows. There was an evening manager's reception with a free drink and snacks (chips and veggies).  And the breakfast buffet was included in the price of the room.  The drawback to that was if you did not go first thing, the breakfast area was overrun with mobs of young families. This place is only about three or four blocks off Michigan Avenue, which is great if you're looking for a place close to the Magnificent Mile.  There are tons of restaurants around within walking distance.  And there's a Trader Joe's a few blocks away.  Not sure I'd return due to the noisy room and so many young families.",Y
5043,"Stayed here in May 2012. Room was lovely, modern, comfortable, nicely decorated, clean,  large, quiet and easy to find. Which is saying quite a bit, actually.However, front desk personnel were an unwelcoming committee. They didn't smile, didn't welcome us as HiltonHHonors members,  didn't tell us about the reception or breakfast or actually, anything. They weren't outright mean or straight-up rude, but were somewhere between surly and sullen. I would've written it off as one person having a bad day, but two different people checked us in (one a pre-check-in when we dropped off luggage, and one after official check-in time).  I stay fairly regularly in other HIlton chain hotels, and have always been pleased with the attitude and service. Wi-fi was a pain and required multiple tries, calls to the front desk and finally, IT support, to get it connected.",Y
5044,"Terrible experience on New Year's Eve. Careless attitudes, poor communication skills, unfair treatment, too terrible and ridiculous of an experience to post the entire story. Let's just say if I were not a minority, my experience would've been totally different.",Y
5056,"I loved this place!!  It is better hotel in chicago. It is modren  theme and furniture looks good and their staff is very friendly. My wife and and I stayed here for 3 days .The room we stayed was clean and comfortable . We amazed by the good custmer services by all male and female staff. The shopping area  just steps away after you exit. The rooms were not cheap but given the proximity and convenience, it was fairly worth it. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",Y
5058,"Everyone gave this hotel rave reviews, but it has a dark side.  Right next to those nice rooms they have a lot of crappy Motel 6 rooms too.  I booked through Expedia and I was treated as such.  Check in was advertised, (I also called the night before), at 2 and I had to wait two hours for a room.  The woman at the front desk said they would call me when my room was ready, but they never did.  I got to the room and it is quite obvious I am not viewed as a customer akin to there normal clientel because I booked for a reduced rate.  First of all my room smells like a dog.  It is really small, I have stayed at Holiday Inns that are larger.  There is a maintenance door to the air conditioner in my room and the door doesn't stay closed so they proped a seven foot mirror up against it and called it modern decor.  There isn't a desk in the room either just a little table and a shabby low back bench.  I don't doubt that they have nice rooms here but be warned there are also some nasty rooms included.",Y
5060,"I am not a frequent yelper but was so impressed by this hotel that I felt like I needed to share my experience. I stayed at the James on Monday of this week and after a long day at the office, I really appreciated the friendly and helpful staff at the front desk. Check-in was a breeze and they even gave me an upgrade to a suite.  My suite was exactly what I was looking for, large king size bed with flatscreen in the bedroom, moderately sized living room with a coffee table, couuch and large TV. It was great for finishing up some work at night in a more relaxing environment. Wifi was free, they offer a nice high-tech ""Dream Machine"" alarm clock with audio like rain and beach sounds to put you to sleep + an ipod deck in the mini kitchen. I checked out their GYM and was really impressed to see the sheer size and number of machines and equiptment, also opened 24 hours. Their bath products were all natural and high-quality (can't recall the name) and the shower was very clean, which I have noticed is NOT standard at many pretty high-end hotels. I woke up refereshed and headed out for the day. The last experience that sealed the deal on this hotel moving to my top 5 was the helpful bell-boy that gave me directions to the Starbucks down the street, offered to hold my bags while I went and had my bags in a cab waiting for me when I got back. It's the extra committment to service that makes the James Hotel special in my mind. I've got 50/50 luck on finding great hotels that actually make you feel at home when traveling for business so this hotel ranks well above some of the more popular hotels in this part of Chicago. Kudos to the James, you seem to ""get it"" when it comes to service and you've got really fantastic people on your team!",Y
5073,"The Victor Hotel is closed.  Nobody should walk around here, its a scary area.  The Mid is just around the corner (SW corner of Halsted & Wayman) and is a great club for dancing (and they have tent for smokers).",Y
5074,"I never actually got to go because they cancelled the party we were supposed to have.We were going to go to the Holi [Hindu Festival of Colors] party because the state shut it down. If Illinois is shutting down the hotel, I can only pressume it's living up to the not-so-great reputation is already has. I just can't believe they waited until only hours before the event was supposed to start to notify everyone that it was cancelled.",Y
5075,"Three shot, two killed.  This ""club"" poses a crime threat to the area and should be closed..    This is not the first case of violence there.",Y
5088,"Good hotel. I've stayed here a couple of times. Nice interior, beautiful lobby, clean rooms. Provides a good service of you need something extra.",Y
5089,Not recommended ..parking fee was extra. Lakeview room was restricted and was additional. We would have rather stayed at Drake in downtown for better view and easy access downtown shopping,Y
5090,"DO NOT STAY HERE!  Perhaps the worse Hilton ever.  First, expect to wait up to 60 minutes to check-in.  Second, expect to find your room unmade and dusty/dirty.  Third, the halls smell like decaying flesh. Fourth, the in-house PBX phones do not work.  Everything, especially Internet service, is extremely expensive.  I was promised 25,000 miles for all the inconveniences and still waiting to see them.",Y
5091,"The atmosphere in general was very beautiful. Beautiful chandeliers, murals on the ceilings, etc. However, I was not very impressed with our room. We paid $250 a night for 2 beds and 2 bathrooms. The beds were doubles (not queens). It was nice having 2 bathrooms. There were two major disappointments with the room. First, there was no mini fridge. I don't think I've ever stayed in a room without one. Second of all, there was one vent for the air conditioning to come in, and it wasn't very effective. We tried turning the air down to cool off the room, and the coolest setting it would go to was 64 degrees. But the room never cooled off below like 76. We were extremely hot!I have stayed in Hiltons in other cities, and I have never been disappointed....until now.",Y
5092,"We really liked this hotel during our recent stay in Chicago.  Very upscale and beautiful.  My only issues were that the duvet covers on the beds were missing so it had one sheet on top and one on the bottom with out any other covers.  Additionally, the blinds didn't pull down and we were up early with the sun in our east facing room.  The computer screen without an off button was also a challenge to sleeping.  Otherwise a great stay.",Y
5093,"Ignore the negative scores, those ""people"" can't write a sentence with any logical conclusion.I stayed there via Hotwire for $80/night on the 11th floor and had a very modern, comfrotable/spacious room with two beds. Yeah, there's noise. you're in Chicago, not Ames Iowa.I'm not sure about charging $250/night...not worth that much, but Hotwire really pulls through with the best deals.Conclusion: If you like older hotels with some character/charm, then this Hotel on Michigan Avenue will satisfy that indulgence.",Y
5094,"BEWARE BEWARE this hotel charges for everything!! Internet, fitness center, parking and badge storage. Not only do they charge you but the fees are out of control. After paying $1700 for a four night stay I had to pay $45 a night for parking $16 a day for Internet, $15 a day for the fitness center this is completely out of control. Oh but the wifi is offered for free in the lobby but really when staying on the 18th floor and going up and down to do work is ridiculous. I could understand if the hotel nightly rate was cheaper to charge all these additional fees but it's not. The trump hotel and the W has the same rates and provide Internet and fitness center FREE to its guest and their location is far better placed than the Hilton. I stayed at the Hilton for a conference but next time I will stay someplace else and take a taxi to the conference. Also The Hilton is about a forty five minute walk to all the good shopping and dining so if your not a walker you will be paying about $20 bucks a day for a round trip taxis ride.",Y
5103,"We visited the Chicago for a weekend trip Friday to Monday. I used my Triple A discount which saved on the room and gave us a free breakfast. Honestly we never used the free breakfast because it was always packed. We preferred breakfast at Eggsperience anyway, which was AMAZING! The Marriott staff was friendly and helpful. We ordered a movie in our room and it took forever to load, when it finally did begin we had missed the beginning with no way to rewind.  We called concierge and they took off the purchase so we could order the movie again. Honestly, we missed the beginning of the movie again but by that time I was too tired and just went to sleep. We chose to self park instead of paying $55 a day to valet. We spent $35 per day and self park was just across the street. Honestly, we never used our car! We walked everywhere and the extra money saved paid for a whole meal! Save money and self park!Marriott has a Starbucks in the lobby which is convenient if you like Starbucks, but those employees were not as friendly as other Marriott staff. I gave the Marriott 4 stars because the sheets on the bed didn't seem to fit or were put on wrong. Every night the fitted sheet was on the corners but by the middle of the night it was completely off and I was laying on the mattress protector. The trouble with the in-room movie was a hassle also. In the end, I will stay at the Marriott again & will recommend it to others. Great quality for a fair price.",Y
5104,"No free WiFi or Internet, lots of police sirens and car noise all night from the 24th floor.  They pay their CEO $30m a year and don't give customers free WiFi!?!?!?Stay somewhere else!",Y
5105,"For a downtown hotel...choose another! I stayed one night and had two rooms in my name. We had rust stains down our wall and hair in our shower! We told the front desk about it and they simply done nothing!  Horrible experience and will never return! The rooms were tiny and the second room had no view! The only view was the roof and another building! If you are going to pay this amount of money for a room, go to somewhere else downtown.... This is coming from a Marriott employee!",Y
5106,great location....rooms were fine....lobby and bar area was trendy.....they had trouble with maid service if you use price-line and get separate days at a time .....prices at bar were normal....room was clean....bathroom was small.....shower had hot water and that is all that i need....,Y
5107,"Very nice facility and the location is prime.  My only issue is the tiny bathroom, but for two days I can deal with it.   My first impression was the outstanding level of customer service given by the staff.  I have never been thanked so much in my life.  The bed is comfortable with a soft fluffy comforter and lots of pillows.  My 31st floor view was fantastic.  I happened to have been there for a business meeting which took place on the premises.  I have to say the food that was served was outstanding.  I would definitely stay there again.",Y
5117,"Should be number 1 in our opinion for service, location and pool!!!We stayed here in August to celebrate many events and we were upgraded to  wonderful suite. Margaret at check in merely overheard that it was our daughter's birthday and organized a beautiful chocolate cake..this created an amazing memory that will last forever.  Exceptional service.  This hotel oozes character in the historical wing.The Pool was beautiful, the service unmatched  and the location incredible!!Nothing is too much trouble.THANK YOU",Y
5118,"I travel a lot for business and pleasure, so I am able to stay in a lot of nice hotels. I am really surprised by some of the reviews I've read here because I thought this was a fantastic hotel! Celebrated our anniversary with dinner and a show, got back to the room and the staff had put a nice bottle of french champagne on ice with a nice box of chocolates, plus coupons for free breakfast for two! Very clean room, the staff was friendly, had a nice lunch the next day at Michael Jordan's in the hotel. People, it's Chicago! You're going to pay a lot for parking and amenities. Lots of other hotel options for those of you who don't want to spend much.",Y
5119,"Definitely NOT worth paying full price; I Hotwired this hotel for $175/night (about half off) and it wasn't even worth that. Hotwire had it listed as 4-4.5 stars and while it looks fancy in the lobby and from the outside, the rooms are anything but. The beds are full-size AT BEST, lighting is terrible, and the fridge/mini bar situation is a nightmare. I was afraid to touch anything because I thought I'd be charged. Everything is on a sensor and you are charged immediately if something is moved. I've been in hotels that charge by weight or after 30 seconds or so, but never immediately. We were in a non-smoking room yet our room somehow still smelled like smoke and it was disgusting. And there is only ice on the 7th floor, with no ice buckets provided. Also, I went to use the fitness center and there is a CHARGE?! Never in my life have I ever experience that. Instead I ran down and around Navy Pier which was only 4 blocks away for free. I will NOT stay here again nor would I recommend this hotel to anyone.",Y
5120,"A dump! and outdated! Horrible customer service! RUN FOREST RUN!This space just rides on a name, well if you ask me tarnishes a global brand, The GM of this location is stuck in the dark ages and is VERY prejudice!STAY FAR AWAY!",Y
5121,"Terrible Terrible service. I will NEVER stay at this hotel or chain ever again. I travel for work and had airline miles that I used for a room over the Christmas holidays in Chicago. I was charged triple the room price even before we got to the room (incidentals, was thier excuse) even though my stay was already paid upon arrival. Staff were very RUDE and had an attitude that they could have cared less. The pool was out of service and we were told to go across the street and down the block to use the Mariott pool - in the freezing winter. No apologies, no discounts - nothing but bad attitude. I even filed a complain via thier website and I recieved an automatic reply telling me that someone would get in touch with me about my complaint, but I was NEVER contacted. Even when given the chance to make it right, they couldn;t be bothered and obviously do NOT care about thier customers. I am a Hilton Diamond Level Member and have NEVER been treated this badly in any Hilton property. I liked the location but the hotel service was very bad and the hotel could use a facelift. I was most disappointed by the terrible service, lack of pool (which we were not told was out of service when we made the reservation - even though it had been out of service for a while), and out of date interior. I stayed the very next week at the Beverly Hills Hilton and was treated so well - there was utterly no comparison. The Intercontinental neds to take some hospitality lessons from Hilton and learn how to treat thier customers well.",Y
5132,"The view was great!  But oh no what's that bed bugs.the hotel hopes you don't turn on the lights. We did the bugs were literally running on the white pillow cases.after insisting a new room,o.k only 2 doors down? But what u gonna do by now it's1:30a.m 2women&a baby, from out of state.could go on but the hotel acted like well o.k it happens!! What! Disgusting ! We stayed on 5/24/12.&only until 8:30 a.m what a trip.",Y
5133,"Room is fine and clean, reception was efficient and courteous, that's the good news.  However, if you expect to be able to stay connected, look somewhere else.  The internet connection speed was worse than dialup in the old days.  This hotel needs to get in the 21st century.",Y
5146,Just giving a quick vote for this company. I last left totally delighted with their level of service. I recommend it to all of you that might need this kind of service.,Y
5147,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Radisson Blue Aqua for my daughter's wedding.  We were there 2 nites and had a corner room on the 11th floor.  It was spacious, beautifully decorated and had an amazing view.  The bathroom was equally as nice and big.  The king-sized bed was extremely comfortable.  The staff was very accommodating.   I needed a cart for gifts twice and they were there in less than 5 minutes. Visited Fillini for pre rehearsal dinner drinks and the service was excellent.   We had a post wedding breakfast in the Black Sea Lounge and the food and service were surperb!  I would highly recommend the Radisson Blu!",Y
5148,All new hotel. Our room had an amazing floor that reflected the light like tiny stars. Our room had extra wide doors ( for wheelchairs) and the bathwas probably also equiped for handicapt people. The consequence was that the shower was difficult to use standing in such a large wide bathtub.I'm sorry to say that the bar next to the lobby looked more like a cold/clean/white cantine or mess than like aÃÄ bar.The staff was very friendly and the concierge(s) were very profesionnal and well informed about their city.Ask the frontdoor guys where to go for breakfast. They know their stuff.,Y
5149,This is an awesome hotel in an awesome location. It is beauitful and unique. I loved every minute of my stay.,Y
5150,"We just got back home from the Radisson. This place is just awesome.Parking is underground, as with most of Chicago's hotel, it is $43 daily and does not offer in/out privilege. Valet parking is $53 daily.  The underground parking was a bit of a maze, as it seems to handles more than just the Radisson, and depending on where you are parked, you may not be close to the elevators that are for the Radisson, otherwise you come out from the side and have to walk around the building. No big dealThe lobby was beautiful, nice fresh light brown/cream color, the lighting was soft, not overpowering. From the lobby you have access to Filini restaurant and bar. It seems that it was always busy with people walking in and out all the time. The bar was all white, with all sorts of bottles throughout the wall. I did not have a chance to try the bar or restaurant. Check in was fast and quick, I was greeted by my name and thanked for being a Club Carlson member. I was asked if I have stayed before at Radisson, which I haven't. The check in area was lightly colored and very bright lighting. I booked a executive/business room package, which allowed me early check in, I actually checked in @ 11am. Our room was on the 17th floor with lounge access. The common hallways where light green/gray in color with soft lighting. I got 2 queen beds, overlooking Chicago River and Navy Pier. Room decor was modern, European style, carpeting on the bedroom was actually light blue, also the comforter. It took me some time to get used to the color, but it was not bad at all. Bed was comfortable, 2 plushy pillows per bed, with 2 extras on the closet. The mini bar was completely full with amenities and the prices I found them to be reasonable. The mini bottles were around $5-$6, soda $3. My only complaint is that they did not give you any room to cool a bottle of water or can of soda. The bathroom was very spacious, the shower and toilet where side by side, like in a closet, sharing a glass sliding door. The shower is similar to those of Aloft hotels by Sheraton, with a rainshower head, and a shower wand. This hotel does not skimp on towels, we got 4 each, large, medium & small. They were very soft and heavy. The whole bathroom floor was dark with glass crystals that gave different colors as the light shined. My wife was very pleased with the amenities kit in the bathroom, though I forgot the brand name. The coffee machine was a Nespresso and it came with 6 pods of coffee.The lounge was in the 17th floor also, by the elevator area, overlooking Millennium park, it also has a deck too. It was also lightly colored with blue chairs. It is open from 6am-10pm. You need room key for access to it. It is unmanned between 10am-4:30pm. They have a wide selection of magazines and a tv viewing area. You can rent out free of charge an ipad if you have a business package. Breakfast is from 6am-10am, it consisted of oatmeal, plantains, hard boiled eggs, pastries and fruits. Refreshment had juice, soda, water (gas and no gas) a coffee and tea area. Lounge is still open after breakfast, except they only leave the tea, coffee (Nespresso machine), soda water and the fruit tray. From 4:30pm they have a welcome reception with wine, champagne and beer. They also had some chips, crackers and nuts. Beer was Bud, Bud light, Stella, Lagunita, and 2 local Chicago craft beer from Argus Brewery.The third floor gives you access to the indoor and outdoor pool, sauna, exercise room, and an outdoor recreation area with a park like setting. Nicely landscape with a .5 mile softly padded exercise track that goes around the hotel, and pool area. There are some bbq grills throughout the area for the residents, cabanas, and benches all around.Second floor gives you access to the restaurant.We were very pleased with this stay, the hotel is beautiful, fresh, crisp and hip. I will certainly recommend it to anyone. It is within walking distance to Millennium Park, Michigan Ave, and State St.",Y
5151,"Just got back after staying here for Memorial Day Weekend. After looking at all the pictures online and reading reviews, we were excited to stay here. The hotel did not disappoint. Upon reaching the hotel we were amazed by the gorgeous exterior. The hotel itself is a beauty. The inside is equally as stunning. The lobby area was very pretty and we really liked the long fireplace. Its a small lobby compared to other hotels, but it was extremely opulent and pretty. I guess we stayed in the basic room and I was really impressed. The floors are hardwood - I don't know why more hotels don't convert to this. It makes the place feel a lot cleaner and open. The bathroom is extremely large - maybe a little too large. There is a big bathtub and a big separate shower. The weird thing about the bathroom was there were no towel hooks or racks? This made it tricky to reuse towels or even just keep things looking tidy. The bed was comfy and they gave you plenty of pillows. I think there were over 8! There was also a large closet area with shelving inside. In terms of location, it was a little out of the way of Michigan Ave, but maybe that makes it more appealing. It wasn't loud in the area and its a short walk to Milennium Park (and the bean!) or to Michigan Ave. The staff were all very friendly and pleasant.I do recommend this hotel - it is a bit of a splurge compared to the other hotels in the area, but its a great place to treat yourself. If I am able to return to Chicago one day, I would stay here again.",Y
5152,"My wife and I attended a wedding in Chicago last week and stayed at the new radisson Blue Aqua hotel.  They're building one in our home town of Minneapolis, and we wanted to see what it would be like.  It was fantastic!  Incrediblly beautiful building,and remarkably chic rooms.  Everybody has a number one priority in hotels, and mine is having a perfectly quiet room.  This was remarkable in that regard.  You'd never know that anyone else was on the floor, and yet we could see that every room had a Do Not Distrub sign on the door.  Another high priority is a good work-out room.  Many top of the line hotels have exercise facilities that contain only a few manchines....the Radisson Blue ha was seemed like acres of state of the art machines...and even an indoor track (which was good, because it wss rainng.)We expected to see a glamorous new hotel, and we did, but the reason I'll go back is the guarantee of a quiet night's sleep, and the incredibly good exercise facilities.Our stay ws a delight.",Y
5153,"What a nice surprise. I stayed at the Radisson Blu Aqua hotel for business and because the location is close to the office. I have to say that even with several other options in the immediate area, this is now my favorite. The room I stayed in 1401 - was very cool, very different from the standard rooms in the area. The restaurant was clean and the food was very good and competively priced for downtown Chicago. I recommend the bacon fried salmon and poached eggs or the amazing french toast. Happy Hour was terrific! The staff is oviously proud of their hotel ... someone sure knows how to hire talent.",Y
5154,"We recently spent another stay at The Radisson Aqua Blu.  LOVED IT AGAIN! This time we were put in a corner room overlooking the outdoor pool and walkway path.  This room is definitely brighter than the last room we stayed in since it had huge windows everywhere, outside balconies and full hardwood floors.  We also had a direct view of Navy Pier and were able to see the lights at the pier at night.  Just beautiful.  The room is huge and has a separate area for working with a small tv, desk and refrigerator/stocked bar in it.  This room also had a shower and tub we used nightly.  The tub was really large and deep.  Their beds and pillows are awesome and so soft.  The best part of the rooms are that they are extremely quiet and you never hear people walking through the hallway, EVER.  The weather was nice enough for us to enjoy the outside area.  We went for a walk on the pathway that goes around the whole building and were pleasantly surprised by the sponge walkway.  If you are a jogger it will definitely keep you from jarring your legs!  We ate at Filini restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner during our stays and have loved every meal we have been served.  We have eaten at many restaurants and Filini definitely is one of our favorites. The meals are excellent, gourmet and priced very typical of a Chicago restaurant.  When you sit down they bring cheese and bread to snack on while waiting for your meal.  The bar is our favorite also.  They have huge booths for groups and the bar is just inviting and very beautiful.  We had appetizers and drinks and the appetizers were extremely good.  We had the marinated olives, meatballs and eggplant parmesan.  Everything was seasoned perfect and perfect size for an appetizer.  We love to get a drink from the bar and then go to the lounge area with the full length fireplace.  The couches make you want to lay down and sleep they are so comfortable and cozy.  The staff we encountered are always nice and very helpful.  Bob, the doorman is always on task and available in a second.  We pick this hotel due to how beautiful and comfortable the whole hotel is.  Usually something suffers somewhere but there are no issues that I have found with this hotel.  This hotel is placed perfectly for walking tourists.  We were able to get to all the areas such as Navy Pier and Michigan Avenue within 15 -20 minutes. Definitely saves money on having to get taxis.",Y
5155,"Stayed here last Sat nite.Can't say enough about how nice the room, staff and facilities are. Great location near Millennium station,excellent price/value.One block south of the river two blocks from Michigan Ave. Has a European feel with Midwestern warmth. Had Sunday breakfast in Fillinis, food and service was great.",Y
5156,"I am a frequent business traveler throughout the United States and I get to Chicago at least half a dozen times each year. As a creature of habit and loyal to quality brands I typically stay in the same hotels and even the same rooms. I recently received an e-mail from the good folks at Club Carlson about the Radisson Blu in the Windy City and decided to try it out. First of all, it's a great location in downtown Chicago with great views from just about every angle and a short walk from the CTA. A short walk across Wacker will put you right on Michigan Avenue and the Magnificent Mile. Upon entering the hotel you will find a modern and attractive lobby - much like a W Hotel minus the ""cheesy"" factor. For germaphobes like me, the wooden floors are perfect and perfectly clean as is the bathroom. The lighting is plentiful, the beds really comfortable, and the best part is that the TV channels are mostly in HD. I was assigned a corner room on the 16th floor with a balcony and plenty of windows. The staff could not have been nicer or more accommodating. This is not your daddy's Radisson - it's a whole new and refreshing experience - particularly for those of us who can't be home most of the time, but can 'come home' to a really comfortable and classy setting.",Y
5157,"Our room at the Blu Aqua was modern with hardwood floors, contemporary  furnishing and many nice touches.  The bed was super comfortable.  The room was also spotless.  The employees at the front desk were more friendly and helpful than I have found in most places.  They went out of their way to make sure everything was OK.  Of course, the location is terrific.  Close to Millenium Park, tons of restaurants, theaters and everything downtown Chicago has to offer.",Y
5158,"This place is a cut above the rest.  From the moment that my wife and I arrived to the moment we left we had nothing but good things to say.  They have everything; we had plans in the city and scraped them for a night at the hotel.  The entire staff was smart, friendly, and warm.  From the exquisite customer service at the front desk, to the kind doorman and everyone in-between, this team knows how to treat their guests.  It is obviously a meticulously run location.  The room was unlike most in the city with an amazing view, hard wood floors and a modern bathtub and shower.  Our room was brand new.  It is also conveniently located next to a CVS, if you need to grab few random things, for the room.  However if you are looking for some place good to eat, stay in for room service or eat at the wonderful restaurant on location, at Filini. The head Chef Christian Fantoni creates food that makes you feel like a judge on the food network. Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants a great time and food in a perfect location.",Y
5159,"We had a room reservation for New Years Eve and asked for an upgraded corner balcony with a view of Navy Pier at check-in, and Jamie was very nice and helped us out with our request, and mentioned you'll like the room. We did; and appreciated his efforts.Hotel is brand new, and everything was very nice and clean. The staff was all very friendly and we highly recommend the hotel. We'll be back soon.",Y
5160,Excellent value.  The rooms are fantastic and modern.  The lighting is great.  Quiet and located in the center of everything.,Y
5161,"It sure seems like I'm visiting every W hotel in the U.S.  And, I very much enjoyed every single one of them.  They treat me really well.  Polite. Friendly.  Professional.  I visited here with my girlfriend and gave me a really nice extreme suite.  Thank you.",Y
5162,"A bit darker and edgier than most W hotels.  Nice bar, very clean.  Just disappointed a bit with respect to other W hotels. Everything was just good, from the locale to the restaurant to the amenities.  If you get a great deal on the price, it might be worth it, but not for the usual rates.",Y
5163,"I arrived at midnight.  Easy check in.  Room was so small!  Bathroom has bar sized sink.  Yuck!  Told front desk specifically that I was tired and did not want to be disturbed as I was vacating the room at 11 that day.  Well, the first disturbance came at 12:30 am when some random worker knowed on my door.  Next, I have now shooed away 3 cleaning people each time telling them I was leaving at 11:00.  If you want a good nights sleep or some peace and quiet- do not stay here!",Y
5164,"I was first introduced to W hotels a couple of years ago and this was acutally the one we stayed at.  My wife and I enjoyed it and the beds really were heavenly.  Fast forward a couple of years and though the bar and lobby hasn't changed much, the rooms sure did.  They no longer have the heavenly beds or at least it didn't feel as heavenly as we remembered and the room we stayed in was no longer urban and hip but more like IKEA.  Seriously, it looked and feel like something straight out of an IKEA catalog.  I still rate it 4 stars though because it was comfortable and love the bar and lobby atmosphere.  Very chill and their drinks were delicious!  The Acura service was also nice.  We did have to take a questionnaire but it was better than paying for a taxi.  I think we'll try out the W Lakeshore next time.",Y
5175,"Terrible staff.  From first impression to last the bell staff, front desk and others seem to have little interest in the needs of guests.  Too busy being stuffy, condescending and pretentious, I suppose.  Avoid this place like the plague",Y
5176,"We had our wedding reception at Hotel Allegro on October 1, 2011.  Everything was done perfectly - and the food was delicious!  The ballroom was beautiful, very classic downtown Chicago.  The coordinator was wonderful to deal with and very thorough.  I would highly recommend Hotel Allegro for special events such as a wedding.  We could not have been more pleased!",Y
5188,"I had my wedding in Hotel 71 Penthouse on April 21, 2012. Views are amazing, staff extremely friendly, food delicious, wedding planners Christy and Chelsey wonderful to work with, hotel rooms great!!I highly recommend Hotel 71 for wedding reception!!! P.S.Lala Rojas from Golden Lief Florist who was recommended by hotel did a wonderful job with the flowers!",Y
5189,"The single best experience I've ever had at a hotel. The room was in a prime location and was beautifully decorated. The views were fantastic. I got to tour the 39th floor party room where part of The Dark Knight was filmed, which left a lasting impression of beauty and the best city view in Chicago. But the most outstanding thing about this hotel what its incredible staff. They went above and beyond every hotel i've ever stayed in. Most were multilinguial as well. They were so friendly and helpful, it makesbme want to go back again and again. I loved this place so much, anyone looking for an awesome Chicago experience should come here.",Y
5190,"One of my favorite hotels in the area. This was my second stay there. Very cool place and I love the spacious size of the rooms and the river view rooms! Great location. The staff is great, friendly, professional and welcoming. However, was really disappointed this visit. While clean, our room was less than perfect. Very dusty light and ventilation screens in the bathroom, and ceiling in disrepair. Used K-cup left in machine from last guest. As much as I love it, very expensive considering some of the somewhat run down condition. At almost $200/night even with a discount, unfortunately not worth it with SO many other great choices in the area.",Y
5191,"LOCATION ......LOCATION .......LOCATION!!!!!! Me and my husband, traveled to Chicago for a weekend getaway and stayed at Hotel 71! We absolutely enjoyed our entire stay! Here are a couple of our highlights:* When I arrived, I was floored with the amazing customer service.  * We were immediately waited on hand and foot!* Smiling faces and pleasant spirits greeted us.* Check in was speedy and wonderful.* The decor was absolutely divine throughout the entire hotel.* When I stepped inside my room, it was as if I stepped into an oasis of comfort and relaxation.* The breakfast was absolutely delicious!!! Me and my husband are still in awe about sausage, scrambled eggs etc...* The breakfast put is in the mind of homemade southern cuisine.  It made us feel like we were at home away from home.* The COFFEE was delicious!!!! I over indulged and had over 3 mugs every morning.*The hotel was immaculately clean! You could basically eat off of the floors!* There was plenty of closet space and the actual room itself was HUGE!*The chaise was so comfortable, that it felt like I had fallen asleep on a cloud.* The VIEW was breathtaking!* It felt as though we had spent the whole weekend in paradise!*This hotel was walking distance to tourist attractions!!!!!!!I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT HOTEL 71!!!!!!!!!!!! I DON'T HAVE ONE NEGATIVE THING TO WRITE...I would most definitely encourage anyone traveling to Chicago to stay at this hotel...",Y
5201,"I would give this zero stars if I could.  Platinum express travel suggested I stay here with my nanny,daughter, and husband because of location and accommodations for children.  It was by far the dirtiest place I've stayed in and aside from the cute backpack they gave to my 22month old, there were zero accommodations.",Y
5202,"Wonderful experience even with a 2 and4 year old! We went for breakfast 2 days in a row and our server Shawn was awesome! The food was excellent! The portion sizes are a good size and not overdone. The prices are above average, but the food is not boring by any means. Would come again!! The hotel was actually very kid friendly which we had our doubts about. There were cookies and milk the first night, the concierge was good about knowing the family friendly places to go, the pool was wonderful!  The workout area was very nice!! Great experience! The backpacks filled with toys were a lifesaver! We were close to navy pier and the Disney store! The girls loved it!",Y
5203,"This was a suprise!  Valet parking, Omni has an off site company to park our car in a unsecure lot after paying them 50.00 a night for parking.  My IPad II was stolen out of our vehicle and Omni takes no responsible for the stolen IPad.  I asked the manager if he knew that our vehicle was being parked in an unsecure lot and he said no.  Our car was not broken into, therefore the off site tenants stoled the ipad or they did not lock the vehicle.  Omni does not have secure parking for your vehicle or belongings.",Y
5204,"We had the Perfect Wedding!!! From start to finish my husband and I had a phenomenal experience planning our wedding with the Omni Chicago. The food - staff - facilities - and overall standard of service was phenomenal. Logistically it was so easy to get married at Holy Name Cathedral, have a fantastic view of Michigan Avenue at the 676 restaurant for our cocktail hour, and have our reception and guest rooms in one building. The food that was served at our reception was served hot and tasted phenomenal.The front desk and maintenance staff were very helpful and even put up an extra hook in my closet so we could hang up my wedding dress. The entire event went off without a hitch and far surpassed our expectations - and those were bridal expectations :) Sarah Johnson was our event manager and she made us feel at ease and excited about our wedding from the start. She was extremely professional, flexible, very responsive, easy to work with, and an overall pleasure to be around. I am a very detailed oriented bride and we never worried about a thing. Thank you for such an incredible event!!!",Y
5205,"This is one of our favorites. They have a pool which is great for the kids, all the rooms are suites with dividing doors to the living room which has the sofa bed, a tv in each of the 2 rooms. It is such a great location and can't beat the price for the service. You can walk everywhere or grab a taxi with their doorman to go anywhere. We have been back 3 times, and will go again. They have the American Girl doll package, if you have just one daughter is worth it. Having 4, we just go and buy what the girls choose. A fun trip!",Y
5212,"I have never been so disappointed or disgusted with a hotel and its staff in my entire life. During our stay, the hotel placed us in a room in which they knew the door was faulty, making it so absolutely anyone could push open the door, walk inside and steal anything, which they did. On top of that, the safe within the room was faulty, as the same thief also managed to get into our safe and steal tens of thousands of sentimental jewelry and electronics. The situation was only made worse by the horrifying response of the hotel staff, who showed absolutely no shock, surprise, or apologies when we informed them of the situation. The security in this hotel is terrifying, and even the cops handling our situation told us they would absolutely not stay there. While the cops were in our room getting the details, they were called down to the lobby for ANOTHER security breach in which a homeless man was walking around and wandering into rooms inside the hotel, until he pushed open a door and walked in on a family of four who tackled him to the ground. Now the hotel has told us that they accept absolutely no responsibility for any of our missing items, including the belongings within the safe, because of the faulty door that THEY gave to us! Do NOT stay here if you value your own or your family's safety and property!!",Y
5213,"THEY HAVE A MURDER MYSTERY DINNER SHOW!!!  Seriously, it is amazing.  Hotel offers a discount on the rooms if you stay to see the show.  Right in the heart of the city so you can walk everywhere and not have to pay the ridiculous cab fares.",Y
5214,"I booked my stay via Travelocity and got a great rate (under $70 a night). I was a little worried about how I'd be treated by the hotel front desk because of this, but everything was wonderful. Check in wasn't until 3 but we arrived around 2 and were able to get to our room. The woman at the front desk was very nice, and she gave us a room away from the elevators on a high floor. Our room also had a view of lake Michigan which was a very nice surprise. The room was beautiful, the king sized bed was very comfy, and the bathroom was completely new...which leads me to why I give this hotel 4 stars. The door to the bathroom is a sliding door and it wasn't installed properly. There is a sizable gap, and you can see right into the bathroom. That's fine if you're staying alone, not so much with a traveling companion. You can also hear EVERYTHING that happens in the bathroom, including what your neighbors are doing if you catch my drift. One final complaint, the heating/cooling vents were loud. Everytime the heat kicked in at night, it woke me up. (I'm a light sleeper) Final verdict: I would stay  here again, the location was great but I'd bring earplugs.",Y
5215,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Knickerbocker on a Friday night in February.  We are from Northern Indiana and he was picking me up from the Chicago Airport so we decided to make a date night out of it.  We scored a pretty great deal ""naming our own price"" on Priceline, so that made it even better!  The hotel itself is beautiful, we found all the staff we spoke with to be extremely helpful and friendly.  I had requested champagne and chocolate covered strawberries be delivered to the room before we got there and it was waiting for us as promised when we arrived.  We had planned to park across the street instead of paying the $50/night for valet parking but it took us an hour and a half to get through the Friday night rush hour traffic from the airport to the hotel, so we caved and paid the $50 so that we wouldn't have to get back into the car again that evening.We had several questions for the woman at the reception desk and she gladly answered them all for us.We only had two complaints, first the when we entered the room it was a tad stuffy, so I turned the thermostat on the wall down while we got ready for dinner, hoping that by the time we got back to the room it would be nice and cool.  But when we returned it was still 71 degrees in the room (we like it cool to sleep, plus it was just stuffy.)  So I tried turning it down again, but it didn't seem to work.  So I called the front desk and she said the whole hotel runs on the same system and they were currently in heat mode, so there wasn't much I could do with the thermostat, but offered to have someone bring up a fan right away.  The fan helped and we were able to get a good nights sleep.Our only other complaint (which is partially our fault) is that because we had ordered breakfast to be delivered to the room in the morning we didn't put up the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign and we had about 6-7 knocks at the door from 8:30am until we left at 11:30am.  They knocked when they slipped the bill under the door at 8:30, then housekeeping came by several times, along with a man checking mini-bars.  I have worked in hotels and understand that they want to get their rooms ready and I know we didn't put the sign out, but it just got a little annoying.Our room service breakfast was quite good!  I had the french toast, which was awesome! And my boyfriend had bacon, eggs and toast. Overall we had a great experience and would definitely go back again!  But next time we will use the door sign!",Y
5216,"I went pre- renovations, The rooms were a bit to be desired but what gave them the 4 stars was the friendly staff! A bellman gave us a tour of the hotel that many guests do not get, seeing an old speakeasy on a floor that was only discovered in the 1990s. fantastic history in the hotel and worth seeing.  i did not care for the hidden fees in the stay, but again, the history of the place is amazing.",Y
5223,"Stayed during air and boat show. Perfect view from the room as well as walking distance to many of the best spots. Classy bar and restaurant, great staff, sparkling cleanliness. I usually mix up my hotel stays in Chicago,but I will be back for sure.",Y
5224,"Good hotel and service, excellent location, but maybe getting a little dated now and time for a refit.Nice brunch in the restaurant on Sunday!",Y
5225,"Best hotel ever!!!! seriously, the place is beauiful and the rooms are huge wih great bathrooms. The beds are the best, they are beyond comfotable. The room service is fantastic, expensive of course but so is all room service. The food is amazing though and when my mom and i ordered breakfast one morning, we were not very satisifed with the food so we complained and they fully reembursed us.",Y
5226,"Classic...you can go wrong. Great service, perfect location...love, love it!",Y
5227,"Absolutely best hotel in Chicago. Wonderful service, wonderful staff, nice atmosphere and good vibe. Of course, the prices are high, but definitely worth it.",Y
5234,"This hotel had a great location walking distance to the Shedd aquarium.  We walked to the aquarium though the park and used the tunnels under Lake Shore Drive to get to the aquarium in under 10 minutes.  The room I booked was a queen bed with a very small side room with a table and loveseat.  The decoration was outdated and with a more detailed glance at doors, countertops and floors, you could see some a need for updates.  We used the pool which had not been cleaned that day - however it was a little chilly that day.  The staircase was creepy, but I think most staircases are creepy. There was a charge of $29/30 each day to have your car parked.  This is the latest in hotel charge trends, but it still seems a bit much.  However, it was easy to park the car with blinkers and then jump out to check in and let them park the car.  The front desk did offer to get my car at any time.  Wi-fi was free and the front desk gave me the username and password upon check in which was great.  This was an easy and great surprise as I just stayed at a Hilton that charged for wi-fi.I think the noise level of the city was easy to hear from the hotel.  I heard some loud noises at night from the city and hotel which didn't make for the best night sleep.  The TV was not outdated as the other reviews suggested, but there seemed to be limited channels.The best dining option was the diner behind the hotel and a block south with great breakfast, dinner and dessert options.  For other dining options, it was easy to catch a cab.",Y
5235,"Location and price prompted my stay here, which are very great factors. The hotel was clean, looked dated, but clean. Staff was attentive, but there was no personality. Which is fine, we were there to sleep and relax. I cant say enough about the location. If you are walking, this is the ideal place in downtown to stay for cheap. Everything you need is within 1 mile, food, walgreens, attraction points/parks.",Y
5244,Great service! Room was clean and modern. Would definitely stay here again.,Y
5245,Stayed for NYE 2012 and it was great... outstanding customer service from every employee we encountered.... great deal for the new year...the room was beautiful & I def wanted to stay longer :) I will be back for a few stay-cations :),Y
5254,"Great place, tickets for all the attractions around Chicago at discounted prices and no waiting in line. Clean rooms, very helpful staff. Will stay again.",Y
5255,"I stayed here because from the suburbs to drive back and forth for a conference in downtown is a hastle. I stayed with a co-worker and I think our opinion of this place is the same. This place, from the outside, has a tacky feeling to it. It looks old and I didn't want to stay but the girl I was with said it was cheap and FREE parking. Inside, it's not much better. It's dingy and I felt the room was too small. The front desk people were well enough. They didn't look too happy but they gave us place to visit while we stayed. The view from our hotel room sucke. Did I really want to wake up facing a dirty alley? NO. My car was safe and sound and the ""consierge"" (sp?) was great. But the money I saved on the parking, I would have rather taken it, spent a little more, and stayed at a classier hotel.My experience wasn't TERRIBLE, but I won't stay here again.",Y
5256,"Coming from Springfield on a last minute business trip, I was forced to stay at a hotel for the night. Oh did I make a mistake by picking this place. I took the cheap route and they had free parking (hence the ONE star) so it seemed like a good deal. Coming in in the early morning on February the 29th, the front desk girls were super rude and seemed like they knew nothing. Two girls, a tall one and a short one. Boy they didn't help.The water was FREEZING in the morning. I called the front desk and the same rude girl answered. NO HELP. The water took forever to get even lukewarm! Outrageous. The room was super dingy and small (I guess for the price).And what really made this worse is that the hotel staff didn't even make me feel welcomed. My partners and I will never stay here again.",Y
5264,"My husband and I stayed there over Mother's Day/babymoon. All the staff we ran into were very nice, professional and helpful. We stayed in a room on the 30th floor which was super cool.  The room was clean, comfortable and well taken care of.  I actually liked that the toilet was separate from the rest of bathroom. There was a separate shower stall and soaking tub as well. Didn't use the tub but the shower was so-so. The nook is a little small and we had to move the showerhead over so that when it turned on it didn't spray all over the floor of the bathroom. The only thing that got a little annoying was that there was a HUGE Indian wedding going on when we were there.  Oh well.All in all, great experience and we will return if the occasion presents itself again.",Y
5265,"This hotel was exactly like you would think, the regular accommodations but i wish it were a bit closer to good food and bars. The service was great, and Spa was very clean.",Y
5266,I stayed here on three seperate occasions. Its one of the best hotels i been too. The first two times i went the service was 5 star. But this last time i went there room service was all screwed up. The guy taking orders on the phone was rude. But maybe he was just having a bad day.\,Y
5267,The food here is SO yummy! Seriously some of the best food I have ever had in my life! Beverly's beautiful personality shines through into her food and I am forever grateful to have been able to eat here. Good service and even better cuisine!,Y
5273,"We stayed at that hotel for 4 nights and on the 3rd day two our laptops disappeared from the hotel room. We left the hotel in the morning and when we came back at night we found everything except our computers in the room. The staff was not helpful at all and was obviously marking time. The receptionist told us to wait till the morning to check if the housekeeping confused something. At the same time they said that since the room had not been cleaned that day, nobody had been there (did we steal the computers ourselves?!). Later they said they could do nothing about it. There are no cameras in the corridors either. They did not even apologize to us. Do not go there!",Y
5274,"HELL NO!!!  WHATEVER YOU DO - DO NOT - DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!We just needed an economical one night hotel stay during a layover in Chicago.  OMG - this hotel is the WORST I have ever stayed in.  I don't normally take out the time to comment on the internet but this time I felt compelled to so no one else gets misinformed and ripped off like we did!  The Shuttle took 1 hour to arrive, the hotel is dingy, rundown and disgusting, the bathroom is horrid (no words to describe) and the only breakfast they had (if you can believe this) was CHOCOLATE COVERED TWINKIES and absolutely nothing else!!!!",Y
5282,"It is a good boutique hotel. Nothing special about it but you will definitely not be let down. The services are up to the mark and food too is good. What I loved about this hotel was their love for pets. Pets are not just allowed in the hotel but are pampered too. Then you have relaxing in-room spa services. To my surprise, Amalfi Hotel Chicago offers different packages. I should not forget to mention - Unique Packages - Refuel & Re-energize package, Home Run Package and Romance Package are the only ones I can recollect. Altogether, it was a nice experience with nothing to complain about.",Y
5283,"The Amalfi Hotel is a nice, independent and comfortable hotel. To start with, the rooms are extremely spacious, clean and well-maintained with comfy beds and a large rolling desk in the room. Nice and huge bathroom with lots of counter space and AVEDA toiletries. The staff is very friendly and welcoming . Housekeeping guys are fantastic and quick. All the rooms have fast and FREE wifi and the password is given to you during check-in. You'll be served amazing continental breakfast in the morning on EACH floor. Happy Hours and the Open Bar are my personal,favorites. Definitely try the Amalfitini. Each evening there is cocktail party in the Ravello Lounge on the top floor which is always pretty popular. This hotel is centrally located. The State/Lake and Clark/Lake 'L' station are stone's throw away. There are many restaurants and bars in the area. The check-out was very quick and efficient. Thumbs up to this Hotel. Highly recommended.",Y
5284,"overall a nice hotel. lots of pros, lots of cons, and for the price, not what i expected our first time in Chitown.Cons- y on earth did they not tell us about happy hour? i mean i told them i was new, tell me what u have to offer. i called downstairs 3x and no one answered my call, i had to go downstairs and the lady told me ""we must have been busy"" really? upon checkin, i showed up at about 10pm, and was first told that because i was late i got moved out of my delux king and into a twin queen bed room? i told him sternly me and my fiance are not staying in a queen double bed, next thing u know there was a ""cancellation"" and i could get the room, cmon now im in sales i know that line.  the TV is small, not alot of channels, the delay absolutely sux, and i have to raise my arm like an antenna to change the channel. there were cookies on the desk, cant have em unless u get charged 5 or 6 bucks, i mean cmon? water bottle? 7$! and this is not even mentioning the fridge. one of the highest priced hotels, and a small deluxe room, just expected more i guess. Y dont they take our bags to our rooms i mean they will probably get tipped....ANd the worst thing of all, i waS trying heating up food, but no MICROWAVE!! r u kidding??PROS- double shower head is great. finally a comfy bed. i mean extremely soft and comfortable with great pillows. cont. breakfast on each floor is a nice touch. the door guys are extremely nice. Pius, Rafi, Hi :) .  liked the robes as well. really nice location as well. semi nice view, if ur higher than the 10th floor. will try another hotel next time.",Y
5285,"What can I say -- this hotel is CUTE.I stayed here on business.  All in all it was just okay.  It's not my idea of upscale, but rather a decent, no frills, moderately-priced facility.WHAT I LIKED:1.  If a random person asked me where's a good place to shower, I'd say ""Amalfi!"".  Yep, folks, the dual head shower provided great pressure to get me squeaky clean.2. The soft bed and two kinds of fluffy pillows (one round, one flatter).  It's hard to sleep in most hotels, but that bedding cradled me like mommy's bosom.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:1.  I picked the Amalfi because of its breakfast on every floor.  Man, was I disappointed.  Cold continental breakfasts don't suit me.  I couldn't even heat up my croissant.2.  That darn TV had a severe delay, plus I had to contort my body into odd positions just to get the precise angle for the remote and tv to communicate.  In the middle of a program, the tv would reset and take me back to the menu screen.  Aaargh!3.  I had a corner room and loved how the entire wall was windows on one side.  Beaming with excitement, I peak out and find myself with an unobstructed view of a brick wall.  smhAmalfi is okay.  Definitely not my top pick in that area, but I'd stay if I had too.",Y
5286,"I AM a fan... a big fan.My family stays here every time we come to Chicago, and we have had impeccible service every time.  The hotel lobby isn't fantastic, but it is in a great location.  We can walk almost everywhere we want to go in the downtown area from Kinzie Street.  There was a new gym when we were there at Christmastime, which was a huge plus.  The 5:00 open bar and and early morning breakfast are wonderful as well.",Y
5291,"Great location, friendly staff, great valet.- a fuse blew in our room, took about an hour for them to fix- air conditioner wasn't working at checkin, but they fixed it eventually.- elevator was brokien at the time.- all the drink vendig machines were sold out of everything and the ice dispenser was   broken.",Y
5292,"My friend and I came to Chicago for a day to go to a concert and needed someplace reasonably priced to stay. We had read mixed reviews and decided to take a chance on this hotel, because the more recent reviews were actually pretty decent. We should have found someplace a little bit pricier to stay. It. Was. Terrible. I have to admit the location is spectacular and the staff seemed friendly when we first got there. They explained that because of the above average temperatures the air conditioner wasn't working, and it was going to be a little warm in our room. So we think, okay, maybe it'll be like 70-ish in the room as opposed to you know, comfortable temperatures. WRONG. WRONG. WRONG. They threw us on the very top floor, and it was 90 DEGREES OR HIGHER THE ENTIRE TIME. It was ridiculous. They explained to us that if it was too hot in the room, we could go downstairs and get a room change. So we went downstairs to ask. You know what happened? NOTHING. We were stuck in that about 90 degrees room. It was like if we were in a humid desert in there. They wouldn't even give us a FAN or something to at least cool the room off a little bit. Not even the least bit accommodating. It was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. I have asthma, so the sweltering and humid heat didn't do me any good at all. What would have happened if I had an asthma attack and asked for a refund? Probably nothing, because they didn't seem all that accommodating after they explained to us that the air wasn't working properly. It was like they were saying ""Yeah, we warned you, too bad, you are stuck here!"". I mean it was so hot that if I got a total of like an hour and a half of sleep probably. Same goes for my friend. Overall I wouldn't go back there at all. Other than the location and a reasonable place to lay down your head, I wouldn't go back there.",Y
5299,"What an awesome place to stay.  The staff is amazing and so friendly.  The perks, such as free bike rental, are nice. The history (and restoration) of the building is really cool. Thanks for making my stay so memorable.",Y
5300,I went to my friends birthday which was celebrated in this hotel. We were at the upper half of the building and the sights overlooking is just breathtaking.  The amenities are beyond my expectations and the staff are friendly and very polite.I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wish to have a special party for any occasion.,Y
5307,"Excellent value!  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Rooms are good-size, with 12-foot ceilings.  We had a king suite, with separate living room area.  Nicely appointed.  It is very convenient to all the Chicago activities and transportation.  Lived in Chicago area my whole life and had no idea that this has existed, and dates back to 1896, and is on the National Register of Historic Places.  Definitely will stay here again!",Y
5323,"I stayed at this location for the Marriott brand and location while working at a trade show for a week. Last year, it was a great experience overall. Last week was a DISASTER. The bellman, concierge and front desk staff are all very polite. That has not changed. A few of the waitstaff in the restaurant are exceptional as well. BUT, that is where it all ends. The bed is like sleeping on a brick. The pillows are uncomfortable. I had requested a mini refrigerator and foam pillows when making the reservation (verbal confirmation to my written request), but had to call down to the desk, as they had not been provided. TWO days, the room was NEVER touched. No cleaning, no replenishment of towels, toiletries, coffee, etc. I was out of the room from 7am until 10pm! NO excuses. I complained and the first night I was given 3,000 points in my account, an apology and offer to come clean the room (at that point 10:30pm) and a free cocktail in the bar if I waited downstairs for my room to be cleaned. I just asked for some towels and toiletries and went to bed. The second night they gave me a certificate for a free night, as it was already 11pm! I ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant one morning....what a mistake. My omlette and toast were burned. They took a while to be served as well. When I complained, they offered to make it again, but I had to leave for the trade show (I worked a booth). They still charged me! They took off 20%. I complained later to the front desk. They did not remove the charge. They gave me a coupon for a free breakfast that I never got to use :( Not enough? The elevators were quirky for 3 days and actually got stuck a few times for 5 minutes. next year, I think I am going to try a new location. There are plenty in the area in the same price range, some are better hotels. I was considering a weekend get-a-way here but not now.",Y
5324,"worst hotel ever.  got bed bugs and when they offered to dry clean my clothes and ship them to my house, they called me and said that i had to give them a credit card number and pay for my own shipping.  i've never been more disgusted with ""hospitality"" in my life.  i would never recommend this hotel to anyone and i have made a point tell everyone i know in chicago who has friends coming to visit to never book a room here.",Y
5330,"We had our wedding reception at The Doubletree in June 2012. The Doubletree and our coordinator Slavyana did an amazing job on our wedding. They were very accomodating and there to make sure all of our dreams came true! I was set on modern downtown chicago wedding without spending an astronomical amount of money and the Doubletree was the BEST choice for us. The cocktail hour on the 5th floor pool deck was super unique, we got rave reviews from guests on the food, and the ballroom was beautiful! There is only one ballroom so you don't have to share your wedding day with another couple. I even had my original catering manager leave her position 3 months before my wedding and the new manager, Slavyana, did EVERYTHING to make me feel comfortable and taken care of with lots of attention to detail. We used this venue guest accomodations as well. I docked a star for service not for the event itself but for the hotel reservations desk. They were very slow, did not seem to know alot that was going on, and our discounted parking was very messed up. Also the elevators stopped working the morning after so everyone had to take the stairs down 20+ floors. I hope they get better because it can be a great go to hotel for the area!",Y
5337,"The best way to describe this place is whitewash. The rooms have HVAC from a holiday inn, The beds are uncomfortable and the overall experience was very underwhelming.",Y
5338,"Beware of the $1 sale!  They don't say anything until after you've booked your room but whoever makes the reservation has to be the one to check in to the room with a valid ID no ifs, ands, or buts!  Ufortunately they wouldn't even budge when I was going to be arriving extremely late, around 11pm and would not let my guest check in for us.  Very tricky stipulation that they don't advertise until after you make reservation and in very very small print.",Y
5339,"My wife and I stayed at PUBLIC for our anniversary and had a great experience.  The rooms were a bit smaller than I anticipated, but ultimately were comfortable.  The food in the Pump Room restaurant was fantastic and overall the experience was great.  Great service, great atmosphere.",Y
5340,"The only highlight of this place is Jean-George's food. The lobby is pretty but not functional for hotel guests. The rooms are pretty dismal in comparison to Ian Schrager's Gramercy Park Hotel. They are unfinished and dirty. Calling this place ""Minimal"" is an excuse for lacking attention to detail. It seems like the only renovation that was made to the rooms was throwing in some Ikea esque particle board furniture and a cheap white paint job. I would recommend staying at somewhere else and stopping by for a bite to eat. Overall, this was huge let down after my experience with Ian's Gramercy Park Hotel.",Y
5341,You'd never know how beautiful this new hotel is from the outside. The decor is absolutely spectacular at every corner from the lobby to the rooms. I stayed here with a friend and we had a wonderful time. Everyone was delightful and kind and we would love to come back next time we need a hotel in this area.,Y
5344,"My Husband and a friend stayed stayed 1 night (2/16/2012) here after driving cross country (from Spokane, WA) to purchas a classic car and needed some rest. We chose this hotel based on Tripadvisors reviews. Room and staff were great but on 2/16 about 9pm my husband was harrassed by a drug dealer to buy cocaine, this happen right by the valet area. The next morning at 7:30am his friend was also harrassed by a different man to buy crack. My husband discussed this with the valet staff and was told it is not the first time someone reported this. My husband spoke with Andrew the Mgr. who stated there was nothing he could do since this happened on the street ....street? this happen in front of the valet area. I am sure if a hotel employee stated my husband harrassed them by the valet area security tapes would be pulled or he would be told to leave. As a HGI member I was very surprised Andrew did not offer to look at tapes, refund some or all of his points. As I stated the staff were amazing (especially the valet that let him put his car in their loading zone for the evening beacuase of the size and we did pay the valet fee would never expect not to) and the room very nice, we would have loved to return for another visit but we feel security is lacking and Andrew really wasn't very interested in getting to the bottom of this. I will not stay anywhere I cannot feel safe regardless of how nice and welcoming the staff and the good condition of the room. Also please note the score for service is based on Andrew, handeling of the situation and as far as value i used points, although I do not feel this proprty in anyway represents a cat 6 hotel I have stayed in many Hilton proprties with lower cat. ratings that were beautiful.",Y
5345,"Stayed here for New Years! The staff was so helpful and the maids were very sweet. Breakfast was very good. Great places to go out all around the hotel. Overall, great stay. Will definitely stay here again!",Y
5351,Good overall. The room was big and clean. i stayed there alone and wanted room service for dinner but there weren't very many options. Kind of annoying to come and go because you need to take 2 elevators. Had a lot of issues with my key and had to get assistance from the hotel staff to get in 70% of the time.,Y
5352,"Time for renovations. The only good thing about this hotel is the location and the fast elevators. When you step off said elevators you're greeted with worn and dated carpet that desperately needs to be replaced. Like another reviewer said, the hotel is set up in ""prison cell block model where all the rooms are squared around the central atrium"". This makes it quite loud as you get the noise from the atrium bar.  The suites are small, depressingly dim and dated. The sitting area with no natural light reminded me of a cheap motel. With such a small space, it's beyond me as to why there are 3 sinks. One in the bathroom, one in a wet bar type area, and another free standing sink in the bedroom. There are better ways they could have used that space. There is no fan in the bathroom, so it steams up big time when you shower. (mold, anyone?) The cheap little hairdrier provided barely blows any air. Even the teeny wall mounted ones you find at most hotels work better. The sheets were nice but the pillows were not feather like their website says. Now free breakfast is good because it is free. However, the line for the made to order eggs was extremely long and slow, so we opted for the pre-made. The scrambled eggs were terrible. Powdered, Im sure, but again, free. What got me, was when the egg tray was almost empty, the manager brought out another and then promptly scraped the old eggs into the pan of new eggs prompting noises of disgust from me and other patrons in line. His reply was ""What? it's not like people touched it with their hands."" Classy. Luckily I paid for this stay with Hilton points. I would never spend real money here and will not be back.",Y
5358,"The building is very beautiful and the rooms are upscale and comfortable...albeit a bit pricey.  The woman who checked us in was helpful and friendly but that was the last time we saw anyone.  You need to check into this hotel by 6 pm and are given a key to enter the building and your room.  Breakfast is not served until 9:30 am (no special requests) and once it is put out it is not attended to, so after a few folks came down to eat it was all gone....and not replenished.  The maid pulled the covers up over the bed and gave us new towels but did not refill kleenex or toilet paper, empty the waste cans, or sweep.  There was never anyone at the front desk, so if you want an intimate weekend where you never see any staff...this is the place!  As pretty as it was, I won't return.",Y
5359,"Came to Farmers Market on your property and was so grateful to be there.While I realize you are Boutique Hotel I can not help but thank you for holding an amazing event on your property. I have been in the South Loop for 35 years and have been hoping and praying that one day there would be a farmers market in the South Loop.  People were so happy to be around fresh foods, good friends and great music. Thanks for all your effort to bring such a wonderful experience to the South Loop.  It was very very generous of you to organize and facilitate it. Can't wait till next week to come by again!",Y
5360,"I loved this place. It was my first time staying at something like this and it was first rate. Would recommend it to anyone. Food, service, cleanliness were all top notch. We had no issues and really soaked up the experience of staying at a Mansion. An awesome and memorable place to see Chicago from. Concierge were super accommodating.",Y
5361,Our visit could not have been lovelier. From the reservation process - check in - tour - and breakfast -  the staff was a delight. Special thanks to Stephanie.  This beautiful building is rich with a feeling of history. Our room was perfect - comfortable - very well appointed. Breakfasts were yummy and enjoying the parlor after was great way to start our days.  Can't wait to return.  THANKS!!,Y
5365,"Good place to stay.  We took the metro from o hare to our hotel, but had to transfer to the red from the blue.....a little metro talk for you.  the staff was super friendly and aimed to please.  Drawback was my wife and I went on the hottest week of the year and the room really struggled to keep cool.  Not to mention we were on the top floor, and heat rises.  We had a constant temp of 76 degrees....now that wasn't too bad compared to the face melting 103 outside temp.  So I can't put much blame on the hotel.  The location was great and centrally located to anything you wanted.  Like most big cities, you mostly wall or sell your unborn child for all the cab fare you'll rack up.  We would stay here again no problem, and the area was clean and trash free.  Thanks and come again",Y
5366,"Nice and clean, easy and quick check in and out. Excellent service.",Y
5367,"Great location literally right next to the red line Grand Street Station and close to the miracle mile shops.  Close to a large supermarket as well, just around the corner.  The room was clean, spacious, and comfortable.  Even the beds were adjustable in how firm or soft they could be.  Good sized bathroom, as well as a microwave and fridge in the room.  Free wifi was nice too, although they don't have free continental breakfast.  Good service too... the staff was friendly and accommodating.  Parking and valet is expensive though, just like everywhere else in downtown.",Y

5377,"They say you get what you pay for but in this case we didn't even get that. A group of students and two professors organized a trip to Chicago and we all booked rooms at the Travelodge together. Little did we know that upon arriving they would not have rooms ready for us. After waiting at the desk for about 30 minutes or so we left our bags with the staff so we could all get something to eat in hopes that this would give staff time to get our rooms. We came back after about 2 hours and still nothing so we waited maybe another 1 hour and a half and still nothing. At this point we've been waiting around 4 hours for rooms we reserved. Eventually we just had to find other accommodations for the night. And try and speak to the manager in the morning. Next morning the professor in charge calls the hotel and http://hotels.com to try and organize a refund for last nights debacle. Not only did the hotel hang up on him they told http://hotels.com that we never showed up!In short the staff was unprepared, not courteous, and dishonest. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.(the bell hop who helped us check our bags before going to dinner was very nice though)",Y
5383,"You know that show Boss playing on Starz? It's about the mayor and the aldermen of Chicago wreaking havoc in the city. Well it's based on true circumstances. I saw it first hand at City Suites.Boss has the mayor's henchmen do the dirty work for him but the aldermen have to do their own dirty work. It's true. And here's the proof. I was there for the Urban Assault Ride (biking) and I guess one of the aldermen came in the hotel and as a true gangster, he started yelling at everyone right there in the lobby. No pulling anyone to the side. No letting anyone speak or explain their side. He went from 0 to 60 faster than my BMW Z4. For 10 minutes, we were his bitch. It felt like a hurricane hit an earthquake that hit the City Suites Hotel. I didn't really understand what he was saying but I guess the hotel towed his car away. I can't really describe the situation. The best I can do is show you a reenactment of the whole thing herehttp://www.youtube.com/w...Who said that there are no gangsters in Chicago.If you find me dead tomorrow morning with a suicide note next to me, it's not true. There was a hit placed on me.But the train next to the hotel is more noisy than the alderman. You hear ""Ding dong. This is Belmont station. We are at Belmont station."" They have free WiFi and a free continental breakfast. The rooms are clean and updated. All in all, it's actually pretty good.",Y
5394,"Their Reservations Dept. needs to ask everyone their age BEFORE booking a room for them! Discrimination?  Evidently you must be 21 to book a room at this hotel, so imagine the surprise we got when arriving from out of town & being turned away because we are 20. We were told that a Chicago City Ordinance required that all hotels in Chicago have a 21 yr. old requirement. Holiday Inn did make arrangements for us to stay at the Marriott 1 mile down the street & did pay the difference in the room rate & paid for an extra night.   I think the Holiday Inn was overbooked because of Lallapalooza.  The Marriott said they were unaware of any such ordinance requiring an age of 21.  Just disappointed in Holiday Inn for being so unorganized.  We waited in the lobby for 2 hours for our room, being told our room was still occupied & after 2 hrs. telling us that we didn't meet the age requirement.  Then putting the luggage back in the car & driving to the Marriott.  What a way to spend half the day.",Y

5399,"I arranged a stay for my two best friends for their 10 year wedding anniversary.  The price was more than reasonable given the location and the quality of the hotel.  The staff made it really easy to arrange the room and were very friendly when I called to confirm.  Best of all, my friends LOVED it.  The decor was cheerful and yet tranquil at the same time.  They had a great time.  I can't thank the Indigo's staff enough for the warm and welcoming atmosphere that they provide.",Y
5400,"Stayed at this Hotel Indigo (Gold Coast) during a weekend getaway with friends. Our accommodations could not have been more perfect! Great location, convenient to popular shops, bars and restaurants. Loved the atmosphere and decor. A refreshing change from the typical hotel chain. Clean room and great, attentive service staff. I look forward to our next visit.",Y
5404,Nice clean rooms.  Needs better ventilation in the bathroom. Will get moldy quick. Floors become so wet and slippery.  Vey nice place foe the weekend with a lake view.,Y

5409,"I loved this hotel, the beds were super comfy, the room was larger than expected.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that wants a comfortable stay in a great location in Chicago and would definitely stay there again.  I'm only giving it 4 stars because as its an older building, the walls are thin and I could hear my neighbors alarm clocks in the morning; which didn't bother me as I wanted to be up and exploring Chicago anyway.",Y
5410,"The price is good and by good I mean inexpensive. You pretty much get what you pay for. The hotel needs to updated. Personally I love newer looking and moder hotels and the Whitehall is not that at all. But the location is awesome. It is right by mag mile, the Hancock, the water tower and walking distance from many more Chicago landmarks. The staff is very nice and welcoming. There is no ice machine. You have to call the front desk and they will bring you ice. It was convenient that there were 2 restaurants connected to the hotel. One elevator broke for awhile and I had to wait awhile to go back up to my room. Overall I would stay here again because of the price and location.",Y
5411,"Arrived later in the evening after a long journey to Chicago. Checked into the hotel and given keys to our room. Went up the slow elevator carrying all of our luggage and the keys didn't work. Returned to the desk only to be given bad keys again... Turns out the door was broke so on the third time to the front desk we were given a new room. Second room had a broken shower rod/curtain that had fallen off the wall. Switched to a THIRD room. By this time, we were still not given an upgrade for our inconvenience and it was almost 2:00 (2 hours after we arrived!). Settled into the third room even though the TV did not work and the fruit sitting out was old. Really wanted to like this hotel, but it was extremely outdated and the service was awful. Spoke to management and they were no help with any the issues (and there were a lot). Really tried to give this boutique a chance, but will NEVER return.Great alternative to a Motel 6 or Days Inn. Could not even complete with Holiday Inn... So obviously far out of the luxury category of the Peninsula or Hyatt Regency in the area :( Very disappointed.",Y

Also, the front desk was very knowledgeable  and answered all my questions thoroughly, they even gave me tips on where to go to have a good time in Chicago.The bedroom was clean and the perfect size for a single person. It came with a queen size bed, flat screen TV, coffee maker etc..... Overall I am extremely impressed.",Y
5420,"On Saturday, July 28th, 2012, my partner, Michael and I held our Civil Union at the Carleton Hotel.  Following such a wonderful experience, we wanted to take the time to let everyone know how truly amazing the experience was for us.  All of the aspects of the entire event were beyond our expectations.  From the hotel itself, to the banquet facilities; from the food, to most especially working with Annie Parker, everything was so delightful.We'd like to note that if you are planning an event,  Annie is your girl!  From the begining she was a complete pleasure to work with.  She and her staff went above and beyond the call of duty while working with us throughout the entire planning process to make sure our weekend was the best that it could have been.We have already been telling everybody we know how great the Carlton is, and how we cannot wait until we can be there, again!  Thank you to all who helped us out at the Carleton and please know that we are truly greatful for how wonderful you all made our special day.",Y
5425,"DO NOT STAY HERE! I had booked this hotel last minute as every hotel within a 5 mile radius was booked, I was desperate so I had to stay there. When I checked in the staff was very nice and helpful. The rooms hadn't been cleaned in I don't know how long, I had to walk around in shoes because the carpet was wet everywhere and I was afraid to let anything touch me directly. The room was hot and stuffy and the air conditioner didn't do much. I even had to put towels down on the bed because the sheets were disgusting. However, I was charged not once, not twice, not three times, but FOUR times for parking. I had to call three different times to get these charges taken off. And the last time I talked to a manager she acted as if she was doing me a favor by not charging me for parking, even though I didn't park there!At first I overlooked the charges because the staff that checked me in was super nice. However, the General Manager was very rude and unprofessional. They had charged me so many times I was even charged overdraft fees on my debit card and when I asked for him to reimburse me he said he would transfer me to the Accounting Department and then proceeded to hang up. When I called back he said he was the Accounting Department and said that he wouldn't talk to me. I asked if he could transfer me to someone who would try to help me but he refused. I paid almost $200 for this room, minus all the extra charges, but I still cannot believe how terrible I was treated. Very unprofessional and rude. After having to stay in my dump of a room and to be treated like I was the one causing all the problems was just astonishing to me. As a General Manager I feel as if you should handle problems instead of handing me off to front desk staff. He spoke to me very condescending voice and instead of trying to help me he did everything he could to not speak to me (even hanging up). Everyone keep your money and spend it in a much better way.",Y
5430,"Worst Customer Service especially for a hotel that costs way too much for what they give*HORRIBLE Customer Service. This hotel does not assist in booking a room. I called several times, including leaving phone messages (for Chantel) and not ONCE did the hotel return calls. You'd think they would want to return calls to make sure you get a room? I had to call an additional service, the Starline Booking number to make reservations and the only reason I did that was because of going there for a wedding party staying there. If the entire wedding party hadn't been staying at this hotel, I would not have bothered due to the many phone calls and frustrating experience in even trying to book a room! The reservation hotline is also not much help because they seem to know nothing about the hotel, area of town, or features.*Plain Jane, bare minimal decoration rooms. For a hotel that charges $349 a night - $349 a night on up! They sure do have some basic, ugly rooms. Everything is very plain, the room wasn't even stocked with toilet paper or kleenex - we had to go ask for some, the rooms are brown carpet, brown headboard, white towels, white bedding. Plain and ugly.*Doorman/ bell hops - they were friendly and nice but paid no attention to taking care of luggage! Luggage cases were dragged out of taxi with very little care and dragged across the sidewalks and into the hotel - scraping up the luggage until I noticed! Our luggage had wheels on them - they were dragging the suitcases down sidewalk and through lobby without using the wheel side - thank you for scraping and damaging my new luggage.If I could give this hotel 0 stars, I would, but unfortunately you can't click 0. The customer service at this hotel is terrible - they all seem in a fog or haze, running through the motions of their job without paying attention to the care of the customer nor customer's things - and they don't even fully perform their job. For a hotel that is so expensive, I guess they assume people will stay there based on their location - but their service is horrible and not worth the trip. The one good thing about this hotel is that the beds in the rooms were extremely comfortable, that is it.I will not be staying there again, even if there is another wedding party staying there.",Y
5435,"Yes I am giving this place a 4 star review. No, not because it one of the nicer places I've stayed but because of the whole experience itself. Yes, the elevator is a tad sketchy being the fact that it takes an unusual amount of time for it to even start moving once youre in it. But i did have locks on the door and while being peg-legged the receptionist was very friendly, let us look at the room before we checked in and let us know what we were in for. I did put my own sheets on the bed and wore shoes almost all the time. I liked the charm of the place plugs cut off of all the electrical devices in the room and all. My only complaint I have about the place is the creepy guy who lives on the 14th floor right around the corner from the room we had and right across the hall from the elevator...he likes to sit with his door ajar on a chair in the corner of his room only wearing his tidy whiteys and just stares out the door. While being creepy he didnt bother with us at all. Some might say it was not the safest decision for 2 eighteen/ninteeen year old girls but was the only place in/around the city where you didnt have to be 21 to check in and was at a decent price and its nice they dont jack up the rates for Lollapalooza like every single other hotel/motel in the area. I would recommend Tokyo Hotel to a person whos willing to experience something a tad out of the ordinary or if youre just as broke as I was and desperately needed somewhere to stay for a weekend.",Y
5436,After reading previous reviews I had to see this place. After coming into Chicago for a night I went to take a tour of the rooms. It was absolutely horrible. My friend and I left to have a few drinks only then could I bring myself to say we should stay there. $55 was reasonable which left me a few hundred more to spend out for the night.  When I came in a 3:30 AM I decided to take a look at the other floors and the roof. It was worth the experience the views are amazing and if you are a fan of history this place has it. In 1936 Serial Killer Robert Nixon killed one of his victims on the fifth floor of this hotel. The over night clerk says he isn't sure which room it happened in but room 515 is creepy. Since I know the murder took place on the fifth floor that could be the spot. I did drop my toothbrush on the floor so it was lost forever and yes it smells and yes the walls are cracked and crumbling but to be in the heart of the city for that cheap of a price was well worth it. We were on 16th floor and the other people there were Belgians who stay there every year when they come to town. I really enjoyed the experience but was very happy to take a hot Shower somewhere else the next day...,Y
5440,Decent hotel. Older rooms. Very small but nice interior. Old school fat TVs were a little tacky. Nice bathrooms. If you;re at a wedding they run specials on rooms otherwise be prepared to shell 2-300/night.,N
5441,We stayed here on July 5th 2012. I found a good deal on Southwest airlines .com very surprised to only pay 89 bucks. On thing about Chicago is the parking we had to pay 55 bucks. It was valet with in and out privileges. The Rush street area was lively at night allot of restaurant's and bars all pretty pricy but within walking distance. The shops on Michigan ave are about .10 mile to 1/2 mile walk. The staff was very nice and helpfull. If you are lucky like we were you may see a famous person ask the valet at this place to park there car. We saw Brian Urlacler and his girlfriend Jenny McCarty walk right infrount of us. Avoid Jilly's on rush if it is hot NO AC.,N
5442,"This would have been a five star review, but we had some issues with the staff. The same housekeeper pounded on our doors HOURS before checkout time, despite our having the ""do not disturb"" sign hanging out there. She insisted that it already WAS checkout time (once at 9:30 am, and again at 11am - checkout is at noon). The staff downstairs were generally friendly and helpful - moreso the guys outside than the ones at the desk. The hotel itself is great. Clean, modern, toiletries are top notch, and the location is incredible. The bed was comfortable, and the in-room seating was very cool. If I went back, I'd stay here again, but I'd tape a DO NOT DISTURB sign to my door.",N
5443,"Nice hotel, its a little on the older side, but they keep it very clean and the staff is extra friendly.  I was especially impressed by the door men and bell-hops.  They were not looking for tips, which actually incited me to tip higher ;) Also the house keepers were very accommodating and even checked up on us to see if we needed anything.  We were very impressed by their staff.",N
5444,"Stayed here in August 2012 for 3 nights following a conference. Great location and friendly, helpful staff. Comfortable room, good bath amenities, but it is clearly time to renovate the rooms.",N
5445,"Awesome location and wonderful service here! The staff is so friendly and helpful, the concierge even gave us a great recommendation for a massage parlor and walked us there personally. You can't really beat the room rates for the location. Only complaints were the gym was really small and there's no pool.",N
5446,"This hotel is in a fabulous location - many restaurants and bars, tons of shopping including the ones on Michigan Ave are all a short walk away.  Room was fairly spacious, and the hotel staff was friendly, especially the doorman and staff outside.",N
5447,"Checked in late, got upgraded to a penthouse suite so I assume this is as good as any room in the hotel. VERY tires hotel, the decor is 80s mod but sourced from an low end office supply place. Formica counts, white fixtures, floor lamps all but falling over. It's not dirty, and the bedding is clean and comfortable. But I would not want to spend any time in the room despite the deluxe two level suite. I've stayed at other Sutton Place properties and they are a solid 4 star. This one is a shame to their brand, could be nice if they would put some money into it, superb location.",N
5499,Great location with parking right next store.  Walking distance to Wrigley and most things you'll need while you're there.  Loved our 2-bed suite in the separate building.  Great work-out room.  Starbucks next store all is good!,N
5500,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Best Westerm Hawthorne Terrace.  The room was great, very clean and full of lots of amenities. Everyone that workers there is so nice, friendly and helpful. No matter what time of the day or night, I was always greeted with a welcome smile. Even when I booked my room, I felt that the clerk went above and beyond normal to get me a great room at a fair price.    So, if you are ever looking for a great place to stay in Chicago, call the Best Western Hawthorne Terrace first. You won't regret it.",N
5523,"It's a bit more challenging to rate a place when you have no involvement for paying. So take this review with discretion, as I had no bias of price. Overall I found this hotel to be more than sufficient for my needs during my stay in Chicago. It was a short walk from the rail from O'Hare, it was an extra short walk to the office building I needed, and also a lot of food options in the area. Unfortunately, I wasn't getting crazy in Chitown and was here only for a few days for work. The breakfast bar was adequate, the bed was fairly comfortable, and just in general my room was clean and had everything I needed. The decor tried to be a bit more modern and perhaps more ""boutique-ish"" instead of your run of the mill La Quinta. The staff seemed nice enough and willing to help, so I would definitely recommend this hotel! I'm sure this area of the city isn't cheap to begin with, but definitely don't let the La Quinta name scare you off. No worries, there was not a connected Denny's like you would normally see!",N
5524,"A lot of positives about this hotel: it's just a block or two from the train station downtown, so very easy to get to. Very clean and good service staff. The room was huge, and had many of the conveniences that some hotels skimp on, like a fridge and a microwave. I really liked the room and the conveniences that if offered. Nice location, as it's right downtown, but one minor drawback is that a lot of the restaurants and stores nearby close early because it's located in a predominately commercial area. That said, you really don't have to go far to find places that are open later, so it was a minor inconvenience. One negative (and I should have taken a picture) was the ""view"" from the window. I'm sure some of the rooms have great views, but ours was of the wall on the opposite side of the courtyard where you bring in your car when you arrive. Not a major problem, but given its location, La Quinta could have laid out more of the rooms to offer better views. Overall, it's a great price for a night right in the middle of downtown.",N
5525,Nice property. Slammin' breakfast for a hotel complimentary meal. Incredibly friendly staff. They seem to know where everything is. Comfy beds. Pretty decently priced which is astounding.  Love the kurig in the room. Nice TV's in the room too. Walgreens right next door to buy your CTA cards and if you get here before 6 on a friday I would suggest hitting up the cute little cupcake store right next to the Madison st. entrance. It's super cute. Free wifi with great connection. I can really only take one star for the location. It is right next to an L stop but on the weekends there is nothing open on this side of town and the L lines that go to that station are only open until 12 so if you are a night owl like me you will end up spending some dough on cabs. Not their fault but definitely a downside. I would stay on the Mag Mile next time even though i despise shopping and that area in general. I also wish they had a mini fridge in the room. We left enough food at every place we went out to eat to half of the hungry in the city. Plus it would have been nice to be able to chill the drinks we brought into the room.,N
5526,"We tried to stay here for our anniversary. We stay at LaQuintas frequently and are members of their rewards club. This time our experience was dreadful. There were some young women in a room across the hall partying loudly. We called twice to complain. The first time nothing happened. The second time security came, but as soon as he left, the party started up again. So we packed up and checked out. LaQuinta had obviously decided which customers they wanted to keep. So, the formerly loyal customers are sitting in Union Station waiting for a train. Thanks for giving us a memorable anniversary night, La Quinta.",N
5527,"It surprises me how many positive reviews have been posted for this hotel. I've stayed at this inn on five occasions and have had a negative experience each time. I won't be back. This particular La Quinta fails miserably on so many different levels. Here are a few of them: BUGGY WEB SITE SCREWS UP CHECK-IN DATE:  This topic requires an essay of its own but the short story is this:  In certain circumstances, the web reservation system will incorrectly modify your ""check in"" date -- moving it forward by one day versus what you actually entered. I was bit by this bug twice. NO WAY TO MAKE A TRUE ""RESERVATION"" AT THIS HOTEL: My reservations are frequently missing from La Quinta's computers at check-in time, despite having received a verified reservation confirmation number from the hotel via automated email. What this means is that your ""reservation"" isn't really a reservation at all. There's a 30-40% chance that when you arrive at the hotel, your reservation number will be ""unrecognized."" You'll still be ok if there happen to be some rooms available when you show up at the front desk but if not, well, you're just out of luck. NO WI-FI: The hotel claims to offer WiFi but good luck getting it to work. Upon connection, a standard ""terms of use"" page appeared but clicking ""I Agree"" just led to an error message. This occurred on my MacBook, iPad, and iPhone. The good news is that the aforementioned bug was fixed on my last visit. I was finally able to connect to the Internet -- but at an extremely low data rate. Bottom line: Be prepared to use your 3G phone. WiFi borders on useless in some rooms and is non-existent in others. ALLEY-FACING 'BAIT-AND-SWITCH' ROOMS: Recall that there's a 30-40% chance that your reservation will be ""lost"" when you try to check in. See above. The receptionist at the front desk will then see if she can find anything that's available. The ""only thing available"" will inevitably be facing the alley. The great thing about these alley-facing rooms is that at 4:45am each morning, a garbage truck will provide you with a friendly wake-up call consisting of incessant ear-piercing scraping and banging. And it is very very loud. It doesn't matter if you're on the second floor or the ninth floor. It WILL wake you up and you WILL be startled. Every time. Learn to love it. CLEANING STAFF: Cleaning service begins at 8:30am. The loud slamming of doors and yelling and laughing amongst the cleaning staff marks the beginning of cleaning time. You can't miss it. If you're still in your room at 8:30am, you can put a ""do not disturb"" sign on your door. In any other hotel, encountering a ""do not disturb"" sign indicates that the cleaning crew should come back later. Not at La Quinta though. At this place, if they encounter a DND sign in the early morning (e.g. 9am) they'll slip a little note under your door indicating that they're not going to clean the room at all and if you have a problem with it, you can visit the front desk. Not so great for guests that aren't early risers but that's ok because it's more convenient for the cleaning staff this way and in the end, that's really what counts, right? HYPOCRITICAL GREEN POLICIES: The first thing you'll see when you walk in the room is a nice little laminated note wherein La Quinta pats themselves on the back for trying to save the planet, tries to opt-out of providing basic services like clean linens, and gives you specific instructions you can follow if you actually want your room to be appropriately serviced. Being green sure is hip. La Quinta takes this hipness to a new level by providing only a thimble full of shampoo and not a single glass. What they do provide instead of clean glasses, however, is a set of six styrofoam cups -- each one individually wrapped in its own layer of disposable plastic! Wow. That's very green. WHAT THE @#$ IS WRONG WITH THIS PLACE?? : I've often wondered how one hotel could be so messed up in such a diversity of ways. I wondered why the clothes drawers are only a few inches deep -- so shallow in fact that even if you're that midget from ""Game of Thrones,"" there's not enough room for you to stow a tiny folded sweater. I wondered why, during my last stay, I had a bathroom that was constructed in such a way that there's a vast chasm between the toilet and the toilet paper roll. I could go on and on but I think the real source of the problem is that the hotel owners and management haven't taken the time to actually stay here and ""test"" the place. Not all La Quinta Inns are this bad. But this one in Chicago is a uniquely bizarre trainwreck. It could be fixed if someone cared enough to do so. BETTER ALTERNATIVES: Changing my routine is never easy. But this hotel is so disappointing that I've been forced to give up in disgust. I walked around the neighborhood last night looking for potentially better Chicago hotels that I can patronize. Will try Marriott or W instead.",N
5528,"I have to admit, I groaned when my Hotwire hotel was revealed. I have never stayed at La Quinta property, but somehow made the assumptions that all La Quinta's are ""crappy"". I'm happy to say, I was proven wrong! My husband and I had truly enjoyed our stay. We stayed 4 nights during October 2011. *King Bed Suite: The rooms are clean, spacious and modern. I think this property may have had an update because the paint, furniture and deÃÅcor were in great condition. Our had room many electrical outlets, sofa, flat screen, microwave and mini refrigerator. Average size bathrooms with shower and tub. *Service/Hotel Amenities: The staff was friendly and helpful. No bellhop. Free wifi and breakfast daily. Parking available, but it's $36 a night :/ There is Cupcake shop and Argo Tea Shop in the lobby. *Location: Great location. The hotel is located in the heart of downtown, so there's pros and cons to its location. (The cons were very minimal) -Pros: Walking distance to El train, shops, drug stores and restaurants. 2 blocks away from Sears Tower! -Cons: Business close early. The scene is ""dead"" during evenings and weekends. Not many bars in the area. *Random Tips: -Giordanos' Pizza: 4 blocks away from the hotel. The lobby has Giordano's coupons. -Car Rental: isn't needed to explore Chicago, but if you do rent, there's an Enterprise located in the hotel parking structure. If you do a day rental, you can avoid the daily parking fee, by returning to car to Enterprise, since they are located in the same structure. -Take a Drive to Wisconsin: As a huge cheese lover, I was over the top giddy when I found out Wisconsin was only an hour away. We rented a car for a day and drove to explore Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The highway from Chicago to Milwaukee has many cheese themed shops and a shopping outlet with 5% sales tax! -Pet Friendly: Throughout my stay I saw a few people checking in with their pets.",N
5529,"I stayed at La Quinta last night after a long day in the city. Upon arrival they couldn't find our reservation and didn't quite treat it well. In the end, they did find the reservation and were apologetic. Alls well that ends well. Our room was on the 9th floor and a smoking room (gross) but the hotel was sold out and the smell only lingered a little bit. The room was beautiful~this isn't your usual La Quinta. It was quite large and spacious with two double beds. The bathroom was also very nice with a see-thru shower...OooLaLa. I liked the shade covering the window (see picture)...it made the room seem a bit chic. Tons of cable channels, nice working coffee maker (since some people noted it not working). Free breakfast from 7-10am. The parking lot next door is crazy expensive so I suggest parking in the Green City Parking lot but you'll have to be out by 7am which will mean no soup for you!",N
5530,The Hotel is in an excellent location. It is near everything in the Loop. The staff was very helpful. It was a 30-40 minute from O'hare Airport. The hot tub was small but it still served its purpose. I would stay there again. Also shout out to Mike who was working security a couple days. He deserves a raise lol.,N
5531,"Came on a Saturday for an overnight stay. The hotel was clean and room was spacious. The staff is friendly and accommodating. This location is located right next to a Walgreens, pnc, jimmy johns and a few other places. It's in a great location! Also by the Washington/wells loop subway stop. Went into the jacuzzi in the evening and it's super small! Not too many people in the pool area anyways. They offer complimentary breakfast which includes DIY waffles, muffins, breads, yogurt, cereal, hard boiled eggs, etc. Cons: - the next morning the complimentary breakfast was PACKED. barely no place to sit. line to make waffles - there might've been some sort of partying going on because we saw remnants of puke in the hallway early next morning...SO GROSS.",N
5532,"I recently stayed at the La Quinta on a recent business trip. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised as my only experience with the La Quinta brand are the road-side hotels-more-like-motels establishments. Upon arrival I was greeted by a bell hop who guided me towards the front desk. I did not have a wait upon check-in and within a span of 5 minutes or less was checked in and in my room. The rooms are adequately appointed, not opulent or awe inspiring, but most decidedly functionality. I found there to be ample closet space, working space and bathroom space. However, the set up did trigger one of my biggest pet peeves about hotels and that is there were an insufficient number of outlets. To plug in my phone charger I had to maneuver my way beside the in-room refrigerator and then pray the cord reached to the nightstand. Of course it did not and so I ended up using my laptop as an extension cord. Anyone who travels for business and prefers to use their phone as their alarm clock will find this annoying. Unlike some of the other reviews I did not encounter any early morning noise but I did hear a family complaining in the hall when they, upon entering their newly assigned room, found that it was already occupied. I also was able to access the internet without issue. The complimentary breakfast was actually quite nice. I would definitely stay here again when traveling for business.",N
5539,"We stayed at the La Quinta Inn & Suites while attending my daughter's graduation. They charged a fair rate for downtown Chicago. The suite was quite large, very neat and well maintained. They offered a great breakfast buffet. The staff was cordial and helpful to a fault. This is a wonderful hotel and I would definitely stay there again. A real gem.",N
5543,"Be prepared to be jarred awake by the super loud noises of emptying dumpsters at 3-4am every night on the two sides of the building facing the alley. The mattress was below average quality. There are many other much nicer places in or very near the Loop at this price point. The ""breakfast"" is only served until 9am. There were a few nice attributes but not worth mentioning in light of the extreme noise.",N
5547,"Really affordable option in Chicago. You don't have to pay like $200 for a decent room. It's located in the 'west loop,' just a few blocks from the Sears/Willis tower. And there are a couple 'L' stops located close by which makes transportation easy. The river and both major parks are within walking distance also. As for the hotel itself, it's very nice and clean. The room is big enough for 4 people. The bathroom is pretty big as well and our room even had a partial view of Willis Tower. Nice. The best part is the complementary breakfast. It's quite a spread. They have make-your-own waffle stations, hot foods like eggs and sausage and bacon as well as pastries, cereal, and fruit. They also claimed to have free wifi but it never really worked for us in our room. I did bring my laptop so I was able to connect directly and it worked great. Every worker we came across was very nice and polite as well.",N
5556,I like this place. I went here with my sister for new year. Ppl who work here are really friendly. Most great one is free wifi. Self parking lot is located just right next to the hotel. I can recommend this place to whom plan to visit Chicago.,N
5564,"We chose this hotel based on a combination of location and sale price, and could not have been more pleasantly surprised. Should we ever return to Chicago we will most definitely be staying here. The rooms are delightfully furnished and decorated - none of the tired, drab and faded decor we would expect from a hotel in this price range. The entire place has this charmingly David Lynchian lounge atmosphere. Just across the street is Lincoln Park and Lake Michigan. We found the surrounding neighborhoods excellently suited for walking and architecture viewing. Oh, and the restaurant downstairs? Heartbreakingly good food.",N
5565,"Stayed here over our anniversary trip while in Chicago.  It was everything we'd hoped for in a boutique hotel. We were immediately greeted at the front curb and again inside the lobby by friendly attendants who told us exactly what to do and where to go.   The king room we were in was a little on the small side, however they really made the most of the space and the room was decorated with a neat combination of paintings and drawings and pictures. Our room looked out onto the street, which was fine with us.  And since the weather was nice we were actually able to open the window, only a few inches though, and let in fresh air and hear the city. The bed was very comfy and we got a great night sleep.  All the linens were clean and pressed.   The room has all the modern touches you would expect, flat screen television and even an Ipod dock/radio on the nightstand.  Free Wifi and a safe. Within walking distance of lots of great places to eat, or the lake or the zoo. There is a parking lot one block down that charges $28 a night to self park.   We loved it, and would certainly stay again.",N
5566,"My husband and I just enjoyed a great stay here over the weekend. We got a good rate over the weekend from Hotwire. The room is big enough, though by no means spacious. We had a view of Lincoln Park. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and the toiletries were awesome. The flat screen tv seemed to have some issues with some channels, but we weren't there to watch tv. Front desk is definitely chaotic. We tried to check in about 45 minutes before check in and were told our room was not ready. However, people after me were able to check into their rooms. I get that we paid less, but it still seems insulting that you will give other people a room before me. Also, I called for a recommendation on where to get a massage and I am pretty sure the guy was googling it on the internet. It took about ten minutes. I can look stuff up on the internet, I was wondering if your hotel had a spa they had a discount set up with (or better yet, a masseuse who would come to my room!) You can't beat the location and the room is just as nice as any other hotels in the area. We would definitely return.",N
5567,"We got a great price on our room because we booked before it opened. For the price we paid, I was satisfied. There are a few areas in the renovations that I noticed that could have been done a little better, but overall, it's a nice place to stay. The decor is very 50's style/kitschy, but I loved it. We got a suite, which was a nice size. The bathroom area is a little small. You have a separate sink/vanity area from the room with the toilet/shower which is small. They probably could have installed the bathroom door differently, as it's a bit awkward using the toilet. Decent sized closet but the best part was that you had drawers hidden under the bed to stow your non-hanging clothes, etc. I wish EVERY hotel did this! My only gripe with the room is that the safe didn't work. The location is a nice one, right in Lincoln Park. I'm not positive I'd stay in the Lincoln Park area on my next visit, but if we do, I'm sure we will be staying at this hotel. We JUST missed the grand opening of their rooftop bar. I've seen pictures of it and it looks awesome! This will definitely be the spot to be in LP.",N
5568,"Ok, they are just so nice here...have not had that in a while at a hotel. Of course it would be a Joie de Vive hotel...Chip really has a great model.  So close to The Loop without the high cost. Two bus lines and 15 minutes into The Loop right outside the hotel's front door. Very convenient. Nice artwork and views of the lake and park areas. Bikes and great restaurant/bar downstairs. I was told there was a rooftop deck although booked with private events both nights I was there.",N
5569,"Love this hotel.  Front desk, parking guys and the blonde guy who gave us a ride in the hotels bike cab....all great.  I met the manager in the lobby and he watched my dog while I got a coffee from the best coffee place in Chicago.  Courtesy from the top down!!  This place is not to be missed when you visit Chicago",N
5570,"This revamped hotel has this kitschy 50s-60s/Mad Men thing going on.  Not only is the decor all thematic, but all the staff are attired accordingly too!  It was fun and made for a special stay.   I got a great offer off jetsetter and enjoyed the 1 BR Suite for under $200 a night.  Plus, because my original room was not ready in time, was upgraded to a lake view, which had a calming effect, even if hard to view from the small windows. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom fixtures and toiletries tops.  I can see why people have said the rooms are small -- and if I did not have the suite, I may have removed a star. I also enjoyed the cute neighborhood - a bit outside of the main city bits, but close to lots of fun spots, including Second City - another Chicago must.  Plus, the park is just across the street.",N
5571,"My boyfriend and I stayed here this weekend and really enjoyed it!  We were in a junior suite which was a comfortable size and had two bathrooms.  The view was beautiful.  The room was clean, and nicely decorated.  The bed was much better than most other hotels.  The sheets felt clean and fresh, and the mattress and pillows were soft.  The front desk staff was very accomodating.   One of the issues I had was with the elevator.  It took forever to get to our floor and we ended up having to walk one time.  The bathroom with the shower was small and awkwardly configured but it did not bother me much. Overall, we had a lovely experience and would stay here again!",N
5572,I was originally very suspicious of this hotel. It was extremely inexpensive and I couldn't find any reviews online. The Hotel Lincoln turned out to be a great place. The interior looks like a set from a John Waters movie. The hotel is very convenient to Wrigley Field and the Lincoln Park Zoo. I will return to this hotel.,N
5573,"I recently set up a wedding block with Hotel Lincoln and have been very pleased with their customer service. While I haven't actually stayed at the hotel, everyone from sales to the bellboy were courteous and attentive. I'm sure my guests will be happy with their stay this summer, and I can't wait to see what the roof deck is like this summer. The views from each room of the park and the lake are amazing, I can only imagine what it will be like from the rooftop! I stopped in the coffee shop attached to the lobby and had a delicious cuppa. The publicist for the hotel happened to overhear me ask the barista what exactly the hotel was going for with their design choices. From the outside, I was expecting the hotel to be somewhat deco. Upon walking in, I realized it's anything but. I think she described it as collegial eclectic, which they really achieved by getting most of their common room decor from various places throughout Lincoln Park.",N
5574,Great hotel!The hotel is in a great location and lets you get to experience the real neighborhood side of Chicago but allows for you to go downtown in one shot if necessary. Also the connecting restaurants and coffee bar was great! One key thing to note is the staff was really nice and the decor of the hotel was amazing. Also it is located in between two of the best neighborhoods in the Chicago area Lincoln Park and Old town. You cant go wrong with this hotel.,N
5575,"Very cool hotel with a great decor. As another reviewer commented, it reminded me of Mad Men as well. We booked a Jr. Suite and were upgraded to a family room (2 rooms - jr. Suite with adjoining room with bunk beds, own tv and bathroom).  I almost felt guilty about all of the space. Comfortable bed:) The staff were helpful and fun. Loved the uniforms! Attached coffee shop was good. Drawback for me was that the rooftop wasn't open, so there wasn't a bar. That is why it wasn't five star for me. I like to come out from the evening and be able to have a drink on-site. If you plan to hang out in Lincoln Park, location is awesome. Short walk to the zoo, great restaurants and shopping. If you are planning more of a Michigan Ave., museums, Navy Pier, etc... The location isn't ideal. Will definitely stay there again when visiting my niece in Lincoln Park.",N
5576,Vintage. Retro. Very clean. Heavenly comfortable bed. Nice views. Great location - walk through Lincoln Park to beach. Near to some of Chicago's best restaurants.,N
5577,"Awesome hotel, right in the heart of Chicago. It's in a great neighborhood and everyone who works there is friendly and helpful. The coffee shop had wonderful scones and pain au chocolat, along with good coffee! The room was beautiful - nice art on the walls, well decorated. the bed was very comfortable, which is the most important detail to me, along with an affordable price. Highly recommend, and will definitely stay here again.",N
5578,"Some of the reviews had me a bit wary of this hotel, but we got such a great deal through Expedia that we had to try it.  I'm so glad we did--I love this place! Recently renovated, the decor is charming. Walking in to the spacious and attractive lobby, greeted by smiling and helpful staff, you know you are in for a treat. Its location is simply unbeatable--right across the street from Lincoln Park, a couple of blocks from the North Ave. Beach, a stone's throw from major bus lines (the 22, the 151) that will get you anywhere around Chicago you care to go. Our particular room was small but affordable, well-kept and attractively decorated in sort of a ""Mad Men"" '60's style (to borrow a description from other reviewers).  Larger rooms are available, but as we spent all of our time out exploring Chicago, the size of the room was not a problem for us. Oh, and do ask for a lake view room--so worth it! The hotel also has a wonderful little breakfast cafe with delicious cherry scones and raspberry muffins made fresh daily, and a great restaurant for dinner. The rooftop bar is now open and holy moly what a view! The bar is a real party scene on the weekends, but go up during the week when it's a bit quieter and enjoy a drink while watching the sunset--it is heavenly! The staff is excellent--friendly, professional, knowledgeable and just plain fun! Although there is no concierge as such, everyone behind the lobby counter was able to answer our touristy questions (where is the nearest ATM, which bus will get us to xyz, where is the best local place to get an Italian meat sandwich...). All in all, it's a great hotel. We'll stay here again the next time we visit Chicago.",N
5579,"Great hotel in an excellent location.  Rooms are small - older building - but the rooms have been updated and are decorated well.  People at the hotel are super friendly.  Cafe in the lobby has amazing coffee.  Huge farmers market in the park across the street on Saturdays - plan on making that breakfast if you will be there on a Saturday morning.   Work out room is as basic as it could be but has a couple of treadmills and an elliptical trainer, plus free weights, so good enough.",N
5580,"We reserved a block of rooms at Hotel Lincoln for our wedding weekend in June 2012.  We ended up using about 12 rooms.  Pros - very reasonable pricing, amazing location (our guests enjoyed the farmers market across the street on Saturday, the hotel rents bikes to guests who want to explore the bike path along the lake and Lincoln Park Zoo & conservatory are right there), newly renovated (just re-opened in March 2012), delivered giftbags with no additional charges (unlike some hotels downtown).  Cons - front desk is completely chaotic, they don't seem equipped to handle the number of guests they have. They overbooked the hotel and kept trying to turn our guests away - despite having had reservations for months! And they didn't seem able to cope with guests inquiries and issues because they seemed overwhelmed. If I did it again I would still book rooms there simply because the location was so convenient for our events, but I do hope the hotel improves its operations as things settle in. Also - note that the rooms are small; if you want a sofa or room to spread out, get a junior suite or full suite.",N
5581,"great hotel, attentive staff, fantastic location. rooms could have a better place to put clothes than the small chest. need more hooks in bathroom. would stay there again next time in Chicago.",N
5582,"My husband and I stayed here last week for two nights then again last night. This is a funkily redone Days Inn. Sixties/Seventies decor. Very, very comfortable beds. Extra thick and absorbent. We stayed in a Jr king suite which had two bathrooms ! The fitness center is a bit dreary and they could add some 2 and 3 pound weights for us old ladies who like to travel and work out. We stayed here to see our son at Second City so it was an easy walk to the performance. Old Town was great to stroll around at night.  The room was quiet. No city street noise because of the neighborhood. However the people in the room next door had a dog who was noisy some of the time.  They have been open two months do have some kinks to work out. On our return visit, the room did not have cups in the bathroom and some soaps. Also a chair was missing.  It is not luxurious, so not five star, but at a discounted price a good, quiet place to stay in a good neighborhood in Chicago.",N
5583,"Westins are great for business or pleasure and this one is good for both.  It is centrally located to a lot of business - right across the river from Wacker, which is a short walk across the bridge.  It's also walking distance to tons of great restaurants.  Nice sized gym, clean rooms, free wifi in the lobby and there is a beautiful courtyard. This property could use a facelift in my opinion and could benefit from a good restaurant inside.  Other than that, it's an excellent option for Chicago.",N
5584,"The room was very spacious; two beds plus a little couch/seat things. And we were able to fit another roll-away mattress. There was an iPad available for you to request housekeeping or bathroom toiletries. Some of the complimentary toiletries were pretty awesome! Such things included women's deodorant, feminine care products, nail polish remover pads (airplane friendly!), nail files, soft contact solution, and others that you'll probably never need. Location was key, staff members were friendly and accommodating, and the hotel was definitely very modern and chic looking. The lounge also provided complimentary continental breakfast for patrons of the executive floor. The breakfast was actually well above a typical continental style; in addition to the regular toast and bagels, it also had a medley of fruit, oatmeal, cereal, and a cappuccino machine! I also love the way the lobby smells like white tea and jasmine upon walking in (which is what the shampoo and soaps smell like too)",N
5585,"I love SPGs. This hotel has a great location - within minutes walk to the subway.  The lobby is grand and has a clean modern feel.  I asked for a complimentary upgrade at check-in and got placed on the executive floor which means access to the lounge! SWEET!   The room was comfortable, clean, and more spacious as I had imagined.  There was an iPad for which I could request items from housekeeping rather than calling the front desk.  Complimentary items that I could request included the norm - toothpaste/toothbrush, but also deoderant, contact lens solution and feminine products?!  COOL.  Only feature missing (or maybe I didn't find it) was the option to check out on the iPad.  Downside, no free in-room WiFi but they do have it in the lobby. Best part? I PriceLine'd this hotel for $100/night.",N
5586,"One of the nicest hotels I have stayed in while in Chicago- conveniently located, room was comfortable and quiet, and the hotel seemed clean- a much better option that the Sheraton if you're into SPG. The only downer is that the concierge lounge breakfast was a little poor- some eggs would be nice.",N
5587,"Great location right on the river. They told me the hotel used to be a Hotel Nikko which made the lobby decor make a lot more sense. It's a better than average Westin, plus the location makes this a good deal. I was there for a conference and the downstairs conference rooms were terrific and the catering was better than average. The only disappointment was the restaurant which seemed disorganized and not well run. Food was not interesting. There was also a sushi bar in the lobby and while I was there I never saw more than one person eating there. You have to wonder about that... There are way better dining options within walking distance.",N
5588,"Terrible service all around. The first night, my bathroom smelled like urine, so badly that I had to hold my breath as I brushed my teeth in the morning. I waited in line for over 30 minutes to get my room changed. The water pressure in my shower was basically just dripping water out, and it took the engineer 4 hours to come to my room. Then, there was a billing issue, and I called three times, left three messages, and nobody called me back for a week. I finally had to call the front desk manager, who was cold, rude, and was basically rushing me off the phone. All of his responses were completely standardized, like he was reading from a manual. I'm sure other Westins are great, but this particular one is a nightmare and I will NEVER stay here again.",N
5589,"My wife and I reserved the River North Westin for our wedding suite and our wedding block for our out of town guests.  While negotiating terms of the wedding block, were were told (in writing) that the bride and groom's suite would be upgraded if there was availability.  We were ultimately placed in a small suite with windows facing an alley.  It was hard to believe this was the ""Deluxe"" King Suite we book, yet the upgrade we were told we would receive upon availability, but after mention to the bellhop, he took care of the issue and made sure that we got upgraded to an awesome suite.  Kudos to him. The major star deduction comes from how the staff handled an incident after the wedding. One of our wedding guests helped bring back a few of our personal items from the wedding reception to the hotel.   These items included a large Nordstrom bag and two box fans (it was really hot) which were left in the lobby bar with all the other guests as everybody wound down the evening.  My wife and I weren't told that these items were left in the bar, and we didn't know to grab them, so they were left after the bar was closed, by ourselves and several other wedding guests.  We have pictures from that night of these items in the lobby bar and inquired in the morning if they had them in lost and found (we were the last people to leave the bar).  Management and security said that they did not have them so we asked if they would review their security camera as a large bag and two box fans don't just walk away.  We received the run around from them many times and were never able to secure any footage.  Multiple people also called while we were on our honeymoon including mother, mother-in-law, and maid-of honor, but they were unable to make any progress as to where the bag of valuables and box fans could have disappeared to.  We have subsequently filed a police report which in attempt to file a claim with our homeowners policy. One would think that the River North Westin would try and take better care of their bride and groom who reserved a wedding block at their location.  I've always been extremely pleased with Westin's in general but am extremely sour after this latest experience.",N
5594,"Excellent location, spotless rooms, friendly staff and super Lemon Drop Martinis.",N
5596,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this hotel...great location, but the outside didn't look very updated.  However, they have renovated inside and the hotel boasts all of the wonderful amenities I associate the Westin with...heavenly beds, showers and club lounge.  The room was comfortable and the staff was extremely polite and professional.  I will definitely be back!",N
5598,"Definitely lives up to the Westin name. Hotel bar area had great service. Friendly, fast and seared shrimp tacos were nice and had a little spice! Room is spacious with fantastic view of the city. Front desk helpful and fast.  Was here for only one night for client work but will certainly return. Other favorites was the comp water bottle for Starwood members. And really like that they email you the final bill.",N
5625,"It's a Westin. The basics extremely nicely done, with no unnecessary frills. Great service. The room service burger and salad had a ridiculous amount of onion on it though, as if onions were going to go extinct tomorrow. I love onions usually, but there was probably a whole onion between the salad and the burger. Bizarre.",N
5657,"I've stayed at a lot of hotels in my day and the Talbott Hotel was by far one of my best experiences overall in ages. The service was impeccable, everyone greeted me by name and had great recommendations on local fare that really help out-of-towners like myself. All of the staff always had a smile and were eager to make sure I was having the best possible stay from check-in to room service. The room was huge, bigger than my old 1 bedroom apartment in LA, and was equipped with apple tv which made my evenings holed up in the hotel doing work much more enjoyable. The bed was spacious and comfy and the bathroom impressive with separate bath and shower and vanity. And to put the cherry on top there was a keurig coffee maker in the room for good early morning coffee! I was traveling to and from the mccormick place convention center which cost me about 15 bucks in cab fare each way. Not too shabby. If you're ever staying in downtown Chicago and need a nice place to hang your hat, definitely give the Talbott Hotel a try, I highly recommend them!",N
5658,"This place has a ton of perks! - It is in a prime location in Chicago - Clean and cozy hotel rooms - Free WiFi - Molton Brown shower products and lotions - Attentive and friendly staff - Late night menu - DVR is a nice lil' bonus - Quiet - Strong AC units in the rooms ...Overall, I had a really good experience at this hotel. I would stay here again.",N
5659,"Great hotel. Nice, well appointed, quiet rooms. Friendly, helpful staff. They don't offer a wide range of amenities and services but what they do, they do very well, including free wifi which is rare in a nice hotel. We really enjoyed our stay and will make The Talbott our go-to hotel in the Gold Coast area of Chicago.",N
5660,"I had a great stay here. The hotel is small and quant but the rooms are more than adequate. Great location and very reasonable rates. What made this a great stay was the staff. From the bellman to the housekeeping staff, everyone was super attentive and very friendly.",N
5661,"I stayed here with my wife and two adult daughters in early August 1012 and I'd have to say this was one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in and I've stayed at the Drake which is just down the street.  Great service from the staff, great room with nice amenities, great location and delicious breakfast.  This is where I'll stay when I go to Chicago.",N
5662,"The staff here (front desk clerks, bell men, concierage) are extremely nice and helpful. The male housekeeper/delivery food person who works late night (graveyard shift) is a little creepy though and not so friendly. He brought my girlfriend food after midnight when she ordered off the late night menu and didn't let her pay cash wtf? I asked her to pay cash since we were splitting everything when we checked out. Besides him everyone else was wonderful and the rooms and the hotel itself is extremely well kept. They had molton brown amenities in our room and the hotel is in a great location walking distance to Michigan ave, restaurants and stores.",N
5663,"Best Hotel in Chicago! The hotel has an upscale classic appearance with great modern touches!  Apple Mini Mac in every room, comp WiFi and VERY large rooms for a city!!!  Friendliest staff ever!",N
5664,"Wow.  Super fancy, super location, super friendly and helpful staff, super big rooms....do you see the trend here?  I live in the city but had a the pleasure of visiting the Talbott when members of a bachelorette party I was attending stayed here.  All I can say is, if you can afford it, the Talbott is the place to stay!   (Ps...each room has a doorbell, how awesome is that?!)",N
5665,Stayed at the Talbott for a two day business meeting.  The rooms were nice and clean.  There was bad Wifi reception and a huge delay in the TVs remote control and with satellite TV.  The carpet was a little old and  I wish there were more amenities in the hotel.   I was in a meeting room on the second floor during the day.  The catering in the hotel is horrible.  The continental breakfast was disappointing at best. There was food ordered for 12 and there wasn't even enough food for 9. They made a little more food but it was disappointing at best. Read more reviews on my blog: http://www.talesofatrave...,N
5666,"Having stayed in Chicago on three different occasions this is the first time that I totally enjoyed my stay in the Windy city! The Talbott Hotel was just the perfect place to stay and I will defenetly be returning.  A fabulous location! The hotil is simply lovely .... warm,  inviting, and cozy. Just the perfect recipe for a perfect weekend stay!  And by the way... don't bother to take your lap top...the Talbott has a Mac mini hook up to the flat screen in your room, one click and you are on line! Cannot wait to visit my son again! Many thanks to the gracious and friendly staff.",N
5667,"I apologize if this evaluation is in the wrong place, but I didn't see an entry in Yelp for the bar/restaurant, as opposed to the hotel. I visited the bar at The Talbott two nights ago after dinner across the street at Feast. If Yelp had a 6th star, the staff here would have earned it! Although their drink list is still in the process of being refined by the bar's new mixologist, Danny (the bartender) whipped up several delicious drinks that really hit the spot. He -- along with the rest of the staff -- were polite, helpful and fun. I'll definitely go back.",N
5668,"top notch hotel: My girlfriend got a room at this hotel and it was an experience. I am not used to staying in a classy & place with character like the talbott.We arrived a lil early than 3pm check in and they allowed us to check in early, so i thought that was a big plus we stayed for the weekend and the room was very clean and very quiet.Security is a big thing on my list and i felt good knowing that there were modern security camera everywhere you walked. i was even making out with my girl in the elevator and looked up to notice a camera on me.Everyone was very friendly and helpful and that made us look forward to coming back.Its also located in a real good & safe area. with all the train & bus lines close by. Excellent places to wine & dine but you will pay more because this is the gold coast and the safe areas are usually the expensive areas.The wifi wireless internet is great for those laptops and my laptop worked great.Its great thing to have the internet in your room and wireless is a bonus. Oh yeah no coffee makers in the room so you have to go the lobby and get a cup. Also in the bar in the morning they have pastries & juices setup there but its not free. I made the mistake of grabbing 2 donuts and got charged over $3.00 yikes. theres a place called tempos which serves great breakfast a block away. I would stay at this place again and even though it might be a lil pricey to stay here it worth every penny of it.",N
5670,"One of the best hotels I've stayed in. Spacious and elegant room, huge bathroom, extremely friendly and helpful staff. The concierge was fantastic. The location is great. Can't say enough good things.",N
5688,"Stayed at the River Hotel Thursday night for a quick two trip to enjoy some Chicago fun with the wife.  This is a great little boutique hotel on the Chicago River, just a block off Michigan Ave. Clean, modern decor room - all interior was pretty new with ""step up"" quality.  Shower only, but I like not having to step into a bathtub.  Pretty decent room size, too.   Fantastic access for the price, right off the Magnificant Mile, and only a couple short blocks from the El.  Surrounded by other pricier places wanting your money. Nice touches - elevator only allowed access to the floors with your room key; filtered water dispenser on every floor with new bottles for you to fill and go, great for us summer tourists. Front desk personnel very pleasant and helpful.  During checkout, manager directed me to self-checkout machine, and guided me through entire process.  Not necessarily more efficient, but showed their willingness to make the process easy. Price was incredible.  $112 ($130 with taxes) through Hotwire, for a summer night right in the heart of the action.  Past stay at similar time cost $150 + taxes at a tiny, tiny Red Roof Inn off Michigan Ave.  Or you go you big and drop a few hundred at the name hotels.",N
5689,"We had our ups and downs here. I booked a 3 night Fri-Sun night stay at an incredible rate ($400 including all taxes), and the location was great. Valet'd the car, checked in, room was small but nice. Here's where the problems begin... The room was hot, 79 degrees. No worries, we were going to hit the town anyways. So we cranked it down to the minimum temperature allowed, 65, and went out. Returned several hours later, still hot. Maybe it didn't click on? Tried to re-set it but we ultimately ended up suffering through a sticky, sweaty night. This is when we noticed the unbelievably shitty quality of the bedding. Stiff, sandpaper-y, cheap. First thing in the morning, I notified the front desk that our AC might be broken. We went out and came back maybe 4-6 hours later to find that nothing had been done. When the maintenance guy finally came, he confirmed that it was broken and he called downstairs to get our room changed. Waited at least a 1/2 hour for a bellhop to come move our bags, never did. Called again and asked, still waiting...finally went down to the lobby and started to pitch a fit. Bellhop never came, so my boyfriend and the maintenance man dragged all of our bags down 2 floors. Room #2 smelled god awful as soon as we walked in. Some kind of chemical or moth ball smell. Had to argue with the hotel staff for a good 15 minutes about the smell before I finally went ballistic down in the lobby. NOW a manager intervenes... We got upgraded to a much bigger, nicer room on another floor. They also comp'd our valet parking, breakfast, and gave us a complimentary one night stay for a location closer to home on the East coast. Another manager saw us the next day and personally apologized, he did seem truly embarrassed. River Hotel hmmm wouldn't stay there again but I did appreciate all the free sh*t we got in their attempt to pacify us.",N
5690,"Great price, Great location, Great service! We had a room facing the river for our honeymoon and it was only $209 a night! The valet was $25 a night. They have water bottles on every floor you can fill up, a fridge, microwave, and coffee pot. Water pressure kind of sucked. Our air conditioning didn't work the first night, but they fixed it for the next night. It is soo close to Michigan Ave shopping. River taxi access within minutes. Many river restaurants easy to access. LOVED IT! Will stay again!",N
5691,"This is really a three and a half star rating. Great location, helpful staff, and very nice (though small) room. Parking, though, was expensive and a hassle. Don't drive here if you can avoid it.",N
5692,"This hotel is in a pretty good downtown location, giving you central access to Michigan Avenue or more shops on State street. Lobby was nice and inviting, though a bit of confusion set in as it looked like they share an entrance with Club Quarters. The room I was in, while pretty nice (modern touch), was really narrow. A ""river view"" can be a bit misleading - the one I had was more of a partial river view, with an in-your-face view of Trump tower. The windows are operable which was surprising. The bathroom is a bit tiny and only has a stand-alone shower.",N
5693,"Good location and easy check in. I had a good experience with this property. The view of the river was to die for! My room was on the fifth floor. The room was small but adequate for one or two people. Modern amenities, bedding, desk and chair. The little bar area included a coffee pot, refrigerator and a microwave. They have a filtered water station with free empty bottles in the hall near the elevator. The elevator is programmed to go to your floor with your plastic room key - safety in mind. They have a dedicated computer in the business office for printing boarding passes. Small lounge area on ground floor. This hotel is 5 blocks from the Clark cta station on the Blue line coming from the O'Hare airport (cta fare was $2.25 one way at this writing). I spent most of my time out and about town and the room was fine. My only quirk was that the shower water wasn't exactly hot nor was it cold. When I checked out, I mentioned it to staff. Excellent value for the price.",N
5694,"AMAZING!! My boyfriend and I went for the weekend to Chicago. He had never been and was looking to stay at a hotel ten miles away and renting a car for our trip...I said NO! Did a little research online and came upon this GEM The Chicago River Hotel!! Price wise was only $25 more a night when compared to the hotel miles away. I told the concierge that we were in town for our anniversary so they made sure that we had a great room overlooking the river and straight ahead was the Trump Hotel. The location is seriously unreal for the price. The neighborhood hotels are The Hardrock, Trump Towers, etc (all high end hotels). Restaurants and entertainment is all walking distance. Overall we had an amazing stay at the hotel and are so happy about the price and location :) (Rooms are SO clean, and the size is appropriate because you should be OUT on the town!)",N
5695,"I had my second stay at this Loop hotel last weekend and once again, the service was solid, reasonably priced for the area, clean, contemporary rooms with free bottled water and wireless internet. I also apprecaite having to use your hotel key to operate the elevator preventing strays from roaming the hotel halls. This time I was given a room with a river view on the Club Quarters side (sister hotels, same building, one reservation, could end up at either) and overheard a front desk agent tell someone that usually CQ is for their corporate/business travelers and the River Hotel for the public. Recommended.",N
5704,"The location was excellent and close to major tourist sites. We had a room facing the buildings to the back of the hotel, which we didn't mind because it seemed to ""buffer"" the noise level. It was a great historical building, which usually indicates small rooms. This was expected..but was surprised by the minimal housekeeping. We stayed a week and some days the room would not be cleaned up until 3 pm. I don't think they ever vaccumed the carpet while we were there. It took them 5 hours to get us a roll-away for our daughter to sleep in the first night. The staff was somewhat helpful when we asked them a few questions about how to get to the orange line to get to the Mid-way airport. The restaurant downstairs had good food, but a bit pricey I felt for the portion size. Checking in and out was really fast and they stored our luggage for several hours on the last day. The bathroom flooring did have a ""urine"" smell to it. I believe someone in an another review also had mentioned that as well. The filtered water/water bottles was a perfect addition. We had a few days where there was not enough warm water when showering in the morning. I was shocked to find out that this hotel throws out all the plastic/paper and does not recycle anything. I took our empty plastic bottles down to the street side recylce bin myself. In all it was a good location for the money.",N
5705,"It was our first time to Chicago; we didn't know what to expect. I booked this hotel off of the great reviews on Yelp. We were very pleased with this hotel, easy check-in, clean, updated rooms, friendly staff. Added bonuses of free chilled bottled water stations on every floor and free wifi! GREAT location; we walked everywhere. Close to a lot of great restaurants as well. We defiantly recommend this hotel and will stay here for our next Chicago visit!",N
5719,"I used the Crowne Plaza as the host hotel for my wedding at Loft on Lake.  Location-wise is was great  for that venue, although less fun if my guests wanted to explore the more touristy things in Chicago in their free time.  It's also right off 90/94, so guests driving in from out of town can find it pretty easily.  Despite looking pretty drab from the outside, the interior is actually pretty inviting. Lena in the Sales department did a great job reserving blocks of rooms for the guests and responding quickly to my questions and requests leading up to the big day.  The check-in staff were able to hand out welcome bags that we had assembled  upon checking in.  Pricing was pretty good given their location. Overall the out of towners were very happy with the place. Important things to know -  parking is pricey valet only, although there are cheaper pay lots nearby too.  Restaurants nearby are the ones in Greek town or the one in the hotel.  I had the breakfast buffet in the hotel, which was good, although it was your typical fare at typical hotel price (some of my guests had breakfast vouchers). We had a 2 room suite for the bridal party, which was spacious, comfortable, and modern.  Family liked being able to run across the street to Dominicks for snacks and food for the room while everyone was getting ready. Overall I was very happy with the service and accommodations here.",N
5720,"It wasn't hard to find this hotel when I emerged from the train station: it's a tall building with a big ""Crowne Plaza"" sign at the top. Three stars is the average rating here, and that seems right to me.  My room was not outstanding in any way, but it was comfortable enough and I slept well.  The bathroom was small; ""narrow"" is the first word that comes to mind.  The counter is a thin piece of moulded plastic -- not something that suggests luxury. Here are a few positives: the folk at the front desk were perfectly friendly; the elevators were fast-moving and fast-arriving; the hotel is well situated if you want to visit UIC or hang out in Greektown.  The gym is a room with a couple of Precors, some treadmills and even some free weights.  It looked OK but I skipped my workout to write yelp reviews.",N
5721,"It is close to great places to eat, but when I reserved a King room, they gave me two double beds, so my husband & I had to sleep in separate beds for the night.  Annoying.  They said it was because a conference was there that weekend (it was Thursday night) and they filled everything up with them.  And I'm sure they were traveling with their spouses & needed a King bed.  They didn't even have any queens & were very rude about the whole checking in process.  Like I was doing them a favor by coming there.  The rooms were clean, but besides being close to good food that's all the positive I have to say about it.  Thank goodness I was only there for a night, I won't be going back there.",N
5722,"Location is really good, the rates are pretty okay, and the design of the room is nice. We got Executice Suite on the 17th floor (as Platinum member) and the room was really beautiful, the washroom was nice and very clean, with lots of items as shampoo, lotions, mouth wash, eye mask, ear plugs, water, etc. and free Wi-Fi access. 2 balconies, nice views to the Sears Toweer and highway (I dont mind). Many restaurants around (many of them Greek) and Starbucks right accross the street! One minus though - they only have walet parking, no regular. So its pretty complicated to get the card whenever you want... However, I am very happy with my decision to stay here. Update: 2 minuses: 1) The heating - it was really loud and blowing in your face all night long, I couldnt even hair the TV (in bedroom). It was also little broken so the wind from outside was blowing inside like crazy. 2) No fridge in the room. I guess I could have asked for it so its no big deal.",N
5723,"My doctor booked my sleep study at this location, thinking it would be better than the sterile environment of a sleep clinic. Well, I've had to deal with drilling in the walls starting at 11:30pm. It's now 1:38am, and this has been going on every 30 minutes for 10-15 minutes at a time. I have taken video evidence, as this is ridiculous. When I called down to the front desk, I was told that the owner's brother was doing the construction and that it would not stop. I reminded them that their core business is having people pay to sleep in their facility, and that drilling in the walls late at night goes against it. He said there was nothing he could do. Never again will I stay in this pit, where they don't value business.",N
5726,Nice rooms. Decent restaurant downstairs. Parking costs extra. Slow internet connection.,N
5728,"First of all it cost $399 to book a single room for 1 night which is an outrageous price. It was a standard room that mimics any of the major chain hotels. After staying there I have been trying to get an electronic invoice, but to no avail. I have called 5 times now and been given the run around assuring me that I should receive the invoice in my email, but still have not...",N
5758,"As a former resident of Chicago, I like to go back and visit frequently.  And when I do, I always try to stay at the Heart O' Chicago.  Decent accommodations for a very low price.  The rooms simple and usually clean.  Free wi-fi is a perk.  Free parking right out front.  The continental breakfast has improved over the years - what used to be tiny cups of coffee and a few donuts is now coffee, milk, juice, and plenty of food options.  The biggest drawback is that the walls are QUITE thin (the last time I stayed there, my dad was in the room next door and we could have conversations with each other without yelling... yikes).  But that's not enough to keep me away, and I'll continue to stay at the HoC for trips to come.",N
5770,"What a pleasant stay! We were just here for a weekend but we were very impressed. The staff was courteous and accommodating. When we asked the valet for a cab, he offered to take us since it was only a mile or so away. The room was spacious and clean. The only drawback is that it's not really near a lot of ""touristy"" activities.",N
5771,"I stayed here about 3 weeks ago. I booked two rooms, but they gave me confirmations for four rooms instead. If I hadn't called to fix this, they would have charged me for cancelling two rooms. The stay at the hotel was alright. The rooms were clean and very basic. The dinner downstairs was alright. The buffet wasn't very consistent. One beef dish was very bland, but the next batch they brought out was overwhelmingly filled with pepper corns. Like I stated earlier, I booked the rooms with my card. However, a different card by a different person was used to pay with it. I received copies of the receipt by email and my card number isn't listed whatsoever as the form of payment. Now, can you explain to me why I got charged $200 by the hotel? Never again.",N
5772,"This place is ""ok."" It's a little off the beaten path so not too crazy but yet you will see a few homeless people wondering around. I think their valet only option is ridiculous with ample spaces.  The valet people were a tad rude a few times in the three days we stayed. The housekeeping didn't stock The coffee 2 out of 3 days.  I did however love Rooks Lounge. Decent food and one of the best bloody Mary's I ever had. And I'm a complete Bloody Mary snob. Overall good stay.",N
5773,"Hidden gem! We just left this hotel, and let me tell you something... we had a blast! Quiet location, convenient to Little Italy, Greek Town, United Center, Union Park, blue line and pink line are just 2 blocks away, and hotel provides a free shuttle within 1 mile radius. Front Desk, Valet, Restaurant and Housekeeping staff were awesome. For every question we had, they had an answer. Rooms were nice, fresh and most important clean. We order 625 Salad and Club Sandwich at their restaurant twice, because it was soo delicious. Parking is $30, valet only, but hey, I this is the cheapest hotel parking in Chicago. Overall, we had a great time, and we will be back for Lollapalooza. See you soon!!!",N
5779,"Try the restaurant inside the Hotel, Rooks Corner! The food is really good, they always have drink specials and the service is great! Plus free parking for 2 hrs! That's a DEAL!",N
5784,"Dog friendly!  ($50 pet fee) To my wife and I, our dog is our child (yep we are those kind of people), and pet friendly is very important to us. The Staff at this place flat out ROCKS!!! Angie and the rest of the front desk/hotel staff were super friendly and helpful. We originally had a second floor room which was a problem since our Greyhound is really bad at going up and down steps. Angie got us a room on the ground floor and made sure it was directly below our original room  to ease the transition. I did not find the rooms to be as bad as some have posted. They are what they are.. We had a flat screen tv, modern HVAC, and a decent wi-fi signal. The decor was typical Ramada Inn and as Lisa B conveyed, it's in a decent location. My only complaints are that we did not have a fridge in the room and the doors opening and closing were very loud. I doubt you can find a better pet friendly hotel for the price in the area.",N
5785,"It was a very decent hotel on the cheap.  The staff was very helpful, room was clean.  Bed was about what I'd expect for the price.",N
5786,"I attended a week-long training in their conference rooms. The conference rooms were very roomy, clean, and the staff was accomodating. We were provided with water pitchers to keep the attendees hydrated and also provided with lunch in their dining area. The linen table cloths and napkins gave a really nice touch along with the helpful wait staff that were attentive to our needs.Yes the conference rooms were air-conditionsed and I recommend bringing a layer to wear on top, because it can get chilly.",N
5787,"I am torn with how I want to rate this hotel. I intentionally returned here for the location. It is the only hotel I am aware of that allows one to easily walk around Hyde Park. People complain of the room layout, the fact it is old, etc...yes...all of that is true. I come here because I don't need all the fancy amenities that others need. Here is why I like this hotel: *It is in Hyde Park and the free art center is a block away. *It is on the line 6, which takes me downtown and fast. *It is cheap. *It is clean. *The shower head freaking rocks. If you want to be spoiled with amenities and pay a shit ton, go downtown. If you want safety, cleanliness and basics, stay here.",N
5788,"Horibble hotel.  The wireless internet will not connect in the room.  The signal is to weak.  The hotel room has a funky odor and it is very noisy.  You can hear every little sound.  I highly recommend you look to stay somewhere else.  Don't let the cheap rates fool you, you get what you pay for.  It is old and in need of a major update.",N
5789,The free wireless advertised doesn't exist. Room layout sucks.  There isn't a plugin within laptop power adapter reach of the desk. I won't be staying here again.,N
5799,"Was here for a one night stay. It's a warmed over two-star. The help is very friendly, and the bed was comfy. If that's all you need, it's a four star. The bathroom was midget sized, the flapper ball in the toilet needed changing, and honestly, the room is just too small. Go away from here if you're a plus-sized person although it's just at the edge of tolerance for average sized people. The WiFi was very slow and oversubscribed. It failed several times. The restaurant was covered in another review. It's not bad. There is no breakfast plan here, although they will serve up breakfast for group bookings. The rooms don't have much sound insulation, and we could tell you verbatim the phone conversations in the room next door. We didn't try the TV, although it looked good. Could have been worse, I suppose.",N
5806,"This place was as good as it get, very reasonable and affordable. I recently moved into Chicago for the Occupy movement, and found that this place meets all my needs. The staff was very kind and warming and even helped me to my room with my bags. I would recommend this beautiful hotel to anyone looking for a great place to spend the night.",Y
5814,"BED BUGS!!!APPEARS very clean and just old, BUT I only stayed ONE night after prepaying for THREE because i was bitten so severly. I wish I could upload a picture of my arm (the one that was under my pillow while I slept).  Only laid down for 5 hours! I should have been wary when on their website they stipulate NO REFUNDS FOR ANY REASONS - it's because they probably know what is happening.  I showed my arm to the front desk clerk, and she did not appear suprised at all. Said she would ""Contact the maid"" !!!  Really, the maid, for bedbugs?!? Unbelieveable.DO NOT STAY",Y
5822,"If you're looking for a Marriott or Hilton, go to a Marriott or Hilton.  I have the opportunity to stay in the upscale hotels while traveling for business and have no issues with staying at the Heart O'Chicago.The HOC is a economic alternative when my wife and i travel to Chicago a couple of times per year to visit our son.  It meets all of the basic criteria you look for when you're planning most of your time visiting the city.  It is clean, affordable, and conveniently located to the Northwest side so that we do not have to travel far.",Y
5826,Room ok ... Still had a bad experience,Y
5830,"Fantastic location, friendly staff and nice accommodations. The room is not large but adequate for 1 or 2 people. My daughter and I stayed 2 nights and were very pleased with our room. We overlooked the river. Initially we were assigned a room 2 floors higher but they were working on the AC. The technician let us into our new room and the front desk sent up our new keys. We were able to check in early with no problem. We requested a late check out, paid a little extra for that but it was worth it. The bottled water available in the hall was very welcomed with the high temps!! I would definitely stay there again.",Y
5831,"This boutique hotel is in an excellent location and the staff  (both restaurant and housekeeping) are absolutely wonderful. It's easy to catch a cab or to walk along the river or lakefront. The restaurant serves good, reasonably priced food. You can get great salads, delicious breakfasts and appetizers and can sit outside or inside. I found the microwave, coffee machine and fridge very useful in the suite and liked the separate seating area with additional TV. Our room was on the back side of the hotel and was very quiet and extremely clean. I highly recommend this hotel.",Y
5838,"All Westins are definitely nice and so was this one. My only issue was with the front desk, who seemed a bit annoyed at us for requesting a view of Michigan Ave. But the place is 100% clean which helps a TON. Really was pleased.",Y
5842,"A post scriptum to my earlier less than positive review.  A few days after returning home the Hotel Lincoln sent me a survey to fill out about my stay. I again gave less than stellar comments. Imagine my very pleasant surprise when a day or so later I was contacted by a member of the staff, who 1) apologized for my inconvenience, 2) told me that one of my suggestions had already been acted upon, and they were looking into my comments about the room, and 3) and informed me that he was sending me a certificate for a complimentary night's stay at the hotel. I am impressed with the personal follow-up and attention. This is more than I would have ever expected, and have not experienced this type of courteous response from any other hotel I have stayed at. Kudos to the Hotel Lincoln for going above and beyond the call of duty in trying to make the customer happy. I am looking forward to returning to Chicago in the near future.",Y
5843,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel because it was pretty cheap (112$ a night) and had some great reviews. I have to say, we were overall pleased with it. When we got there, the staff was VERY nice and helpful. Our room was very cute, very clean, but very small. Not a big deal thought if you're not going to spend too much time in it. The hotel was right across from Lincoln Park (really pretty park with a free zoo in it). And close to buses and trains that would take you downtown or to several attractions.The only negative point I could think of when it comes to this hotel is the parking. You can do valet for over 40$ a day. Instead, we parked at a garage a few blocks down for $20 a day, and used the transit system the entire trip.",Y
5844,"I choose this hotel via Hotwire and couldn't be happier.  Mark at the front desk checked us in last night and was wonderful.  Then this morning Katie helped me out so much by rolling over my room to elimate an interruption in the room.   What a pleasant surprise at 830 in the morning.  A great staff , location, hip modern feel stay here if you can.",Y
5845,"I booked this hotel last minute on a trip to Chicago. From the moment I walked into Hotel Lincoln I was well taken care of. The entire staff was helpful and friendly. They offered up great advice for places to eat and remembered me the next day. Do not book this hotel if you are looking for a large, luxurious suite but please book it if you are looking for a hotel that is a little hip, amazing location and a great staff. I would absolutely stay there again and recommend it for most of my friends.",Y
