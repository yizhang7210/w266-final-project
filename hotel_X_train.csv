2137,Used this hotel the first time I was in Chicago. For the prices and for being classified an intercontinental...I wouldn't consider it that good. The rooms were solid. The view was ok (but so is it virtually everywhere else on Michigan Ave.) The service was ok. The prices were ridiculous for everything from wifi to well everything else. We came here for a Jewish/Hindi wedding. Appetizer was fine. Main entree was a small portion of meat with forgettable everything else. Dessert was inedible. I have been to some other expensive hotels with similar ratings but they had more or just better rooms to an extent that it would be worth it. I personally preferred the Conrad. Better prices and better service.,N
2755,"The best place to stay in down town Chicago. I've stayed at least in 5-6 different hotels in the downtown chicago area for business and pleasure.  For the money-location and service- I'll be staying at the James from now on. Its similar to the W without the ""chaos."" Very modern. Fantastic service from the door men- to spa to the front desk.  And only one block away from michigan Ave. Centerally located. I've stayed at the James twice now- first time business- second time pleasure- and both stays were consistant.  And added bonus- the Kiehls products you get in the room. And need to give special kudos to Scott - Lobby Assistant Coordinator- gave us good tips on where to go and even got us into a popular bar with VIP- no wait in line status.",N

2063,"I had my wedding here on 5/14/11, and I was very pleased with the entire event.  From start to finish, Barbara Martin, the catering manager, was very easy to work with and very accommodating.  The view from the Wolf Point Ballroom is great.  It looks out over the river and makes this more than just another hotel ballroom.   Another nice surprise was that the food was amazing.  I don't tend to expect much of wedding food, but I must say that ours was delicious.  We chose chicken napoleon with roasted vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes.   I had people telling me all night that they loved it.  The cake (from Alliance Bakery) was included in our package and that was great, too.  And I didn't have to do any coordinating.  The bakery dealt directly with Barbara.   The rooms that they blocked out for us were also very nice.  The rooms for both sets of parents were free, as was our bridal suite which was spectacular.  It was huge, had a nice view of the city, and there was free champagne and cookies waiting for us.  We, and our parents, also got free breakfast the next morning.   I definitely recommend having an event there.  We really wanted a downtown wedding and at the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza we were able to get it without spending a crazy amount of money.",N

5834,"The Talbott is a great place to stay. It is a luxury boutique in the heart of the Gold Coast, easily within walking distance of Michigan Avenue, State Street, and Navy Pier. The staff is exceptionally friendly. They provide twenty-four-hour room service, concierge service, and the front desk staff and waitstaff are even cheerful late at night. The rooms are modern, well decorated, and comfortable. They feature flat-screen satellite televisions, ihome alarm clocks, and many other conveniences one would expect from a luxury hotel, without the sameness of the chains.",Y
5775,"Typical Marriott in a fairly good location near the UIC campus and the medical district.  Driven towards the business traveler.  Has a decent restaurant and bar area, although hardly warm or comfortable - more get-in and get-out.  Starbucks service at the bar. Most of the rooms seemed to have nice street views - above average for a hotel. Getting there is a bit of a problem if not by car.  Local nearby bus stop is the best choice - the metro is good half mile from the hotel.  Walking from the hotel to the waterfront is a trek and is possible during the day - I wouldn't recommend at night.",N
3108,"This is a 5 star hotel and lounge, They can have the other 3 stars back when they get rid of the rapper crowd with dead looser T-shirts on, Have been coming here for 5+ years, Always have a great time, However, The last 2 times have forced us to go somewhere via cab so we don't get shot or stabbed by overzeleous rappers looking for fat white chics with low self esteem, Excalibur is on Dearborn holmes. Dear Westin folks, We feel your pain but please fix this problem.\ *UPDATE* stayed here back in April 2008, A complete turn around, the W is great again. thanks, Westin",N
3947,"at first you might compliment her for her character and her unpretentiousness. then you'll start making excuses: she's older, she hasn't been cared for and at least she's cheap. then you realise it's not you, it's her. you deserve better, and she needs a makeover of fresh paint, wallpaper, linoleum, and then some before you'll even consider being seen with her again.",N
3487,"Let me start off by saying that I did not stay here, this review is only for the experience I had with booking my wedding room block here. So of course Hotwire was running some deal, where you could get a fight and a room at the Allerton for some really ridiculously low rate. So rather than booking directly through the Hotel, my out of town relatives booked through Hotwire. Knowing this, I called my contact at the hotel who will be called ""MK"" in this review and added everyone to the list. I spent a significant amount of time on the phone with MK so that everyone that was checking in would get the out of town bag etc. So when check in date came along, I was told by my mother-in-law that no one was getting bags!!! As you can imagine this is the LAST thing I wanted to deal with after having spent HOURS on the phone with MK and being charged $3 bucks a bag so they could sit there and not be distributed. I had to call the hotel after my rehearsal to iron out the issues. It appears that MK left no list at the check in counter and no one knew what to do, even though I had dropped off 20 bags to be given out. The best part is that I was still charged for ""distribution"" after having gone through this pain in rear experience. MK was less that pleasant to deal with, so please be cautious if you are ever considering a room block here. Be prepared to make phone calls and supervise the night before your wedding. NEVER AGAIN!!!",N
4847,The Hyatt Regency in Chicago is a really nice hotel.  It has an upscale feel and is so close to downtown that you can just leave on foot to get to the magnificent mile.  It is very professional and has a great feel to it.,Y
4989,"This is the worst hotel 3 star I have stayed in in the past 10 years! It should be a 0 star. We stayed here because of the pool for the kids.The pool is filthy, has RUST & BROWN SCUM all over the edges and ladders and needs cleaning.The atrium smells. The continental breakfast is a joke-with vendor machine type muffins in plastic wrap. No restaurant either. No beverage or snack bar. No movies available on tv either. Pillows are more like a rock hard basketballs. The bathroom was the smallest bathroom I have ever used in a hotel and almost impossible to get an adult and child in there without getting banged by the door.The garage attendants damaged our car and they gave us the runaround for 2 days before we were able to file the report.I called at noon and asked why our room was not cleaned and was informed that this was not a regular hotel with hotel rules----it was the ""Essex Inn"" and was rudely informed that the room would be cleaned by 4PM. The hotel manager is never available.Poor attitude and poor management is the norm for this hotel.Save your hard earned money and stay elsewhere!",Y
800,"The Westin on Michigan Avenue enjoys one of the prime locations in the city. It is just north of the John Hancock Center, which has a plaza that is the unofficial outdoor porch of the hotel. The rooms are very nice but not top-notch, suffering only in comparison to the competing five-star hotels in the area. The front desk area can be very busy, but the beds are ""heavenly"".",N
4539,"This review is for happy hour only.  I've come here a handful of times for cocktails in the lobby. Here's the thing... the drinks are expensive, the service isn't great, and the food options are small... but none of that matters.  Because you come here for one reason and one reason only.  The atmosphere.  It's a kick ass old hotel with a million things to look at on the ceiling alone.  I love sitting in those tall back chairs, sipping on a scotch, and catching up with a friend.  If you haven't ever been here I highly recommend you visit.",N
908,"My favorite hotel in Chicago.  Why?  First and foremost, the staff is outstanding.  They are so friendly and helpful.  Reggie, the Bell Captain, has been there for years to welcome you to the hotel. Second, is location.  You can take take the blue line to/from O'hare and the hotel is a mere 2 blocks away from the station.  They are also close to 2 ""L"" line stations, and the red line. Third is the complimentary nightly wine reception.  This is a great way to start your evening and I always meet interesting people. Fourth is the decor and history behind this hotel.  Ask to stay on one of the historic floors (7 and above) for a truly unique experience. But again, it is the staff at this hotel which make it exceptional!",N
1375,"don't be fooled by the age of the lobby, front desk, and elevators, because those are misrepresentations of the rooms! rooms are newly renovated with modern decor.  nice flat screen plasma in every room.  the rooms are not big, but not small and claustrophobia inducing.   restroom came with rain shower, hand held shower, as well as every hotel's must:  hairdryer.  well-lit and clean!   friendly staff and great service.  i would highly recommend the millennium knickerbocker for anyone looking for a reasonable priced place to stay :)",N
4915,Went here for a wedding a few weeks a go in the Gold Coast room. Food was beyond a dissapointment. But- wedding food is never perfect especially if you have a lot of guests. The decor is nice. Stayed in a huge sweet on the 7th floor which was amazing. Staff was very friendly.,Y
2306,"I went to a wedding reception here.  I will admit I did not expect much because this place seems to have been under construction for forever and I just didn't have high hopes.  It was a lovely reception, however.  The room was very modern, with a nice cool reception area outside to step away from the dance floor and cool off.  The biggest problem was that you had to ride up a very slow, cramped elevator to get there.     The soup here was...remarkable.  The best tomato-basil soup I've ever had.  Second-best wedding soup I've ever had (that would be the cream of artichoke at the Hotel Intercontinental about 12 years back).  I don't know what the magic ingredient is, but it must be pixie dust or leprechan gold shavings or unicorn kisses.  It is served with a marvelous bread top that defies description.  I just cannot say enough about it.  I would do unspeakable things to have that soup again.  I think I'm going to start calling the hotel to see what I can barter for more of this soup. Also, the wedding was beautiful and lovely.  I assume the first dance, cutting the cake, etc. was nice but couldn't look up from my soup.  I'll have to watch the video.",N
1771,"I've stayed at the Allegro several times while traveling for work and have never had anything but a pleasant experience. I typically like modern hotels but this boutique hotel is quite nice. The interesting decor, paired with the friendly staff and great wine happy hour make for a unique experience. I also liked the fact that it's located in the theater district which has its' own feel and is an easy cab ride anywhere you're looking to go.",N
2120,"Stayed here Christmas Eve and it was quite nice. The room had a lovely view of the river and the gorgeous architecture of Chicago. Nice big bed and good toiletries in the bathroom. Nothing stunning beyond recognition, but very nice. For a few bucks extra, breakfast was included. Big buffet (but the pancakes and French toast were cold).  Overall, nice. Not very nice: no free wi-fi in the room. What kind of nonsense is that?!",N
1541,"This is an oddly mismatched kind of place...many things going for it....and several...well...not so much!   Location: Absolutely Great!  In the Loop at the lower end of Michigan Ave., all the good stuff downtown Chicago has to offer is close by.   The hotel is trying to be an upscale boutique hotel. About half the rooms have been renovated and about half have not.  The rooms are spacious in size, though maybe a little weirdly laid out.  I had a renovated room, which was trying to aspire to the more upscale hotels  but fell short in a few areas.   There is a 32 inch Plasma TV...and a glassed in shower with another TV in the bathroom.  The desk is weirdly tall compared to the chairs if you want to work in the room as I did.   The staff was mostly very helpful, particularly the room service people and the meeting & event people, though the front desk people (although pleasant) seemed a bit clueless about the issues that people had to deal with while I was there.   The biggest issue for me (a business traveler) was that the internet in the guest rooms was down for 5 of the 6 days I was there!  A major inconvenience!  I was amazed that it wasn't fixed within 24 hours.   One of the 4 elevators didn't work the whole time I was there, and the restaurant was closed for renovation, so later guests will hopefully avoid these issues.  Also the doorbell on our room went off for no apparent reason at 4:45 AM several of the nights we were there.  I did see that some people who reviewed complained about noise...Our room was nice and quiet, except for the aforementioned doorbell, which appeared to be an electrical problem, not a prankster. For meetings or events, the Penthouse on the 39th floor is absolutely awesome!!!  I held an event there and it was a great venue, and the staff very helpful.   Overall...a good place to stay....if a little random :)",N
4547,"i and my friend stayed here for lollapalooza this year. the rooms are small -- i prefer to call them ""cozy"" -- but the decor of the whole hotel, elevators,bars and all, is gorgeous. you feel like you're *someone* when you walk the halls of the palmer house. as mentioned, the room's small. there really isn't a lot of space to really walk around. it was two steps from the bed to the bathroom. but i'm not complaining. they're clean and they're a place to sleep. granted, not the best decorated, which is strange because the rest of the hotel's just grand. part of the reason you go to a lavish hotel such as this one is the service. and oh, we got served. we ordered room service for breakfast and it was really, really good, and it got up to us quickly. everyone was courteous and went out of their way to make our stay comfortable. and when i hung out at the bar, the bartender was accommodating when i asked for drink suggestions. we made nice, it was all good. i quite enjoyed my stay here, and i'd definitely come back, despite how expensive it is to get a room. oh, speaking of which, we were only a short walk from grant park. perhaps about three blocks. so it's an awesome place to stay if you're going to lolla.",N
705,"Location, location, location...that's the primary benefit of this hotel.  CMs are pretty standard wherever you go...yes, some better maintained than others.  This one was finishing a renovation but the rooms still looked pretty average.   If you like being near Michigan Ave. and don't want to pay extreme prices but want a decent bed at night and good business travel amenities, this is the place.  2 blocks from Nordstrom, a few blocks from Ginos and right next to the brand new Garretts Popcorn shop with the heavenly caramel aroma. A very small Starbucks off the lobby. The bed is okay, not great, not enough blankets.  Free wireless is great.  Not enough channels on TV (no A&E, no TRUTV); Great bellmen who are very helpful.  You can schedule the cleaning of your room in case you want to go out for the day and don't want to leave your laptop, etc. in the room while it's being serviced.   Do not...I repeat...DO NOT order room service from the restaurant off the lobby called Vivande.  I had the misfortune of ordering dinner from there on SuperBowl Sunday because I wanted to eat  in my room and watch the game.  The salad was old and the soup had these mushy croutons (blegch!).  Eggs over medium were eggs over raw.   The serving staff was apologetic of course but it was a poor compensation for bad cuisine. I would stay there again yes, especially if I knew i wasn't going to spend much time in my room (to go shopping instead!)",N
3837,"One of the best hotels in downtown chicago! from service to selection highest quality all around. an amazing rooftop lounge, aja restaurant offers an amazing food menu, and the service is above and beyond. try the rainbow maki sushi rolls, excellent!",N
3839,"I have to admit that I was pretty stoked about my stay here after reading all of the reviews. I'm a sucker for a great hotel. Check-in was a breeze, although I'm really not a fan of the whole ""let's put your whole stay on hold on your credit card when you get here to cover incidentals"" policy. That certainly isn't fun for those of us on strict budgets, although I guess that's not the typical patron at the Dana. I absolutely LOVED the mosaic behind the check in desk, and would kind of like it for my apartment, please. Thank you. My stay at the Dana (for 5 whole nights) was overall a pleasure. Todd, the bartender downstairs, took great care of us on a VERY regular basis and would whip my Hendrick's and tonic up without having to ask. God, I loved that bar. Comfortable seating, free tasty fried wontons, and Hendrick's gin. Love. Who cares if it's $10 a cocktail, right? My room was a study in form over function. The desk space was great and I used it often. The bed was comfortable, although it didn't hold a candle to the palatial heavenly beds at the Westin. My main beef was with the bathroom. As others have mentioned, the shower is all glass and opens up to your room, which is fine for those of us who travel solo. Just have to put the blinds down, and as someone who loves to live by natural light, that became a pain. The other side of the shower has NOTHING. No door, no glass, so you're just open to the bathroom, resulting in water flying everywhere. Maybe I'm just a really sloppy shower-er, but I felt really bad for housekeeping who had to deal with my sopping wet bathmat. It also led to things getting pretty drafty, which I could  imagine being a serious issue come cold Chicago winter. Finally, the rain-style showerhead. I know these are all the rage, but I don't like them. As someone who doesn't wash my hair every day (but still likes to shower) it provides some difficulty. Sure, they've still got the handheld thing, but who the hell wants to use that? Plus, it added even more to the mess beyond the shower walls. It wasn't pretty. Finally, be sure not to get a room across from the elevator (rooms that end in 08 or 10). You will here the dinging all.night.long. Not to mention all the folks that chat it up while waiting for the lift to arrive. Not fun if you like extreme peace and quiet. Would I come back to the Dana? Sure, as long as work is paying or I get an insane deal. Otherwise you can find me on a friend's couch or at the Days Inn in the 'burbs.",N
2162,"I had never had occasion to stay in a hotel in Chicago before, so this was an unusual occasion.  The ICH turned out to be one of the nicest places I've ever stayed in (Hotel Indigo in Asheville, NC still takes the cake). Our room was in the older of the hotel's two towers, the one that used to house the Medina Athletic Club.  The room was on the 25th floor, and had great views up and down Michigan Avenue and out to the west. The Room itself was very spacious, and the bathroom was enormous, with a separate shower and bath. We got brunch in the hotel restaurant, and the buffet was off the chain in terms of quality and selection.  It was also priced accordingly . . . The topper, though, was the fitness facility housed in the hotel.  You have not only the gorgeous and historic swimming pool, but a full complement of cardio and weight equipment.  And the dry sauna was delightfully hot. On the down side (and hence the missing star), this place nickels and dimes you on things like internet.  I've heard not-so-great things about the promptness of their room service, but, almost needless to say, we did not order room service.  (At $18 for a ""Maxwell street polish sausage,"" can you blame us?)",N
3294,"The Hard Rock Hotel is in the landmark Carbide and Carbon Building on Michigan Avenue, not too far from Millennium Park. Within its subtly colorful exteriors are very hip interiors, and it is home to the expensive China Grill restaurant.",N
890,"The Hotel Burnham lets you step back into a bit of 19th century old world charm while still providing some of the more modern conveniences. The restoration job Kimpton has done on Daniel Burnham's 1895 predecessor to today's skyscraper is truly wonderful. I was much happier staying at this little boutique hotel this past week on my business trip than one of the other big name neighbors. Its ideally located to all that the Loop offers. If given a choice - I'll be back here again when staying in Chicago. From the moment you walk into the dark wood reception area with its quaint little sitting area, you are greeted by smiling faces eager to make your stay a success. Like most other Kimpton properties they offer an evening wine reception and have a generous pet policy. It pays to be a member of their Kimpton In Touch program (free) as you get free internet access, $10 mini-bar credit and free continental breakfast in the restaurant downstairs. A couple of tips for this particular location: - You will get an actual key to your room. At first I loved concept this antiquated concept, hearkening back to a simpler time. But after a week of the key jingling in my pocket and trying not to lose the darn thing - I think I'd rather leave this part of history behind and have the added security of modern key cards. - There aren't hairdryers in the rooms (at least in mine) but they will bring one up to you. - Rooms are a little small. Try to get at least a queen or king room - at 5.4 my footsies were hanging off the double bed unless I scrunched all the way up on my pillows. Issue solved by sleeping diagonally - but the larger bed would have been nice. - Request an upper floor room. I was the 5th floor overlooking Washington and State, but I could still hear quite a bit of noise from the street and ""L"". Didn't keep me from sleeping well though.",N
3647,"Recently stayed at the Drake Hotel (4 nights). The hotel itself was beautiful! The staff was very helpful and friendly. Beds were very comfortable as well. The only downside was the fact that the rooms are not standard queen/king beds. --They have rooms with two twin beds and one bathroom, but in order to have a room with two queen beds, you have to upgrade to a suite, which includes two bathrooms. Didn't get a chance to try the restaurant or tea, unfortunately. Overall, the stay was good.",N
3088,"Best room views in the whole city! I travel to Chicago often and this is the first place I look at to stay! The ""Lake View"" rooms are stunning! I can not stop using exclamation points when reviewing this hotel, that's how much I love it! I love the design of the the bathrooms with the window that opens to give more space to the whole room. I'm not a very demanding guest, so I don't make the staff jump through hoops and then complain about horrible service on here when I don't get my way. The location is great for the views, but not nessacerely for getting to public transportation. Cabs are always available, though if you have a car, expect to pay $50 a day for parking. The bar on the 30-something'ish floor is less to be desired. It's just a very dark room with a view over looking the city. This is Chicago! There are plenty of bars every where! I love this place! Have I mentioned that? :)",N
1024,"I enjoyed my stay at the Amalfi hotel. The only thing that I did not like about it was the lady who sits at the desk and greets/checks people in. She was kind of aloof and distant. Then later there was another woman at the front desk area who seemed the same way. That was weird to me. The hotel though was nice. They had some magazines,which I love, waiting in the room for me, some CDs, and a very nice robe to lounge around in. The bed was very nice. I could have fallen asleep in it seconds after my head hit the pillow.  Oh yea, and I cant forget the the happy hour. The drinks were not all watered down as I would have expected. They were pretty good and top notch. I'd stay here again for sure.",N

5792,"Rooms are kinda old. Service is pretty mediocre, but they do have a pool, fridge in room, free parking, free shuttle and the location is pretty close to downtown and some good food near Univ Chicago. I'd go back and stay here again bc i got a super good deal on hotwire, but I wouldn't run back to pay full price ever.",N
831,"Silversmith has that old traditional feel, which is not my style so there was no wow factor as far as interior decor goes here.  The metal scrolls on each hotel room door was a nice touch though.  Everything else had that old wood ""creaky"" feeling to me.   Really enjoyed the staff.  They're all so nice. I happened to leave something at the desk during check in (where others were checking in too) and as I entered my room, my phone was ringing and it was the front desk letting me know I had forgotten it there.  Neat :) This hotel wins for - Location (though I'm sure any downtown hotel would get a point for this!) - Price - not bad for the location.  About $200 a night. - Staff - unbelievably nice.  The bellman even went on a stroll along the streets with me to show me some restaurants and favorite spots since it was my first time visiting Chicago. Parking fees are NOT cheap though.  I believe it was over $40 and I wasn't there for more than 24 hours. Yikes.",N
3856,"The hotel is centrally located.  That's been said.  And yes, there is some street noise, although I didn't get much hallway noise.  But I haven't been to a hotel yet, in a big city, that didn't have some noise.  That said; check-in was efficient and easy.  The bags were taken to our room while we went into the bar to pay for a very overpriced drink.  I mean, we ordered an Irish coffee and got charged $5.00 for the cup of coffee and then $6.00 for the shot...anyway...it is a hotel bar.   Up to the room, nicely appointed.  The bathroom is large with a beautiful shower (we were in a double queen room - our shower had only one head, our friends were in a Tranquil King Suite- they had like water coming from every direction) - nice comfy robes to wear too.  The hair-dryer was feeble...but eventually did the job.   The biggest problem with the hotel is the inconsistency. The first night the maid turned down the beds and pulled the shades, but neglected to pull the blackout shades; an important feature when you are in an east facing room...and we didn't know to do it ourselves.  The second night, they were pulled, but the maid threw the pillows on the chair next to them so there was a nice crack for that sun to peek through, right into my friends eyes.   A nice touch is that they give you coupons for a made to order breakfast in their downstairs restaurant - valued at $15.00.  So in the morning we went downstairs for breakfast...it was busy...we waited...once we sat...we waited...and waited...can someone PLEASE bring us some coffee???? Oh, sure...we waited...and waited...can we say, the service was slow?  Yes, yes we can.  The food was mostly good; again a couple of missteps and inconsistencies; I assume the kitchen makes their poached eggs in advance, using the method of putting the egg into an ice bath to hold it until service and then putting it into hot water to warm and finish cooking; it's an important step, that putting it back into hot water; when it's not done, the egg is a cold as ice.  As was the eggs on my friend's Eggs Benedict. However, the poached eggs on my other friends plate were hot. This was, however, something that was quickly corrected.  The second morning was no better than the first on service...it was slow, and worse, it's like they are ignoring you.  They don't even make eye contact.  That morning I ordered the Biscuits and Gravy...let me say this...clearly...DON'T...it's not Biscuits and Gravy, it's a biscuit in some white stuff with some slices of sausage and mushrooms...that's just not right.   I do want to give a shout out to TJ and the guy with the Tats, (sorry can't remember your name) you guys were great! LindySez: It's a nice place to stay, central to many sites, comfortable, and the food is good...just don't expect it any time soon.",N
5241,"Like someone else said, don't expect frills here -- Best Western Grant Park Hotel is for the budget-minded (like me). Good downtown location at the South Loop, and Bears games at Soldier Field are just a short walk away. (My boyfriend likes booking here for that very reason.) My room was comfortable (booked a standard room at http://www.getaroom.com)  and I was pleased with the service I received.",Y
1326,"I have to say I'm oddly fascinated by hotel bars.   I've never stayed at this hotel but always find a way to visit the Ritz  in whatever city I can.  My favorite thing to do is sit at the bar and order a Kir royal while I read the New York times and discuss current events with the bartender.  The Ritz here in Chicago is not bad- the lobby is large and spacious with a beautiful fountain which nicely drowns out the noise of your neighbor so you can relax.  The bar is located in the open atrium portion of the building so you get plenty of natural light which is fantastic.  The service, as you may have guessed-this is the Ritz, is exceptional.  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because I've been to the Ritz in New York and it is my favorite.  Take yourself there on a Sunday afternoon and relax...",N
4123,"I booked on Hotwire for $80/night, and for that price I don't think one could do much better. We lucked out and were on the 33rd floor with a great view out the window. The room is oddly laid out, with a desk facing away from the window along the back of the bed - unconventional, but a cool way to create two spaces in a small-ish downtown hotel room. Didn't have any issues with cleanliness like some people report. Yeah, $13 for internet is a drag, but if I'm staying in a 4-star hotel right downtown, that's kind of to be expected.",N
1851,"W.  Whatever. What happened to the luxury that was the ""W""? I haven't given up on the W brand, but I probably will not be staying at the W Chicago City Center again. Here's why:   1.

4505,I spent New Year's Eve here and had a spectacular time! First the bar in the lobby had some great drinks. The empire room didn't have anything going on so my date and I went in and talked and slow danced and then went for more drinks. We didn't make reservations for dinner so had dinner at the Lockwood. Great service. My food was okay and my date's was phnomenal! He took me on a tour of the place and told me about some of the history. And of course the lobby is breathtaking. I'm not so sure why so many people are unhappy with their rooms because there's so much to do outside of the room - how much time do you really spend in there? We spent about 5 hours total between getting ready and having breakfast and a catchin a few zzzzz's. The bed was sooo comfortable! And the showers get really hot and have good water pressure. It was enough room for two people to relax and not feel cramped. My only gripe is that we ordered some room service and we paid $40 for 4 half sized diet cokes on ice. And heads up! Any room service you order there is a fee and a tip added on for you.... I caught myself tipping my breakfast guy $5+. Had I done that He would have gotten over $12 for rolling our cart up to our room..... Breakfast was good but not $50 good.,N
2577,"My friend Maryanna just got a job promoting, here I am being a good friend, I said I would come.  I'm bringing my roommate's sister Kara.   I never been to Victor Hotel before but I knew the area since I been to other restaurants/lounges. I don't recall hearing about a hotel?  I was thinking who would build a hotel over here in an industrial area?  c'mon this got to be a mistake. Kara and I are in a cab, fast driver, both of us seriously thought about wearing seatbelt.  I'm getting little scared because we saw dozens of people with golf clubs out on the street? What the?? We go inside, holy cow.  Talk about fancy! Red colors everywhere, nice chairs, and very cozy.  But where is everyone? Maryanna!!!!! You said show up at 8pm so here we are whole two of us here with 3 other people.  Maryanna, if you are going to promote your stuff? You have to be here huh?  We stuck around because you said you be right over soon as you are done with Madonna concert. Free drinks, heck yeah...  I didn't eat before I came, in an empty stomach and I always get in trouble. I drink little more than I should when they offer free drinks as well.  Sure enough. Within one hour, I drank down 4 or 5 vodka and cranberry.  I was feeling it for sure. Okay, here comes more people now but no Maryanna yet.  Its 9:45pm place is starting to pick up.  This place use to be a meat factory! You can see little rooms for VIP's and huge refrigerator doors.  Ceiling is high as four 6'ft person stacked up together.  They also have bottle service but no one sat down until 11pm.  Bottle service prices are around $125 - $250 (drink menu) and they have sushi and cheese plate. I also met Greg S. and Rohit, two other Yelp members, very nice guys.   I get back home at 3am.  What was I thinking going out getting drunk during the weekday? I'm getting too old for this. I get to work, feeling still drunk.  I should have called in sick. I send my boss a message.  ""I'm not feeling so well""   I tried to go use the bathroom at work but it was so disgusting.  I wasn't going to puke at work bathroom or even thinking about hugging the toilet.  So I needed a plan! Good excuse to go home ASAP because I'm going to burst any minute. Me: I'm having a bad stomach ache; I think it's something I ate last night. Boss: You okay? Do you want me to go get you something from Walgreen? Me: (oh shit, she is going to help me out, quick! think of something drastic to say).  Umm I don't know, it's little personal thing you know. Boss:  Are you having cramps? Is it that time of the month?  Funny she makes jokes. Me:  hahaha, I'm laughing but I said no, I told her I have the D'word, (too embarrassed to say it) but I couldn't think of any other excuse.  I didn't want to tell her I drank too much last night and don't want to be lectured about ""responsibility"" Boss: okay go home, feel better. I take few magazines from work and put it in my bag to read over the weekend.  Tell my coworkers I'm leaving for the day. I told them I made up an excuse to our boss. Saying I had diarrhea.   Coworker:  GEORGE GOT DIARRHEA! Me: damn dude, no need to yell it out so loud so everyone can hear, I don't have diarrhea; I'm going to puke so I'm going home to do it. I need some bread, soup, anything. So I walk over to Cosi to get some bread and soup before I catch a cab to go home ASAP.  I hurry over and get a piece of free bread and start chewing on it quickly as I can than ordered chicken noodle soup to go.  I'm desperately trying to make this transaction quickly as possible and hurry to get in the cab.   Two ladies asking me bunch of questions about all sorts. I give them brief answers and walk outside to flag down a cab.  They follow me outside start talking to me again.  C'mon... cab!  (I'm really not in the mood to talk). I have a piece of bread in my mouth, holding the soup with my right hand, messenger bag on my shoulder, cellphone in my other hand.  These ladies keeps on talking to me, I don't have a free hand to open the cab door so I put doggy bag with soup inside my messenger bag (dumb ass, you know its going to spill) but I wasn't thinking straight okay?   I'm free from the ladies, I get in the cab. Going home finally.  I'm going to puke, dizzy, spinning. Told Mr. Cab driver to hurry! LaSalle and Maple! Okay, I'm home; damn soup did spill in my bag.  My ass is hot from the soup and I open up my bag. Holy shit, look like a fish tank with soup chunks floating everywhere.  Damn it, I don't have time for this. All the magazines are drenched; I throw my bag in the kitchen sink.  I head over to the bathroom.   I'm ready to puke now.  I hover around the toilet for 30 minutes. I don't need to puke any more, puke sensation is gone.   I had to deal with this entire ordeal for nothing?  I cleaned up my bag, dumped rest of the soup that didn't spill in to a bowl.  I ate it and went to sleep for next 8 hours.",N
1794,"Hotel Allegro was recently one of the featured spots on Jetsetter (http://jettsetter.com, a discount travel site featuring high end hotels) and was available for a weekend when I was planning on being in Chicago for a friend's wedding. We got a fantastic rate and I am probably being more forgiving than other travelers may be based on the fantastic deal that we received. The hotel is located in the Loop, Chicago's main business district. As a one time Chicagoan, this location worked great for me, but other people may find that a property off the Magnificant Mile is more ideal. Upon check in, we were given complimentary drink vouchers because we had missed their nightly complimentary wine happy hour in the lobby. Our room had a very retro feel and was clean, but was also very small. Most of the room was occupied by the very comfortable king bed. We had some small issues with both the safe and our AC, but the hotel sent people up very quickly to help with both and they were easily resolved. I would absolutely recommend this hotel, but only to people traveling for business, single travelers,  or those who plan on spending very little time in their rooms.",N
3975,"My sister and I stayed at the Congress Hotel on June 8th, I liked it alot. The decor was beautiful we took pictures in the lobby. We had a drink at the bar which had very nice workers. Check in was easy. Our windows didn't face the park but we only slept there. The room was nice and cool and I loved the pillows. The decor was nice. And you couldn't hear people walking and talking in the hallways or in the next room like you can in alot of other hotels. We ate dinner in one of the inhouse restaurants it was pretty good. The only downside was the restaurant in the lobby that only serves breakfast, skip it, we waited almost 40 minutes for eggs, and my sister said the bacon tasted funny. There where lots of people going to the bathroom in the lobby. Since there are bathrooms in the rooms I guess alot of people come in off the street. Not cool. Yes, I would stay at the Congress Plaza again with or without the ghost.",N
2638,"Me? An A-list celeb? That's how I felt when I stayed at the James. From the doorman greeting you to finding a cookie on your bed, these small details make you feel special and at home. The hotel is small but has everything you need, including a great location only steps away from terrific restaurants and excellent shopping on Michigan Av. As for the accommodations, my room included a king size bed, a bar, living room area, 2 flat screen tvs, 2 iPod stations/radios, and a gorgeous bathroom. The James strikes a unique balance between modern function and artsy aesthetic that made my stay feel unique and personal. It's a great choice for business travel, a romantic getaway, or a weekend to explore the city.",N
2770,"My review is this hotel is superfluous at this point, but like others I simply had to chime in and spread the good word about The James Hotel. Got a great deal on their website $194 a night and all our requests were met with gusto! Early check in, high floors, late check out, got it all. We also got exceptional service and smiles from poised doormen and even extremely happy housemaids! What a joy to stay somewhere where the staff feel proud as well! Their rooms were very well appointed, we LOVED the minibar with fun extras (naughty ones too!) and who doesn't love Keils's bath products. IF I had to be nitpicky I would note just two things: one of the sheets on our bed had a tear in it towards the corner, which was nothing too freak out over. And the 2nd thing was that the walls in the bathroom could have used a once over, there were lots of short black hairs on the gleaming white walls. I imagine from the person before us blow drying their hair. Again, nothing huge. We were extremely happy with the luxuriousness of the bed, the barcelona chair in room was immaculate. We wish there were more James Hotels in more cities! We left feeling like a swanky young couple in love! Does it get better than that?",N
1208,I had a decent stay here.  The hotel seemed relatively new and the views of downtown was amazing.  The restaurants off the lobby were all good I thought for hotel food.  The bed was super comfy.   Ride downtown was only $11 each way.  Not ideal but the nice rooms and comfy beds made up for it.,N
3536,"This hotel used to be the Radisson, which I avoided. Completely remodeled, rebranded, and opened under the name Avenue Hotel, the rooms are luxurious and modern. The upper floor suites have beautiful views of Lake Michigan and the location cannot be beat. I travel and stay frequently in downtown Chicago and this is my first pick of hotels I stay in the area due to higher-end comfort and services at reasonable prices.",N
4075,"This is a convention galore hotel.  It's impersonal, but for $65/night with a view, I'm not complaining!  I got lucky with the view.  The spacious room was probably bigger than a studio rental in SF.  The king size bed was so comfy that I actually ended up sleeping in until 11 am some days!  The Hyatt is conveniently located near the El trains and buses, which makes it easy to get around.  It neighbors many of the tourist's attractions:  Millennium Park, Navy Pier. the Magnificent Mile, etc... The Hyatt's lobby is beautifully laid out with a dining area encircle by a zen-like pond with delicately ""spitting"" waterfalls.  You can watch t.v. while waiting or just relaxing on the many sofas and chairs.  Their bar offers a stunning backdrop view of the city.   Once again, this is a hotel with lots of conventions so to get from point A to B, may take 10 mins, but the majority of all convention hotels are like that.  The difference is that you get a lovely view on your way there. Tip:  Purchase the unlimited transit passes.  DO NOT BRING YOUR CAR into Chicago.  Chicago has one of the best public transit systems that I've experienced.  Besides, it'll cost you at least $40 or more to park your car overnight at the hotels. I'm in love with Chicago, will have to visit soon!",N
5015,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hardrock Hotel in January of 2010. We went to chicago to celebrate our 4 year anniversary. Got a great rate on the room. The rockstar theme isn't my forte but I knew what I was getting into and they do it well. Overnight parking is a little pricey at $46/night but I needed to put my car somewhere, and they have valet so you can just drop your car at the door. Little did I know the REAL reason we went to chicago... While we were out at dinner/drinks at the Hancock building, my bf had talked to Jose at the front desk and when we returned to the room he had arranged champagne/candles/chocolate and strawberries for us. My boyfriend proposed in this lovely setting. Since we hadn't arranged the 'romance package' beforehand we didn't get the rose petals. Jose felt so bad about the missing rose petals that he didn't charge us at all for the rest of it! (We left him a good tip anyway...)The room was good size and very comfy. The bed was incredibly comfortable even though I was too busy planning in my head my upcoming wedding to get much sleep. Great view of Michigan Ave from the 20th floor (could even see the river!)Would stay here again in a heartbeat...",Y
4068,"5 Stars for the courtesy sample size lotion they give you in the bathroom. Citrus Lavender. Of course I took it with me and I always get complements on its smell...then I have to break the news that I 'stole' it from the Hyatt downtown. All in all, the bedrooms are comfortable and clean. The hotel is in a good Central location, and they have a flipping club on the main level. I'm not a clubbin' girl normally, but Hard drive is pretty fun if you're in the mood to spend a lot of cash.",N
3313,"Five Thumbs-up!  After my last review, which was still really good, I got a message from a hotel rep about the forthcoming upgrades.  I'm here tonight on the 19th floor, corner room.  The funky shades have been replaced by blackout drapes.  The carpet has been replaced and the Base Bar downstairs is now Angels & Kings, with a great looking' decor, though for some reason looks smaller than it used to... The hotel is on top of their game.  The check-in could not have been more friendly.  This is a cool hotel!  Great job Hard Rock Chicago!",N
801,"Solid location.  Clean, stale rooms.  Not very memorable in either a good or bad way.",N
248,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights recently.  I am a business traveler that just relocated to Chicago and needed a place to stay while I was waiting to move into my apartment.  I stayed in many different hotels before moving into my place - Swiss Hotel, Marriott, Hyatt - all downtown and I have to tell you, they really depressed me.  Maybe they are geared for the business traveler and not a pleasure traveler, but God, I hated those places.  So I decided to try something different and got a boutique hotel in the Gold Coast which is how I ended up at Hotel Indigo.   Wow, what a great little place.  I looooved it.  Loved the hotel and really loved the location - tucked in on a residential Gold Coast street.  The decor is bright and you just feel happy as soon as you walk in.  The decor is mainly blues and greens - very bright and beachy - it would really be a great place to stay in the summertime.   Anyway, the people were very friendly and helpful.  The rooms were big and bright and nice and the location is to die for.  You can walk to shopping in the Gold Coast, walk to the beach, walk to Old Town, you can even walk to Lincoln Park and the Zoo if the weather permits and you have comfy shoes on.  And forget all those places above - you can just walk around the neighborhood and take a look at all the gorgeous old greystones and brownstones and have a great time.   Highly recommend.  And check out Priceline and Hotwire - they have this place listed at times as the ""secret"" 3.5 star boutique hotel in Goldcoast/Water Tower area.  I got a room on Hotwire here for $109 a night (usually their rates are $275 and up).  What a steal!",N
50,"Well this was an interesting place.  I went to Chicago for one night with a group of friends (six of us) and we found the Inn at Lincoln Park by chance.  Managed to book a room with two beds for just around $60 after fees, with a military discount.  The hotel is really quite charming in an old boutique sort of way, but it is by no means fancy or super clean.  Our room was very cool - used to be two rooms, so it had two walk-in closets and two full bathrooms.  Since we are young and were just looking for somewhere to sleep for one night, it worked really well.  I don't think I'd go back there with my family, though. Downside: I don't think they had cleaned the comforter OR sheets in a while.  There were some interesting stains on them and the wall.  We avoided these by using our own blankets and pillows. Perk: They have free breakfast downstairs every morning.  Pretty decent.  And they didn't seem to care that six of us were staying in one room.",N
886,"I stayed here for a long weekend in May '10 last year. It is a beautiful, historic, boutique hotel and I was quite impressed when we first arrived. Another plus was the free wine in the lobby (which is absolutely beautiful and comfortable) every day between 4-6pm (I think). Also I thought the nightly rates were very reasonable for the wonderful location. Unfortunately, everyone can have different experiences in the same establishment, and if we had been in another room or another floor it could have been a 5 star experience. BUT, the toilet in our room exploded and flooded the ENTIRE hotel room while we were gone (Thank God) due to a plumbing issue in their building. It was disgusting. They moved us to another room (and most of our stuff thankfully stayed dry). To apologize to us they took our home address and promised to send a lovely basket or something. NEVER CAME. Also they didn't knock off any $$ for the stay. They gave us a certificate for one free drink at their bar, but that was it. Doesn't that seem like bad service? Our stuff got wet when a toilet exploded in their hotel room! I'm going back to Chicago this weekend (and go back very frequently), and I'm not planning on staying there again, but it was a pretty hotel in a great location.",N
5617,"Great central location, large gym for a hotel, and a club lounge for premier members.  Not as upscale as the Lakeshore W, but I never have any issues with this Westin property.",N
5618,"The RESTAURANT & LOUNGE at the Westin The lounge area of the Westin has a refreshing combination of sophistication yet informalness. You can sit in the lounge and order cocktails from the bar or food from either the main restaurant or the sushi bar. This is perfect if you are in a group that can't decide what they want to eat. The Pamatini martini is excellent. Their banana ""cheesecake"" dessert is not a cheesecake at all and is excellent. I have enjoyed all their food. I definitely recommend their lounge for an after-work hangout or weekend dinner.",N
4131,"Hyatt's usually don't let me down...but, this one has sort of (2 stars means that I've experience better). The check in woman was kind, helpful and let me check in early (1030am woo hoo!).  That's nice...we all have early flights time to time and just want to put our bags away.  Nice...also there was a big bag storage area, so if they didn't have a room, I could've stored my bag (not sure if there was a fee or not though). But after getting to my room...it was very underwhelming.  The room is quite small, less than 200 sqft.  The room is also unusually dark, I need a light on during the afternoon!  The desk is right next to the bed and the tv is on the same desk...get the feeling of cramped-ness yet?  The bathroom is nicely appointed and quite large (probably half the room size!).   The 2 stars is in comparison to other Hyatts I've stayed at (NYC, New Brunswick NJ, Phoenix, Albuquerque, etc...I've been to many Hyatts) and this one is probably the second worst.  The atrium is beautiful at least, so I guess leaving my room for that is an upgrade.  If staying in this part of town, I'd say to stay at the Swissotel down the street.  A bit further, but it was nicer there than here.  Maybe the other rooms here are nicer, but i can't give reviews based on assumptions and maybes.",N
1147,"Seriously overpriced The room was clean and comfortable but did not stand out from any other mid priced hotel. The ""amenities"" were a smoke screen, nothing was offered that you would not get at a much lesser quality motel but they did not have the basics that you would expect from a Holiday Inn. I would gladly have forgone the scale in the bathroom for a cup of hot coffee that I did not have to get dressed and go down to the lobby to purchase. Being charged $15/day for Internet on top of a $250/night rate was a bit over the top. The bathroom was not well lit which was inconvenient. The shower was a nice size with a fantastic over-sized shower head, unfortunately twice the water pressure was low so the effect was lost. The staff were friendly and helpful, actually the best part of the stay were the staff. All in all I found it overpriced for the quality of the room.",N
4987,"Either I have had comparably great experiences at other hotels in Chicago or this one was exceedingly dismal.  The staff are not refined but then again it is not like I threw out the cash for a refined experience.  My biggest issue with the hotel was the shower.  The bathroom was dark and the plumbing made awful noises when you flushed or turned on the shower.  Not to mention the rusty, moldy, and dirty looking tub.  Upgrades are very much needed.  However, the view was not too shabby.",Y
4204,"I've been to this Hyatt twice since moving to the city. The first time was last summer: I'd scored a room for my mom (she was visiting me for my b-day) for only $100 on hotwire during the first week of June. I was really looking forward to hanging out at the hotel with my mom and just absorbing the atmosphere there. Unfortunately for my mom, my dad was being an idiot that weekend, so she couldn't make it for the night. She told me I could have the room and then called them to let them know I'd be taking over the reservation. They were really nice about it and didn't give me any hassle. One of my friends was in town early to visit and so we both ended up taking the room (neener to my bf, who didn't get to come). My mom was really nice and let us order a glass of wine (each) close to midnight (which would begin my 23rd birthday). I took it as a good sign when our total came out to $23 and some change. We had a wonderful time dancing around our room celebrating my birthday. The room was really nice and we both enjoyed the iHome they provide. Did I mention the view of the river was fantastic? A wonderful start to my 23rd year of life. My second experience was last fall when my best friend chose the Hyatt to spend her bachelorette party night at. Upon my arrival I was hassled by a rude member of the concierge because I couldn't remember the bride's room number and they wouldn't give it to me because I ""wasn't on the list"" of the room guests. Not really a big deal-I know they're not supposed to give out room numbers anymore. So I stood there for a few minutes while I waited for a response text from the matron of honor. I got it, announced to her the room number and a ""thanks for nothing!"" (rude, I know, but so was she), and I was up the elevator, lickety-split. The room was the same as the one I'd shared with my friend for my b-day back in the summer-double bed with an iHome. I got there early and in order to commemorate the  occasion (bachelorette party), they actually sent us (free of charge) a bottle of champagne, 4 chocolate covered strawberries, and some chocolate covered biscuits. Score! It was so nice of them. We had a nice night there. Hung out in the cool bar after getting back from the festivities, walked around the hotel, and finally went to bed around 3am. Definitely a classy hotel. I'll stay there again sometime for sure.",N
3678,"This review is for the bar only.  Maybe my expectations were to high considering this is a very well-known hotel with a lot of history, but I found their bar to be lame, shabby, and just kinda depressing.  I guess they were going for a saloon feel but it came off more like a big red cheesy mess. And the prices were insane.  We also had appetizers which basically sucked.  I hear they have some kind of high noon tea in a tea room there or something like that.  I'll try that next.  Anything is a step up from this bar experience.",N
5301,"This hotel is great -- it has so much history and character. My husband and I stayed here when we got married, and the staff were so friendly and generous -- they left us a complimentary bottle of champagne to enjoy in our room. The hotel is also very convenient to the Art Institute, Millennium Park, etc.",Y
4430,"I stayed here two month ago for work. The entrance and lobby was elegant, and the room was nice. It was a bit small in my opinion and the walls wasn't that sound-proof. I remember waking up to someone throwing up on the other side of the walls. I almost wanted to shout ""are you ok over there"" but figured I should just mind my own business and sleep. 1 star for location, 1 star for price, 1 star for elegance, 1 star for a nice bed and -1 star for waking me up in the middle of the night.",N
433,"The biggest downfall for this hotel is that it is nearly in the middle of no where.  It's a sketchy part of town, with Chinatown about 4-5 blocks away and the nearest L station about 6-7 blocks away... and I can honestly say these are LONG blocks.  If you plan on staying out late in the city after dark, you're probably safe taking a cab.  It can be pricey though, so taking a more expensive hotel farther up north... especially north of the loop is better. Room service is non-existent... although the hotel does advertise a pizza place and chinese place that you and order delivery from. The hotel's little sports bar is its only saving grace.  The crowd is upbeat and the drinks are great. If you're new to the city and aren't street smart, this isn't the best place to stay.  If you've been here before and are used to far south of the loop, it's definitely worth it!",N
2464,"Came to Chicago on March 13, day of the Green River Day Parade, for St. Patrick's Day. The hotel is festive, everyone in green and convincing everyone that walks in to do the same. The had a little booth, right in front of their Irish Bar/ Restaurant - Kitty O'Sheas-, with all things St. Patrick's (tiaras, shirts, necklaces, and more). Their energy is contagious so, of course, I go in and buy something for everyone in my party. Before we join the madness at Kitty O'Sheas, I go check-in. Lady at the counter was really nice. Check-In process took less than 5 minutes. They even had arranged all clocks at the rooms to change automatically for day light savings. Room is big, spacious, clean... so is the bathroom. Mini bar (you can ask for the key when checking-in), TV, desk, big enough closet, and more features to make your stay comfortable.  Oh, but do bring your own soap, the one they have is brutal on your nails and skin.   Back downstairs, St. Patrick's celebration has intensified. Kitty O'Sheas' is packed, with a line of people waiting outside, without and estimated seating time. Would have loved to stay and celebrate but after waking up at 6:30am, traveling without anything to eat, I needed lunch fast. So we leave, with our green accessories to another restaurant, promising ourselves we would have our green beer when we got back. At night the hotel has security, who checks your room key before allowing you into the elevators. They have a piano at the entrance, a lounge/ bar. Apparently this hotel is very popular for conventions, conferences, etc. Saw people from 3 different ones in one weekend. This might be a problem if your traveling to get away and rest. I'm sure it might be a bit quieter on non-holiday weekends but gotta love a hotel with that spirit, good service and, on top of that, close to just about everything on Michigan Ave.",N
2865,"I am a road warrior. I have stayed in some of the finest hotels in the world. I've stayed in some of the worst. The ""Towers"" has hosted me on more than one occasion for different conferences over the years. I've always found the staff gracious, friendly and professional. I will admit it's not a Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental or Ritz Carlton, and on a hotel scale that is the ONLY reason I would think to not give five stars, but for their hotel class, I'm very comfortable giving the five-star rating. The ""Towers"" is clean, well-appointed and has a great location on the river. You can walk everywhere. So what I am writing about today is the absolute ABOVE AND BEYOND service my boyfriend and I received from, yes, San Diego. ""San Diego"", you're asking? Yep. We decided to send his parents here (who live an hour away from in Indiana) as part of a wine and dine Chicago weekend as a combined anniversary/Christmas gift. I called the hotel ahead of time to tell them about this special couple and to ask if there was any way they would consider a room upgrade. **DISCLAIMER: Now I want to make something really clear here. There are times that hotels just do not have the ability or the room to give out upgrades. So please don't think you'll read my review and magically get upgrades just because you ask for one. It helps that this was Chicago in the winter, and thus there was more likelihood for upgrade availability. Well, I received a voicemail at my office from a lovely lady who let me know they would be upgrading my boyfriend's parents to a club level suite. On top of that they also informed me they would be giving them an anniversary amenity, and assured us everything would be great with their stay. They emailed the credit card authorization forms and got everything taken care of in advance of their arrival so all they had to do was RELAX! When my boyfriend's dad - who is an extremely even keeled man- called to let us know they had checked in, he was actually choked up! It is not about a ""club level suite"" or the amenity. It *IS* about making a very special couple know that they are just that - special. My written thank-you will be following, but I cannot stress enough that if you just ask nicely, even if you can't always be accommodated, the staff will do what they can to make you comfortable. While in Chicago I do have many options and several hotels I do absolutely enjoy. However, the ""Towers"" will be my home away from home of choice for not just talking the talk, but walking the walk. HUGE THUMBS UP on my Thumbs Up list! and I mean HUUUUGE!",N
4776,"Just left a two day/night stay at the Palmer house & have zero plans to return. The ""old charm"" of the place is valid, but wears off when your room has no hot water, you end up having to change rooms & then get the worst neighbors in the room next door. Being an older building, you can't expect sound proof rooms, but when the hotel refuses to do anything about your neighbors loud singing, loud talkin & then wild kingdom sounding like mating ritual, well that was under impressive. Mind you this was occurring between 3 & 4 in the morning. Only posting 1 star because the engineer worked really hard trying to fix the hot water issue.",Y
1624,"I stayed here last week when I was in town to see a couple of shows. The first thing I noticed upon my arrival was the professionalism of the staff.  I was very impressed with their helpful attitudes. Next, I ordered room service since I was crunched for time and found it to be enjoyable...no complaints.  I liked the room I stayed in and did not find it to be as small as I expected after reading other reviews.  It was certainly larger and, dare I say nicer, than the room I stayed in at the Hard Rock Hotel during my only other visit to Chicago.  The bathroom was huge and nicely decorated with a shower and tub and two vanities.  I did not have a problem with the elevators unlike other reviewers.  In fact, there was one waiting for me on several occasions.  The only things I saw as lacking was there was no refrigerator in the room and the bar in the lobby is lame compared to the one at Hard Rock.  Other than that, I'd much rather stay at Hotel 71 on my next visit to Chicago.  It doesn't have the ""cool"" factor that the Hard Rock has but in many aspects, I found it to be a better hotel.",N
4576,"While strolling around without any agenda, we decided to see what the Palmer House had to offer in terms of bar/restaurant.  A very charming young bellman escorted us to the restaurant, which did not open for another 30 minutes.  I was excited because the place is opulent and sophistocated looking.  I immediately began to daydream about the steak I would soon be eating.  We took a seat in the bar, with the promise of a table the moment the restaurant opened.  5:00 PM came and went and no one ever came for us.  The server in the bar seemed annoyed that we did not want alcohol, but did order cappucino and 2 large bottles of Peligrino.  He hovered, and not in an eager to please way, but was intrusive until we finally got the hint that we were taking up space meant for  big spenders.  He left a check and came back to open the tab book several times before we actually put money in there.  Then, he rounded the change DOWN, leaving $4.00 even instead of the $4 and coins that would have been accurate.  We left without a word, and had dinner elsewhere.  And yes, we left a tip because, alas, we are NOT cheap.  Shame on us for not speaking up at the time, but shame on them more!",N
2078,"My husband and I are were looking for an economical place to stay in a great location. This hotel fit the bill. I'll have to say that the view was wonderful and for the price we paid through http://priceline.com, really a steal. The rooms are a tad dated, but again for the price, you can't beat it. The bedding and pillows were comfortable. The hotel needs to overhaul the 80's wallpaper and get fresh, fluffy towels for the bathrooms to compete with other business downtown.  We will both stay again as it's centrally located and priced so well.",N
5477,"The location was excellent and the staff was wonderful. The staff was friendly, professional, and met every expectation. The room was adequate, but not special in any way. There was a whirpool tub and a shower stall. The shower stall was very tight (and I'm slender!), but the water pressure was amazing. Some rust on the hinges in the bathroom and discolored rubber molding in the bathroom showed its wear and tear. I have not seen a TV that old in a hotel room since the 1990s. The beds were only double, while the industry standard is now queens. If you asked the right question you received internet access for free, otherwise there was a daily fee. A decent place to stay all-in-all, but not as good as I expected.",N
1550,Stayed at Hotel 71 last weekend and had a really nice time. They upgraded us to a river view room since we were only staying a night. Very nice! The rooms are very sizable and have great amenities. I particularly loved the shower (overhead). The only negative I encountered with Hotel 71 is parking. Not surprising due to its awesome location. Parking is expensive and you cannot get your car on demand. For me it wasn't a big deal. There are a lot of parking options (and much cheaper!) if you're willing to walk a couple blocks.,N
1679,"The Hotel Allegro should have been a five star experience. I mean, what's not to like about a hotel in downtown Chicago, close to everything, especially the theater district, that offers impeccable service in a contemporary environment? Read on, I say. It had been a long day and while I rarely stay in the city since I live here- I was treating my team to a little outing and they wanted to stay in the city so who am I to say no? Due to other commitments, I got to the hotel late and checked in. The lobby is up one level from the street and is decorated in a fun and contemporary way. Know that Kimpton Hotels are pet friendly so I had to maneuver my way around a couple of dogs that had made themselves at home in the front lobby. The desk clerk checked me in quickly and I was in my room moments later. I loved the room layout. I had a corner room with lots of windows, plush pillows on the bed, and a comfy chair. The bed was turned down, the radio on and as I was unpacking my bag I spied two animal print robes in the closet. Rrrrrrrrrrrr! I slipped into one and nibbled a bit on the basket of fruit and cheese that had been sent to the room. Wanting to have a glass of wine to go with it- I went over to the mini bar. It was at this point that I noticed that my mini bar key was broken and no amount of ""finagling"" on my part would open the door. Oh well. I didn't need that wine anyway is what my rational side was saying. My emotional side? Was already whining about no wine! As I settled in for bed- it seemed like a good idea to use the bathroom before I turned in. Imagine my surprise when I flushed and all the water came up instead of going down. Urrgh! Made me think about who the heck was in the room before me? I called down to the front desk and they said they would send an engineer up right away. Oh great. Here I am in my cute leopard print robe. That would never do for a ""visitor"". So I got dressed again to await the man with the steel snake (Trust me. That sounds more interesting than it was!) Other than those two issues and valet parking that was a third of the cost of the room ($48- can you believe that for one night? $42 if you park it yourself) my stay was perfect. Complimentary coffee brought up in the morning, Aveda toiletries in the bathroom, plush towels, chocolates, free wireless, flat screen TV's, everything that I would expect from a hotel of this caliber. And the price was right. You can get a negotiated rate of about $150 - $190 per night which is cheap for this part of town. Would I recommend it? You betcha. Only next time I'm going to flush the toilet BEFORE I put the cute leopard print robe on.",N
113,"Rooms are VERY SMALL! Not a criticism, just a fact. Our room was approximately 10 X 12 with a view of a brick wall about 3 feet from the window. However: great price for the great location, wonderful bed, big screen TV, free WiFi, AC, breakfast included. Terrific staff. If you just need a comfortable, clean place to sleep and shower this works great.",N
3901,"This is what I have to say about this poorly reviewed hotel. Location, Location, Location. Good Prices, Go with low expectations and be surprised to get a room with great views, clean faculties and comfortable beds. As a city tourist I wanted to be close to the water, near the museums and shopping.  With easy access for transportation weather it being taxi, bus or airport shuttle.  I went there with my sister who had to work, while I toured.   We got a room with a kings size bed and a full/queen size bed, located at the corner of the building and the layout was perfect for us two.   Yep the bathroom was dated, but clean.  You can tell they have remodeled recently.  I had gone there October 2009, so I was pleased to have a very pleasant stay.   Skip the hotel store....just go down one block to CVS if you need supplies.  And we did not drink at the bar... but we did eat a quick breakfast at the restaurant, I would not do that again.  The food was a 2 star.  Besides if you walk just a block or two there is so many other choices for your taste buds.   Again the location  is fantastic for a tourist or if you have business in this town.  I would return to this hotel and again have low expectations and ask for a corner spot.",N
3676,"Drake = disappointing Having lived in Chicago my entire life, I was PUMPED about a night at the Drake. It's an icon... looking all magnificent and dignified when you see it while driving down LSD.   A good friend of mine decided to use his points to treat my husband and myself to a night downtown for my birthday. The Mr. had bought tickets for Mary Poppins and was taking me out for sushi... it was shaping up to be a pretty bitchin' birthday. Check in: quick, painless. Lobby is impressive. Rooms: Frankly, I've stayed in better hotels that charge less per night. What you're getting at the Drake is location... well... that and customer service (supposedly). The beds were comfy, the bathroom nice but it all left me underwhelmed. Except for the view. The view of LSD was awesome.  The beds were super comfy... I will certainly give them that. A run down of our experience:   Customer service: not great. Not even good.  My friends had decided to order us some appetizers and a birthday cake and have it delivered to our room.  They requested it be delivered after 6:00 to ensure that we were settled in before it came.  Pretty much moments after we got into our room at 3:30-ish, we had a knock on the door.  The spread was awesome but I feel bad that our friends had requested a specific time and it was disregarded.  Oh well.  So we went out, had a great evening... had a great sleep... then upon checkout, saw that the room had been charged for the cake and apps that our friends had sent.  Me being the one who never wants to create trouble just told my husband to charge the expense... it was a nice thought but they shouldn't have to pay for our cake.  But he insisted just in case we were BOTH charged for that goofy cake.  So, he called our friends who were then embarassed.  It took a few minutes for us to clear it up at the hotel but our poor friend was dealing with it for days.   I guess the long and the short is that we were supposed to have awesome customer service and didn't get it.  Super disappointing.  If we ever want to do a night downtown again, we might as well go to the Westin or something down the street that is going to be cheaper with better service.   But MANY THANKS to our generous friends that hooked up the room and treats!  :)",N
1623,"stayed here on my biz trip a few weeks back and was pleasantly surprised with the room. bigger than most standard hotel rooms with a nice loungy couch and big windows to view downtown chicago.  nice hip decor and free internet access in room. the bathroom had a nice mirrored closet. would come back again. but i dont think they have a hotel bar.  oh by the way, the penhouse was used as Bruce Wayne's penthouse from The Dark Knight",N
5602,"I was not an overnight guest here but I did attend a seminar here recently.  From the looks of it, this place looks like a nice hotel.  It's in a nice location and walking distance to a lot of places. Their conference/special events facilities are very nice.  Comfy seats, clean rooms and yummy treats.",N
4921,spent my 30th anniversary here.. absolute best service of any hotel I've ever stayed !!!!,Y
1325,"I always wondered what is so special about Ritz Carlton until I happen to stay there. As far as location is concerned, this particular Ritz is located in close proximity to the finest dining and shopping boutiques of Chicago.   As soon as I entered the hotel I was greeted by staff member who escorted me to the main lobby. The lobby has marble floors, thick carpet, lots of pillars, a fountain and chandeliers which gives it a very grand look. After the check in with friendly staff i headed to my rooms. The bedroom had dark colors like most of the European hotels with colonial style furniture giving a very majestic appeal. My bed room had view of the art museum and park across the street I received exceptional service during my 2 weeks of stay. They offer complimentary shoe shine everyday .I gave my clothes for laundry one morning and upon my return, I found two cane baskets on the bed with Ritz Carlton wax paper. My first thoughts were, hot fresh bread but when I opened it, it was my laundry, ironed and folded. I was totally blown away. they have a pretty decent gym/work out room with very courteous staff. they even provide Personal trainer service upon request. the locker room is even better than a country club with mahogany lockers, wool carpets and leather chairs. Honestly, I have never seen a locker room so nice. All in all, i was impressed by the personal attention i got . the hotel staff was extremely observant and seemed like the policy was never let the customer ask for it twice. Every evening upon return i use to find bottle water by my bed side, favorite music playing and bath robe placed on the bed. Perfect way to unwind after a long day. Not to mention having a cab ready at 8am sharp with out asking. As i mentioned, all the hotel staff is very attentive.",N
3531,"First, the good. Great location. So close to everything downtown. Staff was friendly enough. The valet is $40 per night, but honestly, the self park garages around the area charge the same for 24 hours, so it's really the going rate. It just seems like a circus in the valet area, so you're almost better off parking across the street at the self park. Now, the bad. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite, which would go for around $340 per night on the weekend, but we did not pay full price. When you see a rate like that, you expect a great quality stay, but not in this case. The light switch covers were falling off in several places throughout our room. The flat screen T.V. was blurry (odd!). The Wi-Fi continuously disconnected. The shower had no water pressure (looked like it needed a good dip in CLR) and the towel rack was hung inside the shower? The coffee maker had an old coffee pod in it from a previous guest. Yuck. Also, out of 6 packages of coffee, 5 were decaf. Really? The walls were really thin. Complete conversations could be heard through them. The doors did not close without some muscle. The wait for the elevator (and there were 3 of them) was really long. We were not impressed. We had stayed at the Fairfield Inn about a block away a few years back, and seriously, it was far cleaner and better maintained. And about half the price. A few other things happened that were beyond the control of the hotel, but they were still annoying. We had some smokers on our floor, and after a call to the front desk, security came and told them it was a non-smoking hotel. Thankfully, that seemed to do the trick. But it was hours before the smell dissipated. Also, a dog peed in the elevator right as we were getting on. But, who wants to get back out and wait who knows how long for another one? Again, not the fault of the hotel, but when so many other things were bad, it just added to the negative vibe. I think there are many hotels in that area that are cheaper and better maintained. Crowne Plaza definitely needs to take a close look at housekeeping and maintenance. I would not recommend this hotel.",N
4232,"I am writing to review HARD DRIVE...the club in the lobby. It's spacious and really non-stuffy like usual clubs. The open bar is good...10-11 and the night we went, there was a promo on Skyy. We tried every flavor :) Fun times overall.",N
3423,"This hotel is small and everything in it is smaller, just get past this theme and you'll enjoy your stay. On a separate note the valet and the hotel manager that was on duty during our stay were amazing. I was driving a rental car and had side swiped another vehicle leaving a long white scratch on the uninsured rental vehicle. What a bummer! The valet sensed my distress and spent over 15 minutes, with the help of the hotel manager, buffing out the scratch. Mind you, they had no involvement in the prior scrape! They genuinely just wanted to help. Absolutely amazing customer service that will not go overlooked. I would go back just for this reason alone! Thank you Hotel Allerton!",N
90,"We had a teeny little dinner (18 people) here the night before the boy's Bar Mitzvah, and some of our guests stayed here.  A lovely hotel with gracious service.  You won't get a pool and fitness center, but the location and charm more than make up for it.  Dana and Annelise gave our small-scale event the same attention and service that they'd give to a 200-person wedding.  The food was was tasty, though not very inventive. The thing is, that you won't get away cheap.  There are room charges on top of the food charges, which is why we had the main event at Maggiano's.",N
2168,"Do stay here if you're on the company dime or get a deal off of hotwire, etc. Otherwise, I don't think it's worth the price, typically between $250 and $300 per night.  There are two different categories of rooms.  The main hotel used to be the Forum hotel back in the 1980's.  Back then, they advertised it as ""business class'.  The tower portion is much nicer but you'll pay a premium for one of these rooms.  Yes, their ammenties are very nice and the rooms in the tower are unusual, not your standard cookie cutter shaped hotel rooms.  The rooms in the main portion are nice just not as luxurious.     Catering staff does a bang up shop at a premium price.  I love the meeting space, very unusual but it is an old hotel so there are not a whole lot of wide open spaces for networking. Love the health club and the  indoor pool is totally cool,very 1930's Palm Beach vibe. Parking is expensive but what isn't off of Mich Ave? Trivia, you ask?  This is the only hotel with a Michigan Avenue address that actually has an entrance right on Michigan Avenue.  Cool, huh?",N
286,"One of the best hotel values I've experienced.  The room felt like my own one bedroom apartment in Chicago.  Quiet and private and perfect for a romantic getaway or trist...;o).  The location can't be beat.  Right by the Hancock Center.  The level of service was excellent as well.  If I ever visit Chitown again, I'll most likely look to stay here.",N
4100,"Dump. This is the most feared type of downtown lodging on earth: the convention hotel. It's actually just fine if you're looking to encounter wild packs of dry humping, married business men in town for the Dunder Mifflin paper expo.  But if you're not, you may want to steer clear of this place.  I accidentally stayed (well, entered the room and left) here after booking on Hotwire and our room looked and smelled like Amy Winehouse just checked out of it.  I should note, however, that the valet and bellmen were friendly and professional. The irony is that it's just as expensive as the nearby Conrad (Hilton family) or Intercontinental which are great places to stay. Another incredible pain in the ass was check in.  Two front desk people were chatting, another was behind the counter and yet they insisted I use the kiosk to check in.  It was a pain to say the least.  Then when we came back downstairs to checkout they seemed really offended by it and were pretty rude about it all.",N
2536,"So, when I went in here on a Friday with friends and fam, I was like, hmmm. 1st- the sign outside looks like a scary movie sign. Like, it looks abandoned, but there's this compelling force that makes you want to go in. Besides, all the other stupid people were right on their way in. So, shoot, we should get killed by Freaky Jason too. 2nd- Walked in (after a stupid 20 dollar cover) and it was not what I expected. I expected the victor to be a grown and sexy shin dig. It was just a night club filled with youngers and one sexed crazed dude. He was trippin, oh yes he was girl! 3rd- After about 20mins, got me a bottle of my Moscato d'asti Saracco 2007 I believe they had, or maybe 8 and then, the DJ started doing HIS THANG!! I mean, throw back stuff for at least 30mins and I was like, this is it. It was an enjoyable night. However, I would not go back if there's something else live and poppin or if I can get there before 11 when it was free.",N
855,"The location is what makes this hotel. I came to the city for a long weekend and wanted a place that would be central to the Art Institute and to Mag Mile shopping.  I am always baffled by the world of Chicago hotels, in which my options  seem to narrow to either a $600/night room at the Fairmont, or a Travelodge experience where I'm taking my life in my hands (but oh, so cheap!). The Silversmith hotel fills this void in the travel landscape serviceably, if not memorably. I'm not convinced I'd stay here again.I almost feel that if I'd had more lead time, that I could have found a nicer room elsewhere at a recognized hotel chain.  The Silversmith's rooms, although spacious, lack some of the more thoughtful appointments (to wit: the shower had only one slot for soap and the selection of toiletries could have been amplified as there was no showercap, shower gel, or hair conditioner). The decor was a bit of a hodgepodge--almost as though someone decided to clean out their storage closets/rec rooms in a bid to quickly furnish this hotel. The rooms did have a fridge and microwave, however, a boon for the budget-conscious or time-strapped traveler (especially with CVS at the ready). The hotel has a gym and business center and the bellmen are good about checking luggage and hailing cabs, which is always a plus.",N
2460,"I stayed here last weekend for some family-time.  I was initially disappointed when I found out we'd be staying here as opposed to one of the ""hipper"" hotels in the area.  My opinion very quickly changed.  The Chicago Hilton is one of the grand dame luxury hotels in Chicago.  They've hosted a bunch of presidents, celebrities, rich folks, etc and they've got the system down pat.  Luxurious well-appointed spaces, an attentive staff, a tony location and comfortable rooms make this a great hotel.  The ball rooms are absolutely gorgeous - dripping in elegance,class and timeless beauty.  The spa, fitness center and pool/hot tubs are clean and lovely.   We booked a suite - a great upgrade at only a small price jump - and were delighted by the amount of room we had including many many windows, a Murphy bed, a bar, sweeping lake views and lots of storage.  The only downside of the room was the tiny bathroom with very little counter space.  Oh well.... I got over it.   One more thing to note - We ate in all of the restaurants (Kitty O'Shea's, Lakeside Green Lounge (the hotel bar) and The Pavilion) and found the food disappointing in each - overpriced, underwhelming, and very limited in choices.  Your best bet is to take advantage of one of the many wonderful restaurants Chicago has to offer and skip the hotel's food offerings altogether.",N
4705,"I just stayed here for a week in Chi town, and Yes the room is small, but I loved it! I LOVE the modern eco friendly hotel,  the service was IMPECCABLE! I had a small problem with a credit card, and they fixed it asap! the front desk guy  was awesome, he always knew my name every night when I got home and every morning when I was leaving for work! What hotel does that? The products in the shower were great! The bed nice and soft, the room service yummy, and the room was always clean! My two complaints, the shower curtain, it was too short, and the cable! NO Vh1, Bravo, or MTV!! Whaaaa? I was there a week! Other than that, I believe if you facebook them, they offer deals that are an AWESOME rate. There is also a Whole foods within walking distance, several places to eat, and Michigan Ave is close. it's also across the street from Angels and Kings. Also, the restaraunt Elate is FANTASTIC! (review on that in a bit!)  the best salmon I have had in a while, good wine selection, and tasty cocktails! I would DEFINATELY stay there when in chicago!!!",N
3954,"This place is not nearly as bad as most of the reviews would have you believe.  It's just old.  The staff was friendly and the lobby was actually pretty nice.  The room was $87 per night and was about half the size of a normal hotel room.  It was a bit beat-up.  For example, the baseboard had some sizable dents in it, and the paint was peeling on the heating unit.  Also, the bed was not the greatest.  The view was cool though, and it was certainly clean and sanitary.  No bed bugs, horrible smells, or anything like that.  So it's a decent value for the price and it will be fine as long as your expectations aren't too high.",N
4637,Service was good. Rooms are tiny.  I'm talking barely enough space to walk around the bed. If you're claustrophobic... ask for larger rooms. No coffee maker. Good location if you're coming to enjoy the night life.,N

It was clean, modern yet vintage, and the service was excellent. They even had complimentary hot chocolate with real marshmallows at all times. The location couldn't have been better it was a short walk to everything:) I would stay again.",N

2278,"LOCATION is the best part of the hotel. GREAT location. Walking distance to some great restaurants (which was key for me because I spent a week here for a conference that did not serve food so I was on my own for every meal - and I hate hotel food). The bar/lobby area was AWESOME too - totally vibrant, lots of people, nice vibe. I brought my laptop down there because I had no WiFi in my room - which is my #1 complain with this hotel. I can't remember the last time I was at a hotel where I had to plug my laptop into an outlet! #FAIL My other complaint is the cable - hardly any channels - no Bravo, no VH1 - I look forward to business trips because I can watch some trashy reality TV and decompress from stressful days. But not here. However, the fitness center is GREAT! Weight room and an aerobic room! One of the best I've ever seen. Which is great because I ate my way through Chicago!",N
2346,"The service is wonderful here - the room looks like it could be 'freshened up', but they are renovating right now, so maybe that's next.  The view is amazing - I'm looking out at the lake right now.  Not only are they quick with service, they also followed up to be sure that the housekeeper I had requested came. However, room service menu both very pricey and pretty lame.  Far too many good places to eat nearby - no need to waste your time/money inside.",N
289,"The Seneca is pleasant.  Not outdamnstanding, but pleasant.  My room was basically a one bedroom apartment.  The bed was comfortable. The furnishings were okay.  I would have given this place four stars, but for one thing.  The bedroom window treatments consist of miniblinds and sheers.  In the middle of the city, this means you will be bathed in city lights all night as you are trying to sleep.  They need actual light-blocking draperies. Really.  It's such a simple fix.  Why don't they just install drapes?   If you don't need darkness to sleep, then this is a reasonably priced place to stay.  Otherwise, you might be better off going elsewhere.",N
4837,"I stay here - whenever I can. I do have membership to both starwood (sheraton) and hyatt (passport). Excellent point systems in both hotels, but good sheratons (with a view) at reasonable corporate prices are rare to find in Chicago downtown. So, that leaves me with this Hyatt - and this one is really nice. Marriott's and Hiltons and Holiday Inn's take for ever to build up points to get a free night, so I tend to avoid them if I can.I always enjoy staying in this hotel. Rooms are fantastic and being a platinum member, I always get great views - 20th floor and higher.I go here for the views, room decor, great bathroom (towels seem cheap tho), and quietness in the rooms. Most rooms have large LCD screen TVs (with horrible resolution:) ), hotel has good service and ""that"" BIG BAR.Tip: There is a dominicks (safeway grocery store) across the river where you can get great wine, fresh fruits and juices if you are planning on staying for over 2-3days. Internet is extra 13+/night, and a mini fridge is 25/stay.",Y
5463,"rooms nice/staff unhelpful I stayed here for one night this past week.  The room was tidy and comfortable, and the beds nice.however, some parts were dated, like the TV, which was CRT and had a terrible warp in the picture around the sides.  On the negative side, the concierge and front desk staff were totally unhelpful.  They had way too much trouble answering simple transit and restaurant related questions, and, because of their answers, we found ourselves late for an appointment across town.",N
3074,"My recent stay at this hotel was *terrible*.  The hallways were dirty, the room was in terrible disrepair, with paint chipped on the tables, threads hanging loose on the lampshades, the headboard falling off the wall, and dust on the desk supplies.  The room as a whole was small and cave-like. The worst experience though, was with the staff, one of whom tried to enter the room while I had the ""do not disturb"" sign up. (thank god for the chain!)  I was really shocked at the really poor quality of such a high-priced hotel, and will never be staying there again.",N

Location is awesome.  2-3 blocks from N.Michigan ave, half a block to Redline train, across the street is Jewel Osco where you can get your groceries, snacks and CTA card!

4118,"I stayed here after staying at a smaller boutique hotel. Its posh for sure. Nice size rooms and a huge bathroom. I just cant believe they nickel and dime you for everything. Example:WiFi , at 12 dollars a day. A hotel this size can be giving that away. And whats with $4 water??? Really, come on. Its water. Plus this place was insane.  People were trashed all over the place... lots of patrons slurring things to strangers walking by, stumbling around like they were at a frat party.  Unfortunately thats the first impression I got before I reached the check in and thats what I remember most. Considering its a Hyatt its not that special, its just large and they'll make sure you'll remember your  paying  for the name.",N
5320,"This hotel is a joke!  We paid $380 for a tiny, musty smelling broom closet with 1 mini bar of soap to share between the sink and shower and cheesy plastic cups.  The location is fabulous but there is no way anyone should stay here.  There are much nicer hotels in Chicago!",Y
2590,"So apparently Victor Hotel changes dramatically depending on the promoter.  Went here on a different Sat and it was pretty empty.  BUT, the DJ was still great!  And the bartenders were again very friendly (especially if you go to the smaller bar behind the DJ).

3436,"This is another one of those times when I would LOVE to have a half star function.  3.5 Stars is exactly what I want to give.  We stayed here this weekend for a friends birthday. The Pros: 1) The rooms are beautifully decorated.  They really have worked to keep the style very vintage 1950s chic, and it is working.   2)  The staff is friendly, professional and attentive.  Even the bellhop was a really nice guy (thanks for everything Moises!) The Cons: This room we stayed in was TINY.  REALLY, REALLY TINY.  I felt like Alice in Wonderland when she gets all big and the house she is in is little.  I could touch the ceiling.  The bathroom (while beautifully decorated)  was pint size, and oh, did I mention the FULL SIZE bed?  A Full.  Really, for a four star hotel? So many things about this hotel were great, but I would have to know in advance the size of my room before staying here again.",N
4469,"So, if your not wanting to stay in a chain Hotel with cookie cutter options then this might be your place. Elegant and clean with a location inside the Loop. From the airport take the Blue line and get off at the Monroe stop. $2.25 and 30 minutes later your 2 blocks away.... The rooms are VERY small so get an Executive Floor room and enjoy more room and on the 23rd floor everyday you get breakfast and a bar at night with free munchies. NO WIFI......... ethernet....WTF No flat screen TV. but Showtime is free.... Great GYM for $10 a day.... Parking is $30 a day .... Sweet lounge/bar but pricey...... Overall we had a blast and only paid $95 a night with priceline so it was well worth the price.... Chicago rocks........",N
2735,"Even though I wasn't too crazy about the bathroom (no fan and very shallow sink), I LOVE this hotel. It's no wonder it has a five-star rating: incomparable customer service; friendly, professional staff; great gym; beautiful, well appointed rooms; Kiehl's products; and David Burke's Primehouse (their asiago popovers are to die for). The location is fantastic as well. We were upgraded to a suite at check-in (thanks, Marco, you're the best!), which was the perfect start to our six-day vacation in Chicago. There was no view to speak of (when we looked out our windows we saw the back of the hotel), but it didn't really matter since we didn't stay in much. It was great having an extra sitting area (with TV) to unwind in after a long day of walking around and taking in this awesome city. I would love to stay here again.",N
1101,"This is not so much for the hotel but for the ballroom on the second floor where we had a party, and then for the restaurant, Aria. For the party:  3 stars. We were welcomed into the hotel lobby, then swept up the stairs. All was fine until we walked into the ballroom... I've heard that there are a few beautiful ball rooms in this hotel, but this one was somewhat lacking. It transported me back to my days of bat and bar mitzvah's on the north shore of Long Island. Two big glitzy gold chandeliers, a small dance floor, mirrors on both sides of the walls, and... that's about it.  The ceilings were kind of low, too, and coupled with the dim lighting in this space, it felt kind of oppressive. Throw in  two severely understaffed free-standing bars (read: one bartender at each bar) with rude bartenders (probably overstressed, overworked, and underpaid), and you see why this event venue was a disappointment. For the restaurant: 2.5 stars. I'd read some good things about Aria, but having given it two shakes, I've decided I don't like it. For the price, you can easily find better food and a much more aesthetically pleasing environment. I will say, however, that they have a very delicious mushroom soup. I believe it's something like ""mushroom soup your mother never made."" I think my greatest qualms with the restaurant is the space. It's very long and narrow, making it awkward to maneuver around. Also, the restaurant is kind of divided into three separate sections - the front area for the bar, then a hostess booth hidden behind a wall, and then, as you keep walking, what appears to be another room. The layout is very awkward.",N
2296,"My brother used to stay at this location on business and he recommended it to me and although you pay a little extra for the area, its still an okay price. The bar is very well stocked, the service was friendly and quick to serve and the seats were very comfortable. But since its in a big open space and near the side entrance it can get chilly sat there if the heat isn't cranked up at night. I wish the Starbucks was open a little later, but with so many others surrounding the hotel, its a minor complaint. I was a fan of the restaurant- both breakfast and dinner was delicious but its was rather overpriced. The gym was perfect both in stock, cleanliness and smell. The wi-fi 'deals' apparently improved vastly since the refurb so that no longer effects my rating. And of course the room itself, was...well standard Marriott. Big comfy bed with plenty of extra pillows and blankets and the bathroom had a pretty decent shower. It was among the cleanest hotels I've ever stayed in and the friendliest. Will definitely recommend this location to my mother (and shes even pickier than me!) if she visits me late next year.",N
4359,"My husband loves this place, hence our stay. I've been three times and the lobby is a wonderful place to people watch and hang out. Most of the rooms have been updated, which is also nice. It's about a mile from the more popular stores on the strip, so if you're a walker you'll like that, if you're not that won't be so fun. It's a nice stay, nice staff and a Starbucks on the street level. I'll stay again.",N
5232,"It is okay.  Definitely not the nicest Ritz Carlton.  Actually more on the lower end of the ones at which I have stayed.  The decor needs updating.  Went to a wedding here...it was okay....somewhat nice for a wedding but bad for a Ritz.  The food could have been better.  The ballroom was full of peach and was felt very old.  There are not a lot of great photo opportunities in this hotel (it is in a mall...which also cheapens it a little), so keep that in mind if you want to have an event here.",Y
4549,"When visiting Chicago for my semi-quartely pilgrimage to CSO, I always end up staying here not because I like stayin' here but you can get a good deal through various travel websites.  Also the fact that it's only a few blocks away from the hall is a big plus.  Rooms are tiny but that's what you expect at hotels smack in the middle of downtown of any city.  They don't give you a spankin' clean vibe but acceptable sans their rug.  It's close to everything including the Art Institute and shopping.  I haven't tried the restaurants at the premise but the bar downstairs is cozy and they have good sliders.  Subway from O'Hare takes you practically here so that's another plus.",N
240,"I truly enjoyed my stay at Hotel Indigo.  The staff is exceptionally kind and attentive, very welcoming. The bed was REALLY comfortable, and the space was fantastic - particularly for the price point.  Nearby there is a very nice grocery store, a Starbucks, restaurants, and the red-line train is only about 3 blocks away.  Plus, it's a simple walk to Michigan Avenue for anything you could ever hope for.  The unique decor was much more soothing in person than I anticipated by the photos.  It actually works. I liked the fitness center, and the attention to small details. The internet connection worked perfectly and was complimentary! Very quality experience.  Definitely staying here again when I'm in Chicago! I'd like to send a particularly warm shout out to Victoria, who was the best of the best and very helpful.  To the management: GIVE VICTORIA A RAISE.",N
3773,"I am just coming off my HIGH from my girls weekend at the Dana Hotel. My best friend and I met at the Dana for a fun filled weekend to celebrate life. Instead of exchanging Christmas/Valentines gifts, we decided to take a girls trip and get a little rowdy. The Dana was perfect! We both got in on Friday but her train was delayed so I enjoyed the AMAZING view, AMAZING room, and OMG the shower! This hotel is quite possibly the sexiest place I have ever stayed. While we opted to keep it clean and not stare at each other in the nude, this would be the BEST place to go for a sexy love retreat with your favorite favorite. The 2 nights we were there were amazing. We had our first cocktail and amazing meal down at Aja and ended our vacay with a delicious breakfast at the hotel. The mini-bar was tempting late-night and even a great value but we didn't indulge. We loved our experience at the Dana so much that we have promised to return sometime in the summer to take advantage of the SPA and VERTIGO! *I'm knocking one star for a sometimes dirty/smelly elevator and a remote that didn't work but really...who is watching TV?*",N
4230,Comfortable rooms and beautiful view of the water.  A great location in the city and only a few minutes by car to the University of Chicago,N
368,"I'm suprised by the harsh reviews. It's certainly not a fancy hotel, but it's relatively cheap and centrally located. If you're visiting Chicago for the first time and on a tight budget, I think it's a great place to stay. It's close to mass transit, walking distance from a variety of musems and bars, and pretty safe. For blues lovers, Buddy Guy's bar is a block away.",N
2879,"Went here to meet up with a friend.... The lobby is super nice...the rooms are no bones....which is fine because we werent sitting in the room. Its a great location....close to downtown, close to the lake, close to public trans, etc. They have all the standards. You know me, judging a hotel room based on if they have an exhaust fan....alas, they do not....",N
2051,"I stayed here for five nights during a conference, and had a very pleasant time. The room was clean and comfortable with a great view of the skyline (19th floor). The wireless internet was sometimes slow, but I was able to do what I needed to do. Service at the front desk was helpful. I also enjoyed visiting Italiasia (the hotel restaurant) and the Skyline Bar. A few complaints -- the ""Business Center"" was tiny and charged per minute to use the computers, or per page for print/fax. And while restaurant prices for lunch and dinner were reasonable (including for room service), breakfast was insanely expensive. Thankfully, the food court at Merchandise Mart has a Dunkin Donuts and a Jamba Juice, so if you're willing to take a walk (all inside, through the corridor connecting the buildings on the second floor) you can get your coffee, bagel, and banana for less than $12. The location was great -- easy access to CTA and some restaurants, right on the lovely Riverwalk, and within a cheap cab ride of everywhere I wanted to go. I'd recommend it to others who are visiting Chicago who.",N
5591,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights last month while we were in town for a wedding. He is a Starwood Preferred Guest, which is a great loyalty program and ensured we had a great room even though we had booked it using hotel points. The rooms and bathrooms were nice and clean and spacious, albeit very standard in the business hotel sense. The staff were helpful and efficient, and it was a great location that allowed us to walk or take a short cab anywhere we wanted to go. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Chicago for work or play. It doesn't exactly burst with personality, but it had everything one could need.",N
3466,"So, I stayed at this hotel for one night and had a couple of beefs with the hotel.  I had a special rate that was being offered, but it was noted that I may have to contact one of the hotel staff to ensure that I could get the rate.  Well, despite 3 phone calls and 3 messages, that hotel staff member NEVER called me back.  Ever.  Thank goodness for decent reservations operators who helped me out eventually.   As for the hotel itself, it's location is fabulous.  It is right on Michigan Ave (entrance slightly off Michigan Ave) - the TIP TOP TAP building!  I will echo others' comments on the closet sized elevator (if I had large luggage, getting in would have been a problem!) and small-ish rooms.  The check-in was efficient and nice, and they gave me and my friend one of the ""larger"" rooms.  Boy am I glad he did, because even then, it was a bit tiny! Of the room itself.  One major problem which was the floor between the room and bathroom - almost stubbed my foot on a nail (pointy end!) twice - they seriously need to fix that problem as the last thing a hotel guest wants is another tetanus shot on their vacation/trip!  Another smaller problem - the fact that they wanted to charge you for internet access!  Thank goodness we managed to find some ""free"" wireless from some other buildings nearby.  I personally didn't mind the bed, but my friend thought it was too hard.   Hmmm...  it wasn't all bad!  I loved the shower!  :)   Overall, for the price paid, not bad, especially for the convenience of the location.  But they definitely could fix things, starting with their staff - CALL PEOPLE BACK!!!",N
4217,"Great location, but for the money would have liked a better view and cleaner hotel. Everything cost extra from TV ($5) and movies($16) to Internet($14/day).  Very busy, lots of guests.",N
2821,"This hotel definitely caters to families and big groups. The rooms are well-sized and well-appointed (furnishings new/recently updated). The common areas are generally well-kept and clean.  The pool is small, but nice, as is the fitness area.  There's an ""office"" services (printer, computer, Internet) which is available (apparently) free for guests.   We've never tried the Manager's Reception (the food doesn't look that great), but the breakfast buffet is substantial, and pretty high quality food. GREAT location - walkable to shopping, eating, museums, etc.  You'll save a lot in taxi fares if you stay here. Some of the downsides: a. Front desk staff is pretty perfunctory in how they deal with you. Check-in and check-out can take a long time, and if you want to store your bags (after you check-out), you might wait a long time. b. There aren't enough elevators at peak time (which is pretty much all day during the weekend).  Long lines for the elevators, which seem to stop on the lobby level only one at a time. c. Valet parking is very expensive ($46). d. Because of the hotel layout (all rooms face a courtyard), the rooms can be pretty noisy.",N
2787,"I truly hope that I can give a more accurate review of this place at a later date. I called the reservations line and an automated advertisement basically picked up the call and I stayed on hold for like 10 min. When a lady finally picked up I explained that I had made a reservation for my parents (for my wedding) on hotwire and that my fiance and I decided we would like to stay there too (and that we were getting married on Sept 12). I asked if she could give us the same rate as hotwire. She just said no, we can't do that. No, let me see what I can offer you. Hey - you sell your rooms to hotwire so don't get upset with me for booking with them at a cheaper rate. It just really bothers me when a hotel has a 4, 4 1/2 or 5 star rating and I have a bad experience from the moment I call. It's not what I would expect. Especially when it's a special occasion like my wedding. I bet if I would have called the Ritz Carlton they would have done it.",N
2941,"Ok, nice hotel, but the brunches are a bit week. The pool is small and not good for laps. Room service is clean and fresh, but nothing special. The fresh fruit was beautiful and fresh. This is not so much a family hotel, but if you are going to Navy Pier it works well. Also, they have a movie theater a block away.  This hotel could stand out if it wanted to, but unfortunately they have yet to walk the walk.",N
3905,"My husband and I stayed here during our small, budget honeymoon. We liked the location. Not far to all the things we wanted to see.  The room was average, nothing special. There are almost always picketers but they never bothered us.  The bathroom tile was a bit thrown together but all in all, nothing interfered with having a comfortable stay. My only disappointment is I didn't get a visit from the infamous ghosts! Lol!",N
802,"Ok, they have the best showers...if not the smallest bathrooms. And really, charging for everything? And ridiculous charges at that! Sure I realize baseball players stay here and they can spend money like water, but damn...I'm not Jay-Z! They also have awesome beds with great comforters, and the place is relatively sharp, clean, and fancy...but i'd never stay here if i had to spend more than $65.",N
325,"A recent visit shows City Suites is still as good as ever.  Friendly staff, clean rooms.  The TV was a bit stubborn but we were able to get it going.  For the first time in many visits I stayed on the 'El' side of the hotel.  The windows seal tightly to block out most noise from the train- I was rarely aware of it.  The convenience to the train is a huge plus!  Belmont is as busy as ever, but here are tons of great restaurants within walking distance.",N
1675,"I fell in love with this sweet boutique hotel the moment we checked in. The staff was helpful and courteous, and the ""lounge"" serving free wine and beer for happy hour was fantastic- a gorgeous fireplace, modern and funky decor and furniture, and good wine to boot. And the room! The room was AMAZING. Perfect pink and gold striped walls (okay sounds tacky, but trust me, it was DIVINE), beautiful crown molding,a fantastic chaise lounge, luscious brown silk headboards, and gorgeous high thread count bedding. Okay, I have hit my adjective threshold for one review...Suffice to say I was sad to leave after my week stay here.",N
575,"This hotel is a lot of fun. The design is great, as is the vibe. As you walk in, it feels opulent, some of the neo-classical and art-deco architectural elements are smoothed out with a soothing neutral palette. Service is excellent, both at reception, in the coffee bar and throughout the hotel. The lobby after 5:00p.m. can feel like party central, as it seems to be a hip after-work hang out spot - which didn't bother me, but it is a bit loud in the lobby in the evening. None of this noise affected me once I was off of that floor, however. The coffee bar is wonderful, too! The coffee is well-priced, and while it is a bit watery, this is standard across the United States. In a city that is known for its coffee roasters and coffee shops, however, definitely check out other places! Nonetheless, the decor is great at the coffee bar and the pastries they offer are not bad. The room was very comfortable - very visually soothing and a great place to unravel from my jam-packed days!",N
2066,"I agree with Allen M. I'd like to add that room service is fast, but the food is bland. they did not deliver the food on a tble so we had to eat on the bed and desk...ugh. No mayonase was delivered as asked or onions for the sandwich. All the food was clean and well made, but just tastless. The pizza was bad evenby kid standards (they eat anything). The pool was cold to me, but the kids seemed to enjoy it. I enjoyed the sauna. There is no whirlpool, ugh! Service was fine. The only special thing I can say about this place was the bar. View was excellent and they allowed the kids to sit and drink Shirley Temples. Must add that I left something in the room and it was returned. I should have been called when it was found, which is what happened at Disney when I left something. They actually called me and sent  the items to me. It ought to be standard to call when things are found.",N
1756,"Check ins went smoothly. But be advised.... Walls are super thin, the building is old and the rooms are very very very small. The downside of them allowing pets was that we could hear the poor dog barking in the morning probably because it needed to go out. For the price it wasn't bad. It was walking distance to most major attractions. Overall ... it's ok at best. Another plus is the CTA is close by.",N
4835,"Room comfortable, quiet, bed and linens first rate.  TV large, bath clean, furnishing comfortable, Wifi $14 per day extra. Front desk service great, luggage hold for room service not handicap friendly.",Y

4425,"My husband and I had our wedding in the Empire Room in August. Dennis Chaffee is extremely accomodating, organized, professional, reliable, and easy to contact. He gave priceless advice. It is obvious that he is very experienced. No request was too much to ask!  The majority of our guests booked rooms at the hotel- he made sure that all of the rooms were available as early as possible. The dinner was absolutely outstanding!  Many of the guests remarked that it was the ""best wedding food"" they have ever had. We served halibut and filet. Dennis personally stayed the majority of the wedding to ensure that everything on time and running as smooth as possible.  Thank you Palmer House and Dennis Chaffee! Word of advice future Palmer House brides: Be sure to book Claudia and Jane from As you Wish as your wedding planners- they are lifesavers!",N
2699,"Perfection. This place was cool, calm and a great way to spend a three day weekend. My travel partner and I are crazy enough to go to the Windy City in January, so we got a kickn' deal too. The bathroom in our room was gigantic and there was even a little couch/table area which, considering the vibe of the hotel, I renamed ""The Nook-ie"". If you get a chance to stay here, you'll feel very swank.",N
3528,"Let me first say that I'm used to staying at mosquito infested dumps on the Mekong delta, and hostels filled with drunk Canadians crashing in at 4 in the morning... so I may be a bit unqualified to rate a place as nice as the Avenue, but I'll be damned if I don't try. As far as bang for your buck goes, I was blown away by this hotel. The staff was friendly, and the rooms were relatively cheap, but still enormous. The standard king sized room that I stayed in had a couch, and a work desk on top of other standards like lounge chairs and TVs. There was a rooftop bar and pool that were a great way to end a relaxing day exploring Chicago. Even for someone used to traveling on a budget, the Avenue doesn't come close to breaking the bank. This place is a great deal, and you get a heck of a lot for your hard earned dough.",N
1529,"Yeesh....did not have the best experience with this place.   We kept talking about all those things we needed to do before the wedding, and finding a nice hotel for the night of was one we kept forgetting about.  A Groupon popped up a couple of months before for Hotel 71.  Sounded nice enough for a fine downtown hotel price, so we bought it. The Groupon advised that we not call until the next day to book it.  Fine.  I called around 9:30.  The woman who answered was very rude and already flustered sounding.  So far we weren't off to a good start.   Then about a week later I have a charge on my credit card from Hotel 71 for $250!  In a panic I call and find out the woman had booked my date incorrectly and we were charged the no show fee.  With barely an apology it was refunded - which as everyone knows takes a few days to clear back onto your card.  Lovely when you're paying vendors left and right for wedding stuff.   The week before I called to verify we actually still had a room and we did, so so far so good I suppose. Day of wedding we arrive exhausted around 10:45p.  The front desk staff were super duper friendly and even went out of their way to go find a cork screw for us to open our bottle of wine the caterer had stashed away for us to take!   The room itself was eew.  Leopard print chaise lounge you didn't want to touch.  I didn't sleep a wink that night the bed was so uncomfortable - and considering how exhausted from the whole week of events leading up to the wedding, this was BAD.  I ended up watching the sun come up through the windows of the buildings across the river.  It was bad.   Again though, the staff was super sweet and friendly when we left!  The one redeeming quality about this place were the kind ones working - except for the icky woman on the phone. For our out of town guests that come in through the year I won't recommend this place, unless they can sleep like a rock on anything and don't mind paying a pretty penny for it!",N
3694,"The Drake is definetely a unique place. Or was anyways, now tht is owned by Hilton. While it is expensive, you definetely get what you pay for. The room is classy, the service is excellent but the location is really great on the lake. It probably has one of the best views and it is also great when you are doing shopping. But it is not a place for everyday stay. I would rather go with Sofitel, House of Blues or even Hard Rock Hotel which is more modern styled.",N
1852,"Not a fan of this place.  The staff had a very lazy attitude, terrible customer service, waay overpriced, the room was blah, no special perks.  I asked for an Ipod speaker thingy and they couldn't even come up with that.  I will not be staying here again.  Whack. The lobby is gorgeous, but that has nothing to do with the W, as the building is a turn of the century gem.",N
3751,"Great location and room was very nice.  Shower was the best Ive ever been in.  Customer service was not good.  I called the day before explaining I was having something delivered as a surprise for my wife.  The girl I talked to acted like I was speaking a foreign language, and total additude.  Im sorry I pulled you away from your People magazine, but do your job.  I wasn't asking much.  I then emailed the hotel asking if someone could help me with my surprise.  Still havent replied!   Not sure If Id go back since Chicago has tons of hotels that are just as nice and with better customer service.",N
877,"We very much enjoyed our stay here over the weekend.  We were put on a lower floor at our request ( we like to take the stairs ) with a very nice view of the corner of State and Washington.  The room had high ceilings, huge windows, and did not feel cramped at all.  It really is a beautifully restored building. The location cannot be beat, at least for our purposes: close to both the Blue and Red lines and a couple blocks from the Metra station and Millenium Park, it's right in the middle of everything. The staff was without exception friendly, enthusiastic and accommodating.  They have a wine hour for guests from 5-6pm which featured a selection of two wines from California and a very nice sangria the night we attended.  They also have an assortment of coffee and tea available in the lobby in the mornings.  We did not try the lobby restaurant, but observed that the bar seems to close kind of early for a hotel bar. Wireless is free if you sign up for their affinity program, which we did.  At least in our room, though the signal was plenty strong, the connection seemed very slow even for the purposes of checking e-mail. Overall, it's a comfortable, upscale place to stay in a convenient location, and I thought I got a very good value for the rate I paid.  When we are next in Chicago, we'll definitely be looking up the Hotel Burnham again.",N
3705,"I have been to the hotel, but have not stayed overnight. I set up an initial appointment to meet with the catering manager regarding my wedding.  My mom and I were waiting for 35 minutes and he never showed!  I was shocked to experience this from what is supposed to be a nice hotel. He didn't even respond to me until 2 days later and said he had another appointment!!!  I think he should have found me or had someone let me know while I was sitting there. I would never stay overnight or do any kind of business with the hotel. If this is how they represent themselves in initial meetings, I wouldn't even want to know what the wedding would be like--I am sure a disaster!",N
4993,"I came to stay at the Essex Inn for a wedding, and the group rate was very reasonable - especially for a hotel in the loop! It was completely comfortable, and the staff were courteous.  They were quite understanding and helpful while working out a little error in our reservation.  The concierge (Bill) was remarkably friendly and helpful!   Little inconveniences keep this from being a five-star review: sometimes the elevators were slow, the bathroom was awkward to share, the wireless internet wasn't free (I know - but if it had been, I'd have been impressed!), and the television channels had a strange numbering system that I never figured out (no channel guide in the room).  Those are little things, but in the interest of saving a five-star review for a truly wonderful place, I'm holding back in this case.  I'm not hard to please, though, and I'd recommend this place/stay there again.Other useful things to know: 1. The room (king bed) had a fridge, iron & ironing board, single-mug coffee maker (powder creamer), and hair dryer.2. The bathroom came with plenty of linens of course, face soap, body soap, shampoo (which didn't lather a whole lot but got the job done), and conditioner.3.  The weight room had exercise bikes, treadmills, elliptical trainers, nautilus-type machines, and free weights.  There wasn't a space with mats to lie down but I liked the rest of it.  It looked out on the pool.4.  I never saw a room-service menu.  But I didn't look hard; just went across the street to Kitty O'Shea's (in the Hilton) and ordered out.",Y
2388,"I stayed here for 3 nights for a work conference, from Sunday to Wednesday. My room was quite nice. Large 42"" plasma and welcome center terminal, although the room itself was a bit small. The gym and pool are on the 8th floor, and the first 3 floors are mostly conference rooms. This place was absolutely packed with conference attendees while I was there, since there were 3-4 other large ones. Entire hotel has 1500 rooms. Wifi is ridiculously expensive, but luckily our company covered it. Parking is also ridiculously expensive (about $50/night), so you're better off parking in one of the many garages nearby. Food during the conference was pretty good, as was service.",N
1746,"Let me preface by saying I work for a hotel brand that is not Kimpton.  I made last minute plans to head back to Chicago and decided on the Allegro.  Great Choice.  I used to live in Chicago for many years so I know the layout and CTA well so it was nice to have a hotel which was very accessable so that I wouldn't have to rent a car. Like a few other people who booked there, I was expecting a room that was smaller, I guess I'm used to many historic type hotels rooms in NYC which have basically enough room for the bed and a little walking space, nice molding on the walls but not a whole lot of space to walk lol.  I had a premier king room which basically was a king room with a little more space, well, I had plenty of space.  Nice amenities (Aveda), housekeeping is fantastic as they cleaned my room somehow when I wasn't there.  I was impressed because I was in and out throughout my 3 day stay and never saw them in my room.  I was also impressed by the fact that I looked down onto the L tracks but never heard the train.  Maybe I was too immersed in my work but it definately wasn't like some street noise I've encountered at many other hotels.  Room service, the person answering the phone was very thorough and the food was fast, hot and correct.  The hotel is very conveniently located so that if you want to see/go anywhere in the loop you can really walk.  If you need to hop on the L, its centrally located to Wells and the Lake st stops.   Points to help out When you first walk in, there is a flight of stairs which you have to go up to get to the main lobby Definately join InTouch before you check in Use the hotels services ie concierge, fitness room",N
1521,I don't like giving bad reviews.  So i made sure I called back everyday for almost a week.  I did finally get the charger back.   Everyday I called back the front desk would always without fail transfer me to an extension that wasn't setup. After the first or second day you would think someone would send out a memo. The effort it took to get the lost laptop charger back still earns Hotel 71 a low rating.,N
805,"The worst Westin and hotel experience ever. Staying here ruined our suppose to be wonderful engagement weekend. My fiance had just proposed and had flown me out to Chicago as his job was relocating him. We were suppose to celebrate and check out the area. When we got there, our nonsmoking King room with a view was no longer available. My fiance had called in and put in a special request and they said they would honor it. We ended up in a smoking room, and then we ended up with two full beds. Oh how romantic. Not only that, for the four days we were there, the rooms were rarely made before three pm. We have since stayed at the Westin across from the House of Blues. Those rooms were must bigger, the people were nicer, and the service excellent. The service at this Westin sucked and all the management offered us was a free meal from the room service menu. Yeah!",N
1690,"Copying from my old profile. I have never been there, but this is what many of my friends say: Like nothing you've experienced before. Sophisticated, lively accommodations with nine different styles and sizes. Allegro's 483 guestrooms are a modern chorus of color blended with the original Art Deco design. The Allegro is a contemporary American hotel in Chicago's downtown Loop district. Close to everything music, theatre, galleries, restaurants, tourism and nightlife.

3159,"I'm a fan of The W chain, and this property surely doesn't disappoint.  It's a stone's throw from the Navy Pier.  However, the driveway is a mess.  It's really small, and two cars makes it so crowded.  There's really only room for cars to go in one direction, but since there are entrances/exits at both ends, vehicles end up playing chicken.  Whoever planned the driveway was probably smoking crack.  Good thing I wasn't driving.  I just felt sorry for our cab drivers.",N
3457,"Pictures on their website are deceiving.  Rooms are small and elevators are sloooooowwwwww.  I understand its an older hotel, but with sites like Yelp, hotels need to make sure that every inch of their hotel is somewhat perfect.   Reviews can hurt a business and  its always best to make sure every area meets the customers satisfaction.  Remember to request any floor below 4 or 5, because you can avoid the elevators and just walk.  The lounge area was nice and our bartender/server was knowledgeable of the hotel.   Will I go back.  NO!  I'd rather pay more and stay in a hotel with a view.",N
3935,"I booked a double bed room for one night, cost me $241.19, $209.00 plus $32.19 tax. It did not look like on the picture whatsoever. Furniture looked like it was beaten many times by some angry customers. The air in the room was very hot, and there was no any thermostat in the room to change the temperature. For valet parking they charge $33.00 if you roll the car to the front, if you bring it to the garage yourself  it cost $28.00, and guess what, guys, to use an Internet will cost you $9.95. We checked in at 3pm, left the room at 6pm, came back after dinner,around 9pm, no one came to check up on room and refresh it. Next time I would stay somewhere else.",N
1761,"I am a frequent guest of Kimpton Hotels and an ""In Touch"" member. I have stayed at the Allegro once before, well over a year ago and prior to the massive renovation. The good: - The location is touristy, but convenient. The El is very close by, as are multiple bars and restaurants. - The renovation is definitely a huge improvement. The palette is pleasing and the rooms are much more restful. - The beds are comfortable, as expected at a Kimpton hotel. The bad: - Leave your toiletries at home, because there is absolutely no space to place them in the bathroom. Literally...zero. - The closets are extremely bizarre. They removed the main rack to hang your clothing and replaced it with two face-out racks...you can't see your clothes all at once, as you are forced to stack them on top of each other. Also, you'll find tacky apparel the hotel is trying to get you to purchase, taking up the majority of hangers. - The doormen (with the exception of one, Fidel) are surly and I found this quite annoying. I was told which cab to get into, as though I'd never hailed a cab before (I am from NYC). While approaching the hotel on several occasions, the doormen would yell at me what door to use (there are three, all of which work...) yet not once did they bother to open it for me. Where is the service? - While check-in was pleasant, the woman who checked me out was both rude and abrupt. Not only was I not asked how my stay was, but I was hastily shoved a receipt (no envelope, no review of charges) and shoved aside for another guest who was checking in...at noon. I travel very frequently for business and pleasure and normally have the Kimpton group on the very top of my hotel list. After this horrible experience, I will likely reconsider my loyalty and may make a beeline back to the Starwood group.",N
2277,"Attended several meetings in this hotel and would have to say: ""meh, I've experienced better."" Although the rooms, lightening and acoustics were positive the food is nothing to get excited over. If you need to hold a business function and want to impress, please consider another establishment. Good luck!",N
2349,"There are a few things I like about this hotel, and a few things I absolutely hate. The lobby is a nice open area. + The employees are helpful and nice, even house keeping was nice! + The hotel is easy to get lost in. - We requested king size beds, we got twins. - WiFi is not free, despite it being 2010. - (It's 14.95 for ""fast 256k service for 24 hours"") The rooms don't have microwaves or refrigerators, seriously? - The room is small, it compares to a $40 room. There's some obnoxious banging that happens outside the door every 10 minutes or so, and I can hear a buzzing noise coming from the room below. makes it pretty hard to sleep. The food that the hotel restaurant serves is strange/unappetizing. -",N
4361,"This place was disappointment to say the very least. At first glance it looks grand and ornate, but don't look too closely or you will be sorely disappointed. Front desk check/reception was rude, arrogant and reluctant to be helpful. Did I mention RUDE? On a positive note, the housekeeping staff was first class, professional and very helpful. In my humble opinion, the housekeeping staff should switch positions with the front desk employees and this place would be, without a doubt, five stars. I will avoid Hilton's whenever possible. Based on rudeness and arrogant front desk , I would have given a minus star if I knew how.",N
5139,"I have nothing but great things to say about the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza. I had my wedding there on October 23, 2010. I looked at more than 15 reception venues in the Chicagoland area and no place compared to the Holiday Inn 15th Floor Wolf Point Ballroom! When comparing  the price per plate and the  ballroom with gorgeous views to other venues-it was an easy decision to make! Barbara Martin, the event coordinator, is very experienced, professional, and will answer any questions you have leading up to the night of your event. She made my wedding planning so simple with a list of recommended vendors to use for chair covers, music, entertainment, ect.  We had hor'dourves during cocktail hour-tuscan chicken, coconut shrimp, and champange cantelope soup shots-Our guests LOVED all of them!  Then when they open the doors to the main room-I don't even know where to begin! The view is spectacular, our head table was decorated beautifully, the food tasted great, and the staff went above and beyond to make sure our guests were pleased! Our wedding cake from Alliance Bakery (which is included in your wedding package) came out exactly how we envisioned it, and it was the best tasting cake I have ever had. Our bridal suite had an amazing view and it was huge! Our entire night at the Holiday Inn was perfect and I would highly recommend meeting with Barbara Martin if you are planning a wedding or event in the Chicagoland area!",Y
3938,"After reading the reviews on this site and tripadvisor I came pretty close to canceling my reservations at the Congress Plaza for Lollapalooza weekend. I live downtown, and had booked the hotel for it's convenience to Grant Park, thinking that it would be easier to commute 2 blocks rather than 15. I have to let you all know that, perhaps because I was expecting the worst, I was pleasantly surprised.  Our room on the 13th Floor, South Tower was clean and nicely appointed with a flat screen TV and 15 ft ceilings.  We didn't pay extra for a lake view, so we had a great city view.  The carpet was fresh, and while not overly decadent, the bedding was clean and new looking.   I didn't order room service, but I did request extra pillows, which were delivered within 10 minutes at 11:00 pm.  Nice! I understand that your experience could be much different, but for us, it was perfect!",N
3263,"Hard Rock Hotel is a modern, hip place to stay in. As soon as you walk through the door you feel its refreshing style. There are cool paintings on the walls and the service is pretty good. The room is excellent and comfortable on the eye. The bed is comfortable and they have awesome pillows ;) We ordered food and it was not good at all. The ceasar salad felt like it was done three days ago. Watch our for the mini bar. Touch anything and it is on your bill. I would definetely stay there again.",N
4551,"I booked this hotel via Priceline and I was very impressed with the hotel when I arrived. The lobby was beautiful and the gentleman at the front desk was very professional and friendly.  Initially my 9th floor room was very spacious and well decorated. Unfortunately I had an uninvited guest in my room. There was a rather large cockaroach crawling on my bag that was on the floor. I called housekeeping and they killed it and asked if I wanted them to spray the room. I told them I wanted to be moved to a new room. I was moved to the 12th floor and the room was very small, the noise from the El was rather annoying and the bathroom toilet kept running after it was flushed. I was very disappointed at the level of service they showed after the incident I had. I suggest they keep up on there pest control.",N
4571,"I just adore this hotel. It really is gorgeous. I'm a big fan of anything with a great history behind it, and this hotel is chalk full of interesting history. I love the architecture and how I feel like I'm stepping back into the 1940s-1950s whenever I walk the halls with the movie stars from one of the best eras in Hollywood. I've been here twice (though didn't stay the night-my mom did) and I can't wait to go back just to take it all in again. This time I went with my mom, boyfriend, and his mom to wander around and check out all the fancy stuff. There was a wedding reception and a prom going on, so we didn't see the smaller rooms, but we did venture into the Grand Ballroom, and boy was it ever grand! They don't call it that for nothing, let me tell you. The chandeliers were just gorgeous. We wandered all over and encountered the most beautiful piano I've ever seen. Sadly they'd locked it (too many people trying to play it, I imagine), so I didn't get to see what I'm sure are beautiful keys. Sigh. Maybe someday. I'm not entirely sure what Gene is talking about, I have yet to encounter a small room there. We booked a room both times using hotwire and were able to score a $78 (for a saturday and sunday, friday for my bf's mom was $73) deal. Good sized room, double beds, and with a window looking at another wing of the hotel. The only thing I didn't really like was that there was no screen in the window, but as I wouldn't go there with kids, it's not that big of a deal. I can't wait until I can stay there myself (though it'll be a while since I live one el stop away).",N
4953,"At Avenue Hotel -Weddings and Relaxation both available! We  attended a friend's wedding in Chicago at Avenue Hotel in Chicago and decided to stay the weekend for a little holiday. I was excited to have a weekend away with my husband and our closest friends.The wedding at Avenue Hotel was simply beautiful. It seemed like everything went flawlessly. The food was quite good and I must say the service level of the staff was excellent. Everyone who works there seems happy and it reflects on how they treat guests. I am in the service business so I always notice these things and am usually quite critical.  But nothing to criticize about my Chicago stay at Avenue Hotel - my husband was shocked!We made plans ahead to fill in our time with other activities. My husband and I felt like kids again being able to explore a bit of Chicago and have a new adventure to share.  We loved the Navy Pier and riding the Ferris wheel and I loved all the shopping that was within walking distance of the hotel.  After a busy day, we wanted to enjoy a couple's massage, which we had never done before and we were thrilled to discover they would come directly to our room.  How awesome was that!  The Avenue Hotel is great and not only perfect for a wedding in Chicago but also for a relaxing weekend. The hotel has the Sky Bar which is outstanding and on the 40th floor with amazing views of the city. The rooms are comfortable yet contemporary, with a great vibe. We truly enjoyed our stay and will recommend the Avenue Hotel for our Chicago vacationing friends.",Y
4521,"The hotel has a beautiful lobby. Very large. I think the ceilings in the lobby were at least 3 stories tall. Wonderful architecture. Very classy. Now to the rooms. I had a King room that I booked on Priceline. You don't get to select the type of room on priceline like you do on expedia, orbiz, or any other travel site, so I had to call to make sure I had a King room.  I was also told by a friend to ask for the more renevated room, which I was able to get, (I guess).  The room was very very small. the bed was about 6 or 7 feet from the door. The room had a desk and a chair, but no extra comfy chair. No dresser to store my clothing. The ice bucket and two glasses were stored in the closet because there was no room to put it. The flat screen tv was mounted on the wall but a whole in the wall where the cable comes from was right in the middle of the wall (tacky) including all the wires to the tv halfway hanging down from the tv. (tacky again).  The bathroom was ok, small but ok.     I order room service, a $12 cheeseburger and soda turned out to be $32 after state tax, city tax, room service fee, 18% gratuity for room service orders. And the guy acted like he wanted a tip when he brought in the tray. Seriously?? A soda in the vending machine was $2.50 and so was bottled water. Luckily there was a 7-elevan down the street for my late night cravings.     I put the do not disturb sign on the door because I wanted to sleep in late that next saturday morning. At 8am I am waken up by vacuuming by my door. Mind you the bed is close to the door. I felt like I was being punked. I guess do not disturb in only to keep the maids from knocking on your door. They didnt finish vacuuming the long azz hallway til and hour and a half later.     There was no view from my window, only the back fire escape and the building next to me.     I would never stay at this hotel or suggest anyone stay here.",N
2280,"We booked our room here through a Priceline bid process, so we did not pick it, but we got a single night for a room for two for $90 plus taxes and fees, which we thought was a stellar deal! As other Yelpers mention, the location of this hotel is absolutely the best quality about it. We had excellent train access to Wrigley Field and could walk to wonderful restaurants as well as waterfront activities. Getting out of Chicago in the morning was super efficient, driving down Ontario to I-94 for freeway access. We did have some trouble getting to the valet parking entry when we first arrived, as that entry is on Rush street, and when we went past it, it took us awhile, with the one-way streets and the river, to loop back around. The lobby is incredibly busy and hopping, but even so, we managed to check in very quickly on a Sunday. We also had access to our room before the posted check-in time, which was a wonderful treat. We had a room on a  high floor with a king bed, but we didn't have views of the lake (ask for that!). The room was not large, but it had everything we needed and was beautifully appointed and very comfortable. In fact, overnight I was sick with a migraine and throwing up, and this is the one time in my life when such suffering away from home did NOT make me wish to be home in my own bed. Everything was very comforting and comfortable. Again, I noticed this Marriott did not include a hairdryer in the room. (I've noticed this recently in Marriott properties.) I brought my own, so I did not mind. Also, the WiFi is NOT included in the room price. There is a Starbucks in the lobby, which we appreciated, and we found all the staffers to be very professional, energetic and attentive. I would definitely stay at this hotel again if I have the opportunity.",N
1033,"I really, really wanted to like Amalfi.  For some reason, I keep booking room in boutique hotels thinking that they'll have a chip on their shoulder to really try to impress their customers.  This, however, has not been my experience. We were in Chicago on business and needed to use the printer in the business center.  I called ahead before we even booked and asked about their business center.  They assured me that they had building-wide wifi as well as a printer that guests could use. When we arrived, I attempted to print 4 sheets of paper for an upcoming meeting.  The page was streaked.  Printer read: Change Black Ink.  So I called down, thinking it would be no big deal, and they happily said they would send someone up.  Okay.  I left for the meeting and went about my day.  The next day I went down to the business center and the printer was doing the same thing.  They never changed the cartridge.  I called the front desk and they assured me again that they would send someone up.  2 hours later, nothing had changed.  I called again and they said I could use the front desk's printer.  I went down and they very nicely printed off about 15 pages for me (though it was odd that the guy at the desk wanted to log into my email account himself... ""okay, what's your password.""   Umm, no.  The next day I went down to the business center to print our boarding passes -- three guys in suits are in there complaining about how the printer is streaking and says it needs a new cartridge.  Ridiculous. The wifi in the building is a joke. I was on the 6th floor and couldn't get a signal.  If you're on the 4th floor (where the business center is), then you might get one, so request that floor.  They had to send up an ethernet cable for me to connect to the internet. Finally, the breakfast was lame.  I understand you want to be able to advertise ""free breakfast,"" but the food was generally stale, especially the bagels.  It was nice to have free coffee, so I can't complain about it that much since I'm not big on breakfast.  If you are expecting even the equivalent of a Hampton Inn, you'll be dismayed. Despite this, the rooms were pretty nice and I have no complaints there.  If you're here for business, I can't recommend Amalfi.  ""Meh. I've experienced better"" pretty much sums up my experience at Amalfi.",N
4189,"the rooms are pretty nice, the look&feel is somewhere between classy and sleek. but the hotel is just massive. the lobby feels like you're constantly at a convention. when i stayed, 'die hard' crashed in the last 20 minutes, so my 90 minutes of time invested went to waste. i had to push, but the hotel gave me a credit to say sorry.",N
917,"This was one of the best hotel experiences of my life. A green hotel, everyone is extremely friendly, it has personality, a great location, great beds and decor, and they constantly have Jazz on! Our room on the 6th floor had a lovely view of the Chicago Theater sign. We didn't even really care that there was a construction site across the street. Once that place is done, this will be an even better location! By the way, a great thing to do while you are staying here and you don't have a bathtub at home.... Go across the street to Lush (In Macy's) and get a bath melt and a bath bomb. Amazing. Will stay here again, absolutely!!",N
4625,"What a cute, stylish eco-hotel!  It's conveniently located in the heart of Chicago. My friends Sage J. and Andy just moved here and Andy  booked us a hotel at hotel Felix.   The rooms are small which is typical for big cities. It's slightly smaller than the Club Quarters in San Francisco. However the place is clean, the employees are friendly and it's located in a prime location. I love that it's within walking distance to my favorite grocery store ""Whole Foods"". This is a really special hotel that caters to the business traveler and the young & hip. (but not the douchey trendy hipster kind)  Lots of bars and shopping nearby. Internet is free, but it's very slow. There is no coffee maker and no luggage rack in the room,  but overall a good experience.",N
2443,Gorgeous hotel--absolutely amazing. If I ever get married this is the type of place I'd like to take the plunge at. Pricey but classy. Once went to a political event here and recently went back to meet some friends at the hotel bar. Looking good as ever.,N
1961,very nice!,N
3932,"The second star is for the location and history.  I have such mixed feelings because despite the reviews I had high expectations.   We had booked for the Marathon with a package that included the entry fee to the race.  It just happened to be here which thrilled me to no end thinking that I was going to have a wonderful experience.   First things first, this is considered the MOST haunted hotel in Chicago which is a hugely haunted city if you are into that. (No I didn't get haunted myself) The Hotel has some beautiful areas, like the ballroom, but the rest of the place is run down, old and smelly.  I have no problem with old or quaint even as long as its clean and cool.  I need a very cold room at night to sleep in and the second we walked into the room it was extremely smelly with a moldy smell that was just embeded in the air.  The air conditioner was not working but luckily we could open the windows and the fresh air at night was great.  The safe was locked open.  We took our wallets with us so we didn't really need it but the devil is in the details. Our view was of the back not the much advertised Buckingham fountain view.GF3y There were picketers out in front our whole stay.  One of them was very obnoxious and vulgar as we passed with our 15 year old.  Most of the time they were just in the way not letting people pass.   Front desk service?  Just 'meh' at best.   We were in the room when housekeeping came and she asked if I preferred if she came back later or not at all (with hope in her voice) and when I told her later it was very obvious that is not the answer she wanted. I would have to say that it was in an amazing location, but aside from that I have stayed in much nicer hotels right next to Disney World in Florida for $50 a night.  I was very disappointed.",N
4833,Stuck in a corner room with previous guests roomservice outside our room all night. Guess you shouldn't expect much more for a 60$ PL bid. $50 for parking was outrageous...,Y
2487,"GOOD: - Two bathrooms in many of the rooms (including mine).  Since I was sharing a room with a colleague, this was super-helpful and much appreciated! - Ornate and often very classy decor.  *Definitely* not the bland, sterile Hilton's I've been accustomed to elsewhere. - Free calls to 800 numbers.  A small respite from their cheap-ass nickel-and-diming I mention below. - Friendly and helpful employees. - Decent location, at least in that it's near the Shedd Aquarium and planetarium and so on.  But I wouldn't call it centrally located. BAD: - One morning, I had only lukewarm water in the shower :(. - They seem to wash towels whether you want them to or not.  That's wasteful. - Don't bother with their restaurant, Pavillion.  Very mediocre food (at best).  Fruits: hard as a rock and flavorless.  Prawn salad = four tasty prawns on top of unsurprisingly wilted greens that are sitting in about a 2 inch-deep mixture of orange juice and water (well, that's what the dressing tasted like).  Lobster bisque soup:  Where's The Beef?  Er, I mean lobster.  Even the bisque part wasn't very tasty.  In short, yuck! - As with nearly all Hiltons, it seems, you get nickeled and dimed.  They charge you $1.50 per bag checked in their storage, for crying out loud.  That's a complimentary service at *every* other hotel I've stayed at.  And $15/day for wireless?  $25 for late checkout?  $6 for the unfrigerated bottle of water on your desk?!   - Assuming it's the Hilton that caters conference lunches... YUCK!!!  Could they not have varied the sandwich choice once in five days?!  Or offered a sandwich that didn't taste like eating flavorless sawdust? - Christmas music.  24/7 in the lobbies.  Not even very good Christmas music, mind you... just schmaltzy crap on and on and on... - Beds were too soft to be comfortable. *  *  * I was conflicted between 2 and 3 stars here.  I'd say 2.5, but decided on 2 due to the crappy dining options in the hotel and the nickel-and-diming (admittedly typical in most high-end hotels, but that doesn't make it right).",N
2428,"The staff is great, fast and efficient. The elevators were slow on the upper levels. The rooms are large enough, but they need some updating - the rooms are clean but for a Flagship hotel it should be updated. The pool and health club are excellent, I recommend the pool.",N
1232,"To echo everyone else - absolutely no reason to stay here if you're not attending an event at the convention center. - $45 cab ride to and from O'Hare.  Luckily on my way back I split it with anoter conference attendee - When I checked in, I threw my stuff down in the room and went to sit in the desk chair but it had been smeared with grape jelly.  Gross.  Thank god I noticed.  It almost felt like a prank, you know, like unscrewing the cap on a salt shaker. . . - Incredibly overpriced food at their restaurants.  A chicken and pasta in tomato sauce with a side salad was $37 through room service - ""Late"" checkout is 1:00 instead of noon.  Super helpful. - No newspaper at your door in the morning - You have to pay for internet - The pool is a joke - The entire hotel and convention center are kept at meat-locker temperatures.  I lost feeling in my extremeties several times. - Considering you're a prisoner to the hotel, you'd figure they'd offer more TV channels.  Nope.  There were like 10 channels, 4 of which were ESPN.  No Comedy Central, no MTV or VH1, no Toon Network, no Food Network. . . The only two redeeming points were that - - The fitness center was pretty nice, not the best I've had at a hotel but nice.  But the water cooler they have is WAAAAAY over-lemony, like sucking on a lemon.  Gross, especially coming off a hard workout. - We got continental breakfast in the mornings of the conference which was actually pretty good.  Fruits, cereals, parfaits, pastries.",N
32,"My fiance and I vacationed to Chicago for 5 days & 4 nights; he picked The Tremont. At first, I was confused on the hotel: do I like it or hate it? The lobby is old fashioned in the sense with beautifully decorated with wooden crown moldings and leather sofa's. The receptionist didn't acknowledge us when we entered or exited, however, they were very attentive when I needed something. (IE: I wanted more towels & i got them in less than 5 minutes). The room was average, but very clean. At first, I was annoyed at how different the room looked in comparison to the photos, but my fiance made me change my mind: were we there to stay in a room the whole day or were we in Chicago to sight see? He was right: who cares? The best part: it was cheap ($85 a night) and walking distance to SO MANY attractions: a block away from million mile, short walk to the beach/Lake Michigan, 2 blocks from the Chicago Trolley, short walk to several bars and restaurants, to name a few. They also allowed me to receive and send faxes for free! For the price other hotels were charging, I would definately recommend this place!",N
3434,"+ on the magnificent mile + entrance newly refurbished, very nice + comfortable beds + l'occitane products in the bathrooms (including huge chunks of soap.. we stole many off maid carts...) + the rooms are decorated really nicely + huge, flat screen tv + pretty quiet + they provide maid service everyday but you have the option of not sending your linens everyday to cleaned (go earth!) - the elevators are quite small, shake when they go fast and take a long time to respond to the button push -- not only that but they magically stop at practically every floor .. but no one is waiting..( i have an elevator phobia -- so this might not be such a problem for non-crazies) - very close to Northwestern hospital so lots of ambulance noise - the rooms are pretty small as is the bathroom -- doesn't bother me too much but some people might need more roamin' space - no free wi-fi in the rooms, only in the bar area, but you can get it from the hotel next door...",N
1444,"We took a large family trip to chicago and stayed at Omni in June. There were seven of us on this trip and we booked 3 rooms. Although we had three government ID's the hotel was only able to give us two rooms at the governemnt employee rate. They said this was due to the hotel being sold out and so there were no more discount rates avaliable? This did not make any sense. We stayed for 6 nights and 7 days. Never once was the room service the same. One night they would turn dow the bed all the way, the next just take the pillows off, the next they would hide the pillows in the closet.... It was weird. The hotel offers a Select Guest program, which we signed up for before even going to Chicago. When we got there the check-in staff did not mention it at all, we had to bring it up. With the beverage program, as a part of the select guest thing: I would mark for them to knock and bring in our drinks, but the only time it was brought in was the day that I ask for it to be left out..... so strange. The selecet guest program stated that the hotel had a pillow bar, you could pick a feather pillow or a foam pillow. We ask for feather but never got it. We ask a couple of times. The select guest program stated it included a nightly treat and a bottle of water, yet we never got either brought to the room. The internet did not work half the time and we needed the internet as we had to work while we were on vacation. Elevators were weird, you couldn't even take the stairs if you wanted to....who does that? The billing was really weird as well. They charged our credit card 1800 dollars when we checked in and then when we reviewed out billing statment when we were leaving we noticed that they charged us for the internet that we were told was free so they had to go back and credit us. Then it took about a week for the internet charges to be credited. This type of billing caused the fraud department on everyones credit cards to shut down the cards until we called to get things fixed ..... a hassel that could have been avoided had Omni charged per night or at the end of our stay. The location was nice, but we felt like we still had a long way to go for most things, other than shopping. Although this used to be the hotel that Oprah used, it looked more like something Jerry Springer would use. Overall it was just a plain old hotel. I would NEVER pay $219+ tax and fees to stay here again. I would have rather stayed at a Motel 6.",N
4443,"3.5 Stars - We stayed here for three nights on our recent trip to Chicago. $200/night, they put us on the HIlton Honors floor (#15)- nice n quiet- we were on the inside rooms so no city view, just a view of the workout room- wah Room was decorated in 20's Art Deco style with lime green accents and the ever present Peacock theme that is evident in the whole hotel. King sized bed, crib was in room as requested, no feather pillows as requested, got to use the short check-in line as an Honors member...room was clean and the daily maid did a wonderful job upholding that standard!! All in all a good experience in a great location 2 blocks walking from the lakeshore. Details: Pool- indoors, good...super small for such a huge hotel,add in a few unruly teens and some crappy parents and you have an unusable pool for a baby=bad  Good thing they have GREAT BEACHES in Chicago! Dennis was always at the door, helping to  get us cabs and assistance getting our bags upstairs. I think his title should be  Chicago Ambassador, as he recommended the absolute best beach for us to go to with a young child and seemed to be able to make conversation with pretty much anyone.  Good asset to the hotel. The Bathroom- normally I give Hiltons 5 stars but they fell down on the bathroom. Granite and tile with the oversized bowl sink...stylish but MAN WAS THAT SPACE CRAMPED. There was no countertop, so nowhere to put our deoderant, makeup, etc except on the back of le toilette, which isn't very sanitary, no? This did not feel like a $200/night bathroom Starbucks inside, nice to have so convenient although servers were a little curt and super slow for coffee shop workers (maybe they are immune to caffeine at this point) Ambiance- the lobby and hotel itself is truly big-city magnificent - there was a wedding there while we were there and I can understand why - the work on the ceiling was done by a guy who worked on the Sistene Chapel and there are works of art all around. - If we had just come here for drinks and dinner I would have given this place 5 stars easily for environment alone. Elegant. History- they have the pictures of all of the performers around the hotel, great names that everyone recognizes who came to perform back in the day- the peacock door has a placard next to it explaining the history...just cool to be in a place that's been around so long, it was around when they hosted the World Fair- that's OOOLLLLDD,. Room service- GREAT caesar salad but a salad, club sammie and mac n cheese bites plus two drinks cost $91 - really? Yikes, next time Imma take my lazy pants downstairs and next door Internet Access- I brought my laptop but they tried to charge me $7.50/hour or $15/24 hrs for internet access -There was NO WIRELESS and that's WAY too much to charge me for a basic service- I need internet to check flights, do some work, stream my kid's Dora movies....Even the Best Western gives it for free, what's up Hilton? Don't be cheap with me, I'm not cheap with you or your employees. Yes I'd go back but there's something like 5 Hiltons in Chicago so next time we're likely to try another one.",N
2476,"I lucked out when I stayed here. Came into town early to tour a college with my daughter before staying longer for a work-related convention at McCormick Place. We were able to check in before the scheduled time and the kind receptionist sized me up and suggested a room with a king bed to accommodate my height. We were checked in and were able to drop off our luggage within 10 minutes. Fortunately, the internet was included for convention attendees so that wasn't a sore point for me. My daughter and I had been using the L and CTA to get around so parking wasn't an issue either. My room was on the lake side but in near the lobby. It was larger with a couch in the sitting area by the desk, four windows toward the lake, and a wet bar with a fridge. I can't complain. One event from the convention was at the Buddy Guy Legends bar down across the street. When my friend and I had enough of the Belgian beer they happened to be serving that night, we came back to Kitty O'Shea's in the Hilton and listened to some guys playing some great Celtic-style music. The sitting area in the Lakeside Green Lounge was very comfortable as well, and the park is right across the street. I like the classic old style that this hotel exudes. Sure, there are some things that might be considered out of date, but I found it to be tastefully appointed and the bed was real comfortable. I'd stay here again if I needed to be in the area.",N
3494,Updated Review: My credit card was credited back. So that's good.  It's in a great location and decent.  Just watch your credit card statement.   Old Review: BEWARE!!!!!! I prepaid my 2 night stay at the Allerton through Expedia. Allerton Hotel then proceeded to charge my credit card  $160.  I even confirmed during checkout that there were no charges to my room and everything was pre-paid.  Then I came home to find a 160 dollar charge on my credit card from the Allerton Hotel.,N
3658,Beautiful hotel with a kind and helpful staff.   Carlos  the doorman has all the 411 for everywhere you want to go.  The room was very nice and comfortable.  The only complaint I have is that it was too warm!  I pumped down the  thermostat to 60 degrees and still had to kick the covers off.  Don't know what was up with that.,N
2493,Thanks to travelocity  this is probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in.  Two bathrooms per room.  Beautiful architecture in the lobby.  Only downside was the hustle on the wi-fi.,N
4502,"This has to be the classiest and and oldest hotel I've ever stayed at. It was a great experience, excellent room service. I hate some excellent Kobe beef hamburgers, crab cakes, and salmon. The rooms were small though, but I stayed in a newly renovated room. And it was down the street from my training office.",N
3101,"I've stayed at both lake and loop.  lake was bad: crazy masseuse banged on our door at obscene hour telling us it was time for our massages.  giant amounts of high school cheerleaders where staying here at the same time which i guess is not the fault of w, but i still hated being around their noise.  we did get massive breakfast in bed to make up for the crazy masseuse mishap but that was only after i did massive complaining. loop was better but again, the crowds this chain attracts are just plain questionable.  it almost feels like shopping at water tower place.  the rooms are the same no matter what W you are in anywhere, good enough but i think i'm getting too old for all the purple velvet.  i guess this is why starwood offers the westin.",N
3523,"All things considered, this Hotel is OK. A few annoyances: they nickle and dime you ($1 a minute) for Phonecalls in the same area code. 2. The Fridges have some bizzare borg-inspired technology that ""senses"" if you take something out of the fridge (ie. to put your own drinks in) and charges you accordingly. 3. The Elevators - Slowest Elevators in the WORLD. We waiting 30 mins to get one on a Sunday AM on the 20th Floor. Yes, Really. Aside from that - It's pretty OK. Room sizes are adequate, very VERY Touristy being so close to Michigan Ave.",N
2387,"Wow, what a disappointment!  Don't want to be vulgar, but this place is a real s**t hole.  No doubt. The Hilton name implies a certain level of quality.  Yeah, but that died when Conrad Hilton passed away.  Hilton is going down rapidly and this hotel proves my point. In a city like Chicago, with all the top-shelf hotels one may choose from, this is one to avoid like the plague! The carpet in the common areas is filthy, worn and threadbare.  The chairs in the common area as the same:  dirty, worn and threadbare, and so 40 years ago.  The styles are out-of-date, the colors are sad, the paint is blistering and peeling, and overall the hotel is just depressing!  And yes, I know the historic background to this hotel and no, the 'out-of-date' motif is not my misunderstanding of the property's history.  Trust me, it's awful! The bank of elevators is stunning in its lack of thought and design.  There are ten elevators, five on each side.  As you press the ONLY elevator request button (yes, one button for all ten elevators) one notices the paint that is blistering, cracking, peeling, dirty, nicked and overall more like you'd expect to see in a horror film psychiatric hospital.  And  the detail of the ceiling's woodwork?  It's been painted so many times the relief and detail is filling in with layers upon layers of paint.  Yuk! The room itself has a nice modern flat screen television with beds that are 30 years out-of-date, bathrooms that are out-of-date and feel unclean containing soap and shampoo selections that disappoint.   The breakfast buffet in Buckingham's is another disappointing feature.  I went there three times as there was little other choice.  On Saturday I could tell the oatmeal was left over from Friday, as were the 'eggs' if you want to call them eggs.  How could I tell?  They were dry and almost had a crust on them from being in storage overnight.  NOT appetizing. The exhibit halls are dungeon-like as they are down in the bowels of the hotel. Columns block walking paths and views.  The exhibit halls become a labyrinth and, as a result, it is difficult to find much of anything.  Here for a meeting?  Good luck!  Planning a meeting here?  AVOID it. Overall, this hotel is simply as sad and depressing as it gets.  This is the type of hotel where one would expect to find the businessman (or woman) swinging from a bed sheet while hanging from the shower head in a last-ditch effort to escape this depressing property. Quick!  Run!  Run to any other hotel in the city as there  are many, many better hotels charging a similar rate.",N
4239,"This is a review for Hard Drive- the club in the lobby. At first I thought the idea of a club in the lobby was a little odd. The club is sectioned off with ropes, so people walking through the lobby can look in at the clubbers. The music at first was mainly techno/house, but later on in the evening the music changed to hiphop. Overall, it was a fun place, but very pricey. Normal cover is about $20, and drinks were expensive as well- $10 for a shot.",N
3655,"OK, I'm bummed about this because I just gave them four starts. But it turns out they double charged me for some of my mini bottle drinks and I have had duplicate charges on my credit card since April 27th. 3 phone calls and 2 emails later, no one has helped me. They keep telling me they are going to resolve it, but its getting a little tiresome. I mean - its $35 dollars from the Drake, but dammit, I booked through Priceline. I'm not a big spender and I just want my money back. :(",N
4620,"from 4 to 3. My second stay featured incredibly loud air conditioning going on and off all night. Also, the room was a little warm. I woke up in the middle of the night and stumbled in a half drunken, half hungover state to turn the temp down and it was locked at it's lowest point - 65 - and I was still sweating. Not an awful experience, but not as good as the first.",N
867,"My usual stay in a hotel rarely requires any contact with the front desk other then checking in.  This time we were asked to wait for the room we booked or check in right away into a downgraded room.  We decided to wait for our room.  When we returned, they had a different front desk person on duty and a different story, take it or leave it.  We basically waited for a room that didn't materialize wasting our precious time while on a short vacation.  No apology.  Non existent customer service.",N
1457,"How cool is it that every room is a suite? I love it.   Pros: 1. absolutely beautiful hotel 2. in downtown, right on the strip so everything was easily accessible 3. there is a walgreens right across the street - perfect for buying some water and snacks 4. the concierge. gotta give it up for my man marcus. so incredibly friendly, so incredibly knowledgeable 5. the staff overall was incredibly friendly, and not in a pretentious fake way 6. the restaurant 676 serves pretty decent food 7. there is a starbucks cart right in the lobby! (but it's not free, boo) cons: 1. kind of a weird floor plan. you walk in, you take the elevator up to the 3rd floor (where the main lobby is), and then from there you can take an elevator up to your rooms. why not just have an elevator on the street that accesses rooms using room keys? 2. this really isn't a con, but i found this to be perplexing. the bathroom is huge. and there is only one tiny trash can, and it's against the far wall by the toilet. i would move the trash can so it would be more central, and every day, house keeping would move it back by the toilet. 3. the mini fridge is kind of small.  thankfully i'm the master of rearranging fridges to make things, like my cupcakes from more and my leftover gino's east pizza, fit in there. I had a great time at the Omni. It wasn't the fanciest hotel I've ever stayed in (one had a pillow ""menu"" so you can ask for pillows you like), but it was very pleasant.  Kudos to the staff, you made the stay very enjoyable.",N
4116,"This hotel was located in an amazing prime location.  Cross the bridge and it's the magnificent mile.  Go 3 blocks south and it's Millenium Park.  Just a block to the left of the hotel, you can catch a bus to anywhere you want.   However, this place was insane.  I don't know if it's cause of the bar or what but people were trashed all over the place... boyfriends clinging onto their girlfriends who were trying to run off slurring things to strangers walking by, stumbling around in their heels.  This place was a madhouse.  The walls for my room were really thin- I swore to god I was in the middle of a hallway but when I got up in the morning I realized I was at the end of a deadend hallway.  It made no sense!   This place was ridiculous.  If you're a rowdy college aged kid looking to meet other people, this is the place to be.  I was here for a casual anniversary weekend with my boyfriend, not to get all liquored up and slobby in a tubetop dress with a bunch of girlfriends, so this wasn't exactly the atmosphere working well for our ""romantic weekend"".",N

1378,"DO NOT STAY HERE. I chose the Millennium Knickerbocker for my wedding hotel block.  I chose it because the rooms were reasonably priced, the location was perfect in relation to where my reception was and the coordinator was very easy to deal with.  We signed the contract in January and that was the last good thing to happen.  Here are some highlights: -management changed and the new wedding block coordinator had no idea what was going on.  she was not timely in her response time and made everything very confusing -on the tuesday before our saturday wedding i called to confirm what time we would have access to the Burnham Suite where my soon to be husband and i were staying but where the groomsmen were also going to be getting ready on Saturday during the day - I was notified that the Suite had been given away!!!! -so the groomsmen had to get ready in a less than appealing conf room, we spent our first night being married in the same room i had stayed in on friday -it gets better -my room was not cleaned, we had arranged for champagne and a fruit tray for when we got back after the reception.  the fruit was moldy -oh and it took over 20 minutes to check-in I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE",N
2604,"Some of my friends had gone to this place a couple of weeks ago to celebrate a birthday. They apparently had a good time, so when my bff asked me how this club was, I told her (based on my friends reviews) that it sounded like it was a fun club. Boy was I wrong! We went to celebrate my bff sister's birthday, on Saturday. We got there with another gf around 10:45. Parking was kind of difficult to find and valet was $12. Its a very shady neighborhood, full of warehouses and factories. The place is actually behind a meat packing place that my step-brother use to co-own and I worked there a summer when I was younger to earn a little bit of money. I was kind of surprised by the location of this ""club"". It looked like a place where you could be mugged or killed your body thrown in a dump or the river and you would never be heard from again! So we find parking about a block away walk there and there's a line waiting to get in, I assume there where about 20 people in front of us waiting to get in. It was freezing outside and there was ice on the sidewalk. I mean if the club managers know there's going to be girls going who are wearing heels. Wouldn't the smart thing be to throw some salt to melt the ice to prevent injury!? So were waiting, and waiting and waiting and the line moves about an inch. We continue waiting and waiting and waiting...Meanwhile our toes are beginning to hurt from the cold. Finally we make it just inside this little un-heated tent they had out there, at least the cold air won't hit us. We continue to wait and wait and wait.... In the meantime there's groups of people who just go talk to the bouncer and get in. That's fine we figure they probably bought one of they're expensive, watered down bottles. After half an hour of waiting and our toes freezing off, we start to question if this place will really be worth it. We contemplate leaving, but decide not to since we already waited this long. Half an hour later the bouncer decides only women can get in, we where the first ones behind a group of guys. So we finally get in, only to find we HAVE to check our coats in. which causes us to wait again because the coat check room is right by the entrance. Were inside its now about 11:45 and the place is half empty and there's more girls than guys standing around! Wth! why where they keeping us out in the freezing Chicago weather? Why did they only, eventually only let girls inside? And why was this place so freaking small!? I thought there would be a lower or upper level!? Its basically the main ""dance"" floor where the bar is on one side and tables and chairs on the other. And two smaller rooms, I guess for parties. But then again what did I expect if this place is behind a freaking meat packing factory!!! We left after about twenty minutes and 2 drinks later to find a place where we could really dance(La Pachanga) The only good thing was we didn't pay a cover because my friend forwarded me that get-in-the-club-free txt. Will NEVER be going to this place again!!!",N
4511,"Small rooms, loud street noise from the El, old furnishings, and expensive ""extras"" make the Palmer House a plain rip off.  The lobby is impressive and gorgeous, and yes, some of the rroms  have been renovated, but I've been stuck in an older room for a week, which sucks.  Throw in another $18 for internet per day and another $18 per day for use of the health club and the cost adds up.  I would definitely look elsewhere!",N
1120,"I've actually never been in the Fairmont Hotel until I attended a wedding here last night. The wedding was beautiful and I was very impressed with the hotel.

3422,"Let's be honest, the Allerton only has one thing going for it.  That one thing is its amazing location.  It is right in the middle of Michigan Avenue, right in the middle of the stores, crowds, restaurants, etc.  It's just a few blocks away from the red line so very easy to get to from either Chicago airport without a cab or renting a car. Unfortunately, that's where the good things end.  The Allerton is a very old hotel and it shows.  The elevators are teeny, teeny, tiny and are comically inadequate to service a hotel of this size.  The bedroom furniture is quite old and there's NO DRAWERS in the rooms to put your stuff.  There's no BATHROOM COUNTER or anywhere else to put your toothbrush, etc.  There's just a free standings sink.  Even that sucks because the edges of it are slanted so if you try to balance anything on it, it just slides into the sink! I can't complain too much because we got a good rate on Priceline.  I do not at all agree that the Allerton deserves it's 3.5 star status that Priceline assigns it.  The excellent location is the only reason I'll give 2 stars versus 1.",N
740,"My girlfriend got married here over the weekend. It was absolutely beautiful. Apparently, this Westin is one of the few places in the city that can accommodate a wedding of 350 guests. Every detail was well executed and the ballroom was exquisite. I spent the morning of the wedding day in the bridal suite. It is an older hotel and you can tell, but it still has fantastic views and luxurious amenities. They also have the very comfortable Westin beds! The stair way was beautifully decorated for photographs. Everyone at the hotel was awesome. As for the food, the salmon was dry, but my date's filet was very good. I'd definitely recommend the Westin for a large wedding!",N
5335,"didn't hate it, didn't love it.  the hotel was a bit smaller than i envisioned.  i liked that there was a little bar in the lobby, just wish the lobby was bigger.  it was so small could feel the air when people entered and exited. the room was nice and updated, but smaller than i thought.  all in all it was okay, not great, not horrible.  i might stay again.  the cookie was nice.  i even wanted the cookie ice cream sandwich, but couldn't see myself payin $6 plus 18$ gratuity and $3 delivery for them to come upstairs.",Y
4632,"There is a reason why I like boutique hotels.  First, it's small and that usually means great customer service.  Second, the products are usually better.  Third, I like knowing that I'm in an unique hotel.  Which is exactly my reaction from my recent stay at Hotel Felix.  Great customer service from check-in to check-out.  The room was smaller than I anticipated but that didn't mean I didn't LOVE it.  I adored it!  A bit pricier than I would have preferred but it was so wonderfully located in downtown Chicago I just couldn't complain. I highly recommend!",N

1868,"The W in San Francisco is much nicer than in Chicago.  My biggest concern was the size of the rooms!  I know it's an old building and such but I thought my room was down some narrow hallway and the room itself was rediculously small.  The air conditioner made a loud BANG sound every 10 minutes which isn't good when you are jet lagged as it is. The customer service was quite good as the concierge spent about 20 minutes with me figuring out the best way to get to Northbrook, but that was the highlight of the stay.",N
5671,"This place deserves 5 stars. We stayed here our second night in Chicago, (after staying at The Drake) and it did not disappoint. To be honest, it was nicer than The Drake in a lot of ways, and I certainly prefer the rooms at The Talbott. I'd actually stay here over The Drake next trip. We stayed in a standard king, which was over 500 square feet! I love boutique hotels because they have so much more charm, and this one had a lot of it. Downstairs, they have the restaurant Bice, which is very classy too. It's true that the little things make this place so charming such as: a small living room, a designer remote control, Aveda products, excellent bathrooms with nice lighting and a bathrobe, free umbrellas, complementary passes to EQUINOX fitness, 3 telephones, electronic maid service displays, and a newspaper hung on the door in a cute little Talbott bag. Additionally, the room came with a lot of Chicago magazines for hot spots, as well as a beautiful Small Luxury Hotels of the world book (which is free for you to take and very handy!) Book online and you should also receive a $15 breakfast credit. Try the waffles if you're a fan. They're really good. The only complaint is that if you're staying on a higher floor, the elevator can be a little slow.  Overall, excellent hotel, great service!",N
1893,"This review is somewhat tempered by the fact that we got a good deal for the place, and the staff and service were mostly fine. I thought the lobby was interesting, although it takes a minute to even find the check in desk which seems apologetically superfluous to its main function, which is to double as an uber-contemporary lounge for the European twenty-something guests. You then enter the elevator under a flood of black light and Euro trance hits bumping through the speakers...at all times of day and night. I felt really sorry for the people's doors that are across from the elevators on each floor. Finally, the rooms are small to medium sized, as if you were in New York and not Chicago. Mattress was not so comfortable. The bathroom and shower were both nice and clean. The snack bar was dumped out over the shelves so the $8 Fiji water and accompanying organic snack bar stared at you in the face the entire time. A loud, clanging sound went off intermittently throughout the night whenever the air conditioning transitioned itself from one setting to another. It's a good thing I only needed to sleep one night of the two I was there. Otherwise it would have been miserable. On the bonus side we did get to interact with a famous and unfriendly hip hop star when our elevator stopped on his floor. So there's that. What I found most odd was that the hotel seems clearly suited for business travelers who need to be near the corporate offices in the area, but I really can't imagine most business travelers enjoying the place based on the above details and others (they had USA Today in the lobby, for example).   Summary: This hotel seems both pretentious and completely misguided for the area. I feel like these sorts of hotels might impress people who don't get to experience big cities very often but it just seemed tacky and dated to me, like a Puff Daddy music video, circa 2002. Not good for business travelers, not good for families with kids, not good for older folks. Good for European 20 somethings and perhaps the odd bachelor party, if they don't mind taking a cab to a part of the city that is alive at night. If not, they could always hang out in the elevator.",N
876,"Darnell at the front desk was friendly, and offered dinner recommendations when he saw me with fast food. He told me that the gold fish at the front desk is known by a different name by different employees. Darnell called that fish, Nemo. Service was excellent, and I love that they offer Mighty Leaf teas. The metal tea is a fun, vintage touch. When my tub wasn't draining, a quick call, and they had it fixed while I was out. The location is great for shopping and restaurants in the Loop. The reason why I'm not giving it more stars is because my personal preferences are for more modern interiors, and a more spacious room. For my hotel rate, I was expecting the Palomar.",N

1074,"Worst. Hotel. Experience. Ever. I've never written a review about a hotel (and this is the second ever 1-star review I've given) - that shows you how bad this experience must've been. I booked on kayak many weeks in advance. (I know booking through kayak doesn't result in quite the same service that booking through Fairmont and paying full price would have - however that is no excuse.) They: - double-booked our room - gave our non-smoking room to someone who came earlier in the day - only had one smoking room left in the entire hotel - would not give us any benefits in return (except breakfast - which we had already booked at a MUCH better place weeks in advance as well) - left stains, hairs, dead flies and dead mosquitos on our beds - AND the types of hairs that shall not be named in our tub - and then charged us an extra $70 (which they didn't tell us when we left, I had to find it on my credit card bill, and call them to have them remove the unwarranted charge) REVOLTING!!!! I could give many more details about how DISAPPOINTING and DISGUSTING we found the Fairmont Chicago - however intsead, I will simply advise you to CHOOSE SOMEPLACE ELSE!",N
1920,"In general, this hotel was a disappointment.  I was expecting much more from a W. The front desk is in an odd location - it requires directions to find.  The decor in the hotel is modern. I checked in around midnight and had booked a room that was supposed to a ""Wonderful Room"" with 253 sq ft.  Instead, they sent me to a room about half that size.  The bathroom was so small that there was no room for the waste basket - which they positioned practically  in front of the toilet.  The vanity was so small that there was definitely no place to put the regular toiletries people bring when they travel.  I assume they think you will be running these back and forth between your luggage and the bathroom. The person checking me in informed me that this was a newly renovated room and it did smell that way.  However, they missed small details such as the air conditioner against the wall was not caulked and the old wall was showing behind it. When I called to let them know I was not satisfied with this accommodation, they offered to upgrade me for another $70/night.  Eventually, I went down to the front desk and the next person on duty was excellent.  He was anxious to make things right and immediately moved me to another room that was twice the size - probably the room I reserved at 253 sq ft. (no additional charge) The lounge was nice.  The service was good and the waitresses were friendly and helpful.  The security personnel were also nice as were the people at the bell desk. The exercise room was reasonable (called the Sweat Room) - but the thermostat was set too high and it was pretty warm in there.  I guess that's why they call it the sweat room:-)   There was a relatively small collection of equipment but it was in good condition and well maintained. Other than the bad first impression, this hotel is okay.  It is nothing exceptional though and for the price, there are better places.",N
2777,"We've stayed here several times and I've been to a number of events here as well.  Beautiful decor and great service.  Nice touches - even on the small stuff.

1534,"This place is kind of the worst.  Maybe I'm a little too posh, but, here goes: 1 - Ambiance: Lobby was playing Fox News when I checked in.  What kind of hip hotel plays Fox News? 2 - Poor Reservation system: The room for which I had to **pre-pay** was sold out, so I had a choice of either downgrading at ""no additional charge"" or upgrading for $30 a night extra.  Oh yeah and I went from a river view to the view of an alleyway, and a room next to the elevators. 3 - Ambiance, again: Pretty beat-up hallway, terrible insulation between rooms and halls 4 - Amenities: No bottled water in the rooms, either for free or via mini-bar.  If you need water, you need to drink tap. 5 - Amenities: No bathtubs. 6 - Amenities: Linens are 100% polyester. 7 - Amenities: No blankets or duvets.  Even in the summer, offer a duvet.  (PS I can't believe I am considering warmth, kind of at the base of my hierarchy of needs, an ""amenity"") 8 - Ambiance: Poor-fitting bathroom fixtures (with an inch gape between the shower faucet and the tile, you can just imagine all the water damage and toxic mold waiting to grow. 9 - Amenities: No wireless. In other words, don't let the website fool you.  Not in the same league as W or Kimpton.",N
2890,"I stayed at the Sheraton back in March for a conference. I should preface this by saying I'm rather cheap and really the only thing I want out of a hotel is a clean room and a nice bed. So my bar was pretty average to begin with. What I got was an amazing room (small, yes, but I was just 1 person who'd be at a conference most of the day) with the most amazing bed I've ever slept on, and a freaking awesome coffee maker. The staff was just extremely friendly and accommodating. I spent a good portion of my time in the internet cafe, which was one of the few places to get wireless internet. The staff there would grab me a sandwich or a drink even if they were in the process of closing, which was awesome. Considering the amount of geeks that had converged upon this hotel for a few days, I think the staff went above and beyond to make sure everyone was taken care of. Also, I kinda blame the Sheraton's bacon for my downfall from vegetarianism. One drawback - no wireless in the room. If you want a room connection, it's another 13 a night and they provide a cable, but hey, not that much of an inconvenience.",N
5611,"Luckily for me, work pays for my hotel and the Westin River North has been great so far. The interior is, in a word, classy.  I've heard that the hotel was an Asian themed hotel in a prior life, and you can definitely see it in the decor.  The house restaurant has sushi available for room service, haven't tried it but I've heard it's pretty tasty.  I did look at the prices and it didn't look any more expensive than a regular sushi place. The rooms are great.  Bathrooms are huge and sleek, dual-shower heads and big towels. The beds are...well Westin Heavenly Beds.  Super comfortable and takes about 10 seconds to fall asleep. Good views of the river and right across from House of Blues doesn't hurt either.  Location isn't bad, close enough to walk to places like Rockit and there's a 7-11 close by for snacking needs.",N
218,"Stayed here for six nights with 5 other coworkers for a tech event with Chicago.  We are all in our late 20s, and we felt like this hotel was not for our age group.  Almost everyone there looked over 50, and the decor is a very cheesy nautical theme, and we joked to people we met at bars that we were staying in a retirement home. Also, we pretty much all found the front desk staff pretty unhelpful.  When we were checking in it seemed like they wanted to get rid of us as soon as possible, and when we asked for them to call a cab in the morning, they called one and said that we should wait fifteen minutes outside, but it might never come.   We paid $179/night during the week and about $250 for the weekend.  We went to the ""Pump Room"" for drinks, and wished we had stayed there.  It was reasonably priced and very classy because of a recent remodel.",N
759,"This place is rude and has the most horrible service I have ever seen. At several hundred dollars a night, I shouldn't be accosted by their impressively trained 'security' staff. This very unpleasant fat woman that was working there yelled at me and followed me around for a good 20 minutes. Even though I was all 'you know, i'm like paying to stay here and just trying to get to my room"" she was all ""oh what room are you staying in what room are you in who you be who you be blah blah blah"" It wasn't even late, it was like 9:00.   Management is not helpful and unresponsive.  This place SUCKS. Stay at the Drake.... P.S. The bar is fantastic... everyone's nice in there!",N
4140,"I got this room off of priceline for $80.  It was right on Michigan, which I loved.  Yes it is a convention hotel but it was still pretty inside, with lots at your fingertips, including on site restaurants, coffee shops and souvenier shops.   The staff was all incredibly helpful and very nice.  WE called down to them for recommendations about 4-5 times and had great ideas each time... The room was very clean and very nice, high thread count linens and plush towels. They even helped my boy plan a romantic little setup in the room for me (rose petals, a vase of tulips, wine and chocolate covered strawberries)! We got a room at the end of the hallway, which was nice as well.  the only downside was that I could hear the VERY loud girls across the hall all night.",N
1774,"Hotel Allegro, you've won us back.  After our lackluster stay last year, the snob offered us a complimentary two-night stay in a king suite.  We obliged. We arrived on Saturday October 10th.  John at the desk was very nice and helpful.  He answered a few questions I had about which streets would be closed with the marathon the next day.  We headed up to our king suite! (I would've given five stars, but I had to take one away for the scary elevator experience.  I heard others on the elevator say that had happened to them before....) Our suite was on the 18th floor.  I'm not a big fan of elevators so being that high was a bit of an ""oh crap"" moment for me.  Anyhow, we jump in the elevator with a bunch of others and head up.  The elevator goes to four.  Then three.  No doors open.  People start to panic.  Then it goes back to four.  Doors open.  I hop right on out.  There is no way I'm getting stuck on an elevator with a bunch of people!  We truck it up the stairs to about the 12th floor and decide to either die on the stairs or try the elevator again.  It's empty.  Thank God. We get to the room.....awesome!!  It has a huge bed, two rooms, two big tvs, a jucuzzi tub, and my favorite....Aveda bath products!!  I changed and we headed back down the scary elevator for the free wine tasting!  Yeah, that's right....freeeeee!!  The white wine was delish!  We had a couple of glasses and headed down to Encore to have an appetizer since we were a few hours early for our dinner reservation.  The artichoke mozzarella dip is awesome!  I loved it.  We had a few drinks, scoped out Dennis Rodman who was also there, and headed out to dinner. We were really impressed with the staff, the room, and enjoyed our stay this time around!  Even the bed-linens are superbly soft.  Me likey.  I'll be back.",N
3937,"Love it like I love ""Mad Men.""   If you're a huge fan of the show, or the era, or the style..whatever... this place is great.  GREAT.  Don't listen to the bad reviews.  I travel all the time for business- that's pretty much my life- and I know what generic, clean, mediocre American hotel rooms look & smell like.  The Congress Plaza is completely different.  Completely cool lobby, totally enormous rooms, friendly staff & better service than at your average big chain.  Seriously. If you want to come to Chicago & stay someplace generic that you'll forget, that's up to you.  If you want a place you can talk about having stayed there years later... that's this place.  If you're not totally hung up or stuck up, you'll get past the dated interior. But- don't complain to management when the hair stands up on your neck after you could swear something just followed you to the elevator.  Haunted it is.",N
243,"My neighbor told me that you offer a neighborhood rate so I called and asked about it.  Not only did I get forwarded to a different person after the receptionist couldn't answer my question, but the guy who answered was like a robot.  He not only made it sound really complicated to get a discount as a local, but he kept trying to change the subject by telling me about the hotel.  I just wanted to know the bottom line and STILL don't know the answer to my question.  Pathetic.  Maybe the hotel stay would have been better but the robots get in the way.",N
812,"As everyone says, great location......I will review the hotel.  I agree with most everyone, the beds are great, the rooms are small and uninspired and the lobby is just that....a lobby.  We had a very good experience with the staff, they were nice and helpful.  Room is loud with the hallway noise, but it didn't bother us too much.  We were on the 4th floor with a roof right outside our window....in case of fire we would be in the perfect room....however, no view in the meantime, and luckily no fire.  I am sure most rooms have great views due to the location.  Overall, I would stay here again for sure.",N
1924,"I  went to a conference here the other day with around 400+ people. The break was awesome when they offered unlimited water with your choice of strawberries, cucumbers, or lemon in it. Tons of cookies too. The sound system was great and the room was awesome. I could totally see having some type of reception there.",N
2472,"What a gorgeous Grand Ballroom. I have never stayed at the hotel, but have been to a few Indian Weddings here. The place is magnificent, beautiful, always elegant. Love the very long reception area right outside the Grand Ballroom, which has its own reception area as well. The Ballroom is just gorgeous, large, with such a beautiful balcony all around the top of the Ballroom. Love the Hotel, the Valet is super expensive though! $30 parking for a few hours!!! Crazy!!",N
758,Stayed here once...  This is a great location...  Right on Michigan Ave just north of the hancock.  Can't beat that... I liked everything about the hotel except the room size...  Just a bit cramped but that is to be expected in downtown Chicago.  I have seen far worst too in NYC (the W hotel-tuscany for instance) and you will pay double for that space! I would imagine this is a great place for business along with personal ventures alike.,N
2292,"Oh Chicago Marriott Downtown Magnificent Mile, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways... I love your 300 thread count Signature linens that gave me a restful and comfy sleep. And your towels that didn't smell funky. I love your adoption of Mayor Daley's green initiative by housing 200,000 honey bees on your rooftop to produce honey for the hotel and sell to hotel guests. I love your registration clerk Melissa who gave us a fabulous room on the 39th floor that provided an amazing view of the lake. I love your house made potato chips cooked fresh daily. I REALLY love your homemade pickles that have a banana pepper zip to them. I love your close proximity to everything Chicago! No rental of a car needed. We walked everywhere. Front entrance is on Rush. Back entrance is smack dab on Michigan Avenue. Close to the river. Within walking distance to Navy Pier and Millennium Park. I love your lobby bar and the loungey, comfy furniture where we would partake of a nightcap after a day of sightseeing before we hit the hay. Yea, internet is extra and the rooms lack fridges, but you know what? This is a big city. They want you out and about enjoying the sights and sounds; not holed up in your room being a hermit. That's why I love the Chicago Marriott Downtown Magnificent Mile!",N
304,"Let me start with the most important part of my experience at City Suites:   My boyfriend, who's black, was greeted by one of the front desk staff with a cold stare and a stern ""What floor are you on?"" a couple days into our stay.  When he told the attendant our room number, she mumbled something about a guest's missing property.  We still can't figure out what she meant, but I think you get the point.  In 2009, in Chicago, we had hoped for better. Here's the other critical part of our experience:  Anyone who says you can ignore sounds from ""El"" trains next to the hotel is lying.  The noise in rooms is brutal.  You hear everything -- trains pulling in and out, conductors' voices, door-closing chimes.  We also woke up to construction outside our window from 7am both weekdays of our stay.  Rooms don't seem to be soundproofed, so sounds almost seemed amplified. Some less important points, but equally unpleasant:  Housekeeping was lazy, leaving towels strewn on sofas and cabinet doors. I've never stayed in a hotel where the cleaners didn't return towels to the bathroom, or just replace them. FInally, the property's in poor shape.  While the lobby's clean, the facilities in general feel more ""hostel"" than ""hotel"". Bottom line:  I'm staying at the Days Inn next time I'm in Chicago.  Better value, better location, better hotel.",N
3524,"Nice mid market hotel - the rooms are clean and comfortable, about what you'd expect. The real winners are: Service - genuinely helpful and pleasant. I travel a LOT and sadly, it is rare to see this. Location - half a block off the best part of Michigan ave. You can't beat that with a stick. I hosted a conference here for 30 people and they did a great job. Pricing  is competitive, so I would certainly come back without hesitation.",N
2071,"BED BUGS!!! DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL.  My fiance and I just tried to check into this hotel this past Saturday.  My fiance is a pest control technician, so we literally check EVERYWHERE we stay now for bed bugs.  By check, I mean strip down the bed, lift the mattress, lift the box spring, pillows, bed frame...EVERYTHING.  Thank god we lifted the box spring this time!  My fiance knew something was up because the box spring had a bed bug encasement sheet on it.  Once we lifted the box spring and took a flash light to the bottom, you literally could see about 10 bed bugs and the fecal matter!! We immediately called down to the front desk and explained what we found.  They tried to give us a room on the same floor and were very casual about the whole situation.  EXTREMELY DISSAPPOINTED!  We requested our money back and left the hotel immediately. You seriously cannot take any chances with these things.  Once you bring them home, it is very hard to get rid of.  I know sometimes hotels like to respond to these type of posts and explain that it actually was not bed bugs and that it was ants, or some other creature.  I TOOK A PICTURE WITH MY PHONE, so don't even try to deny this!!!",N
4422,"I stayed here for business for three nights in the middle of winter and I was disappointed. Is it a hotel for business travelers or a swanky couples getaway? It can't seem to decide and my fear is that it does neither very well. Upsides? Great central location one block from the train. Spectacular lobby! Comfortable beds/linens. Friendly staff. Downsides? $20 a day for Internet? Even on the executive floors. No wifi in the room. I was stuck in my room working for two days. I couldn't move my laptop and the chair was too low for the desk. Not comfortable. $18 a day for the gym? C'mon! Even on an expense account, I could not justify that. Bad food. Granted, I didn't try the restaurant. I was here on business and I always order room service. Point me to a hotel that serves good, relatively healthy food in my room and I'll be thrilled. Also, I don't know if it was because it's low, low season in Chicago, but there were rarely staff at the concierge desks. I was more effective helping myself on the Internet the one day I ventured out. I would not recommend this hotel for business travelers.",N
5343,"This is the greatest hotel I have ever been to - the customer service is unmatched, the lobby and public areas are luxurious, the rooms are bright, beautiful, and comfortable. The food is delicious! Great location, great staff, great experience!To elaborate on the customer service I should tell my story. My purse containing my license, money, and interview folder was stolen on the train. I didn't have the credit card that I used to book the room or any ID to prove who I was. The hotel found a way to work around that, AND they called me and asked whether there was anything that the hotel could replace to make my stay more comfortable. I only asked for a notebook, as I needed one for my case interviews, but they brought me a leather-bound professional folder and notebook with pens that was even nicer than the one that was stolen. I started the day sobbing and ended it astounded with the generosity and kindness of this wonderful place.",Y
66,I have stayed here many times. It is a fine place to stay however I cannot stay there anymore because THEY HAVE BEDBUGS. Don't do it. This was in January 2011. They may have fixed the problem. I don't know. ASK!,N
3240,"Get out that platinum card, because it's going to cost you. Reserve early when tourism season comes around, because the rooms will be taken before you know it. And there's a very good reason for that. Even during off season, you want to try to to book as early as possible. Emphasis on the chic and rock and roll. At the base of the building is the Hard Rock Bar, which is quite the spot to hang out in after a long days venturing throughout the downtown area. Alongside of course, is their little store of Hard Rock Cafe goodies. You know you have a collection of Hard Rock Cafe T-Shirts from different countries and cities somewhere in your closet. The rooms themselves are fitted, at least the moderately priced ones, with spacious bathrooms that usually work as quasi jet tubs, modern interiors, and if you're lucky an excellent view of Michigan Avenue. They even offer the call for your very own masseuse after hours or during the day. Overall, a memorable stay with excellent location and respectable prices given the amenities and service they provide.",N
1031,"My Boyfriend and I stayed for 2 nights and our total bill was about $250. Not bad at all! Our room was great, I mean it's no Ritz-Carlton, but it was perfect for it's price. Everything was clean and orderly and I wasn't grossed out at all. Although we were only there for 2 days, we went to their gym so we didn't feel too guilty about all the Chicago-style pizza we just scarfed down our throats and it wasn't too shabby. We never ate the complimentary breakfast, but we did see it and it look delicious, and what is there to complain about if it's free! On the last day we had to check out at noon, but our flight didn't leave until about 7pm and we still wanted to walk around so we asked the front desk if they could hold it for us and they were pretty nice about it. My only complaint is that a couple of the front desk guys were pretty snooty/douchy, but the all the girls at the front desk and the bellhops were really friendly. This place is perfectly located too. If I ever go back to Chicago, I will definitely be staying here again!",N
1085,"Warning.  My stay here was compliments to my company a.k.a. I'm only writing this review on my stay and not making any judgments on price. I've stayed in Chicago before, near the Drake, and expected similar sized rooms.  In other words, small, like what you'd expect in New York.  When I walked into my room, I was pleasantly surprised.  If I was the one paying for this, I'd probably have my whole family staying in the room!  That.  Big.  Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating, but this certainly is a luxury hotel.  Walking in, I noticed the king sized bed and couch sitting more than six feet away from the bed. I then did the usual hotel ritual--looked through/at everything.  I ventured to the restroom and saw a standing shower (rain shower for the win!) and a separate tub.  The toilet was in its separate room as if this was a master suite bathroom.  There was also a vanity.  Nice! In the morning, I ordered room service--french toast with bruleed bananas.  While the service was really great (he ended coming back up to collect the tray without my calling) and helpful, I would say the bananas were a bit over bruleed.  But I guess that's just nitpicking. Although, if I was only rating this off of the environment of the room and room service itself, I would give it four stars.  Sadly, poor internet service and the area bumped it down.  First, the area: while not bad, there's really not that much to do around the hotel at night if you don't take a cab and don't know anything about Chicago.  Granted, that's just a qualm about living downtown, but still. Now poor internet service.  First, no free wi-fi in the lobby.  For some reason, I thought that was fairly common, but no.  $14 per day.  Though not bad, the service was SLOW.  I tried sending and receiving a few times from my work laptop and my iPhone (with AT&T's crappy service) got the messages and sent the messages even before they were received!  Muh. This was certainly a great stay for free, but would I return?  Mm maybe.  Then again..I live in Chicago.",N
3203,"My girlfriend and I stayed here over the weekend.  The room was booked through priceline.  While the hotel did have its high points (very comfy bed, nice TV, beautiful lobby, great views) the bad outweighed the good.  First off, someone made a terrible decision when designing the bathroom.  There's a wood slated window that opens from the bathroom into the rest of the room.  The door of the bathroom is also wood slated and it slides open and shut.  There is no over-head fan.  So what happens in the bathroom is essentially public knowledge to everyone else in the room.  Also, the walls are paper thin.  We could hear everything (and I really do mean everything) in the neighboring room.  While this is expected to a certain degree, it was a little too intimate for a four star hotel.  The W really does try to squeeze every dime out of you they can.  Even the cheapest of hotel chains offer free wi-fi in their rooms.  Why the W charges is beyond me.  Lastly, the W Lakeshore attracts a more boisterous crowd than I would have anticipated.  People literally yelling in the hallways at 3am.  Bottom line --- while we still had a good time, the next time we're looking for a nice place to stay in the city, we'll be avoiding the W Lakeshore.",N
87,"I'm surprised to see a review of the motor lodge that says the rooms have an ""old but clean look"". I'm not sure if the rooms have been redone recently or not, or if the motor lodge that others have reviewed is a totally different section. From my understanding, however, my friend did stay in the motor inn section. The room was pretty modern, with a flat screen TV, kitchenette, and a pretty nice bathroom when compared with your average motel-type rooms. We were both believing he would be staying in the main hotel, yet were both somewhat impressed by the room, which he described as ""artsy"". For the price, the room was great. I'm not sure if his price was lower because he placed his reservation online or not, but it was a pretty sweet deal. The room had two beds, a table with four chairs, a flat panel TV, a kitchenette with coffee maker and comp coffee, dishes, silverware, microwave, mini frig, and cabinets. The room had a little hallway which led to both the closet and bathroom. There's no dresser in the room, but a wall with drawers in the back of this little hall. The closet has more than ample space, plus two extra pillows, two extra blankets, iron, full sized ironing board, an extra roll of toilet tissue, and plenty of towels is the bathroom. The only ""bad"" thing was that I saw no ice machine anywhere. There was however a soda machine outside. The beds were fairly comfortable as far as motel beds go, and he had no problems with anything in the room, aside from the wifi being slow. Everything worked, the front desk staff was incredibly helpful, and everything was just great. I've stayed in a few motels, as well has motels pretending to be hotels, and this is by far my favorite. The next time I want to just get away for the weekend, it's nice to know that I don't have to leave the state or even Oak Park, to find a nice, relaxing hotel at a fair price for a night or two.",N
3267,"Ok, I have stayed here in the past and remember it being very different. I must have been sick last visit because there are things this time that I cannot believe i missed last time. When you check in the music in the lobby is so loud that you cannot have a conversation with the person who checks you in. You also cannot hang out in the lobby and have a conversation live, on the phone or any other way. I am not that old that this should be an overlooked factor. My room. So dark that even with all the lights on I felt like a blind 90 year old. Then there is the fridge - you can't use it all. I had to call down to check it out/ They happily supplied me another fridge sent up by two little frail woman. I felt so bad for them that I took it off the cart and placed it on the floor in fear that one of these two women would hurt themselves. Tip: Send up a guy next time, not two little Spanish women that the fridge is bigger than. If you need to send a woman - have her there to hold the door. Then there was this noise. A clicking noise all night long outside of my room. I called to complain and the first time they said ""we will check it out."" No response. The next morning when I told the chick at the desk about the issue and she asked me ""are you sure that the noise is not your alarm clock?"" Really? My response: ""I am not that retarded but thanks for checking."" Problem never solved. Then the last straw: No freekin Coffee. My lifeblood. Working on no sleep because of clicking. Can't get work done because of lighting. Can't work in the lobby because of noise then, two days in a row, no coffee in the lobby. Day 1: ""we are working on it."" - waited for 10 minutes before swearing and leaving for my meeting. Day 2: No coffee. I proceed to stand at front desk with my empty cup starting the conversation with ""day 2 no coffee"" and waited there front and center until desk guy goes in the back and gets me a cup. No refill and others look at my coffee with lust and hatred. RUN far and fast from this place. Effort and atmosphere lacking. Seriously.",N
3579,"I haven't stayed here -- yet. But, I've been fortunate enough to have been the guest at some cool soirees at this fancy pants hotel and I'm quite impressed with the way they run shop. To begin with, no matter which side of the hotel in which you enter, you know you're in for a treat. Ample staff, click-clacky floors, lots of gilded stuff and mirrors that allow me to ogle myself and say, ""D@mn, I'm looking good tonight!""... these are all pluses. From the check-in staff to doormen to waitstaff, I've never had anyone be less than helpful. I don't know if folks are, genuinely happy to work here or fantastic actors but, as a guest, I appreciate the charm and hospitality. It goes noticed. The ballrooms are exactly what you'd imagine a ballroom in an old, majestic hotel to be: opulent, historic, mysterious, and achingly romantic. I think my favorite thing about the ballrooms are the views. The windows are floor-to-ceiling and they look out at some of the most incredible views of Lake Michigan that you'll ever see. A nighttime view -- in the winter -- at the crashing waves, foamy crests and pitch waters can put a spell on you if you let it. Let it. After your betwitching is over, look up. Gaze high at the ceiling and then let you view go long. The rooms are so much higher and deeper than what they initially appear to be. Yet, despite the depth, acoustics are never a problem. I don't know whether this is a modern sound-engineering miracle or structural engineering foresight from long ago but whatever the reason, again, it's appreciated and noticed. Getting a chance to dress up in fancy clothes and attend fancy black-tie affairs is fun (for me). Getting the chance to do so in a historical, mouth-dropping venue like The Drake is an incredibly opportunity you should take, if offered. While things, in general, seem to go towards new! younger! hipper!... there's a reason why classics are classics... and why classics are classy. Be classy.",N
4109,"The hotel is enormous, and there are A LOT of conventions and people do deal with walking through the enormous lobby.  The staff is generally friendly and the Hyatt Club Lounge is a very nice perk (with drinks and snacks).  The rooms on the Club level are renovated and have good views.  It's not a ""cozy"" hotel, but it's conveniently located and you can often get a good price for a hotel with these amenities.",N

2516,"Great hotel. I highly enjoyed my experience here. The beds are so comfortable and I love the idea of 2 bathrooms. Although it was just me in the room, I could imagine how helpful it would be if my husband were with me. We ate in both restaurants and hung out at the bar several times. All staff was very accommodating and friendly. The food was very good. In the morning, the bar turns into a makeshift breakfast area with fruit, muffins, coffee, juice, etc. Still a little pricey, but gives you a break from the $22 breakfast buffet in the restaurant. I love that they use Crabtree & Evelyn bath products. I always load up when I go to a Hilton. Hey, you've got to get your money's worth, right? It's not like I take towels or anything! There is no refrigerator or safe in the rooms. I found this a little odd. There is a mini bar, but I stay away from those things. Other than that, my stay was great!",N

2753,"I've been meaning to review The James for almost a year now. My husband  and I stayed here the night of our wedding. We, being designers, wanted to stay in a modern hotel. After doing a little online research, I found The James and it looked like a place that we would love! OMG, The James was heaven! We stayed in the penthouse. It has beautiful walnut furniture, walls and floors. The bathroom is all marble. I love the combination of walnut and marble. It's full of designer furniture, clean lines, flush closets, pocket doors and beautiful materials. The concierge knew that it was our wedding night, so when we walked in, completely exhausted after a long, but wonderful day, there was some cool lounge music playing lightly throughout the room and there was a bottle of champagne on ice and a nice little tray of cookies. We proceeded to enjoy our champagne while enjoying the wonderful view of the city. And then, like the design nerds we are, we completely examined all the well-designed features of every nook and cranny of that room. The interior design is really great. I want my condo to look exactly like that someday. And I want to have my iPod streaming music through every room! Even their music selection was totally us. The bathroom was awesome: big, clean shower, huge, marble bathtub complete with an LCD TV. They have Kiehl's bath products. It was all just so beautiful! We also ordered room service. We filled out a little card and hung it on our door before we went to bed. And at our requested time, they delivered our breakfast and we ate it at the dining room table while, once again, enjoying the amazing view of the city. Check out time wasn't until 2:00 so we milked that one! We wanted to stay there as long as possible! I'd like to move in :)",N

I have stayed at SO many W hotels...I used to prefer this one over Lake Shore but I'm starting to re-think that.  The rooms at Lake Shore are bigger.  We stayed in room #1715 which was a Wonderful room with a king-size bed.  I was shocked at how thin the walls were--I heard the baby crying in the room next to me.  UGH.  I've never had this problem during prior stays.  Front desk staff is very accommodating.  Kudos to the maid for replenishing our Bliss toiletries every day with new ones (even if we still had full ones).  I found the bartender in the Living Room bar to be completely bitchy.  I ordered a glass of wine and Shirley Temple for my niece and it was as if I had asked her to drive to Evanston to get the ice to put in the Shirley Temple.  Rarely do I forego tips but she didn't get a tip from me because of her attitude.",N
4687,"This is about the hotel lobby bar. Damn, I want their fireplace in my house. It was so toasty and warm. I will be back when it's really cold out and will order overpriced wine or drinks just to sit next to it. The lighting could have been a bit dimmer at 10:30 on a Saturday night but I guess it has to be bright since it's part of the lobby. The bartender was cool. We actually didn't stay and order drinks because it was too pricey for what we wantede. But that fireplace...I can't wait to enjoy it again on a super cold day.",N
3700,"I had the opp. to take a ""staycation"" at this very prestige hotel and upon entering we were upgraded to a very nice suit because all they had left were 2 doubles.  The spot is prime, everything is walking distance and the red line is a couple of blocks away.",N
3741,"Shaky, shaky. First of all, here's a staff breakdown: (my major complaint at the Dana) Door guys: All great. Friendly. Held doors. Fetched elevators. Helped with bags. Front desk/reception: Rude, short, annoyed, unhelpful. Reservations: unprofessional and mostly unhelpful. Housekeeping: Mostly ok, save one day they forgot to clean and leaving a room service tray outside of our room for 24 hours. Spa: Great. My major issues were both with Reservations and the Front Desk. Everyone seems unhappy. IT shows through, I just kept thinking ""you guys should NOT be in hospitality."" Yes, I booked rooms through Expedia. No, that does NOT mean that you should treat me as less of a guest. Last time I checked booking $1500 worth of rooms at a hotel should warrant at the very LEAST adequate service. After many blunders and trials, finally our rooms were all situated. Not without much headache. I wasn't so much unimpressed with the fact that there was an error, but I was displeased with the way in which it was handled. ""Jason"" was not only exasperated, but also pretty lame. At 8am if I have to hear ""Well guess what? You've got a problem now!"" in a really high pitched, mocking tone...I'm going to be annoyed. Figure out the problems. That's your job. That's really your only job, actually. The rooms are nice, the floor to ceiling windows in the corner rooms are pretty radical. The views are nice. If you are booking here, def get a corner as the other ones have very little light (my coworker had one). The rooms aren't huge, but they are well appointed for the most part. The bathroom was awkward, sliding door that never stayed shut, could not lock, and a curtain over the shower? Weird. IT was clean and pretty stylish though, and not a bad spot to hang for 4 days. Room service was great (from Aja downstairs). Quickly arrived and food was really good. The tray sat outside for a day though, which is actually pretty gross. Overall, I won't stay again. With so many good options in Chicago, the Dana fell short. I got a great rate on Expedia, but if you book through an engine it seems you get subpar service and a crummy attitude. No thanks. Guests are guests and I can take my business elsewhere. *Spa was great. Separate review. *Valet $38",N
1125,"My family was amazed with the rooms.  Clean, great views, super-nice people.  Valet - super.  Bed - amazing (my Uncle said I knows for sure they're going shopping for a new one).  Bathroom - great.  For two guests using canes and/or wheelchairs it was as easy as pie to navigate.  They felt like rock stars.  And the breakfast buffet was a nice surprise (we had one diebatic guest was in great shape before our day of fun). We've put other guests at the Swisshotel, I think the bathroom wasn't as easy to navigate, the bathtub was really high. Wi-fi wasn't important for us.",N
743,"During the second part of our stay in Chicago we elected to stay at the Westin instead of going back to Hotel Felix - it wasn't a good decision. Service upon checking in was not welcoming nor helpful. Two bell hops had more interest in cracking jokes among themselves than assisting us with the check in process. Once we did check in and went to our room, it was nice but in need of a renovation. The lighting in the room makes everything look jaundiced. In our particular case, there was an annoying, loud fan blowing which could only be turned off by calling maintenance, which I did 3 times, with a fourth stop at the front desk before the matter was resolved. Internet service was not free and the connection was not good, lessening the feeling that this particular Westin had any interest in offering value or service to us as patrons.",N
4401,Great character and history. Gorgeous lobby. Kind efficient staff. Small rooms. No ventilation in bathroom.,N
3124,"Let me preface this 2-star review with the following: If this was any other regular hotel, it'd be 3 stars. But, this is the W, and I expected a lot more out of you! There were some redeeming qualities...awesome Bliss toiletries (though on day 1 I was missing conditioner and lotion), great location (close to everything without being directly on Michigan), comfy beds. BUT...There were many problems. This is a Chicago hotel! Do the words ""form follows function"" mean anything to you people?! In W's attempt to make-over the Days Inn, common sense really went out the window. For starters, the bathroom?! WTF? if you want any privacy in your bathroom, don't stay here. Seriously, a sliding wood door with slits, and a ""what the hell is it doing here"" window cut-out with wooden shutters? No overhead fan? A shower without a full door? I had to use a towel just to keep the floor from being completely soaked. Also, no closet, just some shelving. While nice-looking, it was inefficient. It was weird putting my shoes in a drawer. The shelf for my suitcase is directly under the hangers, so when I go into my suitcase, I have clothes hanging, literally, in my face. Annoying. Also, there were some little things that, again at any other hotel wouldn't have been a big deal, but this is the W! For example, both mornings the free coffee was empty. Refilling involved me talking to 2 different people. Lobby (excuse me, ""Living Room"") is way too small for the traffic. Despite 5 stations for front desk clerks, I never saw more than 1 or 2 which resulted in long lines and a crowded lobby. Also, it's hard to forget this was a Days Inn...ugly-colored walls, ,and a ""This used to be a cheap hotel"" stench that just wouldn't go away. If you're going to drop a lot of money on a fancy Chicago hotel, I'd advise looking at other properties. If you want that ""W Experience"" try one in a different city. But, if you can get a good deal, and don't come expecting much, by all means stay here!  When you book your room, request a lake view.",N
1465,"I booked a 4 night, through the weekend, stay for my mother who was visiting from out of town. I know the area well and the hotel is definitely centrally located, walking distance to John Hancock, great stores and dining, and Millennium Park. It also appealed to me because all rooms are suites (which I assumed meant spacious) and the hotel has a pool. They assigned her a room on the 12th floor which had a horrific view of the building next door. Had I known it would be THAT bad, I would have definitely paid the extra $30 to get the room with a city view. I'm talking seal the window with bricks bad view. The living room area did not have a sofa but instead two armchairs, one of which did not have an accompanying ottoman. Website pictures made it look large and spacious but in reality that was not the case. Bedroom area was really good with enormous comfortable bed. Amenities: -Pool area was mediocre and filled with children when I went to take a look. -Also, the hotel has a complimentary car that guests can book during weekday business hours. A car was booked to take my mom to brunch - it was running late and she had to stand waiting with a friend on the ground floor area which had no seating. Her friend asked if they could just call them when the cab arrived while they waited in the seating area on the 3rd floor lobby. Hotel staff said they could not and admitted other guests had requested this service in the past. If the car booked is running late (fault of hotel) then it seems this is not too much to ask? All in all, I expected this hotel to be a great experience for my mom but was let down. Being the great mom that she is, she had no complaints, but I have a feeling if it were on her tab she would have had plenty ; )",N
4812,The rooftop has the greatest views! The drinks are a bit expensive but well worth it. The staff is friendly and they play a great variety of music.,Y
3551,"Lots of things I loved, and a few things I didn't but overall I would stay here again Pros -staff is very nice -great location/decent price for where it's at -free wireless -ihome and large flatscreen tv that allowed me to hook up my mini dvd player -comfortable bed -mini fridge rental was $20 and I stayed a week so not bad Cons-I'm just picky and sometimes lazy so these won't bother most -very few tv channels -elevators take way to long since it's 40 floors -no vending machines and the nearest place to get a soda or snack is 5 blocks away at the 7/11 -non smoking hotel so Smokers beware -food deliveries can't delivery to your room, so you'll have to meet them at the lobby which is just annoying since the elevators take so long",N
5754,Business class hotel through and through. No frills very basic rooms. Our remote broke and even though the hotel was redone in 2005 it needs another makeover for sure.. Dont think you are going to split a room with another person that isnt going to see you naked - their bathroom door system is a little shotty and depending on your roomate could be frightfully revealing.,N
2218,"Taking advantage of a groupon coupon I decided to use this for Valentine's Day, so the price was right for what is typically a pricey hotel.  The staff here is very friendly and nice offering us a late checkout, but we had to go to work the next day.  The room was nice and plush.  The bed was comfortable.  Our view wasn't that great, probably the worst of any other hotel I've stayed at in Chicago.  It was smaller than what I was used to but it was just nice to get away.  I was a little surprised that they didn't have free bottled water considering it's more of the higher end of the Priority Rewards end of the chain, and we got bottled water at a Hotel Indigo.  I like that there's a Starbucks attached to the hotel.",N
4945,"I'm a priority club member so always trying to stay someplace that I can collect points.  Downtown Chicago has several options so I researched many of them on the web, and found time and time again the Avenue was coming up with positive feedback.  Sure I saw the reviews about noise, but come on people it's downtown Chicago what do you expect?  I can attest that the staff was incredibly friendly from check in to check out.  The front desk was accommodating with my special requests and didn't make me feel like I was inconveniencing them at all.  My room was huge, which is so nice while traveling on business.  You have a place to relax...a place to work...and a place to sleep.  You don't have to do it all while propped up in your bed like most other hotels.  The room was spotless and I'm big on that!  I don't keep my home messy so I certainly don't want to pay money and stay in a place that's messy.   Everyone I passed in the hall smiled and said hello, wishing me a good day continuously.  I really felt like my business was appreciated and with so many options that is important.  The restaurant was good, lots of variety and the hotel is in easy walking distance to all of the hot spots in Chicago.  I'll tell ya, some of those other hotels in Chicago could take some lessons in friendliness and customer service from this Hotel.  Thank you for making my time away from home incredibly enjoyable",Y
2549,"I was finagled into going to this place for someone's birthday.  Um. . . can we take a minute to discuss why this ""nightclub"" set up shop away from Lake St amongst a whole bunch of warehouses? I felt like a real-life horror film was taking place a block away.  I think some guy got shot up by ""organized crime"" right over there a couple of weeks before the day I went. No, I'm being for serious. Ladies. . . . this is definitely not somewhere you want to be walking down the street to alone.  Shoot, men too! Yea, it looks suspect outside but you get in and it looks like it  used to be a pretty jukin joint at one time. But it really is too small for the amount of people they let in there. If you don't get there early when the crowd is still a little sparse, you will have a hard to getting a drink at the bar or even making your way to the bar at all. Once it gets crowded there really isn't any distinction between what's the dance floor and what isn't. You'll be at the bar trying to get your drink while one half of a dancing couple may be bouncing their butt against your hip.  My face: Not Amused. The speakers are huge and it's hard to be close enough where you can really feel the music and far enough away that you don't that annoying ring in your ears after you leave. Don't you hate that sound? And seating? Forget about it.  The few seats that are around are claimed by the early birds and conquered throughout the rest of the evening by their party.   Overall, the place wasn't my steez at all. I already have issues with paying $10 and up to get into some place to listen to non-live music without anything else included. So, if I'm going to do it I certainly need it to be worth my while. The Victor Hotel is not, but if you like big crowds, sub-par yet still expensive drinks, and that ring in your ears at the end of the night, this Vic's for you.",N
1677,"Check into the Allegro for a change from your typical big-name hotel. It isn't a bad spot for a romantic getaway, and since it's possible to hear your neighbors (and vice-versa) hilarity can ensue depending on how mischievous you are. Right in Chicago's theater district, you're conveniently near a Metro stop connecting to many lines, including tourist stops and O'Hare International. The location isn't ideal for breakfast as there are too many chain eateries nearby, and the non-chains aren't open early enough. The lobby and lounge is attractive (dig the eclectic wallpaper), and their happy hour special provides free wine - yes, gratis - to guests from 5 to 6 PM, giving one a chance to mingle, or simply unwind solo. (Besides happy hour vino, we scoured small, pricey bottles of Belvedere from our minibar.) After realizing our dinner plans were a bit unrealistic, a concierge stationed in the lobby (Mark) helpfully found us another place, secured a reservation, and provided us with handy directions. Loved our room's decent view, modern decor, and amenities, like dreamy soft beds, an iPod charger/alarm clock (perfect for having an impromptu party like we did), and a huge flat screen TV - the bathroom's glam, marble counter topped with Aveda products was a nice touch too. (Didn't think the room was tiny, but I don't spend quality time in my hotel room.)",N
5672,"One of the best places i've ever stayed.  My hubby and i got married this summer and couldnt go on our honeymoon for a few weeks, so we did a mini honeymoon in chicago - and this is where we stayed.  Listed on tripadvisor as one of the top ten places to stay in the US - I can definately see why.  Our room was over a thousand square feet or something like that - basically the size of our apartment - it was wonderful.  For paying a fraction more than you'd pay for any standard room elsewhere in the city we were getting a huge room and personalized treatment you'd never find in huge hotels.   The bathroom was amazing - though i was disappointed the tub wasnt really sized for two - which would have been great - i enjoyed soaking in a bubble bath and watching tv.  Lounging around in their luxurious robes was fantastic - and we got monogrammed robes to take home.   They have a concierge to take care of all of your reservation needs or to give suggestions for things to do in the area - we're from chicago but this was a fantastic luxury to have.  She reccomended some great places that we never would have found on our own.  They spent probably a good hour hunting around trying to make an appointment for a couples massage for us on july 5th (which seemed impossible)  They did it!  And it was much appreciated work!   After going out for dinner the first night, we came home to a turned down bed with rose petals and a complimentary bottle of champagne as well as some truffles and a congratulatory note about our marriage.   This place was great - i will definately come back and highly reccomend it to all travelers or chicagoans for a little getaway.  They make you feel like family here and the service is outstanding.",N
5507,"This is a really sweet little hotel. There isn't anything flashy or fancy about it, but its in good condition and the people are very friendly. Since my family lives a plane ride away, and my apartment is very small, they end up staying in this hotel whenever they come to visit because its amazingly close to where I live. The hotel books up really far in advance in baseball season because it is the closes hotel to Wrigley (about a mile), and good luck getting a room whenever there are Pride events or Lakeview/Lincoln Park festivals. But, they are very accomodating of special situations (like my graduation from grad school). For people visiting Chicago, I would really recommend this hotel. Its far enough away from the touristy areas that you get a good feel for a Chicago neighborhood and its a block from the express buses that run down LSD, as well as a mile from the red line. Definitely the nicest Best Western (Bestest Western?) I've seen.",N
846,"Silversmith was a perfectly acceptable hotel in the middle of Chicago's downtown and a short walk from Millenium and Grant Parks.  You cannot beat the location.  However, for a ""boutique hotel"", I was expecting more.  The lobby was kind of strange... all wood with their ""business center"" (2 computers) and their gym which was pretty sorry looking. Our room was very dark since we were directly facing another building.  That being said, the room was immaculate, the staff was friendly and the beds were comfortable. This was completely serviceable, however it didn't seem very ""boutique hotel""-ish to me.  I'm not sure if they should try to sell themselves as that.  Either way, it was affordable and worth it for the location alone.",N
386,"On the outside, it was pretty and well taken care of. Inspite of the construction on the corner of State and Grand, the exterior was still well swept, nary a noise was heard through the construction, and inside the lobby was wonderfully appointed. On the inside however, the hotel was suffering from the need for a makeover, much more than new beds could ever offer. It looked like any Marriott from the late 80's and 90's, our two queen suite even being overlooked by a Marriott hotel, likely giggling whenever we opened the windows, saying to itself ""Yeah. I remember when I looked like that. Good times."" The front desk employees weren't much help (aside from the Consierge). Despite a clearly labeled 3pm check-in time, our room wasn't ready at 3pm. In fact, it wasn't ready at 4pm when we'd returned to the hotel after a few drinks in the attached Weber Grill. The front desk employee who'd asked if she could help us rolled her eyes when I asked if our room was ready. ""Sir, we're very busy,"" she replied. ""Your room is marked as cleaned, but there's something they need to replace in housekeeping. Let me call them."" Two other people approached the desk and were told the same. I stood up after a half-hour and glared (I'm good at glaring) slightly. The girl, with a lobby full of people, disappeared for a while. The consierge, who's name I didn't catch, smiled and nodded at me. He cleared off a luggage cart and told my son (who's name he'd heard once in passing, which shames me more for not remembering his) to stand there, and he'd be right back. He disappeared for a few minutes, and came back, nudging me. ""Ask her again if your room's ready. I'll betcha it is,"" he said with a wink. I did. It was. We were on our way. As for the room? The best I can say is that it was a place to sleep. I certainly didn't feel as though I was in the lap of luxury, though for the price I paid, I certainly shouldn't, either. Still, their wannabe Sleep Number bed is for the birds. The lowest setting is just flat enough to emulate a more than worn-out mattress. The highest, firmest setting was marginally harder than concrete. The middle setting was non-existent. I didn't sleep well, but, I did sleep. Would I stay here again? Sure. If I were on a trip with family, I would absolutely stay here again. The pool was nice, if small. The attached food options and location are wonderful. And the staff that wasn't a front desk employee were amazingly friendly much in the vein of everyone else we'd met in the city.",N

2179,Ehhh.. I was expecting more out of a four star hotel.  The room was nice.. but the shower water varied as I took a shower in the morning.  I also wasn't impressed with their lobby or bar area.  The entire lobby also lacks one trash can.  I would have also liked to have some bubble bath since there was a separate tub.  Oh.. and breakfast would be nice. It's a decent location though and the staff is terrific.  Very friendly and helpful.. not snobby at all. I think I would say it's a great 3 star.. or a poor 4 star.,N
3686,"This isn't a review of the hotel, but the high tea they offer.  Fabulous. Great service, selection, the pastries and finger food is to die for and they don't rush you and your friends.  Go during the week and treat yourself to a relaxing and lovely time.  Total class.",N
815,"Wow.  This really is the worst Westin in the nation.  I've actually been lurking on Yelp reading reviews for a while now, this hotel prompted me to register and write my first review to warn people.  My wife and I frequently stay in Starwood properties, and we have been Platinum Preferred Members of Starwood for some time now.  So far, so good (until recently).  I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to hotel rooms, and I understand that you get what you pay for.  All I ask is the room is clean.  Sheets, surfaces, etc.  If I pay for a luxury room, I expect a bit more, but overall pretty easy to please.  For Westin, I was expecting middle of the road.  OK, lets get to the hotel.  The first room we got upon check-in was dirty.  I mean, there was a crust (not sure what) on the glass covered nightstand, a layer of dust on the lights, the carpet was stained in several places, the chair looked like it was from a garage sale (stained/dirty) and the toilet, lets not even go there.  I called and spoke to the ""Director of Client Relations/Satisfaction"".  I asked her, please just go look at the room and see what you are putting your guests in......  She declined.   Our new room on the ""Preferred"" 14th floor (for only preferred guests) was just as dirty.  The ceiling in the bathroom, I have to guess, is lower than seven feet (in San Francisco, that's illegal, not sure about here).  Bottom line, location is great, lobby is nice, and the rooms represent the worst Starwood property in the nation.  Avoid it, stay somewhere else.",N
4735,"We stayed here for a wedding, so had a discounted price. That definitely helped us love everything more, but overall not a bad hotel. The service was great. We had pleasent interactions with the front desk employees (who checked us in very early when we arrived), room service, and cleaning staff. We slept in leaving our ""Do Not Disturb"" sign up frequently and were not disturbed. The location is great. We frequently walked from our hotel to our destinations. The lobby is trendy, warm, and inviting. Our room was small, but pristine. We had a big, Queen bed, nice furniture, a wonderful TV, and nice bathroom producuts, towels, and a robe. There was little storage for our stuff and luggage, and no mini-fridge, which would have been nice. The bathroom too had little storage.",Y
4464,"The Palmer House is a beautiful, classic Chicago hotel.  The lobby is spectacular and the rooms are always spotlessly clean and very comfortable.  The staff is friendly and I have had 2 good stays here  -- once for work and once on vacation.   The reason that I am giving three stars is that I can't believe that they don't have free wi-fi.  In fact, they don't have wireless internet at all!!  I understand that the hotel is a classic, old building but if you have electricity and running water, there is no reason not to provide wireless internet.  And at they prices they charge for one night, it just doesn't make any sense.  During my most recent stay here, I decided that I would just suck it up and pay for the wired internet in the room to do some work only to find that the cord was broken and wouldn't stay connected to my computer without some MacGyver-like maneuvering with duct tape that I was just not in the mood for.  Sigh.   As beautiful as this hotel is, I probably won't stay here again because of the internet situation.",N
1616,"This is a tough one to rate.  I say two stars for the room and six(!) for the view. I was here in mid-Oct for a conference and my company placed me here so I gave no idea of the price.  The room itself wasn't particularly memorable.  Better than a Motel 6 but less than a Hyatt.  Good bed and furniture but a bit noisy with a janky sink and an old, stained bathtub.  Ick. The location was good, not far from the train, subway, or Millennium Park.  The convention center was a $10 cab ride away.  Not sure if the hotels north of the river like near 'Miracle Mile' were better. The view was insane, though.  I had a view straight down the river from the 31st floor.  I've never had a view that spectacular.  All my associates had better hotel rooms a few blocks north but they were all amazed with the view.  It more than made up for the room quality.",N

The hotel itself is in a perfect location if you want to experience all that Chicago has to offer. Close to Water tower, The Hancock and all the bars and restaurants. Upon arrival we were greeted by the staff who were very friendly. At check in I could see a look of concern cross Derrick's face and I knew there was going to be some drama rama with the fact that we booked through hot wire. He said the room I had booked was not available , however, he was able to upgrade us to a better room which I thought was very nice of him. I do question why I am able to book a room but not actually know for sure that I have it. Derrick advised that we book direct in future which I understand but the whole point of Hot wire is no get a better deal right? The room itself was nice, very large four poster bed, although I think someone may have swung from them as they were a little wonky! The sheets were lovely quality and so comfy. The TV was kinda old school but was fine. Overall this was a nice hotel and a good value. I like that it was small and ""boutique"" and close to the action.",N

Otherwise... B+ for the staff A+ for the restaurant service (granted I used to work for Shula's so they hooked me up because I'm a member of the fam) A++ for the bed quality, even though I couldn't sleep at all due to my fear that my alarm wouldnt go off and I would be late for my morning appointments.

I'm a big fan of the Hilton hotels and this was the first Doubletree I've stayed in.  Rooms were spacious and being on floor 17 offered a great view of the city.  The door man was fantastic and the service was great.  There is an Einstein Brothers Bagels downstairs, which was very good.  They are about 2 blocks from 'Magnificent Mile'.  It was a great experience for the money.",N
1459,"Full disclosure: I haven't actually slept in this hotel. I have, however, visited friends staying here, and let me tell you, this place is pretty dang swank. It trends toward new-money opulence--modern but luxe (I'm thinking of this in comparison to, say, the SF Fairmont, which feels like walking into Buckingham bloody Palace). My pals managed to get a suite with two double beds they seemed to love, plus deluxe bathroom, and separate parlor, which is awesome and, apparently, standard. Genius. Combined with great location--right on the Mag Mile!--it would make for a super shopping weekend or even a nice base of operations for any of the many summer festivals and events. Also, you needn't fear shoddy cleanup service. Housekeeping is very diligent. When my friends decided they'd rather stay in and skip the housekeeping, the response was: ""What? You don't want housekeeping?! Okaaay..."" It's a lot funnier spoken aloud, promise.",N

1902,"We visited Chicago over Memorial Day weekend and stayed at the W City Center.  It has the same feel as other Ws we've been to; hip, stylish and sleek.  The interesting thing is that once you enter the cavernous lobby, you look up and the architecture appears to have a more Victorian, turn-of-the-century feel.  Ornate ceiling moldings and the like, juxtaposed against sleek modern...definitely an eye-catching combination.   The elevators have an interesting sleight-of-eye decoration inside and truly, I wouldn't want to be tripping when riding in one of them.  Just being stone sober inside the elevators could give you a headache if you weren't careful.   Our room was recently updated, according to the deskperson, and definitely smelled of fresh paint when we opened the door,  The paint small clashed a little with the gentle orange scent that otherwise perfumed the air.  The room itself was utilitarian, but TINY.  I'm talking smaller than New York City hotel rooms.  Really.  A great little space, but emphasis on little.  As long as you're not staying in your room much, the space is just fine for sleeping.  The bathroom was updated nicely and was surprisingly spacious compared to the room itself.   Overall a nice place to stay, centrally located and near a Starbucks which is nice for morning coffee.  We'd stay here again!",N
912,"Stayed 2 nights recently while I was in  Chicago for my job.  Located at the corner of West Washington and State, it's the perfect location for shopping, theater and sightseeing. You can reach the Burnham easily from O'Hare via subway -- stop is just around the corner. The Art Institute and the Chicago Symphony are both within walking distance.  The rooms are small, yes, but are beautifully decorated, though perhaps not to everyone's taste.  Enjoyed the free evening wine reception and the hotel bar/restaurant seemed quite popular.  Staff are extremely friendly and helpful and create an all around warm atmosphere.  I like to exercise but their tiny fitness room did not meet my needs.  No worries-- there's a Bally's on the next block up on W Washington that allows non-members to work out for $10 a day.  Perfect!",N
2641,"Great hotel to use as home base if you're in Chicago.   The nightly rate is very reasonable and the hotel and rooms are very modern.  I just hate the stuffy, cookie cutter look of the chains.  Service is excellent and there is free WiFi. 4 stars instead of 5 because the fee to park a car is exorbitant ($48.00).   That is just crazy! Also, though I enjoyed the hotel, my bed honestly wasn't very comfortable.  I didn't sleep well the whole trip - but I wasn't really in Chicago to sleep.  The bathroom door is a sliding door and there is no soundproofing so there can be some awkward moments if someone is in the room with you... Overall a great, centrally located hotel.   I will return.",N
4655,"We stayed here over the Thanksgiving holiday. The hotel is clean, clean, clean. Loved the robe in the room. The staff is friendly and the location is great as we walked to Michigan Avenue shopping and could walk to Whole Foods to grab a piece of fruit or drink. The rooms are well appointed (just a shower, no tub) but our room was VERY small.  Sink was incredibly shallow. The view out the front was poor and we were awakened at 4:30 a.m. by a very loud garbage truck that stayed for a very long time. No room for a coffee maker in the room, so we had to go the 1st floor for coffee, but at least it was free from 7-10 a.m. We had no trouble with it being empty and the coffee cleanup lady even set it back up quickly when we arrived at 10:10 a.m. Wi-Fi was free, so that was a plus.",N
3264,"We stayed at the Hard Rock in July, so this review is a little late coming.  It was a great place to stay in a fairly central location downtown.  The train from Midway has a stop very close and within easy walking distance, so it is easy to get there without having to take a taxi if you do not mind the train ride. We were there for 3 nights and would definitely book this hotel again; we had great a deal, which averaged about $140 a night.  The room was clean and huge; at first, we thought we had the worst room in the hotel.  The room was located back in a corner by the ice machine and housekeeping closet, yes, it was a tad noisy, but it was a corner room with 6 windows, 17th floor and one of the biggest hotel rooms I have had in a very long time, especially in Chicago.  The view was worth a little bit of noise. The beds were great as was the bathroom and the shower was wonderful.  We did not visit the bar or restaurant, with so many other great options in this city why stick to your hotel.  We were also in town for a surprise party and were on the go quite a bit.  Our friend used the parking valet, great service with those astronomical Chicago parking prices.  You might be able to find a cheaper parking spot looking on your own, but the convenience of in/out valet was worth the price.  The work out room was small; it had maybe 3 elliptical and 3 treadmills with some free weights and 3 or 4 circuit machines, not to bad though.  I would definitely stay here.",N
2751,"Last night I went to an event at the James Hotel. It was fabulous. The room that they use for weddings is phenomenal!!! The service is excellent, I can't say what staying there is like, but I really enjoy visiting this hotel. They have a great lounge, restaurant and club.",N
3488,"location pretty much rocks. the elevator system is beyond wonky. enter on huron, take elevator to third floor. walk to a different elevator and wait. hopefully you aren't in a rush or have to use the restroom as i waited for 15 minutes for an elevator. lame. housekeeping wanted me out at 11:30 am and checkout was at noon. i know they had to clean...but chill. valet service was slow. they said it would be 20 minutes to get the car, it turned out to be more like 40. rooms were quaint and the service was quite friendly.",N
3644,"This hotel was really a great experience with the history that it comes with.  The rooms could have been a tad bigger but it was plush and comfy and those windows blacked out if you wanted them too. The bar downstairs stays open fairly late as well as being able to get some food which is always a plus.  The biggest gripe I had was the 55 dollars it would cost to park including the fact that the attendant did not take any form of credit cards. The Drake was everything that people say it is, it is more of a historical place to stay and those who appreciate things of that manner would like it but it wasn't the type of place you get pampered at either.",N
4887,"Dana Hotel & Spa is by far, one of the best hotels I have ever stayed. The rooms are elegant and contemporary; which I enjoy over other hotel's classic and bland look and feel. Also, the customer service was great!! From the valet to the waiters in the restaurant to the front desk, everyone provided me with the upmost service and courtesy. Plus, they also have one of the best spas in the city, and an awesome rooftop nightclub, Vertigo. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Chicago, looking for a great spa treatment, or just looking to enjoy a great night out. If you're in Chicago, this is the hotel to stay!!!!",Y
2660,"We stayed at the James over the weekend, and I was definitely impressed. What I didn't like about the hotel was made up for in the impeccable service of this boutique hotel. Decor: I'm not a fan of the red.  It SCREAMS tacky.  It's the type of place with hip electronic music playing in the background and then you see a group of 30-40 year old bachelors with ripped designer jeans, half unbuttoned shirts, man jewelry and enough cologne to start a fire (when they light their cigarette). I guess a little red is okay, but to put a large patent pleather red chaise lounge in a room with four white walls is just wrong. What were you thinking??? The bed was very nice.  Very large and plush with soft sheets and down comforter.  Perfect for lounging around or having a lazy Sunday morning.  I liked the large wooden bench for setting your luggage and the nook for reading, working or eating was very nice (but not that comfortable).   Bathroom is very large, but houses the closet (weird).  Shallow tub reminds me of my own apartment.   Service and amenities: Love the cookies for turn down service!  Also love the martini glasses, large assortment of full bottles of liquer in room (Tanqueray, Grey Goose, Johnny Walker Black and Petron) with martini shaker, and Kiehls bath products.  (I LOVE Kiehls!!).  Free wifi is always great too! Full sized gym is awesome.  Clean, empty with a variety of cardio and weight equipment.  Complimentary large bottles of SmartWater in the elevator area too! A couple of things that were lacking, ok just one.  No Newspaper!!!   Dog and cat friendly too! I enjoyed my stay, but the Peninsula is more my type of place :)",N
5776,"great spot.   and free shuttle service to united center and surrounding spots. ask for louie, the driver.  he rox.",N
3680,"I adore the vintage Chicago feel at The Drake and I'm so thrilled I finally got to stay there.  Somehow, it was the cheapest place we found at the last minute.  Our service was flawless and next time, I will stop by the bar for a martini on my way out the door for the evening.",N
1265,"Chose this hotel for price/location. This is a older city hotel- rooms are smaller than you might be accustomed to. That's not a negative, simply a head's up. Prices are reasonable for the location: South Loop in Chicago, Within walking distance of Natural History Museum, right across the street from Grant Park, and close to Columbia College Chicago and DePaul. Easy drive to McCormick Place. Great location! Bed was comfortable, sheets were soft and in good condition. Pillows sucked. Worst pillows I've ever slept on- stuffed with lumpy little pieces of foam. They could/would not give me an extra pillow. A/C was super noisy but it worked. We stayed in a king suite, which is an open L-shaped room w/ a king bed, and a loveseat /single pull out bed in the 'L'. No privacy between the living and bedroom areas, so if that's an issue, get two rooms. No blanket for the pull out bed and three single size pillows for the whole room to use- all lumpy, btw. Fridge and microwave in the room. Again, it's an older city hotel so they don't splurge on space. Great views of the city. It's close to the ""El"" so you will hear the train rumbling by every 10-15 minutes during the day, less at night. Parking is valet with in and out privileges. It fills up quickly so you will have to call to specifically reserve a space or check-in early. We were unaware of this. There is a public valet parking garage right next door for a few dollars more but without in and out service. However, you are in such a great location that you can walk or take public transport or a taxi with no problems. I would stay here again because of the location/price, and I would recommend it, but, those pillows... oh my gosh... Please fix those pillows!",N
492,"Very modern hotel, beautiful sky ceiling to look up to from the lobby.  Looks nice inside and out.  The lobby bar has free drinks from 5 to 7pm, which would have been nice, had I not been working until 8:00 most nights I was there!  The free breakfast is made to order omeletes with sausage, hash browns, bacon; other dishes include hot oatmeal, fresh fruit, bagels, toast, and yogurt choices.  Starts at 6:30a.m.   Rooms are all suites, which makes it nice and roomy for two, and decent for a third or fourth person.  Plenty of closet space and an extra sink in the master bedroom.  Two tv's make it nice when sharing or if entertaining.",N
3164,Pretty cool.,N
781,"I wasn't really impressed by this Westin that much. I didn't have much time to hang out in the hotel because I got in at midnight the one night I stayed there, but my room was underwhelming. The amenities were all good as you'd expect, but there just wasn't the flair of other Westins. My bathroom was kind of small, the room had an odd configuration and it gave off the 70's modern vibe.",N
768,"I recently stayed at the Westin Michigan Avenue for a business trip. As always, tend to be impressed with Starwood hotels.  The room was clean, the bed was cozy and the hotel had a good-working Starbucks. I loved the location of this Westin as it's next to great shopping and Rush Street (loaded with great restaurants & bars).  Lastly, the bar at the hotel, The Grill, had a fabulous selection of wine, including a couple favorites - J Vineyards Pinor Nior & Grgich Hills Fume Blanc. I'll be back!",N
3331,"This place is great.  Excellent location, very close to Millenium Park, the Art Institute of Chicago and the river.  The building may be older, but if it is they remodeled it because it looks brand new on the inside.  Our room was huge compared to where we stayed the first night- a tiny little place down the street called River Hotel or something like that.  We had a little bit of a view of the city too.  Huge flatscreen TV and we were given free wi-fi with our deal.  They had some cool displays too- different musicians on each floor after you get off the elevator.  Our bathroom kind of sucked though.  Horrible shampoo and conditioner- it smelled funny.  And a weird but annoying thing was that the toilet paper holder is really far from the toilet.  Strange. Also, the bar downstairs sucks. Service is awful and they play techno at a Hard Rock place.  Makes no sense.  Other than that this place is awesome.  Also, if you play guitar, they will let you borrow some really cool ones- as long as they have your credit card number.  One guy showed us a $6,000 guitar.  Don't drop that!",N
2013,We recently purchased a one night stay through a coupon group and right from the time of booking through checkout our service was impeccable. The hotel was outstanding and spotless. The modern decor took our breath away. All areas of the hotel were spotless and for a busy hotel in this area of Chicago I find it so refreshing that even the air in the hallways and elevators seemed as if it were conditioned for our comfort. The staff was so nice to our two young grandchildren that we decided to have dinner in the on-site restaurant Felinni and this too was of top quality and so very reasonably priced for Chicago. We will make it a point to rebook if the opportunity should arise.,N
864,"Stayed here one night to be close to a family event. Great location, clean, really comfortable bed, large room with little living room area. We didn't use the TVs but they do need to upgrade them. Staff was pleasant if not overly enthusiastic. Gym was adequate, although if I'd gone in during early morning hours it probably wouldn't have been, with only 2 treadmills & a handful of other machines. For a first-time visit to Chicago this hotel would be great, since it's walking distance to what you want to see and the price, at least on http://hotels.com, was very good.",N
1552,"Won't be coming back here. They did not have the king size non smoking room available like the reservation (made months in advance and) stated they would honor. However, they did have ""lake view"" rooms available that fit that description if I wanted to pay for an upgrade. Our choices were a king size in a fully smoking floor. Who has fully smoking floors these days? Or a room with two smaller beds. They did not offer up to check if a king non smoking would be available the following day or two either. Lights out and a clogged bath tub in our room as well. Definitely would not recommend this place to anyone. I'm positive that there are many hotels in the area that have similar deals which are much nicer and have better customer service.",N
5328,"Nice hotel-extremely clean  and good size rooms and great decor (primary color in room was red).  Great location. Starbucks right next to check in desk inside the hotel. Vidalia-has a good breakfast but not included. Get a high floor-heard sirens 5 times throughout the night-we were on the 15th floor.  If you receive Marriott specials via email-don't automatically delete them! I booked a double bed for SIXTY NINE DOLLARS A NIGHT! Unheard of for downtown.  It was such a good deal, I booked 2 rooms for our family and requested they be connected to create a family suite!",Y
117,"Perfect place to stay in downtown Chicago. Just stayed here for 3 nights this past weekend and it definitely exceeded my expectations. Being my first time ever staying in a Holiday Inn, I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into, but we were greeted with genuinely friendly staff who were more than happy to hold our luggage (we arrived earlier than check in time) and suggest things for us to do and places to eat while we waited for our room to be cleaned. Free hot breakfast in the morning was better than the usual continental breakfast they offer at other hotels..complete with cereal, eggs filled with cheese, pancakes, bagels, sausage, muffins, biscuits, assorted juices, and hot cinnamon rolls (although we didn't take advantage of this every morning since Chicago has so many yummy breakfast spots). Staff were always available to hail cabs for us. One guy even went down the block to flag one down! Extra tip for him of course. Hotel is walking distance to some nightlife, restaurants, and shopping. If you get the GO Chicago card, the greyline will pick you up a few blocks from the hotel so you can save money on transportation there. Only complaints: small hallways and small rooms! Super cramped. But I guess for the location and price, you can't really expect much more.",N
5475,I love this hotel. The area is great! Cross the street is the best breakfast place.  It feels very 'private'.    Small lobby with the essentials.  The decor is very contemporary and stylish.  The bathroom...gorgeous.  Rooms are not huge but very comfortable. Downstairs there's a cool little spot for drinks. Plus you're within walking distance of some great little bars and restaurants.  Fun shopping as well.I definitely would stay there again.,N
4193,"The Hyatt is a decent place but certainly not a place I would recommend to friends trying to get a true Chicago experience.  It's in a good location only a block from Michigan Avenue and a couple blocks from Millenium Park but beyond that, what makes it a 4 star hotel or worthy of any other Hyatt I have stayed at?  A run of the mill 2 double bed room is small.  The hallways are very dimly lit.  The staff there is good and I thought helpful.  However, if you are looking for a really nice room and a nice hotel, look elsewhere.  The Hyatt is a conventioneers hotel and nothing more.  It's large to accomodate large conventions.  If you can get it through Priceline.COM for 75 bucks a night or less, go for it.  Otherwise, look at other 4 star hotels in the Loop or on Michigan Avenue.",N
284,"Stayed here with boyfriend in the middle of March2011.  I have to say, this place is awesome, especially if you get a good deal on the rooms.  It is a hotel and apartment building.  It is right next to the Hancock Building, which is right on Michigan Ave.  It's easy to get to the bus/eL from the hotel.  Our room was not what I was expecting, it was totally awesome.  They appeared to have been all apartments at one point, so it was like having our own apartment.  Had lots of storage space, full fledged kitchen (that we didn't get to use), huge bed, nice sitting area and tiled in bathroom.  I really loved this place and I plan on staying here in the future.",N
1695,"The Hotel Allegro and I had a 10 month relationship, from 5/2008 until my wedding day in March 2009. We had our ups and downs, but when we finally parted and settled our bill, I couldn't have asked for a better time together. Here are the straight up facts - wedding related, and not. 1. The wedding coordinator, Kerry, despite her insane schedule, got back to me in a reasonable amount of time.  While sometimes I wanted answers ASAP, I had to remember not everyone checks their work email at 6pm Sunday night. Kerry was extremely patient with my now husband and I while we flipped flopped between action stations and a plated meal until the last possible minute.  She understood our situation of planning from out of state and only being able to meet in person a couple times before the big day.  And throughout the process, Kerry was nice, yet didn't give us any B.S. 2. Free Wine Hour. 3. Food = awesome.  Fully surpassed everyone's thoughts on what wedding food usually tastes like.  People are still talking about the mashed potato bar, beef wellington puffs (appetizers), and the pasta bar. 4. Rooms. During my 4 night stay, I was in a spacious suite, but even guests and parents who stayed in regular rooms never complained about the size.  Everything was comfy, clean, and well decorated. Not to mention the location of the hotel was perfect for out of town guests to see Millennium Park, Daley Plaza, ""Marshall Fields"", State Street, etc. 5. Decor.  I heart the decor.  It made for awesome wedding photos! 6. Free Wine. 7. Room Block.  Due to the tanking economy, the Allegro kept dropping their rates.  We had to renegotiate our block rate a couple times, but in the end, everything worked out okay. 8. Free Wine.  Did I say that yet?  Because every guest staying at the hotel thoroughly enjoyed it. After my relationship with the Allegro, part of me doesn't want to stay here ever again.  Why?  Because I had such an amazing wedding weekend, I don't want anything to mess with my memories and current thoughts!",N
985,"I didn't seek out the Amalfi.  This hotel is in same building as our Chicago office and, as such, we have a corporate rate.  So, it was convenience more than anything else.  However, this is a very nice hotel at an affordable rate in a good neighborhood close to a lot of things.  Good combination. The rooms are comfortable and of decent size.  Aside from the requisite TV, in-room entertainment includes several CD collections (mostly Jazz...fine by me!), books and a DVD player (DVDs available at reception.)  The bathrooms are large and offer good quality Aveda soaps and hair products.   Lots of free amenities.  In the mornings, there is a breakfast buffet set up on the credenza of each floor's elevator location.  Coffee, pastries, fruit, juice and the like are set up here from (I believe) 6:30-10.  During the week, from 5-7, there is a happy hour featuring antipasti selections and drinks, including the Amalfitini.  Wireless internet is also available.  Unfortunately, there isn't any free water (in-room Voss water is available for $5 and $7), but that is a very minor thing compared to all the other complimentary amenities.  There's also a workout room and business center, but I have used neither.  Parking is also pretty pricey, but I've never had to deal with that. Oh, almost forgot, they drop off chocolate truffles as part of the turndown service. During my last visit in February 2009, I saw that the lobby had been completely remodeled.  Apparently, by now, so have the rooms.  Hope to head out their soon so I can check them out.",N
634,I stayed here for three nights. The service was friendly and our room was very clean. i will definitely stay here again during my next trip to Chicago.,N
4081,"We stayed there on Sunday night, after gthe July 31 Paul McCartney concert at Wrigley Field.   Two Queen beds, two people, $119.00.  The room was great.  Clean, very comfortable beds, the ac worked perfectly, tv was no problem, bathroom was nice, clean, looked newly remodeled.  3:00 pm Check-in took all of three minutes.  We parked one block away, in inside underground parking, for $30 for 24 hours (the hotel wanted $50). The location is perfoect for exploring the Loop.  L's ar three blocks away.  We did NOT eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel...they are a little pricy....$25 each for buffet breakfast.  But there are plenty of Starbucks and little nook-and-cranny places to get something to eat within 4 blocks of the hotel. did not spring for internet, it would have been $12.95 per night.",N
5318,"I split my time between Chicago and Phoenix for work and no matter what part of town my meetings are in, I stay at The Westin Michigan Ave. The location is ideal for walking to shops, restaurants and bars. The staff is always overly friendly and really helpful. I always ask for an upgrade upon check in and get one about 75% of the time!!",Y
4484,"this is the best service I have ever had at an event. it is unreal the level of care and joy the servers have for making things enjoyable for you, especially if you have dietary restrictions. it was really touching, to be honest. :)",N
511,"Have stayed at many an Embassy Suites in my time from coast to coast, this one was disappointing.  Now mind you, did get to stay free due to Hilton points, but meh is meh and would've been pissed off if I were paying!   The hotel is based on the older models of Embassy Suites, ie. the prison cell block model where all the rooms are squared around the central atrium look.   On the positive side: Two blocks from Navy Pier and two blocks from Miracle Mile.  Walking distance to a few other things too. Grocery store across the street was cool for getting stuff to put in room and a Walgreens a block away. On the negative side: It was crawling with little kiddies of which one we heard crying at night through our room walls (very thin walls I think), the room had no safe or makeup mirror, it had a sink in the bedroom which I thought was rather odd, it took a hella long time for them to bring our bags up after we checked in, they say it takes 20mins to get your car out of valet and for you to call well in advance, OMG you could hear the drunks at the atrium bar at night even with our tv on (the sound just echoed up 10 floors), front desk only had 1-2 people working it at any given time and the concierge was not very helpful or friendly when she was there - which wasn't often, this was the first ES we've been to where they had signs up in the elevators telling you what times breakfast would be more crowded than others, and let me tell you about that!!! Made to order breakfast often had a long line unless you hit it just right and all I saw people get were omelette's and bacon, sausage, and potatoes.  Breakfast was THE SAME everyday!  Two buffet lines with eggs that looked and tasted like powdered eggs, bacon and sausage links, pancakes, and yogurt.  Also watery oatmeal, 3 dried cereals, lots of donuts, and toast and English muffins.  One buffet line had food that was always not warm and you only got orange or apple juice as your choices.  The managers reception in evening was alright. Cell phone reception was zip in our room and valet parking with in and out privileges was 49$ but self park without in and out was 42$.",N
277,"My boyfriend and I stayed at The Seneca on New Year's Eve last year. Now, neither of us are fans of NYE--in fact, we *hate* it--but somehow, The Seneca made it so much better. We booked it on priceline or expedia and for $80, we kind of half-expected it to be a little divey, but this place is definately worth every star. It's in a great location, the hotel is absolutely beautiful, the rooms were great, and the best part about them was the little kitchenettes! Awesome! It made for a New Year's Eve fun-filled night of cooking microwave popcorn and baking cookies! I heart you, Seneca.",N
990,"Bring your Ipod because they have an Ihome/alarm clock/Ipod player  to blast your music while you browse through the free internet -- Yes, none of that $14.95 b.s. internet charge/day. Complimentary breakfast  AND cocktails-hors d'oeuvre? You can check out DVD's downstairs and watch them in your room. (and no, not THAT type of DVDs). They offered door-to-door chocolates service after happy hour. We got lucky, our room is right in front of the work out room. Overall, I've been here for 3 hours already and I'm loving it here. Its a  smaller hotel than the Marriott (where we stayed last time in Chicago)- which I find it to be an advantage on customer service and attentiveness. I think the staff -job title being  ""Experience Designer, Information Specialist, Convenience Architect, Maestro "" to be a little pretentious but I can't complain because they made reservations for us to TRU so we can blow $250/person. The view is pretty lame but the plasma television compensates the view of someone's living room. Location is good; Michigan Avenue is overrated so I do not mind staying a few blocks away from Miracle Mile. A block or two away from The House of Blues. I don't know what people are talking about when they mentioned Amalfi  is in 'desperate need of an upgrade'  because, its clean, sleek and chic hotel.  Designer wallpaper throughout the room, granite counter top in the bathroom, dual high pressure shower head and ladies-- a little vanity chair for you to apply your make-up. CDs and books in the room for your pleasure. Robes and slippers for you to lounge around in (or not...its not like anyone can see through your window) $300/night during our May 28- June 3rd stay. (for a conference) $5-$7 Voss water. Highly recommended.",N
4538,Absolutely stunning hotel. I had a work meeting in the main ballroom. It was huge and beautiful. The staff were very accommodating. A great place for your next event.,N
3805,"I recently wanted a little get-a-way and decided to book a room at the hotel for my mother and myself. We also, booked a massage for my mom and a facial for myself. It was amazing! The rooms have a loft feel to them and kind of remind me of the W Hotel concept. The bar downstairs was very posh and packed all night and the Aja Steak restaurant had excellent food and drinks! Some of the decor was kind of random but for the most part is worked. The showers were kind of strange in the locker rooms. Overall, we both enjoyed it and will certainly go back to eat there again. I went back a few weeks ago for a hot stone massage and yes it was amazing!!! The Vertigo Lounge is awesome...and I will take all my out of town guests back to Ajasteak and to Vertigo for a few drinks! They have a chalkboard in the restrooms which is so fun and they have a shot cart and great outdoor lounge section. Loved it!!",N
4706,"This hotel is with in walking distance of just about everything but that is pretty much where the praise ends. The rooms and beds are super tiny. The bed felt comfortable when we sat down on it but we woke up in pain every morning. We found this hotel as part of a secret deal on Hotwire and because of that I feel we were given a room next to the elevator, and I mean right next to the elevator. Any time and at all hours we could hear the elevator chime and whoever was in the hall way. Even the elevators in this hotel were small but at least there were 3. The walls were also extremely thin and on several occasions we could hear the couple in a room by ours having sex. The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean. I also appreciate that this hotel was eco friendly but it seems like they took a Holiday Inn, put some fancy light fixtures in the lobby, slapped an eco friendly brand on it and called it 4 stars.  I wouldn't recommend this hotel or stay there again, not at least for the price we paid.",N
2242,"For starters, this is a beautiful hotel on truly prime location (just across the wrigley building). The exterior is flawless and there is even  a starbucks inside (major plus in my book). Now, the service is OK at best. I was in a hurry to go to a meeting one morning and got lost. The flow of the meeting space is horribly designed. I then asked for help from employees who could not help me. To top it off apparently some elevators go to a certain floor and  I got mixed up there too. The rooms were too small for my liking and I heard they finished renovating... hmmm I think they need to start over. My lasting moment was meeting their GM, Edward Andrews. Best words to describe him is rude and sloppy. How in the world he got his position is beyond me. Sum things up, historical hotel with character but it definitely needs some fine retuning from the top down. Not very impressed and won't be staying here again. Restaurants were yummy so if you want a quick bite or some starbucks go here otherwise don't even bother wasting your time there.",N
1006,"I stayed at the Amalfi when I was in Chicago for a conference and thought it was a lovely hotel. The staff was all very friendly. The rooms were clean and cozy. There was a continental breakfast set up on a credenza near the elevators on each floor in the morning which was awesome. I went out in my PJs and brought breakfast back to my room. There was also a free happy hour that they hold each day for guests that included picky foods like cheese, crackers, meats, hummus. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others.",N
4726,Small but nice room. Free internet. Great staff.,Y
2911,"This hotel was very nice!  It seemed like mostly business-people here, although I was on vacation with my sister. The room was a nice size and the bed was so friggin comfortable.  I had so much trouble getting out of it. The gym is a ripoff at $12, but I guess since most guests are on the richer side, they can charge it.  Also, if you need a cab, the dude outside blows and whistle and TA-DA!  Cab.  How convenient. I don't like how this hotel doesn't have a candy bowl.  The first thing I looked for when I walked in was a candy bowl.  What a bummer.",N
1556,"My Friend's Bachelor Party Review #7 Considering the prices of all the places nearby, this place is a spectacular deal. $350 for a suite to house 6 unforgivably drunk 20-somethings comfortably, giving enough room to sprawl out, pass out, and play game of asshole until the former occured. The views of the river were spectacular, and the interior was extremely well appointed, with the exception of a small couch which didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the plush decorations. A few knocks were a gigantic walk in closet which really would serve no purpose unless and extremely compulsive packer stayed here. And the lack of a fridge or ice machine, maybe it was best there wasn't a mini-bar, but c'mon, the beer was getting warm. Did we deserve a place this nice? Can I really write a review based on the purpose I used the place for, a drunken crash pad? Probably not. But I think this a great relatively cheap spot for anyone who wants to stay downtown",N
4802,"Did a staycation here with my hubby, it was looovely. I may have even made a souvigner :)))). Rooms are really cool. we had the junior suite so it worked out beautifully( I Must have my own bathroom, must)  we went to cibo matto for dinner (yum yum) and roof for drink which is always great especially on a warm summer chicago night!! I love the rug too when you walk in "" never hate on the weather in chicago, 9 times out of 10 a conversation is started thanks to it) or something or other. heheheh love the wit, the wits the shit!!",Y
5210,"We stayed at the Omni in Chicago from August 28th to September 2nd. Staff on the ground floor were very friendly and directed us to the 3rd floor. Check-in went very smoothly and we got a room on the 25th (top) floor. The living room had a large, flat panel TV with an extensive selection of channels. The bedroom was nicely finished and clean. Bathroom was also neat and tidy. Housekeeping kept our room clean and actually arranged our toiletries in such a manner that we maintained throughout our stay.We ate at the Omni breakfast buffet in the 676 restaurant on the 4th floor every morning because the kids love buffets (and ate for free) and it was good. They really need a separate station for omelettes and other custom egg orders because waiting for eggs in the middle of the buffet hampers the flow. The staff was friendly which was nice given that there was an automatic 20% gratuity levied on our group of six.The daytime concierge for the first half of our stay (Marcus) was extremely friendly and he sat with a disposition that communicated ""I'm here to help!"" The other concierge always looked as though he was busy doing something so we never really disturbed him.The health club on the 5th floor provided the essentials and never got too busy.The adjoining pool was suited perfectly for my kids (3' 6"" from end to end). Numerous games of beachball volleyball. Hot tub was good and there was a general disregard for the sign that indicated that there was a three-person limit.Location, location, location! Perfectly placed on the Magnificent Mile. Hotel entrance is just off of N Michigan and never got too busy in front. If you are traveling with children then I strongly recommend this hotel. That being said, I would still consider staying at the Omni again even if we leave the kids at home.I also recommend that you get the Select Guest membership. It gets you free wireless internet, free bottles of water, and more. It's free and so worthwhile.",Y
3787,"There's a great joke to be made about putting Santa up in a modern downtown Chicago spa/hotel.  Maybe it's the gift he gets for bringing good cheer. Either way, before I could get geared up to don the red suit, I had to climb into this sleek, mod hotel room. And the result was a couple of days of luxurious bliss that had me grinning like that practical joke where Rudolph thought his nose was on fritz. There were tons of tiny cool touches that made an excellent hotel genuinely fantastic: Jones sodas for my inner indie soda lover, the rain shower set up, the giant bed with overstuffed pillows and the panoramic views that had to be seen to be genuinely appreciated. I stopped in the rooftop lounge one night which was fun, if a little emotionless, but my understanding is that this part is new, so maybe it'll evolve by the next time I head back.  But other than that, the staff I met was terrific, friendly and welcoming. Here's hoping I see ya again soon, Dana!",N
1770,"The Allegro is nice and I had one pleasant stay here in 2005. I truly love the Kimpton chain, but I have found myself not returning to this hotel when I am in Chicago. There are so many places to choose in the loop and near north, and the Allegro really doesn't offer anything you can't find done better and cheaper. It is a nice enough hotel, but the only reason I would return is if they have an incredible deal.",N
914,"As a Kimpton hotel, the service is outstanding. The history of the building and its architecture makes it even better. Location is great because its next to a Walgreens (convenient) and barely 2 blocks from the State street train stop (even more convenient).  Ask for a room facing north up State street and you get a great view of the city.  The Aveda products in the room are a nice touch.  Regular rates can be pricey, but join the Kimpton loyalty program or become a fan on Facebook and keep your eyes open for deals.",N
1935,This is a great hotel! You get upscale without the snobby. The rooms are spacious and the decor in the rooms are classy. The Hotel itself is great and you'll have tons of fun at bar. The prices are a bit high but its a great place to start or end your night. A++,N
3182,"I don't usually like ""swanky"" type of places, but assuming you get to the upper floor bar early enough in the night to get a table this can actually be a pretty fun time.  The staff have always seemed more interested in making us feel welcome than treating us like we were lucky to be allowed in.  Prices are high as to be expected with a place like this, but the drinks are generally well made.  Worth putting on quality rags to go and visit.",N
1490,"Very disappointing price/value ratio. Have stayed at Westin River North numerous times and chose Omni expecting even greater luxury and service proportionate to the significantly higher cost. Room was nice but no more special. Internet access was additional $10 per day. We requested a room with a view which they honored but the windows were high on the wall and the view was, well, Michigan Avenue.  Business Center computers were $16 per 15 minutes. Staff was very professional and bar was nice. But overall we didn't have the 4-diamond experience we expected. We will return next time to the Westin and know that we will have a very luxurious stay.  And our view will likely be over the river, Michigan Avenue and Chicago City Center. Always fascinating.",N
5112,"Great location, good lobby, but the room was too small for me.  I felt like I was staying in a closet.  So, I spent most of my free time in the lobby, enjoying the spaciousness.",Y
5277,"We rented (3) rooms, this is not a Hotel, this is a Motel: The rooms: 1 room the shower curtain was broken, only the first and last loop was attached to the overhead pole, there were two shower heads because one the water trickled out (down) and the other one, the head shot off and hit me in the chest, the shower hose sprayed water out and up the whole time you showered. 1 room the lock didn't work, the other room the duvet was yellow stained and had wood pieces all over the bed. None of the rooms had the in room safe as advertised, beds are hard as a rock, musty smelling, we tried to get a microwave to pop popcorn that they sale at the vending machine and was told by the front desk that they no longer supply them, but we could use the employee's behind the front desk. No HBO, no pay movies and no video games were available or even offered. The Facility:The fitness room, was 1 piece of equipment that was/and has been broken for some time, the Bristo restaurant has been closed down for a couple years. The outdoor pool has been closed down for some time, the indoor pool is no longer a pool. They do have a shuttle ""van"" that will pick you up at the airport, the back door is broken on it and has to pulled open and closed by a couple cords, per the driver who spoke little English it has been broken for sometime. The hall ways were dirty with stains on the walls. The wirelss only worked while in the lobby and that was if the wind wasn't blowing and it wasn't cold outside, which during the winter that's difficult. I've never felt so dirty after leaving the hotel, I couldn't wait to get home and take a ""clean"" shower!The Staff-I felt bad for the front desk, but hey I guess they could leave. Everybody checking out around the same time we were complained. I called 2 days ahead to get ajoining rooms since we were getting 3 rooms and 2 of them were 1 family, the front desk lady that answered the phone said to call the night before we were checking in, so I did, they said oh you have to do that when you check in, so when we checked in we were told, we don't have ajoining room, very frustrating why didn't they tell me that the first 2 times I called.",Y
3604,"Stayed with a friend here this winter.  I loved the HUGE Christmas tree in the lobby!  So beautiful! The bedroom was a little small, but the bed was super comfy, and the bathroom was spacious.  Great closet space, and you can't complain about the view of the lake!  :-)  (Granted it was like -20 outside!) I wouldn't mind coming back to stay here :-)",N
435,Pretty basic. Good staff. Clean. Short 1 mile walk to the McCormick convention center. Quiet. Shower head and water pressure not that great. La Quinta grade linens and towels. It REALLY IS in the middle of nothing. You'll have to take a cab everywhere. Wireless internet is craptastic at best. You get what you pay for. Don't be a cheap bastard. Spend a little extra for a nicer place.,N
4700,"Like a number of other Yelpers, I stayed at Hotel Felix because I received a really good deal on Priceline. I would definitely not have a problem staying here again if I got another good deal (I ended up paying $60 a night pre-tax), but probably would not stay here if I had to pay full price. The first night a friend of mine stayed in the room with me, and although many yelpers have complained about the size of the rooms, I didn't think it was overly-small, even with two of us. The too-small bathroom, however, was a big problem for me, and it's the bathroom alone that took this from a 4-star to a 3-star review. I do get the eco-friendly thing and I understand that the sink is really shallow to save water, but, it was just a pain to use. Beyond that, my sink ended up clogging the night before I checked out, so it then became nearly impossible to use. Also, I didn't like that there was no real sink counter space. Beyond that, we did visit the hotel restaurant, Elate, and it was just ok--nothing to rave or rant about. The Good: - Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, particularly the doormen, and check-in/check-out was seamless. - Although, as is typical with hotels in the area, valet is expensive ($45 p/night), there is a parking lot across the street that is a bit cheaper ($35) and a parking garage that is even cheaper ($23). - Hotel is in a good location; in walking distance of many restaurants, clubs, etc. and a short cab ride away from a lot of other high-profile downtown locals). - Free wi-fi. - The best assortment of tv channels I've ever seen in a hotel; and the tv was a well-placed flat-screen. - Way-comfortable beds. The Bad: - Supposedly there were no double-bed rooms available when I arrived, and the bed, while comfortable, was a little small for two people who aren't interested in getting ""romantic"". - While it wasn't a huge issue, we could hear noise outside of our rooms, e.g., the ice-machine and elevator. - Too-small bathroom with an impossible sink that ended up getting badly clogged. - There was only one mirror in the entire room, and it was in the bathroom (which makes it difficult for two women to get ready to go out on the town). - The nonexistent view. The window of my room looked out onto a brick wall. - We found ants crawling across the bedding twice.",N
5312,"If you are looking for luxury on  a budget.  This is the hotel.  My family of three stayed in a suite for three days and loved it.   It was quiet, unique, the staff was great, and we loved room service.",Y
2898,"They have the BEST beds. But they need to work on the cooling situation. The hotel was so hot when I was there and the air didn't work in any of the rooms. And what's a comfortable bed when you're sweating in your sleep? You just can't have one without the other if you're looking for a good night's rest. We stayed here for my friend's wedding and the hotel brought us girls complimentary champagne and strawberries the night before the wedding. That was pretty nice of them. And I love that they have Starbucks coffee in all the rooms. It sure beats Folgers! Be careful with the valet though... apparently if there's a ""shift change,"" as one employee explained to us, then they can lose your car. We were 45 mins late to the rehearsal dinner because they lost our car and it took them an entire hour to find it! Com'on, Really?!",N
899,"I stayed at the Burnham on my fifth trip to Chicago in the last couple years. I have stayed at a different four-star hotel on each visit. The Burnham was probably my favorite of the bunch.   The staff was extremely helpful and friendly, and the location can't be beat. Right on the corner of State and Washington with very easy access to the Red and Blue lines. When they finish the new building at 108 N. State there will be a new Blue line station and new access to the Orange line. That means the Burnham will have easy access to either airport. After reading ""The Devil in the White City"" I was very interested in seeing some of Burnham and Root's (& Atwood's) work first hand.  To have the opportunity to stay in one of their buildings was incredible. The Reliance Building is absolutely beautiful and Kimpton has done a great job of retaining the building's classic charm while adding their own quirky touch. I didn't have a chance to eat in the hotel restaurant, as there are too many food choices and must-eats in Chicago to being with, but it looked great and seemed to be doing some great business. The upper floors all have the original office building doors with frosted glass and mail slots.  I believe they are on the 8th floor and higher. I was on the 10th floor and we had a great view north to the Chicago Theater and the river. The views to the northeast would be great as well. Our room was small, which is expected in a building this old, but very well decorated and comfortable. The beds and linens were great and having access to a pillow library, made the stay that much more comfortable. I honestly can't imagine staying anywhere other than the Burnham on my future visits to Chicago. Great place!",N
4630,"When it comes to choosing a hotel, it often takes some time because I am so damn picky!  After reading reviews online, checking the bedbugregistry (I try to check every hotel I stay in...I'm so afraid of getting bed bugs!), and seeing where the hotel is located, I can finally settle. I am SO glad that I decided to stay here! I loved that you could walk just about anywhere from the hotel, and that it was located only several blocks away from Giordano's (YUMMMMM!).  Also, this hotel is eco-friendly, which is always a plus! I have a hybrid and was able to park for free (total saving s of $40 for parking) for the weekend.   Awesome hotel, and I would definitely stay here again!",N
359,"I think this place rocks. We got a huge room with a kitchenette and free wifi at the last minute for a little over $100. It's not excessively stylish, but it gets the job done in terms of practical wants and needs. A little noisy, but it's downtown Chicago. I'm a fan, and the location is cool.",N
5603,"Took a quick trip to Chicago and decided to stay at an old favorite the Westin Chicago River North. I'm Platinum Elite, in the Starwood Preferred Guest, frequent guest program and based on my past stays, this property is very consistent in it's treatment of guests, especially Elite members. Location has good access to the loop, just a ten to 15 minute walk to Macy's on State Street or Michigan Avenue shopping. The hotel is very convenient to public transportation. You can use either of the L Stations on Lake or the Grand Street station on the Red line. Each of these three station are 5 to 10 minute walk (based on if you have luggage and weather) from the hotel. When I arrived at the hotel, I was the only person checking in. There is a separate Gold/Platinum check-in Line, since I was the only person, there was no need to use it. Check-in was pleasant, I was recognized as a Platinum member and returning guest. If you are the type of person who loses hotel folios or needs to submit one with an expense report be sure to ask that a folio be emailed to you at check-out. Assigned a suite on the 20th floor just down the hall from Executive Club.  The room faces the marina towers.  The room is maintained but the entry way has a slightly ""dated"" feeling.  There is a wet-bar to the left of the entry, once you enter the a parlor room. The granite makes it feel heavy and dark, which is why I think it's dated. There is a closet of the entry for added storage. The parlor portion of the room has the previously used Westin decor scheme, but again, everything is well maintained, rooms are spotless. I got a tip that they will be refreshing rooms, which will be welcomed. There is a flat panel with HD channels and each room comes with complementary access to a mac computer. The room is well lit considering it's location and there is ample lighting. The desk is located by the window and has plenty of work space and sockets for phones, cameras, PDAs, etc.  In my honest opinion, the only negative is there is no bathroom in the parlor. At the far end of the parlor, is the entry to the bedroom. These are some of the largest hotel bedrooms I've ever stayed in, it's very spacious. The room consist of a large closet, heavenly bed, plasma TV, ipod docking station and river view seating. Opposite the entry is the bathroom.  Consistent with the room size, the bathroom is huge. HUGE!  Three 3 people could easily use this bathroom at once. Single sink with good counter space, large soaking tub and separate shower. Lots of towels. The marble does date the room and because it's dark makes the bathroom feel dark as well.  The negative, there is only one since and the there was not a full compliment of Westin brand toiletries in the room. There was bar soap, condition and shampoo. No lotion, shower gel or mouthwash. I carry my own, but it's food for thought. This property has a Westin Executive Club.  It's a nice lounge with good views of the Loop and Near Westside. The morning of my stay, there was a Continental spread and the evening presentation consisted of two hot foods (dumplings and something else) and various fruits and cheeses. Not the best, but not bad. In my stays, I don't ever recall the lounge being crowded or busy. The Fitness Center [AKA Westin Workout] is located on the lower levels of the hotel tower.  It's one of the few Gyms with an attendant who verifies your room and status. For a large urban hotel, the space is small but adequate.  The hotel does not have a pool. There is a business Center on the first level, just before the elevators.  Note, there is a sign that indicates you can print a boarding pass, however, the PC's are not programmed for carriers which have a second screen to print a pass.   If you encounter a problem, ask the concierge for assistance. The hotel is wired for with High Speed Wired & Wireless Internet Access.  As with most Starwood branded properties, wifi is free in the lobby.  If your assigned a room on the Executive Club Level, you're provided with a mac in your room. The hotels lobby is Wide open lobby.  In the many stays I've had at this property, I've met friends in the lobby and I don't ever recall there being more than 5 people there. It's a nice space with good light and access to the river. Embers restaurant is just off the lobby. FINAL IMPRESSION The staff is professional, courteous and very helpful. Everyone I encountered was pleasant from the door man to the lounge attendant.  The hotel is clean and well maintained. The location is great so no car is needed. I would return and recommend this hotel for business and leisure travelers.  Leisure travelers and those traveling with children need to remember there is no pool. The staff, platinum recognition and lounge, give it an edge on other properties. In winter I like being on Michigan avenue, but all the shoppers can be stressful so the WRN is a good place to set up base. Solid property and I recommend.",N
2710,"Loved the clean, modern setting of both the public areas and the private rooms.  It's just a beautiful hotel.   *****My knowledge of The James is limited.  I don't know much about the packages and quality of service- because I only stuck around for 6 hrs total (2 hrs to iron my dress, paint my face, shave my legs, giggle,  bla bla bla + 4 hours of passing out face down on the crisp white sheets.... i bet the housekeeping dept. hate girls like me) while a couple of my girlfriends were staying here.   Peeve: small bathroom.  It's a personal thing- I always look for big bathrooms when I book hotels.",N
496,"I enjoyed a 2-night stay here over my birthday weekend.  It is a nice hotel with extremely courteous employees and clean rooms. In addition to the great employees, the breakfast each morning was great - and this is coming from someone who isn't a big breakfast eater!  Seriously, all these complaints about it being busy are RIDICULOUS.  Obviously it's going to be a happening place with all the options you have - scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, omelettes, cereal, donuts, pastries, yogurt, fruit, soda, milk, juice, pancakes, waffles, hashbrowns... How could you not be happy?!  I was there on a Saturday and Sunday morning which I assume would be busier than weekdays and both times had no problem finding tables. Now on to my cons... Parking.  Parking is $49/day.  That's probably normal for Chicago hotels, but still... that's murder, and a very pathetic way to spend $100. Exercise room.  The room is TINY and has like 5 cardio machines (3 treadmills and 2 ellipticals or something like that.  I really don't remember since I didn't get to use anything).  For a hotel of this size, that's ludicrous.  I ended up going for a jog outside in rainy, 50-degree weather which wasn't ideal, but whatever. Room issues.  None of these ""complaints"" are a big deal, but I'll share them anyway.  The sitting area/office room that you walk into is pretty big.  It has a flat screen tv, desk, etc.  (No free internet...)  And then there's the bedroom - it's small, or at least seems small thanks to the huge bed.  There was probably a foot of walking space on each side of the bed so it wasn't easy to do anything but sleep in there.  I left my suitcase, got dressed, etc in the other room.  Also, the tv in the bedroom is the old cube type...kind of strange to still see those, especially with a newer tv in the other room, and what was even stranger was the extra sink in the bedroom!  So random. Also, taking the elevator to the lobby then the lobby elevator to the ground floor was interesting, but nothing to hold against the place. 5 stars - 3 stars for cons = 2 stars plus 1 star for an overall good experience and being a ""good deal"" (minus the parking) for a total of 3 stars.   It was fine, but I'm not sure I'll stay here again.",N
4057,ASK FOR THE EAST WING! Pricey for anyone off the street I recommend trying Priceline we saved over 50%.,N
788,"So I am here right now.  I had a layover in O'Hare and my flight was cancelled.  So i'm staying in Chicago for a night.  The hotel is nice.   Service:  Well, the only thing that kinda bugged is the fact that the girl who checked me in, gave me a room that someone else had.  How ackward.  So I had to go downstairs and get a new room.   Rooms:  The room gave me a funky vibe at first.  I went in and turned on all of the lights and the television.  But i'm in here now and I'm okay.   Amenities:  One main reason why i stay at Westin hotels is for the heavenly bed and the heavenly shower.  I've always been a big fan and I can't wait to go to sleep.",N
1592,"If not for check-in, I would have given my experience at Hotel 71 five stars.  The premium room was great for what we paid, stylishly furnished, comfortable, quiet, and with an amazing bathroom (seriously, can I take that back to Boston with me??).  The location could not have been better;  we bought 3-day CTA passes and barely used them since we could walk almost everywhere.  Prompt and friendly housekeeping and a fantastic 12th-floor river view were icing on the cake and even the elevators were never a problem (!!). Now for the bad part: check-in.  I'm relatively young already and look even younger, which I think wrote ""take advantage of me"" on my forehead.  When we checked in, we were asked if we'd reserved a premium room with one king, to which I responded no, we'd requested two queens (I was traveling with my brother).  He paused for a minute and told us he'd given us a city view and sent us up to the room.  Well, it turns out he'd given us a standard city view (which wasn't even available on Expedia, but we booked anyway since we got a deal on the premium room).  At first I thought I wouldn't complain since it was probably because they'd gotten the wrong information from Expedia, but I looked up the price difference ($70 per night for four nights) and marched back downstairs, determined either to get the premium room we'd paid for - or at least a standard river view - or to receive some sort of compensation.  Another staff member was very friendly and apologetic and put us in a premium room.  Halfway there, I realized I hadn't mentioned needing two queens and, lo and behold, there was only one king.  I elected my brother to go down to the concierge this time and they finally put us in the room we'd requested: a premium river view with two queens.  Since the room we'd originally reserved was obviously available, I'm not sure why they didn't just put us in it in the first place. That being said, Hotel 71 was indeed a great place to stay in Chicago.  If you can, stay in a premium room.  There is a BIG difference, and I should know!",N
5735,"Quick check-in processs, thanks! Also, they give you a brown paper bag so that you can recycle your trash which is pretty cool.  I didn't love the location as far as walking around, but I was there on business so it was fine.",N
2241,"We stayed in one of the executive double bed suites. Absolutely marvelous marble bathrooms...lovely shower...Rooms was decorated beautifully. We had large screen TVs in both rooms.

We'll be back this next weekend....",N
3325,"I was a little hesitant after reading some of the reviews on here but we (the Mrs. and I) stayed here for 5 nights. She was there on business and I tagged along. We got a much better rate than the host hotel around the corner. Pros: great location. Close to major train stations. Bar has some decent craft beer (local selections). You can check out a guitar and Line 6 pod and rock out in your room. Our room had a pretty nice view. Cold A/C. Nice big TV with decent channels. Comfortable king size bed. Many food options across the street (although we didn't see them until our last day because they're inside a mall like area). Giordano's is across the street. Close to the river. Walgreen's across the street. The staff was overall pretty nice except one concierge. But I don't like tipping a guy because he handed me a map. If he got me some awesome restaurant reservations or something, yes, I will tip you. Maybe that's why he wasn't the friendliest the other couple of times I asked him simple questions that took none of his time and didn't require the use of any outside resources. I never understood the whole tipping thing. I'm not rich. I don't get tipped to do my job. Waiters are different. I tip them. Cons: While the walls are thick and we couldn't hear our neighbor's TV or talking, the door to the room lets a lot of noise in.  The shower has a  kind of half glass panel for a ""door"". You have to reach into the shower and get drenched in cold water to turn it on and then the other half where there is no glass allows water to get all over the entire bathroom floor. I understand wanting to be modern or whatever but it was ridiculous. The closet was a little small and cumbersome. The door to it would not stay open.  No refrigeration, the minifridge is a weight sensor activated mini bar. We had to put our waters and beer on ice in a plastic bag lined trash can because we all know ice buckets hold next to nothing. Internet in the room is overpriced. We were able to slap the charge on an expense report since my wife had to do some work while we were there but $15/day is a bit high.   Would I stay here again? Yes.",N
1577,"I am torn between 3 and 4 stars for Hotel 71.  First of all I think the Lobby should be so much bigger than it is.  It's quite small and when there are people checking in/out it gets super crowded.  Uncomfortably crowded, especially when everyone is lining up for the elevators in this little nook.  But other than that it's very trendy and the staff is nice.  Great location but there are so many other wonderful hotels in the area.",N
734,I was only there for a one day conference so I can not review the rooms themselves.   The Valet parking was a nice touch and once inside the hotel it was easy to find which room I was suppose to be in because of the signage pointing me there. A good experience for the day that I was there.,N
1757,"I think a 9 year old girl with a fetish for princess stuff designed this and then an early 90s contemporary interior designer finished up.  Way too 'girly' and annoying contemporary style.  I'll give em points for the logo though.  The striped hallways make my head spin sober or not, more so when not.  However, very clean and gives off a swanky feel.  Some sort of theatre group meeting was going on while I was there.  Bonus though of free glasses of wine and socializing around 5pm.  My view was a brick wall and there were odd noises throughout the night so that was a bit of a downer.  The staff is very helpful and actually has a sense of humor.  The best part of the stay... the music they play in the lobby and the elevator.  Granted it's possibly a little too hip and that well may make you sick but good tunes nonetheless.  The Smiths while riding to the lobby, hell yeah.",N
3784,"I really want to love you, Dana, I do... but you disappoint me a tad bit every stay.  This time, it was the phone beeping because of a low battery.  I did tear it out and the next day it was put back together yet still beeping.  It was the TV that didn't turn on, the drain that got clogged, and the wireless that didn't function so well... Kudos to the friendly doormen and concierge, the comfy bed, the chocolate dipped fortune cookies, and the complimentary breakfast in the mornings. I noticed Mariah's pluses and minuses cover pretty much everything I observed as well, so I cannot really sum it up better than that. Dana - you're a solid four stars.  I'm sure I'll be back, although maybe next time you will annoy me less?!",N
1584,"my friend from HOT-lanta stayed here while she was interviewing for jobs. pretty darn posh. i am happy to say that her 'rents were picking up the tab. if i was not forking over the dough, i'd stay there every night. very classy art deco style and nice rooms.",N
3869,Overall a great stay. The room and hotel are contemporary in style. Its a fun feel with activity around the main lobby. A strange 2 elevator system at entrance but overall quality good. Its not my favorite hotel ever but service was great and views were good so it gets 5 stars.,N
5738,I stayed here last weekend courtesy of my employer for our post-holiday-party festivities and non-drunk-driving safety.  The location is great (though minus one point for not being near any CTA stations) but is also close enough to everything that a taxi ride is quick and easy.  Right next to both a 24 hours Walgreens and a Dominicks. Check in was easy and service was friendly (could have given me a heads up about that temporary charge they put on your credit card though).  The rooms are super nice and are on the larger size.  Rain showerheads and modern-ish decor.  Flat screen and balcony (with view of Sears Tower if you lean over and look east). Solid bet for a great stay.,N
3500,"The swank lobby is a bit of an oversell on a awkward cramped room with some weird design issues. The hallway reeked of cigarette smoke and I had a lot of trouble with getting calls out on the 3GS network. Also, I didn't appreciate the concierge who could barely be bothered to make eye contact with me except to explain to me as though I was a child that the hotel holds card information in their system for incidentals.",N
4946,"Vibrant City hotel in Chicago - Avenue Crowne Plaza!Wow the excitement of downtown Chicago - I love it!  As a first time visitor to this vibrant city I find myself looking out the hotel window of the Crowne Plaza Avenue Hotel just watching the excitement and the action of the city - the lights, the city noise, the people watching and all that.  Who needs to leave the hotel!  But alas this is a review of the hotel not of the city.  My husband and I wanted a quick weekend get away and as recent transplants to the Midwest, Chicago seemed to be an easy journey.  Scouring on line we stumbled upon the Avenue Crowne Plaza Hotel.  As most travelers do these days, we looked at the reviews and as many websites as we could find to research the hotel.  Time and time again we saw how comfortable the beds were, the positive comments on the guest rooms, location and all that - oh can't forget about the Zebra chairs.  I was intrigued to say the least.So we booked it and didn't regret the decision once during our stay.  The reviews were correct - Avenue Hotels rooms were spacious, the staff was courteous, the location was phenomenal, the beds were comfortable and the zebra chairs were awesome!We arrived mid day and while we waited for the check in time we took the opportunity to walk around.  So many shopping options nearby including the American Girl store.  I drug my husband in there to see what all of the talk was about.  The kids in there were going crazy about the American Girl Store.  Apparently not many American Girl Stores around, even talked to a family that came from Texas to get their American Girl hair done.  What?  Any who--we came back to the hotel, checked in and Sarah at the front desk was amazing.  She gave us some pointers on where to shop, dine and what clubs to hit.  Thank you Sarah - you were correct on all fronts!  We checked into a one bedroom suite and the suite was oversized, very spacious with great city views and yes - you do hear the city below even as high up as we were.  But when traveling to downtown Chicago our expectation was not to hear crickets and birds signing - our expectation is what we experienced.  The sounds of an alive city!  So all you review writers that were bothered by the sounds of the city perhaps should visit a ranch in Montana for your holiday?  Here's a hint..when you take a cruise you hear the ocean too.  Just sayin'Thank you to the Crowne Plaza Avenue Hotel for a great and memorable first time trip to Chicago!   We'll be back.",Y
1880,This review is for the lobby/bar Very cool atmosphere and great drinks. I thought the staff was friendly and provided good service. There was a nice happy hour crowd there on Friday but after 7:30/8:00 most had cleared out. Bonus: You can bring your dog! Talked to the concierge after seeing a beautiful husky come in for happy hour. Apparently the W is a very pet friendly hotel.,N
521,"This is a wonderful hotel with a friendly staff and outstanding service.  Tracee at the front desk was wonderful.  The rooms are large, beds are comfortable with a duvet cover, fluffy towels, reasonably sized kitchen area.  Breakfast is excellent, although sometimes difficult to get a table.  Pool is good - spa a little hot for most, but stil ok. The only negative... it is located near a fire station, as is other hotels in the area.  So get a high floor if necessary, as was our 11th floor.  It was not that bad.  Valet service is competitive and excellent, but takes about 10 minutes. Overall - this is a terrific value, great services, friendly staff..  Take if from someone who travels frequently.  This hotel was nicer than the Chicago Hilton, without the fancy ceiling.   The Hilton does have one of the cows.   that's what you're paying for.",N
3053,"I'm giving this W three stars for their stellar service only! Otherwise...bleh... I will echo the sentiments of other yelpers. Walking into the lobby, you're faced with the familiar look and feel of the W chain but upon closer inspection, the hotel appeared run down and not up to par for the brand. Rushed renovation or bad maintenance? As I mentioned before, the customer service here is excellent!. As was the food in the restaurant. I think it's called Wave. Anyhow, the staff at Bliss were also very nice and extremely accommodating. I would stay here again just for that. On the flip-side, who would want to stay in a nice hotel with bad service? A plus is the location and view of Lake Michigan. I just hope they spruce up a bit if I ever return.",N
2161,"Like others have said, this hotel has a great location and a great pool.  Unfortunately, I wasn't very impressed with the room itself. I came here on a family trip, where the parents got a single room with a king-sized bed, and my sister and I shared a room with two queen-sized beds.  Despite the fact that the two rooms were the same price, there was a huge disparity in the quality.  The single room was much, much nicer, from the view to the coffeemaker to the furniture.  The double room was not much nicer than what I would expect from a Holiday Inn.   I agree with the previous reviewer that the placement of the mirror was bizarre to the point of distraction.  It was on the wall right next to one of the beds.  Personally, I tend to make good use of hotel mirrors when getting ready in the morning, and it's usually near a desk or something.  This particular mirror was completely useless and only served to try and make the room look bigger.  I noted that the mirror was in a more logical spot in the single room. I think my main problem with my room was that they had the kind of toilets you have in public restrooms, with the metal handle that comes up rather than a toilet tank with a flush handle on the side.  It just felt cheap, and it was leaky, so we had to grab it with a towel to avoid getting sprayed with toilet water every time we flushed.  It just wasn't what I expected from the Intercontinental.  Also, I found it really annoying that you have to scan your room card just to open the minibar.  We wanted to keep our bottled water in there, but we were afraid of getting charged, so we just drank it at room temperature. On the plus side, all the staff were really nice.  As mentioned above, the pool is fantastic.  I went once in the evening and again in the morning, and I had to share a lane both times, but it wasn't overly crowded.  It would have been useful to know beforehand that the pool is free for guests, but the gym costs $12.   Overall, I'm happy with the hotel considering that it was only $106 a night on Hotwire, but I don't know that I'd go out of my way to pay full price for it.",N
2136,"Great location, reputable name... but far too rundown of a hotel to be considered 4-star.  We've stayed here a few times (and on both occasions our needs were met for what we were looking for), but each time it just seems to be ""okay"".  Because of that, I would rate their Chicago property a generous 3 stars. On the other hand, I really wish I could review their international locations. The properties in the Middle East (Dubai Festival City, Abu Dhabi) are beyond 4-star service, facilities and amenities - definitely a well-deserved 4 stars.  I would rate the property in Dubai at nothing less than FIVE. But then again... the United Arab Emirates would surpass even the biggest critic's expectations! Overall a superb hotel branch to give and get points with.  We have been happy with InterContinental hotels for our go-to or last minute hotel needs, and their international properties are spot on.",N
2679,"Forget yoga class. If you want to relax without breaking a sweat, book a room at The James. OK, so yoga is a bit easier on the wallet than a stay at this hotel, but I was relaxed as soon as I walked into our room. The employees are friendly and helpful, the room was spacious, and the location is perfect. There's a spa conveniently located in the hotel, but if you want to save some money the great Kiehl's bath products, rainfall showerhead, and comfy robe and slippers will do just fine. Also, skip the pricey in-room pantry and bar items - Trader Joe's is right across the street. If you feel like getting out and exploring the city or want to cruise down the lake shore path, the hotel offers complimentary Paul Frank bicycles for guests. But, trust me, you will not want to leave the comfort of this hotel.",N
5467,"I reserved a block of rooms for out of town guests for my recent wedding. The hotel staff was really great to work with. Rosie contacted me a week or so before the wedding to make sure she had all the info to pass on to the guests. I was a little concerned the suite I booked would be too small for the bridal party to use to get dressed so I e-mailed Rosie, she said she would make sure I was put in the largest junior suite, no problem! The room was beautiful and plenty spacious. The guests loved the location. I think it has a perfect combination of boutique/smallish feel, without seeming quaint or shabby. Would give 5 stars if the price ($179 per night) could have been knocked down just a bit! Otherwise, no complaints.",N
29,"So get this yelpers....I had the WORSE flying experience this past October(09) from SFO to Ohare...I'll yelp that botchjob in a sec, but anywhoo, I called the hotel after landing and mentioned that I was just making sure all was well, due to EVERYTHING ELSE going wrong that day. And when I get to the Tremont, ya wanna know what happened? "" You sounded so stressed out on the phone earlier we upgraded your room"" Pimp. Nice. I didn't even know they had rooms that large..and they got Ditka's to take our order at closing, and the hotel delivered our food to our door.In fact they pretty much spoiled us our whole visit(they even played gatekeeper for an annoying relative of mine..we of course tipped them for it) I love these bitches.See you in october 2010!",N
4642,"Central to any place you might want to walk to in Chicago, the Felix is a great base-camp for any adventures you're planning to have. It is certified Silver LEED status, which also makes you feel good that about Felix's commitment to the environment. The rooms are small, but well designed. The only lacking component is a spacious closet, so if I had stayed for a week or longer, I would have grown tired not having enough space to hang clothes. On the other hand, the bed is the most comfortable one I have ever slept in at a hotel and the shower is well designed and doesn't take forever to heat up. The bar is a great place to relax, though they could bump up their selection some - the night I went down to relax they only had 3 beer offerings. Another big plus - Absolutely free internet service, which was fast. Also a plus, no annoying login process each time you connect! Next time I head to Chicago, I'm calling Felix.",N
4844,I stayed in one of the new rooms and I loved it!!! Great experience. I used the word of the day from Facebook and got a discount for parking!! Great!!!,Y
1336,"We stayed here on the weekend of the Chicago Marathon with our 1 year old.  The staff were super nice, and our room was spacious with a separate area for a crib.  The hotel is in a great location within walking distance to excellent shopping, dining, scenery, and attractions. The nicest part was the hotel had a special toy for our son and provided us with a care package for him that had baby lotions, wipes, diapers, etc.  Beautiful hotel and we will stay here again when we return to Chicago.",N
635,"Reasonable rates.  Friendly to families.  Great location.  Beds were very comfortable and the shower was HOT!  Down the street from a grocery store, and several other cheap dining options.   Market House, the in hotel restaurant was very nice, a bit upscale but not prohibitive, and very welcoming to children.  We would stay here again.",N
4096,"This hotel should be used only for business/conference type events cause I don't think it will satisfy any of the needs of a casual traveler. I stayed here 1 night, and my experience kinda blew. I was supposedly being ""upgraded"" to a better room because I have status with Hyatt, but if the room I got was my upgrade, i'd HATE to see what my original room looked like. Small, uncomfortable, sterile, uninviting setting throughout the hotel. The main lobby is actually very appeasing to the eyes, with waterfalls and high ceilings. The service was decent, and I have no complaints here. If you're looking for a hotel to relax at, this isn't the spot. Its loud and busy typically, with business people and conventioners.",N
3629,"The finest hotel in Chicago, my family has stayed here on several occasions when in the city. The hotel itself is extremely elegant, in fact regal. There is NO other place to stay in Chicago. Located on the Magnificent Mile, the Drake is walking distance to several amazing stores (think Gucci, Prada, etc.) as well as great restaurants and shopping. The hotel staff is extremely professional and courteous.",N
1793,"Hotel Allegro is beautiful.  I don't really have anything bad to say about the place.  We had our wedding there in August and it was more than we could ask for.  The staff there was super helpful, so kind and really went out of their way.  KT, the wedding coordinator, made the process so stress free.  She was there for every step and had all the answers.  We had an amazing wedding.  The ballroom is gorgeous, as is the rest of the hotel.  It was definitely the perfect place for us.",N
3013,"I booked the ""Marvelous Suite"" (corner of hotel; lake view) for the Air & Water show, and I've never paid happily paid so much for a hotel room in my life :)   I couldn't stop looking out the window at the absolutely gorgeous view. Notes: - If you want a coffeemaker or mini-fridge, you'll need to request one.   - Use the roll-down shades behind the bamboo ones to block AM light - Expect full elevators during busy periods - Large sink countertops are great for spreading out toiletries/etc - Bliss shampoo/conditioner/etc = delightful - Location is super convenient - Walls are a bit thin - Staff is very friendly, professional and accommodating As for the people complaining that the lobby is essentially a bar, you are clearly the folks who need a drink the most.",N
3256,"I stayed with my husband at the HRH last week (May 2007)  because the Hilton SCREWED up our reservations, only had smoking rooms, to which I said NO WAY, FIND ME A HOTEL, and everything was booked and finally the only thing left was a junior suite at the HRH.   And frankly, the suites are TRES COOL.  Much better I bet than the Hilton Suites (between Chicago and Dearborn I think!) So anyway, HRH is RIGHT on the bridge, very good location.  The decor outside is kinda crappy, but as soon as you go in, I feel like Kurt Cobain is gonna come greet us, Sheryl Crow will be singing a tune at the bar, and Bob Dylan will take our reservations.  Front desk was TOO attentive, offering us everything from late night munchies to things to do at 12:00 am in Chicago (that's when we finally go the room, thanks to the Hilton....).  When we got to the room, it was TRES swanky (there were two suites to a floor, so imagine the size!!!).  Amenities were normal to a regular room, although we WERE told about the fiasco regarding the mini bar, so we just opted for not even opening it.  Beds were fantastic, bathroom was VERY big for a big city hotel, and all in all, I'd totally return. Very hip.  Much fun if you're into music.  Very young. Very me.",N
4534,"This is a very nice place to stay. The hotel my not be the newest in town, but it is very beautiful and grand. The hotel's rustic look adds to the beauty and makes the experience great. This hotel is very well-kept and the service is excellent. It's also located very conveniently in the city.",N
2204,"I've stayed at the Intercontinental many times and have had almost universally positive experiences. You absolutely cannot beat the location - it is super central and the higher floors have a great view of Michigan Ave., the Chicago river and the Wrigley Building. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and the rooms are nice and spacious.",N
4564,"I have stayed at the PH for about 10 years to attend an annual conference here.  It's always been a good hotel.  Great location,  Rooms are usually fairly nice, though they do seem worn out.  Well, they're working on that now.  RIGHT now.  I flew in last night from California, did not get to bed until very late. This morning at 7:00 (Note: that's 5 a.m. Pacific time, where I am coming from), I wake up to the sounds of hammering and what sounds like a router drill on the other side of the wall at the head of my bed.  No chance of sleep.  I called the front desk.  They were apologetic, but the hotel's full, they can't change my room until later.  So be warned: this hotel's under construction, and if you value SLEEP, you should ask for a room as far from the construction as possible.",N
2424,"What I want in a hotel might differ from most people. I would much rather have an interesting hotel, grand lobby, a sense of history, etc.. and a small but adequate room rather than a boring hotel with spacious rooms (Yes I'm looking right at you Embassy Suites). The Hilton Chicago is everything you would want in a classic hotel. - Scenic location - Amazing architecture   - Humongous lobby   - History oozing out of the walls like blood out of the elevators in The Shining Scenes from The Fugitive, My Best Friends Wedding, Primal Fear, Home Alone 2 and Road to Perdition were all filmed at the Hilton Chicago. They also boast that every president since FDR has walked through their doors. If it's good enough for Dr. Richard Kimble and Gerald Ford shouldn't it be good enough for you? I don't want to forget about our room completely though, after all it's the only hotel room I've had with two bathrooms and that comes in very handy when getting ready in the morning. It's just when I'm traveling the last thing I want to do is stay in the hotel room. I'd much rather be out experiencing the city or at the very least having a drink in the lobby. The Hilton Chicago has two bars that stay open late. Kitty O'Sheas and the Lakeside Green Lounge. If you want to watch a game or news hit the lounge otherwise you're better off at Kitty O'Sheas a faux Irish pub. Also if you want a nice free view find your way to the roof of the hotel for views of Lake Michigan, Grant Park, Navy Pier and the entire city behind you.",N
1580,"We got in really late but there was still someone there to check us in. He put us at a room next to the elevator which was not the greatest so i'm giving it a 4 star. And the shower head was contemporary and all but it was an overhead shower. I felt like i was forced to shower and wash my hair. It was like an overhead waterfall. I wish there was a bathtub it being the king view room. We had a great view, grand comfy bed, and even bath and body soaps, lotions, shampoo and conditioner! There was also free wifi , and a nice flat screen on the wall. I am surprised it's a 3 star hotel, it really should be higher!",N
3170,One of the best hotels I've staid at.  Cool rooms and awesome lakefront view.  Threw a New Years party in one of their suits.,N
299,"So I was a little skeptical about ""The City Suites"" since there was mixed reviews on the various sites around, but it was to where I wanted to go and none of the reviews I read contained neither the word ""junkie"" or ""prostitute"" like some of the other hotels, so I decided I would give it a shot. Checking in was a speedy process in which we were given the skinny about the parking (less than a block away), check out time (11 AM), and breakfast (7 - 10). The first clerk was ok, not terribly friendly, but not rude or hostile. Our room was a nice surprise. The bedroom was separated from the living area, which was nice. The bathroom had checkered tiles on the walls with cubed windows which added more character to the hotel room . The room was very clean and fully stocked. The only downside to my stay was slow internet speed. When I spoke to the first front desk attendant, he seemed to have the attitude that everything was fine and I just needed to deal with it. Which is an OK answer for me. But, the evening manger Jeremy was very informative, telling me that the hotel was fully booked, he already had contacted ATT, and I wasn't the only guest to have mentioned this. That's how you handle a complaint. Jeremy the night manager was very courteous, funny, and informative. The hotel rooms are very descent for the money you're paying, but the service from the staff and attitude of the staff is what really makes you want to come back for another stay at the ""City Suites"".",N
5233,"The Ritz is so full of lustre!  They make me want to use the french spelling of words.The kind of people that can generally afford the Ritz are the kind of people that mind their own business, and I like that.  They do not smile at me as they walk by.  They leave me be.I really like how the staff knows all the guests first and last names.  Talk about custom service!  They're inquiries about  my background made me feel really special.The concierge makes great use of the internet so you do not have to.  How wonderful!  They can find anything you need on that crazy world wide web!  Oh, and the security guys...boy did they make me feel safe.  Being very sure to determine who was a guest and who was not for my safety.  Wow.Parking was $37.  Is that not to be expected though?  They take your car for you AND bring it back to you!  You can not beat that kind of hospitality.The Ritz still has its' sparkle!",Y
2611,"I agree with Tobey.  First few weeks of going when it first opened the staff was friendlier.  The last two times the door guy was very cocky! Yes, you have the power mighty door guy!  Its not that serious of a lounge for the door guy to act like the secret service.  aside from this however, i still prefer this lounge over a club so if you want to hang out with a friend after dinner and not pay to get in, this is a nice place.  The sushi is pretty good and the bar tender that use to work at fulton lounge is swift on her feet.  never leaves you dry!  So overall, go there early, plenty of parking, no cover charge, the music is pretty good and you can have a decent conversation without going deaf...the price for a glass of wine is acceptable for the glass size and they do have very good wine selections....their mango rolls are very very good!  Also, I like that they take pictures of their guests for their website and they actually post them. unlike other places they edit their pictures.  I must add, short people be warned, this place attracts tall model like people, if you dont like to feel clusterphobic then dont stay too long, or you'll have drunk giant women stumbeling on you as they dance to lounge music.   (hee hee)  it is entertaining though... oh yeah, hurray for this place, no more frat boys!  well, we'll wait a couple more months, you'll be seeing them come in with their flip flops.",N
3317,"Love the bar here.  The atmosphere is super chill and the bartenders are awesome.  They had killer specials on St. Pats including $7 carbombs, $6 Irish smashers, and $5 Guiness drafts.  They definitely know how to double pour a Guiness here..the head was poured to perfection.  We ordered the sliders, which for $12 was good, but not great.  They were served on a pretzel bun (good start), but they described them as being ""Kobe beef"" sliders and I just didn't find the quality of the burger to be at the same level of some other Kobe beef burgers I had in Chicago (Sweets & Savories has an incredible Kobe burger by the way).  Regardless, the service is superb, and drinks are strong, so will definitely be going back.",N
5349,"I like to stay in unique, one-of-a-kind hotels that give me a feel of the city/country I am in.  That was my only hesitation for choosing to stay at the Hampton Inn - a chain.  But we decided to go for it for 3 reasons... Location (walking distance to downtown, the river, Mag Mile and free trolley to Navy Pier), Free breakfast (huge choices and rotating hot entrees that changed each of the 6 days we were there), Pool and jacuzzi and small, but adequate fitness center (to relax after a busy day and keep up with our exercise routines).  We got that and so much more.  This renovated hotel has a lobby that made me forget it is a chain - tastefully done in Frank Lloyd Wright style - beautiful!  Every staff person we met - front desk, conceirge, kitchen, housekeeping were so friendly and helpful.  The room was very clean and the bed very comfortable (true, the firetrucks can wake you up now and then...) The convenient and free business center made it easy to print our boarding passes and keep up with the kid's homework and the free in-room wifi was great. Very reasonable price for the location, value, and quality you receive.  I wanted to live here!  Now my only hesitation is telling everyone how great it is and risk not having a vacancy next time I go to Chicago!",Y
2771,This was an awesome hotel!! We spent New Years Eve weekend there 2010/2011 and had a wonderful relaxing time.  My boyfriend proposed on New Years Eve and the hotel was just perfect to relax all day on New Years and enjoy  David Burke's Steakhouse that night which was incredible - such a unique and delicious menu - definitely try the bacon appetizer.  We will make sure the next time we are in Chicago we will stay at the James!!!,N
3249,"We reserved a block of rooms at the Hard Rock for our April wedding. While we were passed around to a few different salespeople over the 8 months or so that we spent planning, everyone was very helpful and friendly. We locked down a rate of $149 per night for king rooms, which is a pretty amazing price for that location.  As the husband (like most of our friends) is an architect, we appreciated the fact that the hotel is housed in the historic (and gorgeous) Carbon and Carbide Building. We really wanted our out of town guests to experience the awesomeness of Chicago, and the hotel's location made that extremely easy. We were given a tower suite at the same rate, and the room was HUGE, which made getting ready on the big day very easy. It's true that some of the finishes aren't exactly the highest quality, but you know, it's not the Ritz. The staff was very courteous and helpful, though we did have a couple of glitches. The first had to do with the gift bags we had made for our guests. Originally I had been told that we could have them handed out at check in, and as long as they were all the same and not personalized (i.e., specific bags to specific people) they would do it for free. A week before the wedding I found out that they had changed their policy and now would only distribute bags to the rooms at a $5 per bag fee. They finally agreed to hand them out for free as they had originally promised, though I would imagine we were an exception.   The other snag had to do with the bar- I had spoken (via email) with the bar manager about bringing our guests there after the wedding, which was to end at midnight on Sunday. We weren't going to pre order anything or reserve space, just offer a place for people to hang out, which the bar manager said was fine.  When we got back to the hotel it was close to 1, and the bar was closed (it's supposed to be open till 2).  But everything was solved by a brief talk with the front desk manager who allowed us to hang out in the lobby with the beers we brought back from the wedding (classy, no?). When we FINALLY made it to our room for the night, we were greeted by champagne, chocolate-covered strawberries, and fancy bottled water. Nice touch.",N
1847,"I really liked this hotel.  They definitely have consistent theme at the W.  You have to trudge through the nightclubby lobby to check in.  If you're checking in late after a long flight, that can be annoying. I literally thought I was hallucinating in the elevator, but once checked into my room I was pleasantly surprised.  The space was, clean, minimal and comfortable.  While l loved the bathroom, the sink was a design failure.  I spilled a ton of water out of the basin, it was a mess!   The lobby is a great area to hang out and the architecture is stunning.  Loved how they embraced it while keeping the decor funky in  classic W fashion.  I found the service to be very helpful and accommodating as well.",N
3608,"I was just here this past weekend with my husband visiting my sister.  As we booked The Drake online via Orbitz, he asked me where I would like to stay and I jokingly said, ""The Drake"", assuming that it was expensive.  He said, sure we can, it's only $84.  In amazement, I said book it!  I've always thought this place was too high class and out of our price range, but apparently not!   I'm an interiors and architecture lover, and being able to stay there and check out the place was fun for me.  I definitely felt like I was living in the 20's and living the life of high class luxury.  Roaming the hallways and peeking into the lounge and restaurant areas was definitely a time warp.  I'd see people dancing to some jazzy tunes and dressed their finest delicately eating their dinner.   The details of the place was beautiful!  There were so many beautiful fixtures throughout the hotel, and I'm sure I didn't even see the half of it.  As for our room, we had a king size bed that was so very comfortable!  I normally have a hard time sleeping at different locations, but here, there was no problem at all!  There was a huge flat screen for your entertainment pleasure with a generous sized desk and mini bar all within reach.  There was a book in the room that documented The Drake's history and it was really neat to see all the big names of the past that stayed here.  I can see why kings and queens would stay here.  There is so much decadence, charm and history to this place that it makes you want to check it out.   I would definitely stay here again!  And I would love to try their restaurants here too!",N
1298,"Most of the first afternoon of my neuroscience conference was spent running frantically through the convention center trying desperately to pick up a mobile signal (and cursing lack thereof) whilst checking out posters, bumping into friends, and juggling the week's worth of program books, so it's possible I looked slightly disheveled when I stepped into the elevator at the Ritz-Carlton. Mind you, I wasn't staying at the Ritz-Carlton, but a non-neuro friend of mine happened to be there for a wedding, and I wanted to squeeze in a quick visit.  I had her room number, so I was planning on just nonchalantly walking in and heading up like a normal person going to visit a friend in a hotel, but they have to make it so confusing for us plebians!  The lobby is on the 12th floor.  Who does that?? There was a fancy family in the first elevator with me, and it was clear that they were not pleased about having to share the same air with someone in a 2004 H&M coat carrying two bags, hair in a messy ponytail.  Fancy dad said to fancy mom, ""you know what I noticed, these are the same elevators as at the Ritz in New York!"" and really, it was all I could do not to jump in with ""OMG I KNOW, isn't that greeeeaat??? I can't tell you how pleased I am to see that the old R-C is consistent in their design."" When we switched to the 2nd elevator, they rolled their eyes and fancy mom said to fancy dad, ""you know, at the Ritz in New York, you can't get in the elevator unless you have a key."" It was then that I really wished I'd been dressed like a prostitute instead of a harried neuroscientist.  Just for fun, you know.  A little Pretty Woman quote fest, perhaps?   ""Oh honey, I've got a runner in my pantyhose!  I'm not wearing pantyhose!"" My friend's room was totally gorgeous, with a view of the lake and the ferris wheel.  It was all done up in decadent periwinkle blue (just like at the NY R-C, I imagine) with a giant luxurious bed and a 2-sink bathroom that was bigger than some NYC apartments (or the Blue Banana, if you're still with me and my PW references).   One day when I'm rich I'm going to come back to the Chicago R-C and I'm going to get in that elevator like a pro and with that awful fancy family watching, I'm going to hit the f-ing PH button.",N
1011,"I ended up at Amalfi because one of the bigger river hotels messed up my reservations.  Lets just say it was classic bait and switch, not so renaissance I'd say.  Great place, great free evening appetizers and drinks and the staff were extremely nice.  The breakfast buffet on every floor was a great touch and very convenient for the working professional - this so-called professional was back home for a conference.  This is probably a redundant review as seeing that everyone seems to write about the same thing but I can attest as well to all the great hype.  Love the location, love the hotel.",N
5412,"We stayed at The Whitehall this past weekend. While it could use some freshening up in the lobby etc. we found it to be a perfectly nice hotel. The staff was pleasant and efficient and the rooms were well appointed and clean.The best parts of the hotel are the lounge, which is nicely rehabbed and very charming, the beds (super comfy) and the bathrooms which have been most recently renovated. We had breakfast in the adjacent restaurant the next morning and found good service and fresh food cooked well.I give the Whitehall 4 stars primarily because of the VALUE of the place. We paid $99 on a Groupon promotion and that INCLUDED valet parking and continental breakfast. What a deal! Even without the promotion, the available rates are great for a charming old hotel on the Gold Coast. We would definitely stay there again.",Y
107,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for four nights in June 2011. If you are looking for huge space and luxurious amenities, this hotel is not for you. If you have kids, this hotel is not for you. If you are looking for a place to sleep and shower, this is for you. Great location and great value. Short walk to CTA red line and within walking distance to many fun bars, restaurants, shops, and the lakefront. There were a few small problems: our intial room lacked air conditioning, so we were transferred to a second floor room that was probably arranged for handicapped persons so there was an open shower, no fan, etc. I am sure the free breakfast was great, bit we never awoke early enough to enjoy it! I would definitely stay here again!",N
5549,"Excellent hotel in the Loop, Chicago. Friendly and attentive staff. Clean and well decorated in a modern and hip style. Free breakfast and internet. Since this area of the loop is primarily a business district, it was surprisingly quiet during the evenings and weekends. If you want a more frantic environment stay in the Mag Mile area. The hotel is about a 5 minute walk to the Sears (watchoo talkin about Willis) Tower where bus/trolley tours depart . Don't pay $70 for a cab from O'Hare. Simply lake the blue line to Washington exit. It costs $2.25 and took about 40 minutes. From the station to the hotel was about a ten minute walk. Exc - Decor, cleanliness, free wifi, location Good - Breakfast Ave - None Poor - None",N
1045,Great stay in Chicago. Rooms ample size for the city. Great beds and modern decor.Location very good. Service very good. Weather was not great our weekend so we spent more time in hotel or close to hotel. Highly recommend.,N
141,"I live in the suburbs and my BF and I were going to the city for a night on the town and decided to get a room for the evening so we didn't have to worry about driving back.  We looked at a few options and the location and price were the big selling points.  We have stayed at The Hilton and Hard Rock and the Whitehall was about 30% less.  We booked about 3 days in advance and it was about $150 for the night.  The hallways were narrow and the front lobby and elevators were realitivly small.  I already had the prenotation the rooms were going to be tiny, but to my suprise the rooms were really spacious!  Super comfy bed with a bear skin blaket throw. The room was bigger than The Hard Rock and the Hilton.  There wasnt a fridge but most hotels downtown dont have refrigerators. The location was su-purb! It was about a 2 block walk to the red line.  We partied that evening in Lincoln Park  and it was about a $12 cab ride back to the hotel.",N
1610,"I stayed here for a week and it was awesome... The good thing about the hotel is primarily the location. You are at the downtown (near michigan street) and all the day/nightlife awesomeness that is Chicago is around you. Public transportation, restaurants, tourist attractions, bars, clubs, weird people and you're on the chicago river. Also, the rooms are fairly spacious, but older. Oh and Batman Dark Knight was filmed at this location. The down side is it is pricey and there are only a couple elevators that service the hotel - so mornings are a pain in the ass to get up and down from say the 30th floor to the lobby. The service is ok, but come on - this place is ideal for a Chicago experience. Go Check it out...",N
5608,"I go to Chicago a fair amount on business and have stayed at the Westin several times. Its a comfortable place and a convenient location (House of Blues is right next door), but there are some annoyances. I actually booked my next stay at a different hotel. I'd certainly stay at the Westin again but at the moment it's not my first choice. First, some good stuff. The staff is great -- very friendly and professional. If you need a cab, the doorman is good and aggressive at getting you set up. The lobby and room decor are great, the bed very comfortable, the rooms spacious, and the shower double-headed. So far so good. The problems start with the TV. I fired my TV at home years ago, so this a TV on the road is quite a novelty, so I'd like it to work and have some channels. Despite it being a nice big LCD, they apparently don't have much in the way of cable. Yes HBO, but no Comedy Central, and some stations don't have sound. Kinda defeats the purpose. I have to have Internet access too. No wireless in the rooms, but that's would be passable except that the past two times I went, the Ethernet cord had a broken tip & kept slipping out. To their credit they fixed it when I pointed it out, but housekeeping should be trained to check these things and proactively make sure it's OK. Oh, and here's a tip, Westin: snagless Cat 5 cable has been around forever. Give it a try. Room service is good if you get the right thing -- they have a baked red fish that's excellent. But the cheeseburger is truly awful. You can get sushi delivered -- very cool -- but the one time I ate downstairs at the sushi bar, it was questionable (I did a separate review on that). The breakfast buffet has some tasty items but is far too small, and there's a disappointing lack of fresh waffles or omelettes. The workout room is a bit small but not bad unless there's a crowd, but there's no pool or hot tub, which I'd love. There have been some other little annoyances, like a drippy faucet, and the fact that road noise leaks through the window enough to bug me. Overall, it's not a bad place to stay on business, but I'm hoping to find better.",N
1194,I have been living here for two weeks. I get fresh towels and sheets everyday... Without asking. The room is always cleaned daily and smells fresh. I hope to stay here again. The down side is the trip downtown. I wish there was more around the hotel to do.,N
3087,"Location is wonderful with fabulous views of the pier from some rooms.   Vibrant trendy lobby area with attentive staff.  Seemed like the music was always pulsing and fashionable people milling around looking to socialize.  I really enjoyed the lounge chairs outside facing the lake.  Restaurant in the lobby area was quite alright, and not too expensive mediterranean influenced fare. Rooms are decently sized and very comfortable linens and beds.  The standard flat screen tv and well stocked mini fridge.  Very nice little set of Bliss products (I see people ebaying these for $10-20!).  facewash, soap, body butter, shampoo, conditioner.  One major drawback for me was the very open design of the bathroom.  Looks cute, but I found it icky.  The bathroom has shutters that open out into the living space and a door that doesn't really close but is just a hollowcore door that slides.  It seems to be a trend, and it's one I don't like.  Maybe I'm too uptight.  I don't enjoy hearing every minutiae of my travelmate's hygiene routines and I don't want them to hear mine. Overall though, enjoyable stay.  Would book again at the right price.",N
3255,"Excellent little bordering-on-the-boutique hotel. I believe it has 300-something beds, so technically it's not a boutique but it has that feel. It's located in the Carbon & Carbide building (which was built to resemble a green-glass champagne bottle- so cool!) and is in the perfect location downtown. It's definitely not as 'hard rock' as you would think. It's more minimalist/ dark modern with accents of rock-n-roll.  They do have meeting rooms which are very, very nice for your next board meeting (top of the line a/v stuff). The sleeping rooms are very cool, sleek and outfitted nicely with soundsystems, Aveda products, etc.  And reasonably priced!  Great place to stay in the city.",N
5813,We got a good deal on this hotel through hotwire but it would have been worth it to go outside of downtown.  There's no view from any angle and the hotel has only an outdoor pool.  We had to pay an extra $15 per day to walk next door to an indoor pool since it was winter out.  This was listed as a 4 star hotel but it lacked a number of amenities I expected from a hotel with that rating.  Parking our car in the hotel garage cost almost as much as the hotel room itself.  I've stayed at the Knickerbocker which is a true 4 star hotel and there's no comparison.  This is more like a 2 1/2 or 3 star hotel at best.,Y
4762,"As I said in previous review for their spa ,wow...i couldn't ask for more..got my self an upgrade to the exec level and it happen to be a huge suite..did not expect that..was thinking of a 1 room  but no...huge living room with a nice bar, 12 chairs dinning room table..i know right? 2 baths ....i felt like a king , there was a slight view of state street but because i was in meeting all day long didn't had time to enjoy as much as i wanted. went to their gym with my free pass from my massage they i had and i was in shock..boy do they have a huge gym..i have been in many hotels..this one is one of the most luxurios..i liked their treadmills, you have a tv on each machine and i think they had like 20 treadmills mixed with elipticals bikes and some other cardio equipment. like the spa , the receptionist got me a tour and explained all the details , etc..i must feel important for those. anyway after fitness i asked the concierge where can i go for some drinks and she gave me some good options and good discounts too ...overall as you can see my experience was a WOW FACTOR one..",Y
5533,"Definitely spent more money on this hotel room than I usually do, but I was being picky about location & I'm traveling with my dog. Very pet friendly! No restrictions on the weight or breed (which is awesome because I have a pitbull, which can sometimes be an issue). There's a pet station outside equipped with bags to pick up messes.  I'm staying Sunday - Tuesday: using a AAA discount, Sunday night was $152 & Monday was $215. If you have AAA discount, use it - I saved like $40 & who isn't a fan of saving money? Oh, and I booked the hotel about 10 hours before we arrived. Free Internet?! WHOO HOO! Maybe I'm just cheap so I never get to experience this, but that is oh-so-awesome in my world. Hence...sitting in the hotel room after an 18 hour car ride...and I decided I was happy enough to write a review instead of sleep. I can smoke in the room. No worries, they have non-smoking rooms as well, but I am such a fan of smoking in my hotel rooms so I am LOVING it here :) Bonus: Air conditioning was all ready on & it's simple to control to make it cooler. BOOYAH! The TV is nice - fridge, microwave, coffee pot & work station in the room. The bed seems comfy enough. While Philippe's review made me roll with laughter, his comment is legit. The shower is a little awkward! Though it may be entertaining for some situations ;) The room is clean. The staff is friendly. While breakfast sounds delicious, I can't imagine I'll ever be up early enough for it. Check-in isn't until 3PM, but they do try to honor early check-ins. Check-out is at noon.   Parking - there is a garage behind the hotel. Make sure you get a ticket & you get it validated by the hotel. By doing this, you may come & go as you please & it'll be free. Without the validation, you will have to pay. It's located on Madison so you actually need to drive past the hotel, take a right on Washington, a right on Wells and then a right on Madison. It's right behind the hotel, but there is an unloading zone in-between the garage & the hotel if you need/want it. The low down on the vending machines: First floor has snacks, ice cream & soda. Second floor has soda & snacks. All other floors have soda machines. All the soda vending machines are Coke, but there is one PEPSI machine on the 6th floor. It's not located where the other machines are on different floors - the Pepsi machine is tucked away where the ice machine would be on the 6th floor (if they had an ice machine). The ice machines are on various floors - it is listed in that space what floors have ice. There is also a recycling station located by the ice machines. YaY recycling! I think all the room service is out-sourced. The pizza, for example, is from a chain restaurant (that I don't support), but you shouldn't be coming to Chicago to eat chain pizza anyways! Do yourself a favor & hit one of the places recommended on Yelp :) It's nice & dark in the room so it's going to be easy taking a nap at 5PM...also a plus for me cause I love napping! This is the second time I've stayed with La Quinta (the first time in New Orleans) & I am pretty sure this trip has solidified me being a fan for life.",N
3549,"Although the hotel has done a revamp and really is working on things, the new Sky Lounge at the top is out of place and awkward for the concept. Too bright and unclassy lighting, as well as the presence of children, ruin the concept of the sexy sky high bar. Ambience is important people!",N
3020,"What's not to love about a W? This Lakeshore location is close to the Navy Pier and Michigan Avenue shopping. The rooms are a good size with plenty of storage space for suitcases. They have bliss products and a well stocked bathroom. The only thing that was a little weird was the shutters on the bathroom. Other than that, the rooms are stylish and relaxing. You can have a city view with Sears Tower or the Navy Pier and Lake Michigan. They have complimentary cookies, water, and apples in the lobby and you can sign up to use an Acura if you need to get around town. The only drawback is it does get pretty packed at night with the bar/club or if there are events going on upstairs. The lobby can get crowded and the elevators can get pretty full. Other than that, a solid W that I would stay in again when in Chi-town.",N
4520,"I stayed here literally every other week for practically a year before i moved to Chicago permanently in April of 07. Its new renovations reveal the true beauty of this architectural masterpiece. The building has great history and excellent service. kind of a pricey place to stay, but hey when its on the companies charge card, go for it !",N
5632,"Nice hotel. Pretty good service, but their food was below par for a Westin. We were there all week. The room service (I ordered stir fry) food was cold and salty - had to send it back. The banquet food was good except the meats - dry. We had to wait 40 minutes for sushi in the lobby, and so on. There are a pile of great restaurants around there - that would be my suggestion.",N
2512,"Have stayed at the Hilton quite a few times (for trade shows and otherwise) and the staff has been average, the building beautiful and location just fine if you don't  mind walking or cabbing. It is a Chicago institution, that's for sure.  It's not going to be a chic hotel; it's in an old building with smaller rooms. (It's bigger than the Allerton!) I do have to say the food at the restaurants is overpriced for what you get and the internet charge is outrageously high. Most hotels aren't even charging anymore and Chgo H and T needs to get with the times. Otherwise, we'll stay here again and always request a lake view room.",N
477,"Embassy suites has some nice rooms with decent beds.  With the suites you get the seperate room which isnt much use in Chicago since you shouldnt be spending much time in the room anyway.  There is free breakfast here and a managers drink hour which isnt worth much either.  The breakfast is below average and you have to wait in a line across the lobby to get a free drink.   The location of this hotel is great with plenty of great restaurants near by and very close to Michigan ave, and the Navy Pier.   Dont plan on parking your car here since it is about $50/night try to find parking near by.   If you stay here skip the free breakfast and head over to Yokes which is awesome, also go to Joes steak seafood and crab for a great dinner",N

5759,"Um, yeah.  I stayed here once while in the process of moving from New England.  Thought to myself ""well, how can one go wrong with a name like Heart of Chicago and a AAA recommendation?""  Well, my friends, the answer is - you can go very wrong.   The place is run down (if it was ever run up I will never know) with small rooms offering shabby furnishings.  The glass block window in the bathroom looks out to the alley, where on the night I was there, a 2 hour yelling argument between a pimp and his ho echoed into my room.  The TV reception was spotty, and I only got 3 stations in well enough to be able to watch.  The heat was broken, but not in the ""off"" position.  Even though this was January, the heat blew on high and full force to such a degree I had to open the only two windows and sleep on top of the covers (maybe not such a bad idea anyway).  It would not turn off, even for the maintenance guy the next morning.  I felt like beef jerky when I woke up.   The folks in the parking lot outside were raucous and big partiers.  I am not certain if they were guests of the motel or not, but noone seemed to complain or shut them up, as it went on for 3 hours. The included breakfast was a single box of Dunkin Donuts and a carafe of coffee.   My thought about all of this is, if AAA can ""highly recommend"" this place, maybe its time to question their level of standards.",N
5724,"Nice hotel, but honestly I've had better experiences with the brand. The ups: -comfy beds -plenty of towels -pretty good price for location -good decor -key card access elevators -Great food districts in walking distance (randolph st, french market) -free wireless internet The downs: -outlets in the room were loose, including the bathroom -drone of constant highway traffic noise from outside. In the pits: -horrendously rank homeless guy dropping bricks in the first floor lobby bathroom, walked out without anyone even approaching him. ~$40 valet parking (what????) I can almost get my monthly pass for that much where I'm from!",N
2178,Stayed in the Historic Tower which has a beautifully ornate restaurant and swimming pool. The rooms are vey dark and not to my taste but the room service was responsive. Plentiful buffet breakfast ($27) and the hotel lobby has a Starbucks. The hotel is very conveniently located on Michigan Ave. 15 min walk to Macy's downtown or 15 min walk to Water Tower Place. Plenty of restaurants and bars within a 5-10 min walk.,N
1092,"View from my room on the 31st floor: most of Chicago, plus Lake Michigan.  Hey, I could get used to this.  Too bad I was in the hotel room, and awake, for maybe 3 hours total.  Wait, actually, that's a good thing, but for other reasons. Huge room, separate shower and bath (and makeup vanity, but I didn't use that), nice LG flatscreen wall-mounted, very decent bed. Downsides: bad pillows (I HATE soft and squishy pillows); shower had one of those ceiling-mounted rainfall shower heads, which look awesome but don't function that well; there was a black extension cord just running along the floor to power a lamp.  None of these are big things, but they are enough to warrant 4 stars instead of 5.",N

He stood inside the door and waited for us to get drenched on our way in then said ""lobby is upstairs.""  Front desk receptionist was a jerk as well.  The door to our balcony did not work and our TV was broken...staff sent someone up who did nothing to resolve either.  Didn't think the rooms were that special aside from the problems.  Overrated hotel, the club makes for a very busy/crowded environment on weekends, would not recommend.",N
4136,"Priceline sent us here when we booked through Priceline (name your own price) and this stay was definitely worth it!  Though the sheer size of this place is enough to make you feel like a small fish (2100 rooms, what?!) the room we stayed in was quite large and spacious.   Linens were clean and crisp, beds were comfortable and downy, and our room was SUPER quiet and dark.  Granted, we were in the west wing, and had a nice view into the neighboring business high rise.  If you're like me, you'll spend half your time in the morning watching all the people laboring away, and be glad you're not them.   The staff was very helpful and the woman at the check in counter supplied me with a map and a detailed list of neighboring parking garages.  Valet is 50 dollars here.  Though the thought of unlimited in/out privileges is appealing, spare yourself a bunch of cash and park at one of the other spots.  Millennium garage, directly behind Hyatt and next to the little grocery store, is 30/overnight.  Its indoor, clean, and safe!  There are reduced rates for being there 12 hours or less. The hotel is also located very close to the infamous Michigan Avenue, where you will find the art museum, millennium park, numerous fancy-pants boutiques and stores.  Plenty of sights to see, lots of people to watch, and just a quick walk back to your room. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay here.",N
2504,"This is a great hotel to stay at in Chicago if you can afford their prices. The room we had was excellent, the view was great, and the food (when we got it) was good.

5085,"Shady...I get the whole elitism, there are no seats, and drinks are expensive as hell thing, but the Victor should be more wary of who they do business with. We went here on March 13 to see J*Davey. The doors opened at 9. We were forced to listen to some crappy, unannounced opening act that took the stage sometime after 11. By 1:15 AM, I'm asking the bar staff when they headliner is going to make an appearance. They tell me the band already played. So I had to let the staff know that J*Davey was the main attraction. They said they didn't know a thing about it and had nothing to do with it.At 1:20 a fight breaks out. There's only so much time you can keep people drinking and standing and waiting before things get unruly. Once that fire is put out, only THEN does J*Davey take the stage. Only to play for about 20 minutes, until the house lights come on and it's time to go. I think they got to perform about six songs. The night was a complete rip off. Someone must have gotten a pretty decent cut of the bar revenue that night given how long the crowd was were kept waiting. I understand Privileged Media was the promoter for this event and I blame them for things getting out of hand. It's not entirely the Victor's fault, but they should be more proactive when hosting an event.",Y
4174,"I had a very good stay at the Hyatt.  The room was modern, clean and very comfortable.  I had a couple of questions for the staffa and they were all answered pleasantly.  The entire hotel is huge featureing restaurants, bars, conference rooms, coffee and gift shops there are staff members everywhere to assist you.  This is a very busy hotel as it is very centrally located to the Loop, Navy Pier, Michigan avenue and everything Chicago has to offer.  There were only a few problems though. They made an error with our reservation and it took them a very long time to resolve it.  They did clear things up.  It also took a very long time to get our car from valet when we checked out.  Amidst all the small problems the Hyatt more than made up for the minor problems that I encountered.",N
748,"I love staying here whenever I come to Chicago. The service is great, the rooms are fabulous and I have never had a bad experience. We got a room at the last minute after hating our room at the Omni hotel down the street. They were able to get us two adjoining rooms, one for my parents and one for my brother and I to share. The rooms were spotless, the beds were fabulous and the staff was fantastic. Plus, it is a dog friendly hotel! How great is that? We had breakfast in the morning downstairs and were regulars at the bar in the lobby! Can't wait to go back soon!",N
2233,This place is great. We had a problem last time we were suppose to stay. They made up for it this time it great they up graded are room to a penthouse on the highest floor. It had 2 bathrooms. It was faboulous. I would defiently stay here again. Great view of all of Chicago.,N
4584,"I interviewed the general manager at the Palmer House. His friendliness and the friendliness of all staff that I encountered is why I'm writing this review. I haven't stayed at the Palmer House yet, but it is now on my shortlist for my wedding accommodation. Chicagoans...well, we love our city... and mention of the Palmer House gives us little sentimental heart tingles b/c of its deep Chicago historic ties. The newly renovated floors have stunning carpeting (deep brown with brightly colored, modern swirls of peacock aesthetic) with black/white photos of classic stars (Sinatra, Clark Gable, probably Ella Fitzgerald, etc.). Check out the 8th floor! And the furniture! Stunning vintage pieces! Bright greens, blues, etc. straight out of glamorous history! Beautifully photogenic! I'm usually the biggest fan of hotels like The W, The Wit, etc. and I so dig this hotel, b/c I think it fits right into that category without selling out its history.",N
2814,"This hotel is pretty good for travel on leisure, especially if you are trying to save money on a group, but it falls short on business travel. Basically, I care about three things when travelling: 1. Free Internet 2. A good gym 3. A good breakfast The internet here both cost money and was difficult to set up. The gym was OK for a hotel, but still not great. The breakfast seemed pretty good though. My suite was fine and actually quite large. Overall, it's definitely a good value, especially for downtown Chicago, but I don't think I'll be coming back here when I'm in town on business.",N

370,stay somewhere else. idk how these pics got here but the place looks nothing like the pic.  0 stars is more like it. our room was right next to the rail system. it ran all night. i would not even take off my shoes my whole stay.,N
346,"The only thing which justifies the forced one star us that this place is right off Michigan Ave. There were large roaches in my neighbors room, which made me worry. The piece of what looked like rat's skin in my own rattled me but I was still thinking this is just a hole to crash in at night. I did not freak out till I found that my room's door was not locking at all. I had already left my valuables and gone out running once before I realized it. And I when I realized it, I was on my way for an appointment. When it became clear that I had to choose between leaving my door wide ajar as the handyman fixed it and being 1.5 hours late for my appointment I had just had enough. Plus by now I was convinced that the one thing one looks for in a hole-to-crash is safety, and there was no way I was going to feel safe at this place. I launched orbitz from my phone and booked the closest decent looking hotel, in this case The Essex Inn which was just a block further south. It turned out to be a much better place, at a better price than what I had booked my room at this Travelodge for. However, this was not the end of it. I got gangsta treatment from the guy (wearing the name tag ""Ken"") at the reception who banged pens and key cards at the desk, was staring at me and generally giving the attitude that he wanted to jump across the counter and grab my neck, and came close to mouthing obscenities and tried big time intimidation by staring. Good riddance to bad rubbish, and I am never going back to this shit hole.",N
157,"Stayed here in February for the Illinois Bar Exam.  All in all, not a bad place! Pros:  The food is great, the bathrooms (recently remodeled) were fabulous and the mini-bar is well stocked and the prices are not out of the ballpark.  Plus, they are undergoing a remodel and they have really worked hard to accentuate their space.  the building itself is not very large, with lots of twisty turny hallways, but they apportioned and accommodated it well.  Also, the gym is really complete as far as hotel gyms go. Cons:  It takes a bit for the staff to warm up to you.  They are brusque and professional, but it seems like you have to talk to them for several minutes before they start to be nice as well.  Also, it took the valet a long time to find my car.  Finally, about the re-model, I'd have liked them to follow through a bit more . For a 4 star hotel, there were too many visible wallpaper seams and other such aesthetic issues showing.   BUT, I would gladly stay here again.",N
739,"Spontaneity is my middle name. Ok.  I lied.  But I very recently had a spur of the moment getaway that was brief, yet very delightful.   The room was hot.  Like whew-eeeeee!!  I tried cranking the a/c but it didn't seem to come on.  Just a little stream of air.  Ugh.   Everything else was great.   The room was super clean.  Carpet was spotless.  And the bathroom...I could have lived in there!  It was all marbley and sparkley.   How do hotels fold the sheets to make it look picture perfect I will never know, but I love that look.  Maybe I'll practice on my bed at home.   The hotel boasts a prime Michigan Ave location which probably attracts a lot of business travelers and tourists.  I'd prefer to stay at a smaller boutique hotel off the beaten path, but it was very quiet and the bed was dream worthy, so no complaints there.",N
5137,"We had our October wedding at the Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza.  We can't rave enough about our experience with this hotel.  Everything was fantastic and our guests really enjoyed the reception. The event planner, Barbara was fantastic and so helpful.  Every meeting with her was so pleasant and she really made sure that everything ran smoothly.  The Holiday Inn was such a wonderful decision for us.  We checked out more than 10 locations but this place was just perfect for us.  The hotel is in a great location, and we took great evening pictures outside the hotel.  We had a great experience with the Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza.",Y
1946,"I'm surprised this place has gotten some poor reviews. My group and I came for a convention and checked in with relative ease. The staff was courteous. Granted, the check in was in a corner but I felt like this hotel in its entirety had a unique modern feel to it. (There was complimentary drinks at the checkin although non-alcoholic) The rooms themselves were not all set up the same although had same features. The bathroom was modern, not spectacular, but definitely nice. I LOVED the large flatscreen that was in every room. Just imagine modern beds, desks, bathrooms, ect. Hell you can even buy half the stuff in their catalog. On my visit there was a plate of cheese and stuff. (it had a card with a different name on it but hey, we were hungry) The concierge is amazing. Needed some mouthwash. They stated they didn't have any. Guy came up. Gave him a dollar. Went to shower. Came out and saw a bottle of mouthwash sitting there with the $4.95 sticker still on it. This guy went to buy mouthwash that cost more than what I gave him! We got there late, wanted to buy some beer but was told the liquor store was closed. They sent up 2 complimentary coronas. Service was amazing. Room service was good. ( i was kinda buzzed tho so that may have thrown my palate off a bit) Concierge was top notch. Had a bill dispute hence the 4 stars. (bottle of wine was charged to our room although there wasn't a bottle there when we had arrived.) I would definitely stay again. Even just to ride in their elevators with the 3d thing that trips you out.",N

1683,"The newly remodeled Allegro is dead sexy.  The small rooms add to its urban feel, and who doesn't like being able to wash her hands WHILE sitting on the toilet.  Spacially, it's like an innovatively planned closet you might find in Tokyo or New York, which suits a short stay or romantic romp just fine.  Stylistically, it's ultra modern and simple - the new classy.  I appreciated the Aveda products and that there WASN'T a $7 bottle of Evian sitting on the night stand.   I'm just realizing in reading other reviews now that the walls are thin.  I hadn't noticed any noises from other rooms...or the El which was practically next door, but  it's probable that, given the booked-to-capacity status of the hotel,  I may owe some neighbors an apology... It may behoove some to know that Allegro is one of many fine establishments you can book on Hotwire for half the price.  Not that you can request it, but it's in the pool anyway.",N
943,"I'm giving Red Roof Inn 4 stars if only for the fact that I was one block away from Michigan Avenue and only had to pay $120 a night. That being said, the rooms are the sizes of small dorm rooms and how they fit 2 full sized beds and a dresser in there is beyond my mental ability. No joke, there was about a foot and a half between the foot of the bed and the wall. The bathroom wasn't much better, though it was clean and that was my only concern. I have to say that while this Red Roof Inn was run down, it wasn't dirty or grimy. The staff was non-existent. That's good if nothing goes wrong, but if you had any needs I don't know if that would be a plus. $33 a night for parking is a crime where I come from, but like I said, you're getting a steal with the price of the room.",N
5289,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this hotel! Found it intriguing while booking a weekend trip for my boyfriend and me.  It's a nice location, and walking distance from michigan ave and shopping.

Different kinds of cheese, meats, dips, etc.I can't wait to spend another weekend there!",Y
1160,"I stayed here for a nursing conference. Reservations were easy to get, the rate was great compared to the Grand Hyatt it was recommended we stay in, it was a 6 block walk from the Magnificent Mile, and free parking. Great, right? There's a billboard in the parking lot of the hotel. EVERY morning at 6am, work started on changing the billboard. Really? I could hear my neighbors talking in the bathroom, and the full conversation of the people upstairs. So quiet, not so much. Everything was clean, but smelled funny. Disinfectant funny. The bed was very comfortable. The facility had 3 elevators, and not all of them would get you to where you had to go. My car stayed underground and came out in 1 piece. No breakfast, but walking distance to lots of great places. The staff was great, very efficient. Until 5am when I got up to take a shower and had ice water. I called to the front desk and got a ""run it awhile, it should warm up"" after 10 minutes the water was still ice. In fact, after 14 hours, the water was still ice. I went to the front desk, and somehow it got fixed-well at least to the point I wasn't going to freeze in the shower. The knob was all the way to ""scalding"" and the water wouldn't pass to steep tea. The staff gave me suggestions for bus routes and passes, extended my checkout to 2pm, and worked with me on a payment issue for my stay, all of which was greatly appreciated. Would I stay here again? Unlikely.",N
5017,"Phenomenal!!!  This is the best Hotel I've ever stayed in.  I went from the curb to my room (on the 18th floor) in a matter of minutes!  The valet service is amazing.  We left a pair of shoes in the car and they were brought to the room in less than 5 minutes.  We needed to put stuff in the car and it was brought around very fast.  I didn't need help, but the hotel staff seemed very friendly.  Awesome decor...makes you feel a little better about yourself haha...that sounds weird.",Y
86,"I worked at a wedding at the Carleton last week.  It is a gorgeous petite boutique hotel in downtown Oak Park.  The ballroom is perfect for a wedding between 100-150 guests.   For the cocktail hour, the hotel used a small banquet room as well as a bar with two small rooms right off of it.  The only thing that I disliked is that some guests were walking through the cocktail hour to get to their rooms on that side of the hotel.",N
3592,"The Drake is a ""great old hotel"" but they rely a little too heavily on their name and not enough on modern swank.  The thing I love most about it is seeing it come more clearly into view when heading south on outer Lake Shore Drive.  It's part of the skyline, symbolic. I've been to a few teas and brunches.  Tea is nothing special - I can do pumpernickel bread with egg salad and sliced, cascaded strawberrys in my own house, and I am no Martha Stewart.  Brunch is pretty grand though - waaay better than the Drake in Oak Brook.  I've visited friends' rooms, nothing extraordinary - I prefer the Allegro or Monaco. But what a symbol.",N
2037,"We booked this room very last minute on July 3rd on Hotwire. I did a little research and had figured it was HI-Mart and for the price (100 with tax) and how late it was when checking in (2AM) I figured the room wasn't going to matter too much. The parking was very easy and compared to other city hotels was reasonably priced for staying the night with in and out. I believe it was right around $34. The check in was quick and easy, as it should be at 2AM. Although the guy checking us in wasn't very talkative or warm to us. The room was a very large with a king bed and a sitting area. The view was not of much however this hotel does offer some amazing views. I would actually say some of the best in the city because of it's position. A definite plus to this hotel. Some things that bother me about hotels that HI had on the list. 1. I hate when electronics aren't in working order when walking into room. The TV was unplugged, the batteries needed changed in the remote and the clock needed set as it was  blinking. All simple things but also all simple things for the hotel staff to check on to make sure the room looks put together. 2. No info on Chicago in the room or info about the hotel. There was no book anywhere about restaurants in hotel, if room service was provided beyond breakfast, pool hours, etc. 3. Two VERY small pillows in the room isn't sufficient. Overall, I wouldn't stay again but it WAS  a great hotel for a quick sleep in Chicago. I prefer a hotel with a more boutique feel and attention. Also, for me, the location wasn't ideal to being where I like to be in Chicago. For a family trip, reunion or even a guys weekend, I think this hotel would fit well. However, for couples looking to relax and have a nice weekend together I think you'd be better fit at a more boutique hotel.",N
1255,"I made a reservation for June 11th on hotwire. Had to wait in line with 15 other guests and only one poor receptionist. I asked if she could get her manager so we could expedite the line. Was told the manager was in her office!. Guests should be your main concern if you are the manager. So, facing a 45 min wait to check in I thought I would use the self check in computer. Oh silly me!. Of course that was not working either!. A concierge named Chris finnally checked me in. He was very polite. I gave him my credit card for incedentals and my hotwire reservation #. He swiped my card and said my card was over it's limit. It was not. I had to call the credit card company and have then explain to him that he was incorrect. Then 10 min later he was finnally able to find my hotwire reservation. I had called the hotel in advance and had been offered a queen non smoking room. Since I have severe asthma. When we got to put room it was two small beds in a smoking room!. I will try and never stay in this hotel again!. They need to train their front desk staff including their managers.",N
1582,"I want to give Hotel 71 more stars, but I just can't.  The location is great, the view from our room was nice, and the staff were very friendly and helpful.  After that it goes downhill. We were given a king bed when two doubles were requested, though a discount was given, it was still an inconvenience.  The room was oddly shaped leading to a lot of unusable space.  No mirror except in the bathroom.   And the bathroom is a whole other issue.  I think the rest of the hotel was recently renovated, unfortunately our bathroom had been overlooked since 1970.  The dingy & stained bathtub was chipped, grout was filthy, lighting was terrible and there was no exhaust, so putting on makeup was next-to-impossible.   Hence the 3 stars.",N
327,"My friend and I stayed here this past Valentine's weekend.  It's an older hotel so it has a really nice atmosphere and old-fashioned (i.e. courteous) service.  They were not intrusive but very accommodating.  GREAT location for us - just a few blocks from Wrigley Field, and near several cool nightclubs, The Metro a few blocks past Wrigley Field, and tons of shops, restaurants, bars.  The CTA is close by as are other public transportation.  VERY comfy beds, robes were provided, as well as a very efficient blowdryer.  Only complaint was that like most buildings in colder climes, the heat was very high and we could not figure out how to turn down the radiator.  Fortunately, the windows opened so we got some fresh air.  Given the small amount of time we actually spent in the room, we didn't bother calling down to ask about the heat, but I'm sure they would have responded right away, just like they did to all our requests. We checked out 2/15 and stayed with a friend for 2 more days, then went home.  That's when I realized I'd forgotten a favorite sweatshirt!  Called the day I got home, 2/17,  and spoke with Maria.  She called me back to let me know she'd found my sweatshirt and I delightedly gave her my cc info to have them mail me my shirt.  It arrived yesterday along with a top Ithat I forgot I'd forgotten! Will definitely stay here again! Affordable too!!",N

2214,If it wasn't for the location this would be a one star review. Hotel staff is just not what you expect from a Michigan Avenue experience. Hotel is crowded with foreigners primarily Europeans. The hotel is nice but not consistent with the price. Our room temperature control was broken and had to have engineering fix it. We spent one very cold night. They charge $18/day for Internet access and wait until you hear this... $12 to use the treadmill at the fitness center. This rule must go since it is just ridiculous. Again location makes this a good choice but the Marriott across the street is a much better choice.,N
3145,"Pains me to write this, but just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, it did.  We stayed here for three nights.  I wrote my last review upon arrival; unfortunately, the stay did not improve.  I doubt that I will stay at this W again, and sadly, my GF says she will never stay at another W - not even the new W Maldives :(   Rather than go into details, I will simply write a laundry list of issues: 1) I already mentioned: rough sheets and a hard bed. As for decor, I'll give them a break, since they are renovating in the next year or two. 2) Overwhelming lemon scent coming from the bed and could not sleep.    We asked housekeeping to change all linens in hopes of ""fixing"" the issue. They did; however, the issue was not resolved.  Come to discover (we discovered, not housekeepping) that somebody poured a substance on the bed and it was simply ""covered up"" and not addressed by housekeeping. Kudos to Grant for moving us to another room, actually a suite. I have an issue with this, too.  I am Platinum with Starwood and they are supposed to automatically upgrade me to the ""best room/suite"" available - but, we did not get a suite until there was an issue.  hmmm... 3) Toilet did not flush properly Issues with room # 2 4) The TV did not work until after we unplugged and reconfigured the wiring. 5) Wireless internet did not work in the suite.  Would go in and out. 6) The light in the living room flickered. 7) The vanity mirror/light shocked my GF when she touched it.  Fortunately, she was wearing shoes with rubber soles. 8) The heater/AC couldn't decide if it wanted to be hot or cold 9) The window covering in the bedroom did not roll up",N

2681,"So I just got married. Here. This weekend. Yup. I don't even want to tell you about it. I want to be selfish and keep all the memories to myself and think that no one else could POSSIBLY have as an amazing time as we did at The James. GAH--okay. I will tell you. Because I want all you brides-to-be out there to think outside the box. To let you know that you don't have to get married at some hoity-toity, over-the-top, been-there, done-that hotel downtown where they are going to offer you nothing but the same-old same-old. The James offered a wedding venue that was utterly and completely refreshing. First of all, the Great Room is a fantastically versatile space. We held our ceremony AND reception in it, and were able to manipulate the space to make it look completely and totally different for both events within the same evening. How? you may ask. Wellll....there are a couple things. First, they have skylights and pinspot lighting in the room--we opened the skylights for a more natural ceremony, but used the pinspots for a more elegant, warm reception. And this is big: the main wall of the room is covered by a large (now a dark, burnt orange) velvet curtain, and underneath lies a huge etched mural of the Chicago skyline and lakefront. Using the curtain for our ceremony allowed for a more solemn moment (as weddings are SERIOUS, ya'll) but the mural changed the feeling of the room completely for the reception, reminding you of the fun, modern space you were in. And the colors in the room are mostly neutral, allowing any gal set on magenta and chartreuse to not have her heart broken. Second--THE STAFF. Sinisa, the event coordinator for The James, is possibly the nicest man in the business I have ever met. He is so calm, so accommodating, and honestly, you feel like you've made a friend by the end of all the planning nonsense. The service staff were flawless, and the management were flexible and even friendly about it when we got behind schedule. Third--THE FOOD. C'mon people. Did you really think David Burke's Primehouse would do the catering?!? Um. Well. THEY DO. They will take your order (from the predetermined menu) at the table, and deliver the perfect steak/fish/veggie risotto to you JUST like you'd order in their amazing restaurant downstairs. COME ON. This is no joke. Other fantastical perks? The rooms, the concierge, The James Club for an afterparty (great space, too! We used the pool table for ping pong), and um. Well. Everything else you could possibly think of to be incredible when you're marrying the love of your life. I can't count how many people told us that our wedding was the absolute best they'd ever been to. I'd consider myself lucky, but...The James definitely had something to do with that.",N
2494,"Stayed here for a business trip, and I'm so glad I didn't have to pay the bill myself!  I expected so much more from a Hilton hotel, but this is what I got: - Used ""refreshments"" left in my room upon arrival.  One vitamin water had been opened and was half-full, the other beverage actually had dust on the cap.  Gross!  I'm not sure how this combination is acceptable at a Hilton hotel.  When I pointed it out, I was told I had to pay for any refreshments consumed during my stay.  Um, the vitamin water was already opened and half gone when I walked in ... - Outrageous daily charge for use of the ""gym"" at the hotel.  I wouldn't really call it a gym, though.  They give you the option of paying $25 per day to use the ""gym"" or you can walk around the ""indoor track"" free of charge.  Knowing my boss was already being billed for someone else's vitamin water, I chose to walk around the track.  It's not a track!  You can't see it until you actually get past the gatekeepers who make it sound like such a luxury, but then you walk in and realize the ""gym"" is just a small collection of workout equipment and there's a make-shift ""track"" surrounding it.  And no running on the track!  Walking only, please.  Whatever.  After walking around the so-called fitness facility twice in a matter of 3 minutes (it's a really short ""track""), I decided to leave and just go running outside by the lake instead for a real workout where nobody was watching me from behind a desk to make sure I didn't hop off the walking path and pick up a dumbbell without paying the $25 fee. - Upon returning from my attempted gym adventure, my room key no longer worked.  The gentleman at the front desk informed me that it's probably because I had kept it in my pocket while running outside.  Um, where else am I supposed to keep it?  It took about 10 minutes for him to send someone else up to the room to open the door, and when that person arrived they demanded to see my ID.  Dude, my ID is in the room that's locked -- the room the key no longer opens. I'd never stay here if I had to pay for it myself.  After the experience here, I always double-check and call hotels to ask about their fitness facilities and daily gym charges.  Lesson learned, thank you for that!",N
251,The staff at this hotel are mighty nice in a genuine way. I think that it must  be a midwest thing because I found that across the board with the general folk too. Check in was a breeze and we were quickly whisked up to our room. At the time we were both smokers so I had requested a smoking room but OH MY! The smell of the ciggie smoke in the hallway just gave me a good ol' one two punch in the nose! It was like a smokers convention had just left the hallway. The room on the other hand had a great themed decor of being at the beach/boardwalk. It was a great and up lifting feeling being that we stayed there in the middle of February and just in time for a big winter storm. The bed was very comfy and like Robert S. said lot of pillows which was a good thing for me cause I am the Princess of pillow hogs *evil grin*. Oh the hotel is located in the Gold Coast residential area which is an upscale area with condos and brownstones. I didn't feel unsafe at all during the entire trip coming or leaving the hotel. I'd highly requimend the hotel to woman or young ladies who are traveling on their own. I'd stay here again if the price is right. Unfort the hotel can be pricey at times so be ready to pony up for a room so I've had to stay at other hotels :(,N
1244,"This hotel is the only property physically connected to McCormick Place, which makes it popular for exhibitors who want to be right next to the convention center.

From the looks alone, it is a  5** palace:   a pretty palace and very upscale for sure.  .  From what I saw, of the open tea room dining area (just looking at the place settings for tea service was an art form in itself), wow, lots of gold leaf style culinary accessories, fabulous bathrooms, I could have stayed in the woman's bathroom at least 1/2 the day relaxing, and fabulously adorned lobby . . .wow, if I had 5 star money, this would be a great place to treat one's self.",N

We did the Tech room this time as my boyfriend had to work ...a little...how boring is that?  He worked I shopped.  Everything close by.  Rooms are really nice and the beds are most amazing.  I think I snored I slept so hard.  Food in the pub shouldn't be missed.  Yeah Yeah..chicago dogs..chicago pizza..blah blah blah.  This place as the best dang fish and chips you'd ever have.

2005,"Stayed one night this weekend with reward points.  This hotel just opened on 10/31/11, so as you can imagine, everything was very nice and new.  Starting with the lobby, not being a big expert on decor, I would describe it as ultra modern, fixtures were very cool, the bar area and restaurant was very modern and had a sheik look to it.  One thing I like is that the room we had (and from what it looked like, all or almost all the rooms had) a nice sized balcony.  The rooms were very nice, bathroom had a sliding door into the bathroom, then a 'dual purpose' sliding door that slid over to close if you were in the toilet area or close if you were in the shower area.  Shower was very nice, overhead 'rain' faucet I really liked.  Nice flat screen TV in the room and FREE wireless internet.  I would recommend the hotel, very impressive.",N
3974,"This is my first review in Yelp, I am usually to lazy to review but i thought it is worth it to warn others agaisnt this hotel. I was looking for good deals online for a 1 week vacation in chicago downtown, i found congress hotel for $90/night, i thought it was great deal for the location and the hotel with the big name... i have walked by congress hotel many times in the passed and i was always impressed by the historical look of the building. i didnt think that anything would be wrong with this hotel so i didnt even bother to read review. some of my issues with the hotel: rude valet personal damaged walls, paint and  doors The room smells like mold TV reception was horrible A/C unit is inside the room and was dripping all night the walls between the rooms are soo thin that i heard my neighbor talking on the phone like he was in front of me till i fall asleep. and i heard his TV like it was in my room, it wasnt bc he was too long but bc of extremly thin walls. if you know  Motel 6, i would rate it 5 stars and still give 1 star to congress hotel. i booked my 7 nights stay at this hotel thru hotwire so there was no way for me to not get charged  if i decided to check out early, but i still checked out the very next day... i lost $600 but at least i enjoyed the rest of my vacation in different hotel. I highly discourage anyone from booking  this hotel without visiting it  in person first and see the rooms... Dont do it even if you are ok with staying at Motels. i would recommend paying more and stayin somewhere else or stay by the airport and take the blue line if you didnt have another choice in downtown.",N
2665,"I got a super deal at the James. $125/night. Yeah, you read that right...a total steal. After one day on my four day trip, I have to say that this is the best hotel at which I've stayed in Chicago. I'd heard about The James for a long time and as I'm a boutique hotel whore, I couldn't wait to check it out. And I wasn't disappointed. Well, let me modify that...I wasn't impressed with the decor, but what can you expect from an older (I can't believe 5 years is older in this category) boutique hotel. What I have really appreciated is the smaller touches. Keihl's (sp?) products, personalized, handwritten notes upon arrival, uber-friendly staff, great down pillow and crisp sheets, and loads of towels. I really can't find anything to complain about, except for that I'd love it if they offered a ""sleep' function on the remote control (can't fall asleep when I'm traveling and need background noise.) -- and they actually may offer that but I've been too slow to figure it out. I wouldn't be surprised if I up this to 5 stars by the end of my stay...esp bc of the price.... Wait and see...",N
1840,"My worst W experience ever. 1. Went to check in at 11 pm, no one at the desk had to call the hotel from my cell (while standing at the counter) to get someone to the desk. 2. Didn't have a food menu in my room. Called to get a menu, after a 10 minute delay they called back to say there was no one around to bring me one. The receptionist had to dictate the menu over the phone. 3. WiFi is free in the lobby and $15/day in your room. So if you want to be comfortable and relaxed you have to pay a ridiculous fee. 4. I was woken up by maintenance work on a neighboring room at 8am on my first day. I talked to the manager and he claimed it was work being done by the city (outside). I disagreed because I had a room that wasn't facing the street, but gave up since he offered no compensation what-so-ever and sure enough on day 2 the maintenance guys were working on the room next door at 8am again. 5. The heater in my room was ancient and barely worked. Fortunately, it wasn't all that cold during my stay. I'm not sure if I'll ever trust the W again, but certainly if you're thinking of staying at a W in Chicago make sure it's not this one.",N
5599,Total fan of this place....stayed here for a few days and the experience was quite lovely.....great ambience....really friendly staff... Plus this is right smack dab in Downtown Chicago.....you could literally walk to any destination if you chose to.....from Taste of Chicago to any dive bar.... Give this place a go....it was worth it =),N
3324,Move beyond the rock theme and it's an average hotel with a good location.  Room was unbearably hot and the controls on the wall did nothing.  Thank goodness the window opened or we'd have been cooked alive.  That of course let in all the noise from Michigan Ave.  This combined with our neighbors door slamming against their thrown door lock every 30 seconds made for a lively setting.  Room was stuffy too. Burn marks on carpet lead me to believe nasty smokers had occupied room on many occasions.  Wife happy w/ Aveda in bath.  Base bar was good  with great service and well made drinks tho pricey.,N
826,"The top things about the Silversmith that I must point out first are LOCATION and VALUE.  But the actual hotel, and the experience were nothing to complain about either.  We never get a hotel in Chicago, and we most definitely would not expect to find something affordable downtown.  But somehow we managed to do so.  With our Yelp check-in , we were even upgraded to a suite (which I would be fine without).  But it was lovely. Every point of contact with the staff was positive from the moment the door was opened for us downstairs , to the lobby with our checking in & out. The rooms were clean.  The suites are good sized.  The bathroom was awesome.  Good water pressure, nice shower, AND a tub (granted I am assuming the regular rooms only have a regular sized bathroom). We had no complaints, and this was an excellent choice for the rate.  The best part for us was that we were able to access the orange, red, and blue lines easily.  AND since we took Amtrak this time, we also were able to walk to the train station (if you have a ton of luggage, you might want to grab a cab). We will definitely stay here again.  Overall a very good experience.",N
5294,"I stayed here for St. Patrick's day. I always use yelp to check out hotels so i figured I would contribute. Its a little bit of a walk to the red line. I believe it was the Grand stop. The hotel was pretty much as expected. Small bathroom but it served its purpose. Beds were a decent size and appeared clean. Plasma TV was nice. about 100 bucks a night. It seems Brett C. had  some trouble with parking. I used Midway Easy Park and it worked out fine. 10 bucks a day and the drive you to midway airport, just hop on the subway and go into the city.",Y
3948,"If I could give Congress Plaza Hotel six stars, I would. If you're going to Chicago, MAKE SURE to stay in Congress Plaza. I absolutely LOVED this place. We had a beautiful room on the eighth floor overlooking the park, lake and Buckingham Fountain. You could see downtown with its tall buildings on the left and all the major museums on the right. It was a short walk from Magnificent Mile, Museum Campus, Chicago Art Museum, Library, and the Loop. The hotel itself has an exquisite interior. The entrance hall is stunning in its old-fashioned beauty and the ballroom on the second floor is simply breathtaking (especially if you're a ballroom dancer like me). The amenities are really hard to complain about: the ceiling and the doors might need a bit remodelling, but who looks at the ceiling anyway? Our room was beautifully decorated in burgundy red and deep green, with a comfortable, always perfectly made bed, elegant Oxford-style armchairs and a table in a beautiful bay window (thus the ease of admiring the view to all sides), and all the usual amenities. My friends from Chicago told me to stay in one of the new hotels and skip the Congress Plaza, but I'm so glad I didn't listen to them. Congress Plaza is not only the perfect location for sightseeing and shopping trips, but the rooms and the views from them are so beautiful that we actually had trouble getting out of the room! Next time I'm in Chicago, I'm not even looking at other places, just heading straight for the Congress Plaza website.",N
1380,"Hotel Lobby Bar Project Review #8 - Martini Bar Drinking at the Knickerbocker lobby bar is like drinking in the company board room. It's not at all unpleasant but you feel like you're in that awkward little place between old-fashioned charm and new-fanged snazz. In other words, just kinda dumpy. My cohort astutely pointed out that the complimentary bar snack was the exact same cheesy pretzel mix that that have at our local VFW Hall. Plus or minus? You decide! The bartender may have been the best part of the bar. When we enquired as to what the large room was up on the mezzanine level he replied (in the friendliest way possible) that we were just looking it a series of mirrors meant to make the room look larger.  Nice trompe 'l'oeil, Knickerbocker. He was friendly, chatty and seemed slightly crestfallen when we asked for the check after only one round. Sorry Martini Bar, we have Chicago Fizzes to drink and toasted almonds to eat up the road. I think Knickerbocker might need to turn in for the evening. It's ok though, Diagnosis Murder is on followed by the evening news. Cheer up!",N
1040,"I recently stayed at The Almalfi and it was just so-so. I am not quite in-line with the other reviews here. It was a hotel, but nothing special, particularly for the price it was charging. It's fairly nicely located for tourist (such as myself) but you still have to walk a few blocks to really find anything. The room was decent, nothing special. Lobby is really small. Service was so-so. Gym was not that great. There's no fan and it's fairly stuffy and hot. Would I stay there again? Perhaps, but I would definitely look else where for.",N
1537,"Pros: 1. Great View (especially from the 38th floor) 2. Great location 4. Almost always available 5. Reasonable rates Cons: 1. Loud (especially next to the 38th floor ice machine) 2. Slow internet 3. AC is insufficient, Chicago gets HOT in the summer 4. Rooms are newly remodeled but they clearly kept some of the old stuff.   Not a problem except the desk chair is WAY to low for the desk. An older hotel with a semi-recent remodel, it's a fairly good value for the location.  I could have overlooked the loud ice machine and slow internet, but insufficient AC is a deal-breaker. Try to avoid this place during heat waves. PS.  Free internet is cool, but as a business traveler we would prefer to pay for internet that actually works.",N
2956,"I just finished working on a conference at the Sheraton. I hadn't been there in many years. Checkin was a breeze and we had a room just off the elevators on the 12th floor. The rooms are fine and clean, but nothing too special (unless you have a room with a view). The ballrooms have been kept up to date and are very serviceable. The banquet food was not very good in this case. The burgers were a lower grade of meat than my wife got from room service the night before. So, all in all, a decent hotel, but stay away from the banquet food.",N
3110,"Way overpriced, like most W hotels, but overall pretty nice.  It's in a quite area of the city, so not recommended if you want to be central to bars and restaurants.",N
4188,I like the big wide open spaces of the hotel lobby that fill with natural light from the transparent glass ceiling.  It really is good for socializing.  There is plenty of convention space underneath and in the other tower as well and it is easy to get around.  The staff is courteous and efficient.  The gym is small but OK for a hotel gym.  They have a lot of tread mills and some dumb bells and machines.  The location is pretty great too.  I think this is just where you want to be in downtown.  Right next to but not on Michigan with a great view of the river (if you book the river/lake view tower)  make this prime real estate for a hotel stay in downtown.  You can walk or take short cab ride to anywhere from here in the Loop/downtown area.  If you want to grab the L or a bus to take you uptown the stop for the bus is about two blocks away and the stop for the L is about five or six blocks.  This is a great place for a convention.,N
628,"What you are going to get here is your standard Hilton stay.  Don't expect anything fancy.   Positives: Great location. Clean rooms. Comfortable bed and pillows. Great views. Great service. Kiosk for boarding passes Negatives: That Hilton room decor Loud air conditioning No free wireless in the rooms (come on, get with the times here) Overall though...a comfortable stay which is all I need on a business trip.",N
790,"Note: This is more a review for the hosting an event aspect of this hotel, not the staying here on vacation aspect. When I got engaged, I traversed the whole city in search of a reception venue that screamed ""Chicago.""  Originally, I was determined to have a non-traditional venue, but I begrudgingly checked out some downtown hotels-- and was really surprised at how much I liked the Westin. The ballroom looked out onto Michigan Ave, everything was inclusive of sales tax/service charge so the prices you saw were what you were charged (the 30% was not tacked on afterward like comparable downtown hotels), the decor was clean & contemporary without being too trendy, and best of all, it was nice but without the snootiness. (Seriously, I cannot stand pretentiousness!) The biggest gamble was the food as you sign the contract before the tasting, but it all turned out splendidly in the end. The food was awesome at the tasting and I was just praying it would be the same at the event-- and it was. People are still raving to us & our families about how great it all was, especially the steak. I can attest to its quality myself, as you bet your ass I made sure that I would be eating the meal I was paying for. :-) And while I didn't stay in a typical room, I did get a kickass suite to get ready in, and I took advantage of getting it at the discounted room block rate for the night before as well. Check-in wasn't until 3, but the room was ready for me at noon. It had an awesome view looking out onto Michigan Ave & the bed was plush & comfy-- super important for a stressed out insomniac bride-to-be! This is not your cheapest option for a Chicago wedding, but it truly is a good value for a downtown hotel right on Michigan Avenue, and less expensive than the nearby comparable hotels. P.S. If you do host an event here, and have the money upfront & can make the payments in full, get a Starwood Amex credit card. You'll thank me later. :-)",N
5072,"Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! I had a great stay here, the staff are awesome super polite and very helpful.

2336,"I arrived a bit early for a dinner meeting one Sunday, so I stopped at the Chicago Marriott Downtown Hotel to review my notes and sip on some Cosmopolitans.  I'll tell ya.... the bartender really knew how to mix a Cosmo!!  I had 2 cocktails and they served glasses of nuts with the drinks.  I was alone but I had a nice time.  Really could have stayed there all evening.... but my time was limited.  Hey, I highly recommend the bar area in the lobby of the Marriott.",N

1320,"With the name ""Ritz Carlton,"" you enter this place with certain expectations. And I'm talking HIGH expectations. This was definitely not the case. My first impression basically sums up my experience here. My friend had picked me up at the airport and dropped me off because A) she's an awesome friend and B) I had just had knee surgery and had a full-leg brace and crutches and could barely walk, let alone manage my things. As we pull up to the hotel, NEITHER of the TWO BELLHOPS took one step towards us. Even after seeing me struggle to get out of the car, after watching me wrestle with my luggage (4 bags), and even after making eye contact with me, they didn't even flinch from their spots. I had to call them over before one of them reluctantly (and I could see it on his face) mosied his way towards me. MOSY?!? I can barely hold my purse and manage my crutches at the same time and this guy is MOSY-ING? It gets worse. He then proceeds to not say one word to us...no greeting, not apologies, nothing...and takes only ONE BAG! Did I mention I had FOUR? Before I could ask him to take the others, he was gone. In effort to keep this somewhat brief, let me list off the other terrible attributes of the stay: 1) after complaining to the front desk about the bellhop as I was checking in, she just stared at me blankly and gave a half-hearted apology. Nothing else was done. No comps, no speaking with the manager, nothing. 2) when checking in, she told me she no longer had king beds available and I would have to take a room with two doubles. That would be fine if I didn't have to sleep with a GIGANTIC BRACE on my leg with my husband next to me. Being that it was a romantic getaway, sleeping in separate beds was not the suggestion I wanted to hear from the front desk. 3) Although they moved us to a king room the next night, the second room had a constant yet intermittent rattle that would sound like someone knocking on our door. All. Throughout. The. Night. 4) They erroneously charged us for mini-bar items TWICE! Once upon checkout and then again when I just happened to check my credit card!!! What if I hadn't? I would've never known. 5) Lastly, when I called the front desk to challenge said mini-bar charge, they stated they would have someone from finance call me back. It has been over a week and I had to call them back myself. Never again will I stay at a Ritz Carlton. Not what I would've expected from such a reputable hotel. Truly disappointing and a waste of my money.",N

227,Cute theme hotel we were on a board walk themed floor it may not be there as they were remodeling when we stayed wouldn't mind seeing some of the other themes clean rooms and comfy beds and we were in town for a conference so were quite tired when we got in every evening and lots of pillows yaaaaaaa !!!!!   Mr Gyro is just around the corner nothing like buy one get one free Gyro's there is a Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts both with in a block of here and a drug store so you can get sodas and stuff forget paying for stuff from the honor bar just use it to keep your stuff cold and when ever you needed a taxi or anything it was real quick to get one,N

Specifically: -internet sucks -manager doesn't follow through on action items -management makes no effort to compensate clientele for inconveniences -management makes no effort to address discrepancies in bills until I pointed it out right at check-out Soooooo, if you're thinking of typical Marriott quality, don't think of this place.",N

4950,"Great Business Trip to Avenue Hotel, ChicagoThe Avenue Hotel is a great business hotel with an unbeatable location and great amenities. The rooms were top-notch and everything about my visit went smoothly. The hotel is a short walk to the Magnificent Mile and all the shops and restaurants you could want.  If not for my business trip and more personal time was available it would have been ideal.  I must make a point of making it back here for a more relaxing trip in the near future.My room was clean, comfortable and had a great view.   The amenities were great and the bed was unbelieveable.  I don't remember ever having such a good night's sleep in a hotel much less on a business trip.  The staff at the Avenue hotel were wonderful.  From the front desk staff to the bellmen, guest services and housekeeping, the entire crew went out of their way to assist with plans both inside and outside of the hotel, and the hotel bar and its wait staff are experts at serving business groups -- attentive but not overbearing.In general, my stay at the Avenue Hotel was exceptionally smooth and productive. Our business meetings went smoothly, the rooms themselves were comfortable and had all the up to date equipment for presentations. I would recommend this hotel to any business group, but also to any tourist looking for a hotel convenient to many popular downtown Chicago spots!",Y
1042,"I stayed at the Amalfi while in town on business with a little weekend of pleasure.   Cute Boutique Hotel Location:  Great location near the River and 3 blocks from Michigan behind the new Trump Tower.  I walked everywhere from up and down Michigan toward the Loop and Mill. Park.   Check In:  I flew in early on Sat morning and my mother flew in that morning too, as we were coming from different cities.  She arrived at the hotel about 9am.  I really didn't expect to check in but at least hold our bags there and give us a place to meet up.  Mother called me and said the lady at the desk said she could check in if her name was on the reservation.  I called when I landed and spoke to the front desk and gave them the OK to let mom check in.  VERY NICE of them to let us check in at 9am!! I arrived and preceded up to the room.   Room:  The original Room they let my mother check into was not the Corner King we had booked.  It was fine, and very nice of them to let us check in that early, but I had paid more for the upgrade. So I went down to the desk and asked the lady if there was a corner king available?  If not, not a big deal as long as she could credit me the difference in price for the room. They ended up giving us a Corner King that was nice.  It was not available until later so they let us keep our stuff in the other room, while we went out for the day, and then upgraded us when we returned from shopping. The Corner King was nice.  Extremely comfortable beds, the windows around the whole room were nice, but a lot to close up at night.  Nice views, much better than the original room where we looked into another building.  I will say other than the corridor where you walked into the room, space wise it wasn't that much different than the original room.  Not really worth the upgrade unless you want the better view and all the natural light. Breakfast and the Happy hour was a great touch.  Fruit and bagels for breakfast with your choices of juices, coffee, and tea.  nothing special but perfect for us. The Free Happy Hour was very nice - they had Sky and Belvedere Vodka, Jim Beam, Captain Morgan, and others.  White and Red wines and a couple Italian beer selections.  Nice little apps too.  anti-pasta setup, cheeses, and breads. Service - lightbulb was out in the room and I called and someone came up in 5 minutes and replaced it. We did receive turndown service the 2nd night and they left a chocolate on the pillow, very nice. Lobby isn't anything much, but why do you need it to be..... Bellmen were very helpful in directions to a drug store and transportation. I typically stay at the Wyndham in Chicago but I think I will be changing to the Amalfi now.",N
5079,"Not a great place to spend your time. Nearly empty, both times I've been there. Drinks aren't too expensive. Management was far from great. Music was just alright, definitely a few silent moments. The crowd was just okay.Just listen to the other reviews and don't waste your time.",Y

156,I was raised in Chicago and downtown and the north side are my stomping grounds. When I saw the rate for the Whitehall hotel online I jumped at the chance to stay in the heart of the Gold Coast walking distance from all of my favorite places.                                                                    The only reason they are not getting a better star review from me is because.....when I went to raise the window in my room the entire window came off in my hand and I almost fell out from the 15 floor. I put it back on the tracks and cracked the other window to get some air  instead. The outlets were loose in the walls and the shower head was loose. They advertise mini bar in the room but don't think that is a fridge because it is not.                   Other than that the staff was nice enough not all smiles but it is Chicago. . . The sheets and the bed were amazing and the gym is pretty cool to have to work out in. This place is about location. You cannot beat the price for were you are. Parking is a bitch....$48 a night but what you gonna do . . . It's Chicago.   Walk over to the Pancake House 7am-3pm for the best breakfast in the Gold Coast. Over all I would stay there again for the price.,N
1143,"The Fairmont is a very nice hotel.  The decor of the lobby gives it a romantic sexy vibe.  The only problem with the lobby is that the Eno wine bar is located smack dab in the middle of it.  Therefore the lobby area is actually pretty small.  Lovely, but small.  My sister ate at Aria and really enjoyed her meal.  She especially liked the ambiance.   The rooms are spacious and luxurious.  The large flat screen tv was a nice surprise.  The beds were comfortable and the decor was lovely.  The room featured a coffee pot which came in handy after walking around in the cold on Michigan Ave.  The rooms were plush.  I generally couldn't hear people in the rooms next to us except when they were blow drying their hair.  The bathrooms were quite large.  The separate shower and tub was a nice surprise.  The rain head shower was nice, but I found that it lacked good water pressure.  All of the fixtures in the bathroom were quite nice.   While the hotel was nice I'm not sure if I would stay here again.  I might try finding a hotel closer to Michigan Ave.  While this isn't far from Michigan Ave it isn't exactly as convenient some other hotels.",N
1728,"I had an average experience at the Allegro Hotel. The staff was all very courteous, and you can expect good service. However, the carpet in my room was wet. Seems like they just deep cleaned it and didn't give it enough time or ventilation to dry. The decor is a little quirky - I felt a little like Alice in Wonderland, kind of bewildered by the bright colors and patterns, but some would call that character. Also, they have Aveda products in the rooms. Eee! It's been a few years since I've stayed there, so I don't know if they still stock the bathroom with Aveda stuff. But I loved it.",N

Free coffee all day, actually tastes good. - Free wifi + 2 public access computers. - Very modern and clean decor.

2832,"great for family, everyone gets some space and autonomy. its no design or aesthetic marvel, but gets the job done reliably for a reasonable price. great location (the Embassy @ Lakeshore may be better views) a couple blocks from magnif-mile, cab-able to most dining and shopping you'll do on a family tourist trip. LOTS OF FAMILYS...so don't expect quiet in the morning, and expect long waits at the hot breakfast buffet. but again, overall good value. *rooms here are a bit old and worn (next time i'll consider embassy lakeshore, for real).",N
2272,"We stayed here for a couple days and if I wanted to be centered in this area again, I'd do it again. But super touristy is not my thing. I'd rather not dodge suitcases with children sitting on them while trying to get outside. You look at other reviews on here and think the bathrooms must be small. If you've ever lived in a one bedroom apartment, you'll enter your room and then laugh. Seriously no different than any bathrooms I've ever had in an apartment, why would you expect anything more in a hotel room? The room itself was great, we had a view over Michigan Avenue on the 36th floor. The bed was so comfortable, and we had plenty of space. Also pretty sure any reviews complaining about elevators are VERY outdated. There are 6 ""low-rise"" elevators that go to the 28th floor and then 6 for the higher level floors. There was almost always one sitting in the lobby to head up, and if there wasn't, you barely had to wait...unless you were the idiots who weren't aware you had to press the button and not just stare at it because you don't have elevator buttons on your farm in Iowa. If you're logical enough not to bring a car here, there are so many buses that come right nearby and it's an easy walk to many different places. Concierge lounge was pretty meh. The drinks were hardly discounted like they are elsewhere (wow, a whole $11 for a cocktail instead of $13 down at the regular bar!). The breakfast wasn't that impressive either and we ended up going elsewhere for it after morning #1. The bar was always pretty busy, we only went there on Christmas for a drink before dinner. They have a couple local beers on tap, which is awesome and they really want you to know they make their blue cheese stuffed olives for martinis.",N

5616,Me = fan of SPG I stayed here 2 weeks ago when I got stranded at ORD after my flight to Milwaukee got cancelled due to a storm. I booked a room while waiting for my luggage at the airport at midnight (Thu. to Fri). I was annoyed when the reservation agent on the SPG phone line didn't understand that I wanted to stay 1 night and not check out on Saturday. Not hard to grasp. Checking into the hotel proved to still be a challenge as it still wasn't clear that I would be checking out 6 hours later. Put that together with the fact that the bathroom wallpaper was coming off the wall near the toilet and you've removed one star.,N

804,Perfect location when coming to Chicago to shop and go out.  Besides the fact that they messed my reservation up 4 times (seriously) I had a great time and our rooms were spacious.  Dont forget Westin's beds they rock!,N
1317,"I spent my birthday weekend in Chicago and at a friends suggestion we staid at the Ritz.  The location is amazing, right across the street from the water tower.  The staff was perfectly helpful and the room was immaculate, perhaps the decore was a bit dated.  Marie Antoinette would have felt right at home.  I asked a friend who went along in what style the room was decorated and he jokingly said it was ""Mormon temple"" On a better note the Sunday brunch is not to be missed.  A bit pricy, but with a breakfast cocktail included and everything from prime rib to an amazing raw seafood bar, to full service sushi it is perfect for a special occasion.  Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely stay at the Ritz again.",N
5293,"Dude! Cockroaches. Really? And no coffee maker in the room? I don't care if there is a push button cappucino maker in the lobby. There's no coffee maker in the room.Other than the cockaroaches and the no coffee maker it was super, but still only worth 2 stars because of the cockroaches. I was able to get a nice clean room with 2 queen sized beds in there, real nice. The TV operated nice and simple, none of that menu stuff. But I do believe there was a large population of people living there. I know there was some sort of homeless bicyclist hanging outside for a bit.Rancho Cordova, CA probably doesn't have much to offer besides Motel 6 but maybe next time I'll take a look there. At $70 it was a pretty good deal. But I should get a credit for there being no coffee maker in the room and for my room already being rented out to a cockaroach.",Y
2500,"Great Hotel! One of the most impressive lobby's I have ever experienced. The rooms are very comfortable and cozy. I was won over by the great service the staff offered, especially when you have requests at odd hours of the night. The location is unbeatable as well, just a few blocks from the EL makes for easy commuting to just about anywhere downtown.",N
2006,"Every Holiday my wife and I try out a new downtown Chicago hotel and enjoy a nice dinner, a show and shopping.  Having just returned from this hotel, I would highly recommend a stay.   Consistent with the other reviews to date, the property is a very appealing modern design.  There are two room decors.  Our room had a gloss black porcelain (marble?) flooring and aqua carpet.  I like that our room was not rectangular and had an alcove with the desk, chair with side table and the flat panel TV.  We also appreciated a balcony with river and lake views.  If it weren't winter, you'd could really enjoy spending time out there.  The bed was very comfortable although a little on the firmer side (though plenty soft, just not a heavenly bed).  There were great down pillows and lots of them.  The room has all the amenities you'd want including nice toiletries, single cup coffee maker, mini-bar, wi-fi, etc.  The common spaces also feature striking design.  The lobby is especially impressive with a massive gas fireplace (probably 75 feet long) and comfortable seating that makes you want to linger.  It's just a great looking contemporary hotel. The staff could not have been more friendly.  While the hotel is still in start up mode, everyone was genuinely and naturally friendly.  We found this to be true of the front desk staff, housekeeping, the lounge staff and those in the restaurant.  We especially liked breakfast.  While on the expensive side, or pretty typical for higher end hotels, the food was especially good.  Try the crepes!  They are wonderful. The only downside I can see is the cost of parking at $51.  We knew this in advance and parked next door at an Illinois Center garage for $30.  Just a pet peeve of mine, as I'm happy to pay for a nice room and good service, but I hate how all the downtown hotels gouge you on parking or don't offer a package that includes parking. We did not use the pool but there is a nice two lane lap pool and hot tub plus health club.  The location was also very convenient to Millenium park, loop theaters and Michigan Avenue.  In short, this hotel was everything we wanted for a relaxing, quick escape from the burbs.",N
2135,"Oh man.  I'm pretty torn on this one. So...beautiful hotel, accommodating staff.  Luxurious in an understated, traditional sort of way.  (Sometimes trendy is *too* trendy...see also: W Hotel Chicago!)  And I can dig quiet luxury.  Attention to detail.   Seriously, super nice staff.  (Bonus points for the day manager being from MKE and knowing my Riverwest neighborhood!) Here's the but.  You knew it was coming. BUT... Two strikes and you're down from your four stars to three.  Well, two and-a-half strikes, actually.  I really want to give the Intercontinental 4 stars...but I can't.  Here's why. Strike 1: First night, I return from dinner in the hopes of relaxation and a nice nightcap at ""Eno"" (the hotel's wine/chocolate/cheese spot).  After extensively perusing the insanely awesome wine list and getting my heart set on a particular glass, the girl behind the bar informs me that they'll be closing.  In 10 minutes.  So...""I can buy a bottle to take to my room...but...yeahhhh.""  (Don't want/need a bottle, so no Eno for me.  No.)  Seriously?  You're a hotel bar in downtown Chicago and you're closed by 9:30?  Hrm. Strike 2:  This morning, I wake up in the hopes of hitting the Fitness Center for an early (for me!) morning jog.  Exit elevator on the level labeled FC (fitness center). Woman behind counter:  ""Just looking around?"" Me:  ""Yeah.  I was just gonna get a quick work-out in."" Her:  ""Well, you're aware you have to pay, right?  16 bucks per day, or 20 to cover your usage for your entire stay.  Still want to work out?"" Me (confused, internal dialogue running wild, finally indignant):  ""I guess I'll just wait...?"" What?  I don't get it.  I just don't. Strike 2 and-a-half: I get back from a long day out and I'm seriously crashing from massive amounts of caffeine and all I want is to take my shoes off, and my room key doesn't work.  (Sigh.)  Truck downstairs, wait in line for the one front desk worker to be able to assist me.  Key re-activated, all is well, but still.  It was sort of the straw that broke this reviewer's back. Don't get me wrong.  This place is pretty dang swanky.  It's nice.  The people are nice.  But a few too many strikes and this lady's not so apt to give that extra star.  Just sayin'.",N
2555,"I was really looking forward to a more upscale night out; a break from my usual jeans-and-tshirt pubs.  Yet once I walked in the door all I could think was, ""I wasted a new dress and an $18 cab ride down to the meatpacking district for THIS?!""   I get it, they're trying to be an exclusive, affluent bar.... but does that mean that literally EVERY SINGLE seat in the entire bar has to be reserved for bottle service?  I'm not exaggerating. And the funniest part  was that at 11 on a Saturday it was basically empty.  Really?  You think you're that cool that you fill up your entire club with bottle service parties all night long?  Well la-di-dah. I could go on and on, but clearly this place just wasn't for me.  There is a way to be a swanky, upscale club without being arrogant and uninviting.  I suggest that Victor Hotel figures that out, fast.",N
1772,"Based on the other reviews we were expecting a very small room; this was not really the case. There was plenty of room for a desk, chair, king sized bed, minibar, a closet to put all our luggage in and more. The decor in the room and the lounge was fun and contemporary. The room was super clean and the housekeeping did an excellent job. The hotel has a free concierge and a free wine ""social hour.""  They were able to hold our luggage for us all day long after we had checked out, also for free. We will be staying here again next time we go to Chicago. Tips: -Lobby is up one floor from ground level in the lounge. It's tricky to find at first. -Coffee is served in the lobby from the morning to 10am, if you are late risers and come to get coffee at 10:10, it will be gone.",N
4192,I really enjoy staying at this hotel. I have stayed there 4 times in the months of March and April. Never had a problem with anything. They even upgraded me to the 33rd floor this last time I was there because I made a comment about the high school kids running around and I didn't want to hear them. Everyone is super friendly and helpful. They always make sure you have been taken care of. The room service is great too. I love the grilled cheese and fries. :) Great meal and not highly priced because its on the kids meal. It really has been my home away from home.,N
2069,"We couldn't have had a nicer time at the Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza. My husband, daughter, and I live in Chicago but stayed there for the weekend of our wedding anniversary just to be closer to the downtown attractions and play tourist in our own town. The staff was SO sweet and so very friendly. --As nice as any of the 4 star hotels I've stayed in. I just can't stress that enough. --Just lovely people. The rooms are nice, very clean, decently appointed but nothing too fancy. The indoor pool area was great, again very clean, lots of towels. Room service was super fast and accurate. The food in the on-site restaurant was delicious and served in a very upscale manner. It's close to everything, easy access to all sorts of transportation, beautiful views of the skyline if you're on the river side, big rooms, lots to do. I'd happily stay there again. We had a great time.",N
2965,"I thought this place was nice. Stayed here for 4th of July weekend last summer because I had family in town and we didn't want to mess with the public transportation after all of the firework madness. The location was good, it is right on the river. It does take some walking to get to most touristy locations, but if you're that lazy then TAKE A CAB. Anytime you are downtown you should be prepared to walk anyway. It is practically across the street from Harry Caray's, and the bar downstairs has a nice little courtyard to enjoy a smoke in. I found the concierge very helpful and prepared with a train schedule to get me back to the 'burbs when I was ready to check out. There is an Einstein Bagels a couple of blocks away that is convenient for breakfast.",N
1292,I LOVE THE RITZ CARLTON HOTEL. I love it.   -The location is in the heart of downtown Chicago. -GREAT CONCIERGE. - The service here is EXCEPTIONAL. the bellman always comes very very quickly so don't forget to tip.   -Beautiful Christmas decorations!!!!!!!! -Very spacious bathroom -They are prompt with everything -Modern feel You won't regret staying here.   Beautiful! This is better than Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago.  I highly highly recommend it.,N
2412,"WOW!  I stayed here this past June for a company event.  I was up in the very very nice Presidential Suite for two nights.  This place was awesome!  I had the lake view from my room, 2 beds, 2 bathrooms.  Of all the places I've been to in the United States, this is the best hotel ever!  Room service was prompt, the food was delicious, the employees were extremely friendly and courteous. If you're looking to book a company event, this is a great place to do it.  This place will make an impression!",N
3527,"This place is a steal compared to the other swanky hotels off of Michigan Avenue. Yeah if you're used to staying at 4 star hotels and above this might seem like a 3 star hotel to you but it is really a deal for the location. And apparently it used to be the Radisson, but it's better than any Radisson I've seen! We stayed for 4 nights in a 1 bedroom suite with views of Lake Michigan and I only paid about $530, averaging out to about $130/night. But that's with a one room service meal and the ridiculous state tax of 11.9% + city tax 3.5% each night added on. What a deal for such a prime location! Hotel Service: Service by the concierge and front desk was pleasant and helpful. Room service was friendly but they didn't get my order right, but it was partially my fault for trying to order breakfast food at 9pm! They accomodated a late check-out at 2pm. :) Hotel Condition: Newly renovated. Halls are still a little outdated and the lobby could use some more decor, but the rooms have been furnished and decorated well. The pool wasn't open but apparently it's only open from May-Sept. Room cleanliness: Overall, pretty clean but there were some fingerprints and dust on the tables. Room comfort: Since it was a 1-bedroom suite we had ample space but the bathroom was small. The shower head was a rain shower and the pressure was very weak. However, the bed is more important and it was very comfortable. It got pretty cold because the bedroom is surrounded by windows, so we had to keep the heater running, which was pretty loud. It also helped to keep the drapes closed, but that view was so fantastic! There was a large LCD TV in each room, an iPod docking station in the parlor and the best part, an iMac computer with free wireless! I didn't even have to bring my laptop. A mini fridge is only $20 for your entire stay. I would recommend walking over to Wal-greens and buying some drinks instead of using the minibar.",N
4314,"Random fact: the Aflac duck & the three Budweiser penguins stayed at the Palmer House. My company's annual meeting was being held in Chicago this year at the Palmer House.  Unfortunately, our staff would be split between two hotels.  I was one of the lucky ones who got to stay at the Palmer House...or so I thought... Being a Hilton hotel, I expected so much more from the Palmer House.  I looked at their beautiful rooms on the internet and upon checking in noticed that they received a plaque for being a historic hotel.  Apparently, it being a ""historic"" hotel only meant it was old and creepy. LOBBY: Absolutely beautiful! The walls and ceiling has such amazing and elegant detail.  However, note that the lobby is located on the second floor. ROOMS: My room did NOT look like the rooms on their website and felt quite cold and creepy.  I walked into an outdated room the size of a large closet or tiny bedroom with a double size bed.  Who still has double beds?!   The edge of the bed was extremely close to a door that opened to a tiny closet that had a safe, iron, and ironing board.  My coworkers and I compared the bathrooms to something you might see out of a horror movie like The Shining.  There was also a TUBE tv.  Free internet?  Nope, they charge...and there isn't wireless internet, you need to use an Ethernet cable. LOCATION: A block or so from Millennium Park (home of the bean) Close to the Blue (Monroe Street exit) and Red (Adams Street exit) train lines A block from State Street shopping area Do yourself a favor, spend the extra money for one of the hotels located across the river.  You'll probably be a lot happier.",N

1311,"If a Ritz Carlton were to marry a Four Seasons (later in life) after they already established themselves (without children)... this is what you would get-- the Ritz Carlton - a Four Seasons Hotel.  Of course the Ritz Carlton would be 20 years Four Seasons senior... however a happy marriage all the same. We experienced the contemporary feel and service of the Four Seasons with the layout and history of the Ritz Carlton.  Rooms were more outdated than previous Four Seasons that I have stayed in, however moderately updated with details sprinkled around every corner. The indoor pool, sauna, and fitness center were standard for a Ritz Carlton, however the water aerobics class took up 3 of the 4 lanes in the morning.  The ice service in the afternoon was thoughtfully timed, however the turn down service did not include chocolates waiting for us on our pillows... something I always look forward to. The location was ideal for shopping and restaurants (steps from the Magnificent Mile).  We were centrally located to everything we tentatively had planned for our stay, but due to the humidity in the middle of summer -- we found ourselves enjoying the comforts of our hotel rather than walking around. When visiting Chicago in the future, I may stay here again...",N
541,"This is a step up from the typical suburban Hampton Inn, as it features Prairie Style interiors in a nod to the Midwest location. The lobby is nice, the rooms are pleasant, and so is the free continental breakfast buffet. The feature restaurant on the main floor seemingly changes yearly, but the hotel itself is fine.",N
5142,"The room was ok and comfortable with a great view of the skyline (20th floor). But a little dated. The wireless internet didn't work at all. Service at the front desk was cool. I also enjoyed  the Skyline Bar. I like the complementary buffet. Parking was pricey but so is the rest of Downtown Chicago.A few complaints -- the ""Business Center"" was horrible and charge per minute to use the computers, or per page for print/fax. Also wanted you to swipe your credit card for a $40.00 hold that was unrealistic",Y
3238,"I stayed at the Hard Rock in one of their suites as a birthday gift.  The hotel is nice and has a fabulous location if you're visiting Chicago but what really made this night was the Hard Rock staff.   When I walked into the suite there was a bottle of champagne, balloons, and cupcakes from Molly's waiting for me with a hand-written note by the girl that had a hand in arranging our entire evening.  We cracked open the champagne as we toured the suite and checked out the fantastic view from every window of our 36th floor David Bowie suite... sweet!   We had only been in the room for about 20 minutes when there's a knock at the door.   Someone from the front desk had come to check on our accommodations and deliver a complimentary bottle of wine!  Obviously the Hard Rock staff are on a mission to satisfy me in every way.  *snicker*  I meant the wine and chocolate you dirty-minded people!   After relaxing a bit we headed down to the fitness center for massages.  I was greeted by name and wished a happy birthday by the two gentlemen that were our masseurs (myself and my boyfriend).   I had never had a professional massage before so I had no idea what to expect.  All it took was a brief explanation and a quick strip and I was under the sheet for a full hour of total and blissful relaxation before going out to dinner. We ordered breakfast in our room the next morning.  I tried not to yawn in the face of the very perky and friendly young woman who delivered our breakfast and set everything up at our table for us, chattering away the entire time.  I just wanted some coffee and to watch the news, poor girl probably thought I was a bum, but she was a good sport and really great. All in all I had a fantastic experience here and would definitely recommend it.",N
2586,"I went here Saturday to celebrate a co-worker's birthday, and I had a pretty good time. There were a few problems I had with the place though- the drinks were very over priced (Im talkin $8 beers) and the place was overly packed toward the point I think they exceeded fire code. Also the DJ booth wasn't blocked off so people  constantly bumped the table causing the music to stop- very annoying.",N
4106,"Big, big, big. I don't typically stay at super hotels like this, and I tend to like a bit more personality in my lodgings, but this Hyatt is perfectly comfortable and acceptably furnished with comfy beds, standard amenities, and some decent views if you're in the right rooms. Staff service is generally good, though when a convention comes in, it can slip a bit, thanks to all the demands made on their time. Both times I have been in this hotel, though, there have been conventions, and service quality remained fairly high. Big Bar is passable, though not terribly exciting. The club/dancefloor space was rather popular when I stayed, but I wouldn't want to spend any time on the lower floors on club nights--it is tremendously loud. All in all a solid option for a short stay.",N
5552,"Now that's better. This is my second time staying at La Quinta. Room: Spacious, with an LCD TV and a workstation. The beds were average, but they did their job. The bathroom was nice but the shower was awkward. The glass was transparent. FAIL. The glass is supposed to be translucent, of course I was in the bathroom by myself but the glass (and mirror) took forever to steam up. It would have been one thing if the mirror wasn't in front of the shower but it was. I felt so weird showering. Pool and other amenities: There was an indoor pool, but Chicago is a pretty chilly place at the end of September. You really don't need to go swimming. (And who goes to Chicago for the pool in their hotel anyway?) The ""continental"" breakfast had eggs, bacon and sausage. Now THAT'S what I call a breakfast. Not waffles, fruit and assorted breads. Location: LOVED it. It was in the heart of Downtown/The Loop. I was in walking distance to State Street! There's also a Walgreens, Dunkin' Donuts, Jimmy John's, Starbucks, Chipotle and several other regional chain restaurants all right outside the front door. Miscellaneous: It's right next to an eL train station. It's pretty reasonably priced for a hotel smack dab in the heart of Chicago too. Had a great time staying here. Would definitely consider using this hotel again, if it wasn't for the self-voyeuristic shower.",N
3163,"We came in from Miami for a weekend stay  We were very pleased with the quality of service, the cleanliness of the entire hotel, and the proximity to all that is within walking distance, including Navy Pier.   We recommend this hotel to anyone who has a taste for the ""whatever"" experience that the W Hotel offers in Chicago.  We look forward to them opening up in Miami Beach in 2009.  Even though this is our home town we will go because they truly know what is takes to set an atmosphere of excellence.  Watch out for the restrooms on the first floor outside the bar once you walk in. The men can look through a glass into the women's restroom, and visa versa.  Maybe you will like it?",N
2657,"The James is an impossible boyfriend. Good-looking, smart, socially-conscious, cultured and playful. If he were a person, I'd imagine The James to kill in a suit, and dazzle just as well wearing nothing at all. Not to out-do you, but rather to elevate you. That's The James. You. Elevated. And from the start too. No coyness, no incessant wishing and hoping and waiting. He's straightforward. From the time you make reservations, concessions are made, no details are spared. It's courtship from the get-go. I'm still considered new to the city, having moved back only in October 2008. So I get to do all the touristy things and do them with glee. It's true. No sighing or eye-rolling here. I relish it all and challenge stereotypes. For my husband's birthday this year, everything seemed trite. He has enough Ben Sherman to start a boutique (though I did get him a wonderful black nylon jacket: http://tinyurl.com/qnc73p. More for me than for him, ya dig?? :-), he wants flying lessons to renew the pilot's license but we aren't yet independently wealthy. . . sad, right? So I called Jackie. I didn't know her name then, but we're emailing now. Trying to set up a lunch date too. She wants to volunteer with us. No, I don't need any more friends, but this is just how it is at The James. You fall in love with everyone. She got to know me, understood being a local but wanting to experience this great city like you just flew in for the night. And she treated us right. The James doesn't have to do much to impress, but it works as hard as it would if it were a Howard Johnson. Of course, the lobby dazzles and yes, the dog biscuits and bowl of water out front is charming but everyone is so damn nice. Ready, willing and able to do anything. Our room was crisp and modern and homey all at once. Again, the perfect boyfriend knew you were coming. Six mini-cupcakes were waiting on a tray with a note encouraging a call if we were wanton for more. The bed was tucked tight and taut, as if you'd be the first to bounce on the mattress. It said just enough about him, but not enough that the mystery wouldn't last for years. And the furniture and art work were West Elm. . . elevated. Like he invented the concept of boutique ""Luxury Liberated"", as they call it. And he probably did. Because he's perfect.",N
3117,"Yeah, I'll admit it.  Sometimes I do go here with a couple girls and hang out in the lounge because it's THAT nice.  I wonder if it's possible to live here.  No, seriously.  If so, I'm staying in Chicago for the rest of my life.",N

5465,"This place is in a really nice neighborhood of Chicago.  The outside of it has many restaurants where people ate outside providing a great atmosphere at night.   There were only 2 elevators, which weren't very fast.  The rooms were clean, but some of the stuff is really dated (the tv was CRT).  Also, the room wasn't very spacious.  The sitting chair is quite upright, and not comfortable to sit for extended periods (nice to look at tho). The good stuff is that they provide an umbrella, robe, bathroom is really nice (tub and shower - NICE), great toiletries, and the bed linens were quite nice.  It is a great business hotel, and if you stay here, you'll feel pampered.  The front desk staff is really nice, the doormen are also very nice.  The Sutton Place comes recommended.",N
4622,"Great little boutique hotel in the middle of River North! Got a great deal for the hotel at http://priceline.com -- the only drawback was that the room was near the elevators. Good thing I sleep like a rock and it doesn't bother me, but that might be something to think about if you're a light sleeper. The rooms were really cute, it was a little compact, but overall everything you needed was there. The amenities were great, everything they use is H2O, I actually didn't mind using their stuff. Usually, I have to pack my own bottles of everything but this time the hotel amenities were exactly what I wanted. However, all of that is trivial compared to the two things I use to rate a hotel - mattress and shower. The mattress was the most comfortable bed I have slept on in a hotel, you just kind of sink in and enjoy the TV. The shower was nice, nothing about it that stood out, but it was good. The service was good, and its right next to portillo's and orange. What's there not to love? I would totally stay here again, especially for that awesome priceline price!",N

It's a good choice if you're looking for a Magnificent Mile property. Though my room was comfortable and well appointed, I could hear noise coming in from the hallway. I also felt the lobby was pretty small. It was also a pain to find parking, but it's the price you pay for staying at such a great location on Michigan Avenue. There are a bunch of restaurants and shops near the hotel, though I didn't have a chance to visit them. All in all, I'd definitely come back.",Y
3799,"Nice hotel, very modern.  Located conviently downtown with walking access to the theater district and Michigan Avenue.  Wall to wall windows offer a spectacular view of the city.

2410,"I'm such a loser.  I was supposed to book a suite here 6 months ago for the election and I freaking forgot.  Not to fear, using my HH Diamond status, I pulled four, yes FOUR, rooms on my HH points from this totally sold out hotel a mere 4 days ago so we could go to the Barack rally in Grant Park and not have to deal with the Thunderdomish traffic getting out of the loop afterwards...I love you Hilton Honors Program! The rooms are a bit smaller than at other Hilton locations, but very nicely appointed and comfortable, they appear to have undergone renovation recently.  Internet is $14.95 per 24 hours, which I find to be rather exorbitant, but it is very fast. This Hilton still has a single smoking floor, thank god, so smokers, book away!   The Executive Lounge on the 24th floor has a great view of Grant Park and is a comfortable place to spend some time.  The attendants are very friendly and they keep it stocked with soda (Coke!), coffee, tea, bottled water, cookies & snacks all day.  More substantial snacks are available during the Honors Reception from 5-7 each evening, but this is one of those Hiltons that actually charges for cocktails during the reception, so boo on that.  If you are a Hilton Diamond, skip the lobby and check in on the 24th floor, no lines and the concierges up there are very fast and friendly. Several restaurants on the property, including the infamous Kitty O'Sheas, Chicago's unofficial dem rallying point during election cycles and my personal favorite place to watch election returns.  Food at all the restaurants is above average for hotel fare, if a bit pricey.  I really like the prime rib sandwich at Kitty O'Sheas - quite nicely done for a hotel bar, tender and you generally get the meat cooked the way you request it. Excellent staff overall, they did an absolutely amazing job dealing with the capacity crowds on hand for Obama and maintained a friendly and helpful demeanor in the face of crazed and drunken Dems celebrating the end of our political exile.  Although the Drake is still my favorite Hilton property in the city, this is a close second and a great option if you are looking for a nice hotel in the loop.",N
3149,"Im a huge fan of the W hotel for their sleek environment. Especially the Lakeshore one. The view is gorgeous. Make sure you get a high floor though. If you get the chance to visit Chicago and are staying here, be sure to take a jog along the water. It is amazing.",N
1050,"I would not stay at this hotel again. I can't believe that this place is still actually considered a hotel. The decor of the place is very similar to the decorations at the tower of terror at California Adventure in Disneyland. Only it looked more rugged. Random bleach stains on the carpet. The place was cheap but not worth the price. There was no water in the pool. The website does not even mention anything about the closing of the cafe that is supposedly on the site. All the amenities were older than old. The bed was more than uncomfortable. It was actually dipping in the middle. Pillows weren't fluffy. There is wifi only in the lobby. There are no places within the hotel to print boarding passes. On the upside, though, maid services were very thorough in keeping the hallways and the rooms clean. Fromt desk personnel were nice, too. And it was only minutes away from the airport.",N
5717,"The River Hotel is definitely geared toward the business traveler; if I am not mistaken I believe this hotel also operates as a Club Quarters location.  Nonetheless this hotel served me well during my weekend stay in Chicago.  I found hotel to be central to the activities which I planned.  A brief walk northbound will lead you to the Magnificent Mile and a brief walk southbound will lead you to Millennium Park.  The hotel itself definitely had a mature clientele, no ruckus or wayward people which was ok with me.  My room was awkward. Clean but very awkward.  I think the hotel did a really good job of trying to make the room as comfortable as possible, however it was pretty clear that guest rooms have been converted.  My room was not particularly large but again the hotel did a really good job of trying to accommodate guest.  There was a nice desk area that would serve the business traveler well.  A mini-fridge and microwave was also on hand.  The bed was not remarkable, but it was clean.  My only true gripe about the River Hotel is definitely the bathroom.  I am a woman; so bathrooms are important.  Not only did it appear as if this bathroom was converted from a former closet, there was no bath tub.  It's not that I wanted to take a bath, I just like to be able to distinguish my bathing space from the rest of the bathroom and this was not possible with the shower stall which was provided.  If you are just looking for a place to set down your belongings and beat the streets...this hotel will serve you well.",N
2788,"My wife and I just celebrated our five-year anniversary and spent a night The James. Our stay was fantastic. Upon arrival I mentioned our celebration. Later that afternoon in-room dining delivered a special congratulatory gift with a personalized card. We also had use of the house car, which was terrific. Booked through Hotwire then upgraded to a junior suite for a small fee. Good call. What we especially appreciated was a standard 2p check-in. Even better, the standard check out time is 2p, which gave us plenty of time to have a leisurely lunch and visit to the Apple store with plenty of time to spare. The only surprise was $50 per night for parking, so unless you need in and out privileges, go with self-park. You can't beat the location: one block off Michigan Ave  in the heart of the mag mile. Overall, kudos to The James for helping to make our weekend especially memorable.",N
3085,"Much better than the City Center W Hotel if you are trying to decide. I stay at many W's around the country, and here, the rooms had are pretty standard, fairly good sized bathroom, rainwater shower and a great daybed. I was on the 32nd and my room had a great view of the Navy pier. They also have telescopes by the elevators for viewing. My flight home was cancelled and I had to stay an extra night in Chicago, so I moved to from the City Center to the Lakeshore - HUGE difference. If you want to pick an SPG property in Chicago I'd pick this. Also they have a cool top-floor bar (Whisky Sky) which has a nice view over the city and some solid drinks. Carly took care of me :)",N
3298,"FAB metropolitan hotel... LOVE this place !   Gorgeous space, gorgeous rooms, gorgeous people.   The Carbide and Carbon building is my favorite in Chicago & I have a birds-eye view from my office windows...Base Bar is the best modern lounge spot in the city if you are looking for a spot of chic - the whole feel of Hard Rock is comparable to the Opus in Vancouver, which is one of my absolute fave hotels in the world.   Would recommend the Hard Rock to anyone coming to Chicago looking for a memorable stay.",N
3236,"Thanks for the yuks, Hard Rock Hotel.  My stay here was perfectly amenable, and, come to think of it, pretty much what I expected.  I've been juggling my hotel choices a little upon my trips to your town, and thought I'd give the Hard Rock a whirl.  The verdict?  About par for the course for a mainstream downtown Chicago stopover:  clean, comfy room, plenty of space, free wi-fi (which I gushed over..seriously, hotel people, sometimes it's really easy to make geeks happy), and a doorway to the Michigan Avenue whatnot that keeps those of us still learning our way around from seeming completely lost. Things I wasn't as crazy about included the fact that the shower door doesn't close (it looks cool but inevitably you end up with a floor half full of water), and actually, that's not quite true.  There's no shower door at all, just a pane of glass and an opening.  I tried the downstairs bar, which was fine and appeared to be full of good company, but a little on the small side.   Bottom line, the Hard Rock Hotel tows the line you think they would:  staffers occasionally referencing you as ""my man,"" bellmen with the emo mustache, and space with all of the requisite memorabilia you might expect.  And my stay there was pleasant, definitely.  But I wouldn't shine a spot light on it and call it fifteen minutes of fame, either.",N
2918,"We stayed here because the hotel was convenient but it's definitely not a Westin.   We received an ""upgrade"" and had a great view.  But the room was absolutely awful.  Flushing the toilet was an ordeal as it was so noisy. The flat screen TV was in contrast to the aging furniture and decor.   For the amount of money we were paying, the value was minimal.   Despite having a Do Not Disturb sign on the door, housekeeping called to ask a question.  What's the point?  The front desk gave a room key without checking ID, which is very scary.",N
5402,"We just stayed at the Indigo...clean, convenient, but would never go back. Their reduced rate was still higher than other hotels in the neighborhood and not worth it. The rooms are very small and neither room we were offered had dressers for clothing, the first room did not even have a closet! The heating system & blowers were so loud and woke us almost hourly through the night; they did nothing to fix the situation and it was truly miserable. If you want food while there, they have it delivered from a mediocre restaurant across the street. Look elsewhere!",Y
3698,"I stayed at The Drake with my family for about 5 days in June 2009. We LOVED it. I booked my hotel on Priceline and was SUPER excited when we landed here. I love staying at older hotels like this. Everything was very clean and elegant. The restaurants are expensive, but that is to be expected. We even got a bit of a room upgrade just for asking. Everyone we interacted with was really enjoyable and helpful. Oh and my 3 year old daughter loved the couches in the elevators.",N

The staff was helpful, and the room was large and well decorated.   I was staying in Chicago on business, and the hotel's proximity to everything was excellent.  There are a number of great restaurants nearby, and it's only two blocks from Millenium Park - where I was fortunate enough to catch a free outdoor Blues concert.",N
5391,"While the Seneca Hotel could not be better located in downtown Chicago it was a truly great experience.  Unlike others who have written reviews, I found the staff to all be very friendly, professional and eager to help in any way possible.  None of the negative concerns expressed by other reviews did I find to be our experience. Flat panel TVs, WiFi, spa tub, all upgrades from the big chains costing at least twice as much. Our room was clean, neat, well appointed, quiet and very spacious.  The bed was as comfortable as any hotel I've visited outside of Hong Kong.  Having access and/or the use of a refrig/micro/sink made our stay seem much more relaxing then a standard non-appointed room where running to the ice machine is the norm.  Based on our last stay, this is our new hotel of choice when visiting Chicago.  My only hesistation in not writing this review earlier is that I wanted to keep this new found ""best value for the money"" find a secret.  Give it a try, and if you find something you want changed, just ask, and I'm sure that the accomodating staff will do their best to resolve your concern.",Y
1478,"I would say the suites are 'cozy', but definitely suit the needs of a business traveler.  The beds are comfy, the bathroom is nice.  They even give you bath salts.

1792,"Ok...so this place isn't for anyone and I hated it when I first walked in.  By the time I left, I'd gotten used to the place and even kind of forgot some of the negatives.  It was an average stay. Room size for several rooms is EXTREMELY small.  I think they tried to do what they could with what they had.  It is, after all, a vintage 1926 building.  I was extremely disappointed with the room size, and, at first, put off by the decor.  My eyes eventually settled and adjusted though.  Also, it seems to make sense with the boutique theme of the hotel. On the positive, the service was good but uneven at times.  ""Superbad"" at the counter was wonderful and even showed my friend and I a bigger room because we had asked to see one.  Other front desk folks were average to below average for a four star place.  I never used the concierge.  The doormen were friendly and helpful.  Location is good.  Readily accessible to the Washington/Wells station on the ""L"".  Also several bus lines run nearby.  You are literally next door to Chicago City Hall and in the same building as the Cadillac Theatre and a few minutes walk from the iconic Chicago Theatre and the Oriental Theatre.  You're about a 10-15 minute walk from the Willis Tower and about two blocks south of the Chicago River.   The free wine is a great amenity nightly, and they bring some nice appetizers over from the 312 Chicago...a restaurant that is co-located in the building.  The food was good (had room service breakfast) and the amenities were enjoyable.   Beds were nice and comfy.  Showers good and powerful.  The housekeeping crew was tremendously nice and helpful.  The place is brand new and clean having just been renovated last year. Negatives?  The wireless internet was a continuous problem.  Two days, it worked fabulously, and two days it just plain was un-usably slow.  I had to go down to the lobby.  The maintenance crew barged in on me after two quick knocks one day.  I get why they did it, but I still don't get the decor for sure.  It's such a mismash of things.  My bathroom in my room was very small.  The sink was very odd, too.  It tended to allow water to swash out everywhere. If you're expecting a run-of-the-mill hotel experience, go to the Holiday Inn.  This is a boutique hotel, and it will not appeal to everyone.  I appreciate what Kimpton is trying to do with this property.  It's definitely a different experience than I've ever had at another hotel.   I might take another shot at the Allegro with another room someday.  Fun and disappointment mixed together for an average stay.",N

I don't love everything about this hotel -- the modern face-lift on old infrastructure shows through sometimes -- but it is a great hotel at not-unreasonable rates. They also have free wifi, which every hotel in the world should offer, but for some reason many still charge $10+/day (crazy).",N
5461,"The Sutton Place is absolutely fabulous.  My girlfriend and I stayed there for her birthday and for an extended weekend.  That was only three weeks ago and we miss it already.   The Sutton Place is in one of the nicest area in Chicago; the Gold Coast.  The place was centrally located for everything.  The Bellman and front desk was extremely friendly for directions and recommendations.  The rooms were clean with comfortable beds.  The Electronics were a bit dated with no IPOD connection and the Bathrooms were a little dated but again very clean.  I do hope they reinvest for some modern decor and upgrades, but neverless we will stay there again.   The Whiskey Bar and Mexx was a cool place to have drinks with an urban lounge atmosphere.  The place is directly across the street from the Frog Bar, Gibson Steakhouse, and Taverns on the Rush.  All cool upscale bars and dining.  If you want the dive scene, that is only two blocks away.   I recommend this hotel for service, atmosphere, the value ( you will be suprised with other hotels in the same price range), and the location.  You can't go wrong with this place.  I am planning on going back with the girl real soon, and we will be staying there.",N

2539,"(Just to preface this, I registered for Yelp just to write this review) We arrived at Victor Hotel shortly after doors opened (around 9:15 - 9:30pm) for their NYE party. There was a good sized line outside, but it couldn't have been more than 100 or so actually outside. We assumed we'd be in line for about 20 - 30 minutes top before we'd get in. Boy, were we wrong. We spent the first 20 minutes in line, only to find out that we actually had to pick up our tickets from another gentleman towards the front of the line. So we got out of line, made our way to the front, got our tickets, and got back in line towards the back. Some time passes and now it's about 10:30pm, and those of us in line are now becoming impatient. We've been in line for over an hour now, and the line doesn't seem to be moving. Finally, one of the gentleman managing the line informs us Victor Hotel will refund our tickets if we decide to leave and bring our tickets back the next day. I was willing to do this but our group had already spent quite a bit of time and money getting there (I'd spent $20 on cab fare just to get there and would have to do the same thing if I decided to come back for a refund the next day), so our group decided to wait it out in hopes we'd get in soon and start to enjoy our night. It began to rain...but we still waited it out since one of the employees informed us we'd be in within 15 - 20 minutes. 30 minutes later, we were finally in getting our coats checked. It's 11:00pm by now. I learned that they had one single person giving out tickets for coat check, and maybe another couple people actually hanging coats. That's right, for the hundreds and hundreds of people in attendance, they had only a few people managing the coat check process which was easily the biggest reason for the slow moving line. We make it into the main part of the club only to find a sea of people we'd have to wade through to get a drink. We found a small spot and decided to park it there and try to get drinks. That didn't happen. We waited another half hour before my girlfriend and I decided we'd had enough. We left at 11:30pm, after waiting in line for over an hour in the rain, waiting for a single drink another half hour, never receiving a single refreshment. We raced home in a cab hoping to get to Dominick's before it closed in order to get drink we had sought after the whole night. I got out of Dominick's at 11:59pm, just in time to celebrate the New Years with my girlfriend. We kissed in the parking lot of Dominick's, watching the fireworks being set off in the distance. Although not ideal, I was at least with the person I wanted to be with that night. ---- Here comes part 2. I thought I was done dealing with these folks, but I was wrong. I started receiving text messages from these guys a couple weeks later telling me to come back for specials. Needless to say, I was infuriated. I hadn't opted into any SMS communications, not to mention the messages they sent didn't include any instructions for opting out of this marketing bullshit. I searched around and found the service they were using to send out these messages (http://texthub.com/) and found the tiny little link in their footer allowed you to opt out of their messages. To be frank, this type of communication is illegal (as I did not opt-in knowingly) and they provided no method for unsubscribing to the messages via SMS (as outlined by the CAN-SPAM act). Stay away from this place. At all costs. Far away.",N

It was my Birthday weekend and""W""-Insider Jessica Young took the time to send me a little birthday platter of goodies! AND this ""W"" had a particularly AWESOME fruity smell coming from around the elevators.  Two little examples of how the hotel serves and comforts its guest.   I chose, will recommend and will stay at the W City Center again instead the more socially centric W Lakeshore for a number of reasons.  Since it caters to business travellers it tends to have much better weekend rates.  It is also very close to the Sears Tower, Greek Town (I'm Greek so it was important I go see how my people are doing) Millennium Park (The Silver Bean) and Grant Park (The Fountain from Married: with Children).  Plus there is a Loop stop at the corner AND a water taxi stop down a block that will take you to the Navy Pier.  Can't go wrong at the W!",N
838,"Was able to get a room in a pinch on a very busy convention weekend in Chicago. That was the best part of this place. I'd second a lot of the other comments although I'm not sure why the ratings were otherwise so high. The rate was good for a hotel in a good location in Chicago. I had a decent sized suite with really all the amenities you'd expect in a hotel - including a safe, which I feel is a rare find these days. The bad: The train is an issue. We were on the 5th floor facing the train. It was loud enough to be annoying, but really did not keep me up. I could see it being a huge problem in 3rd floor rooms. The bed and mattress were old and creaky, and the room was really dry, so I really didn't get a good night sleep either night I was there. Finally, there was absolutely no style. It was all beige, tan, and lightly stained wood with Target-esque faux modern light fixtures. Blah.",N

455,"I stayed at the Wheeler last September with my wife. I contacted their office to reserve a particular room that we had stayed in on a previous visit. Stephanie returned my email and confirmed my reservation. However, when I arrived, I was told the room I reserved was unavailable, and that they would substitute another room. The reason the room was unavailable was because the entire hotel (except for the room they gave us) was being renovated. Now, I'm no fool. You don't just forget that you are renovating your entire hotel. They had to know the room was unavailable when I booked it, but they did not tell me until after I arrived and they had my non-refundable deposit. This is the worst possible service, deliberately lying to your customers. Although the room I was given was very nice (and larger than the room I asked for), my attempt to recreate a previous special getaway was ruined. I really wish I could give them a higher rating, because the mansion is very beautiful inside, and the rooms are extremely comfortable. The breakfast in the morning was also great. Everything about the place is relaxing and luxurious. This could be such a wonderful place to visit, but I don't feel I can recommend it to anyone because of their current management. Edit: I have been informed that the Wheeler is now under new management. The building and amenities were always four stars in my book, and so I now feel comfortable recommending it for special occasions. I have adjusted the rating from two stars to four.",N

I also asked for some bathroom slippers.  My coworker asked for a razor and got shaving cream too (how considerate!), and even nail polish remover and a curling iron!  Now, that really tells me they mean business when they call it SERVICE express.  I really like the Grille downstairs too.  They have a really great bar where most of my coworkers socialized every night, and had some meals.  Good grill food, amazing cocktails (I love it when bartenders take their cocktails seriously).   My only complaint is that they don't have the flat screen tvs here yet.  I've stayed at the Westin in Philadelphia, and the TV's really bring it up a notch.

Internet is fast but $19.95 a day?  really?  Come one I am not teleporting crap to my room using your broadband.  That is a bit much. about twice as much as I usually pay at hotels..

The TV is big but outdated.  (ever here of flat screens?  Well actually it is a flat screen in the room but not a plasma LCD that most people call a flat screen.  its the tube kind with an actual flat screen.  I have been here 2 days and have not turned it on yet though. bathroom is outdated but functional.  Soaps and shampoos are your typical Hilton brand.   Don't expect a view for most of the rooms.  Like I said this is my 3rd time here and every time I have a view of several other rooms outside my window.  Peeping toms holla! I am staying on the executive floor so that is at least nice.  I booked a regualr king room on http://hotels.com.  Being an HHonors member they are letting me check out at 1 free of charge which is nice but i usually get that granted anywhere I stay. Location is nice.  Close to pretty much anything and everything.  for work I do trade shows and events so McCormick is where I go when I stay here.

1202,"If you're attending a conference at the convention center, the Hyatt Regency is tough to beat. It's connected to the center by a hallway and has big screen TVs in the lobby which list convention locations (as well as weather and metro routes into the city). While a very busy lobby, the staff moved people through at a reasonable pace with a concierge and valets who kept taxis in a respectful line back from the door before whistling them to advance. The rooms are also nice with comfortable beds, ready access cords for computers, flat screen TV as well as smaller touches (not only did they have the complimentary shampoo and conditioner, but they had toothpaste in the room). There's two drawbacks to the Hyatt. The first is the location. It can't be entirely helped since it's part of the convention center complex, but it's a decent distance from the downtown and tourist sites. It's a walkable distance, but plan on a brisk 30 minute walk before you start to get to areas that are interesting. The second drawback is that apparently the walls are thin. Noises in the hallway seem magnified and you can even hear the squeak of doorhandles turning in the hallway. Conversations in the adjacent rooms are easy to hear (sadly, the conversations in the rooms next to me were fairly mundane); don't discuss something that you don't want to see on a blog 15 minutes later here.",N

I can't even begin on what a rip off that is. 2)  As a Gold or Platinum member, you always get a complimentary water bottle in your room.  They do not offer that option here and you have to make a fuss about it before they give you one. 3) They do not have wireless internet.  It is 2010- enough said.

My biggest complaint was the damn elevator!  I think that this hotel has the worst elevator in all of Chicago, I was only on the 7th floor and it still took forever for the  elevator to reach the floor. Although there was a computer room with free color printing, I would have loved to have wifi in the room as well. The bathroom was tiny and reminded me of those small bathrooms they have in most hotels in europe, with no bathtub and a really small corner  shower. The gym was nice and had super clean equipment and free weights. It was always quite and had a great view of the city. What was great about the Allerton was the location, it was easy to get around and was close to most major attractions.",N
741,"We stay here 90% of the time while in Chicago.   *It's an excellent location that is a $15 cab ride from just about everything *Good bar *Nice food in the bar...chicken pot pie! *Great beds *Clean lobby *Updated look to the rooms *Solid workout room *Attentive staff As long as it's under $300 per night, the Westin is an excellent value. And I got some!",N
5653,"I normally avoid ""business"" hotels, but, if you want a gorgeously comfy room with a lovely modern decor, stay here. (The lobby and bar are kind of boring, but the rooms are beautiful.) It's downtown, just off Michigan Ave., so it's close to great Magnificent Mile shopping and loads of restaurants. I recommend the very short walk to the Sofitel Hotel on Chestnut for Sunday brunch. It will make your trip.",N
4445,"A beautiful hotel right in the middle of downtown Chicago. I've been to several meetings and conferences here and everything is top-notch. It's also a very historical hotel so gives you a really nice feeling of being part of something older instead of all those new, fancy, ""edgy"" hotels you can find elsewhere. I'd definitely recommend it, especially if you are visiting Chicago.",N
4948,"Chicago's Crowne Plaza Avenue Hotel Downtown (formerly Avenue Hotel) is probably my favorite hotel in the city. Not only is the hotel beautiful and chic, but the guest rooms are a good size, definitely the largest I have had the pleasure of staying in and the service is top notch. A girlfriend of mine was visiting from out of town, and I went for a visit. I absolutely love the hospitality world, and the Crowne Plaza did not disappoint. The decor is charming, especially the zebra chair - LOVE IT!!! Their beds are incredibly comfortable and in my opinion can't be beat. Best of all, breakfast on the 40th floor overlooking the city - just amazing!If you are traveling to Chicago and need a luxurious place to rest your head, this is it!",Y
2159,"I enjoyed a brief stay at the Intercontinental and I have to say that I was fairly impressed. From what I saw of the facilities, they are nice. Fairly well-kept if not a tad bit dated. My companion was laughing a little at the decor in the guestroom. It seemed inspired by Cirque du Soleil, oddly enough. I was NOT laughing at the view though! Straight down onto the Michigan Avenue bridge. Simply gorgeous!! They have an outstanding concierge desk. Maria went out of her way to assist me. I also appreciate that when I called at 6am for a toothbrush, it arrived within just a few minutes!",N
3289,"Okay, not going to talk about parking because parking is just bad everywhere and you will pay a lot to do it.  'nuff said!  I guess the hotel is a good idea in concept but the execution is poor.  The rooms are tiny as are the bathrooms and the amenities are cheap compared to similarlly priced hotels.  The front desk staff is friendly in an icey kind of way which was a surprise because this is not an exclusive hotel....far from it.  It actually reminds me of a cheap European hotel in decor and amenities. They have the obligatory Hard Rock Shop for your trinkets and clothes.  The dining room breakfast buffet is aweful for the price.  However, if you aren't too concerned about your comfort while you are in Chicago this hotel is in a great location and there is a Starbucks just a block away!",N
2095,"I attended a wedding here last weekend, and had a blast!  I'm sure the actual site had little to do with the fun, but the bartenders were happy to keep the beverages flowing!  The food was some of the best ""wedding food"" I've had!  I highly recommend this site if you're looking for a place to host an event.  I'm guessing it's expensive, but since I didn't foot the bill, I have no idea.  :)",N
334,"You can't beat the price! I was traveling alone for a conference and didn't want to over-spend my funding. Travelodge was referred to as the ""ghetto"" hotel by all the other conference attendees, but I was the only one who GOT FREE INTERNET. Plus, my room was AT LEAST 1/2 the price of what they paid. While not luxurious, it definitely was not a sink hole. I stayed for a week and got to know the staff fairly well. They were friendly and always promptly responded if I needed assistance (like extra coffee or an ironing board). I felt COMPLETELY safe in the hotel and in the surrounding proximity. The hotel is half a block from Lake Michigan and Buckingham Fountain. It's close to the red line, major cta bus routes, and Lou Malnati's pizza. If you call the headquarters to book a room and then find a lower rate, you just fill out a form online and they match the rate PLUS give you a 10% discount. GREAT for people wanting to be IN the heart of Chicago without paying 150-200 dollars per night. With taxes and charges, I spent 7 nights for $600 (on Memorial Day weekend, no less).",N
3188,"I have stayed at the W (Lakeshore Drive) a handful of times, and I have never been disappointed. The staff is very polite, the rooms are well appointed, and the scene/atmosphere is very young and trendy. One of my favorite aspects of this hotel is a very very small thing, and  is something you might expect from the Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton's and Peninsulas of Chicago. The W changes out their elevator rugs three times a day. In the morning it reads, Good Morning, in the afternoon, Good Afternoon, and in the evening, you guessed it, Good Evening. Like I said, this is a very minor detail, but in my opinion, it's the kind of detail that helps justify the price and set  the hotel apart from others. I would like to make a couple comments on some of the reviews I have read on this hotel. In regards to the Silver Wall at the hotels main entrance, I think this is a lot less tacky/gaudy then a lot of other reviewers because I believe it is one, intentional and two, a good fit with the hotels overall theme. I would agree that, if a Four Seasons had this outside of its front doors that yes, it would be tacky, but the W is all about young people having a good time and in my opinion, it works. I also agree with the reviewers who said this is not a family hotel.... not that families are unwelcome, but I would be a little uncomfortable with one of my parents going to the bathroom and/or taking a shower in a bathroom without an actual door. The beds in the rooms are very comfortable. They have that softness that you know you couldn't sleep on every night, but is heaven for a night or two. The gym at the W is not great, but does have enough equipment to get the job done. I have not been to the spa, but I have heard good things. The lobby bar and the Whiskey Bar upstairs (great view) are both great, and get very crowded on the weekends and are an awesome spot to spend your night or stop in for a nightcap before you head to your room. Overall, I like this hotel and will definitely return, if you are looking for a fun hotel to stay at, the W is one of the best choices in Chicago.",N
1668,"We stayed here: 1. Because they are pet friendly 2. Because they had the best rates downtown 3. Parking was only (ha) $36 for the night I was researching places to stay in Chicago for a good week before deciding on Hotel Allegro. It was nice they weren't charging the $50-100 pet fee other hotels in the area seem to think is normal. Also, they didn't have a size restriction. Our dog isn't huge, but she's about 50lbs and a lot of other hotels have a max of 25-30lbs. Dog racists if you ask me! There isn't any grass near the hotel that we could find (within 5 blocks at least) so if your dog needs grass to go, I would look elsewhere. Parking was a bitch. The parking garage isn't connected to the hotel, so you're stuck lugging your suitcases, purse, dog etc. down the busy sidewalks of Chicago. It's only half a block away but when you have a ton of crap, it seems like miles. The room was nice and CLEAN. And it was really quiet the whole time we were there. My only complaint about the room itself was the fact our thermostat was broken and we were freezing the whole night. It was stuck in the ""on"" position at 67 degrees, there was no way to turn off the fan or anything. We were able to walk to Michigan Ave quite easily from this location, and the Sears tower is close by.",N
1523,"The one and only time we've ever visited Chicago, we stayed here. It was on a recommended hotel list by family of friends who were hosting a wedding outside of town. So glad we picked this place from the list! This hotel is definitely more bang for your buck than most of the hotels in the area that I was also researching. To tip the scales even more in the right direction of price, we booked our stay with a ""Chi-Town City Escape Package"" that the hotel was promoting (now until 9/5/11) and they give... yes give you a $50 gift card + $20 food voucher per day. SCORE!!! Upon check-in, we were handed the gift card. I had to ask about the voucher process a few times, but I finally cleared it up with a staff member in the know and they said the per day food voucher total would be deducted from any food and beverage charges (room service or restaurant dine in) from your final bill. SWEET! * Really friendly staff and speedy check-in. * Our room was really spacious and looked recently remodeled. * Excellent location and views from the higher floors. * They have HBO. * The Keurig coffee maker is a plus! * No pool, but you're a couple blocks away from Mag Mile -- go shop instead! * There was no fridge, but we also didn't think we could ask for one so we didn't. * The AC was a little warmer than we like and there seemed to be no thermostat control, but it sufficed considering it was a muggy 80+ degrees outside the few days we were in town. * Big bathroom, but the tub had seen better days and didn't drain too well. I highly recommend this hotel if you want to be in the middle of everything and have close access to public transportation.",N
637,"I had no real experience with the Doubletree, but seeing as it was a Hilton, I had some expectations.  Upon inspecting the website, the rooms looked very sophisticated and modern.  When arriving the main lobby was very spacious, smelled amazing and had many friendly employees to help out.  They gave us our free cookies and kept them coming throughout the stay.  However, once arriving to our floor (4th), the experience started a downward spiral.  The hallway was not air conditioned, and extremely muggy and hot.  Our unit was nice and cool, however did not have the flat screen television that was on the website, but our 27 inch tv was fine.  Other electronic snafus included the house phone on the nightstand not working as well as our mini-fridge having a sensory-based system so we couldn't even take out the items to keep our drinks cool.  There were also snacks upon the counter that the stated that it was electronically weighed and if you touch it, you will be charged.  Families traveling with small children must have a lot of charges!  The cleanliness of the bathroom was less than desired.  There was painted-over mold on the ceiling as well as chipping paint.  Likewise, there were stains on the wall above one of the beds.  The blankets were amazing and down, however the pillows were too soft and there were no extra blankets.  The satellite also went out multiple times, which was probably due to storms at least one night.   The location was very convenient and riding the CTA wasn't challenging at all.  Due to the few issues we had with cleanliness and electronics, I may be deterred from staying here again.",N
767,"Two stars may be a stretch. I live down the street, but my company was having a sales contest where  you could stay at the hotel for two nights if you won. So, the room was a sauna and we had to sleep with the window open each night. It gets two starts b/c the front desk was nice enough to give me an upgrade with a killer view of the lake. I was excited to use the Reebok Gym. For those who are not gym rats, these are great gym with TVs built into bikes, treadmills, etc. they have it all.  I went down around 6:30 and there was no water! I called and they said they would send it up. No biggie. I get on the exercise bike and there is only one that has straps. For those who bike, you know you need the straps, so I use the one with the straps and the TV does not work. I check the one next to it and the TV does work. I swap the straps. Start riding and there are only two channels. An hour into my work out and still no water. I called again and they said it would be right up. After 1.5 hours and no water I called it a day.   That night, I called the front desk to get a mini-bar key and they were so RUDE! I cannot believe how rude they were. I will not recommend this hotel to anyone until they get their act together!",N
1161,"My room was clean enough, but the hotel is old and dingy.  The consistent smell of air freshener in the hallways made me wonder what they were trying to cover up.   The staff were friendly enough, but not terribly helpful.  I must have been staying below a family of elephants as the noise from above was unbelievable.  Oh, and the bed in my room was about as soft as a pallet of cement blocks.   Who cares if the parking is free -- I say stay somewhere else.",N
4819,I am in love with this hotel from the art work and restaurant on the first floor to the rooftop bar and music it is the best. we recently opened a business in Chicago and used the hotel to interview potential employees also a 5 star experience. One of the managers in the first floor restaurant is especially helpful and customer service is excellent. We are from Cleveland and tell all of our friends to stay there or at least go rooftop for drinks (hurry spring) French fries and mini cupcakes are especially tasty.n.b.,Y
3720,"Loved staying here for the perfect location, is centrally located to meet all your needs of good food and shops. The hotel needs a little bit of remodeling but what can you say about a hotel that has been around for years and is so ""Iconic"", they planned on remodeling is what the gentlemen stated, so will see on our next trip. The staff was very friendly and the concierge set up reservations at a great steakhouse. Will be back.",N
1052,"Events that have transpired since: - Was hit on and invited into the room of a robot impersonator (while in costume) who made up a basketball contract story. He lives there, the door on the second floor with finger swipes in silver paint. - Have found the wireless extremely impossible to access, only way to attempt it is late at night when said ""tin man"" is up and around which I am forced to awkwardly encounter. -Watched a drunk guy break a lamppost in the parking lot. -Have an old TV now that gets a grainy 3 channels. -Screamed from burning water in irregular shower pressure. -Seen an offering of diet coke made to plastic shrubbery. -Found out ""Bistro 90"" (named after the interstate) is closed. -Etc. Whatever that may entail. It's a combination of entertaining, frustrating and disturbing.",N
189,"Five of us stayed here before my wedding, and while the room was clean and comfortable, our stay could have been much, much better. The day of check-in, it was raining.  We had quite a bit of things with us, and the bell hops did a pretty miserable job of bringing them in.  Worst of all, they had my wedding dress dragging on the floor and dropped my mom's dress for the wedding on the ground outside.   We had booked the suite well in advance, and got a pretty sweet deal online.   Upon check-in, Abraham mentions to us that there are no suites we had booked (2 beds in a separate bedroom, plus the fold-out couch in the living room separated by a door) left, so we'll have to take a smaller room.  We balked at this, and he insisted there was nothing that could be done.. until we asked to speak to the manager.  Then, miraculously, he found a suite for us.  Funny how that works.. The room itself was fine, but a few tweaks could have made our stay much more pleasant.  This is the only hotel I have ever stayed in that did not have an exhaust fan in the bathroom.  And for whatever reason, we were only given two rolls of toilet paper for five people for two and a half days.. even when our room was cleaned, no new rolls were given to us.   The business center charged the standard BS fees of something like $15 for 10 minutes of internet and $10 to print a few pages out.. and the parking at the hotel was close to $50 a night.  There is much cheaper parking a few blocks away, FYI.   I could see this hotel working for someone who just needs a bed to crash in that is conveniently located, but I would not stay here again for a special event and would not recommend this place to anyone.",N
2587,"The only reason I went here was for a friends birthday. They had a table reserved and we had a good time! Not because of anything the bar provided. Not impressed and wouldn't go back. The crowd was lacking...people. No Thanks, I'm all set!",N
4388,"I came to Chicago for the first time with my architecture school classmates.  We were all a bit hesitant about spending so much for a hotel (as most college students are) but in hindsight it was a wonderful decision.  The staff was very courteous and prompt, especially while dealing with our group of about 45.  We had a maintenance problem in our room that was fixed right away.  The amenities were great- and well taken care of.   The location was great, with easy access to transportation in the area.   It was a most enjoyable experience... a simply stunning building... and I recommended it to anyone staying in the City.",N
3526,For $100/night it wasn't bad. Just steps off of Michigan Ave. Great views of the city. Slept comfortably. Staff was friendly and valet parking was a breeze. The Elephant and Castle restaurant located just off the lobby is a great attraction too. Great for after dinner drinks and desserts. Definitely would stay again!,N
1918,"For a W hotel, this one falls short.  Room are very small.  Service was great, but it definitely does not have the same W feel as the others I've stayed at.",N
2212,"This is such a nice hotel! A couple friends and I had a girls night out (er, night in, since we were all a little tired on a Fri. night) last weekend. I will admit I used the wrong set of elevators, and I felt like a huge dork.  Well, I wasn't paying attention to notice two sets of elevators (on opposite sides of the hotel).  Oops. We didn't check out the restaurant/bars in the hotel, but they looked pretty interesting to try at another time. Our room was nice, and we had a decent view of Michigan Ave. Is it weird to comment that the bathroom in our room was well lit? I will, anyway, but it's only because I like a bright bathroom, esp. in hotels. A good hotel to recommend to out of towners....well, also to those in Chicago!",N
4582,"Beautiful hotel. Everyone was so nice and accommodating. Our rooms were so unique as well. The hotel was packed full of people for Lollapalooza, but they still took care of all of us wonderfully. I would definitely stay there again.",N
639,"I enjoyed my 3 night stay  here. The only thing I didn't like about my room was that it didn't have a microwave or  a fridge. I mean they provided us with chilled alcohol and water in this mini cooler looking thing and also candies and snacks (none of these we touched). lol Also, for some odd reason...i noticed that hilton hotels do not have any fans in the restrooms. lol Other than that, I loved their beds and their cookies. I asked for their delicious cookies when I checked in, walked out of the hotel, came in the hotel, and checked out of the hotel.  lol  It's that good!   We stayed on the 18th floor so we got a nice view of the swimming pool and downtown. This location is great, close to the navy pier and you can just walk to all the shops.",N
4086,"It's a nice clean hotel located in downtown Chicago. Went to Chicago for a business conference. the conference itself was located at Hyatt McCormick, but we stayed at the HRC, which is OK. Less lobby traffic. Got a room on the 30th floor. The view is OK. Overlooking some construction site. There are lots of bars in the hotel but lack decent breakfast place. Which is a little disappointing considering it's primary a business oriented hotel. Nothing amazing or outstanding. Expensive for what you get... 200+ / night without wifi really kind of sucks. Wouldn't stay there as a personal trip, but OK for business.",N
5129,"Pros: great location right on Magnificent Mile.  15-minute walk from Art Institute, 10-minute walk from Millennium Park, 10-minute walk from Hancock Tower, 15-minutes walk from Navy Pier, etc.  Our upgraded room was spacious but the furnishings are a bit dated.  There's a Starbucks right next to the lobby so it's easy to grab a coffee if that's your thing.Cons: inconsistent service.  The valet attendant that took our car greeted us with service that you'd expect from someone at a car pound.  We asked for a crib upon checking in and reminded the front desk again upon leaving our room for a stroll up Mag Mile and dinner.  The crib was nowhere to be found when we returned.  Service was fine in other areas.Conclusion: If you expect a five-star hotel due to the Intercontinental name, then you'll be disappointed.  This is a 3.5-star hotel in a 5-star building with a 5-star location.",Y
404,Pretty good place but mostly for location. Considering the price that they charge there during busy times you might as well stay at the W or something that has more character. But can't beat the location... it's right in the middle of everything. Coming to downtown for some work meetings it was nice to stay basically across the street from where i needed to be.,N
3606,"I took my mom to the Drake for an afternoon tea on her birthday and I was very impressed. The room the afternoon tea is held in is gorgeous, with a harpist if you get there after 2pm. The harp music was beautiful; she played everything from ""Happy Birthday"" to ""Beauty and the Beast"" - both classics. The tea was great, but some of the food could have been bigger and better. Because I mentioned I was coming there for a birthday, my mom received an extra piece of birthday cake, which was the breakout performer of the meal. It's also worth mentioning that if you come there for an afternoon tea, they will validate your valet parking pass for $13. It was an overall very expensive afternoon, but my mom and I had a great time drinking tea and then exploring the hotel and accidentally interrupting meetings.",N
4766,"I attended a wedding here last month, and it was fantastic!  The room was beautiful and the sauteed garlic shrimp appetizer was to die for.  Seriously, that was probably the best thing I've ever eaten at a wedding.  I want to go back for more!  It was a pretty big wedding of over 300 people, but I dont think that is an excuse for nothing but exceptional service.  Our corner table was forgotten a few times, and I even had to get up to ask someone to deliver our pasta dish.  All in all, the food was good even if the service wasn't.  Plus, I loved the room the wedding was in.  I'd definitely recommend checking it out for your wedding.",Y
405,"I love Hilton properties.  I just do. The best thing about this hotel is the pool.  The first 2 nights I was there, it was closed for maintenance, which was a disappointment, but when they reopened it, it was IMMACULATE.  Gorgeous, gorgeous pool.  It's not big enough to do laps or anything like that, but the whole set-up is very clean, very open feeling, well lit, and relaxing feeling.  One does not often find hotel pools this nice.  I intend to stay here again when I go back to Chicago for the pool experience.   Also, the room service is great.  the food comes from the Weber Grill restaurant downstairs and is very good.   My one issue is that I think there was a ghost of some sort who lived behind my walls and ceiling who made clicking noises at all hours.  If the ghost would have just shut up and let me sleep, the trip would have been more enjoyable. Oh, and also, the Grand train station is right there, which is super convenient.",N
1915,"This is a review of the room service and for screwing up my check in / bill. The room service is AWFUL.  Your food will take 90 minutes when they tell you 40.   You ask for fresh veggies and you ask them what they have? They say its seasonal mixed.  Your entree FINALLY shows up 90 minutes later.....and shows up with no veggies.  You call down, and they come back with an entire bowl of brussel sprouts ANOTHER 40 MINUTES later.  I kid you not.  Whole bowl of brussel sprouts?  Aren't they just about everyone's nemesis? Oh and it will set you back like $70 The bill....when I got it, it had someone else's name on it, but my room number, I'm like umm, you didn't check me in as the right person, and so the guy at the desk fixed it, or claimed to, and off I went.  A few weeks later, I'm looking at my credit card statement and there are 2 charges, they charged me for my room plus the other persons room, whom I can only assume was the person I got mixed up with  They fixed it, but why did this have to be so painful?",N
1717,"This is a pretty good hotel for the Loop, but I think I came at the wrong time. It was way too crowded, the elevators took FOREVER, and the gym was packed to the gills. It's understandable that the gym and lobby would be busy with a full hotel, but the elevator problem was a real hassle and very frustrating. I waited maybe 25 minutes to only have the elevator finally come, but so jam-packed that I couldn't get on. (Walking down 19 flights in heels didn't appeal to me that day...) Apart from that, the hotel is in a good location, the rooms are clean quiet, and the staff is friendly. Housekeeping responded so quickly when I called about my broken iron, and the front desk gave me great advice on finding a yummy pizza restaurant. Overall, not a bad stay.",N
3140,"It's been a while since I've been to the W Lakeshore, but I needed another night of hotel in Chicago and didn't have any desire to give the Westin River North another night of business, so I booked another night at the W Lakeshore. I arrived rather early and was told that my room was not ready yet, but they would call me my room was ready. Did I mention I was upgraded to one of their Fantastic Suites with a Lake View! SPG Platinum status rocks! I was out when I received a call back from the Welcome Desk (front desk) that my suite was ready. The suite on the 22nd floor overlooked Lake Michigan and Lakeshore Drive. I entered our suite to a large living room and desk. There was a 42"" flat screen television, sirius satellite radio, dvd player, and CD changer. The bedroom was to the left and the master bathroom was off to the side of the bedroom. The bathroom had Bliss bath products. The nice thing about this bathroom was that it had both a shower and a tub. Let me just say the shower was divine.   The bed is also wonderful too. I swear whenever I'm staying at the W it's so so difficult to get out of their plush signature bed. Another nice thing going on at the W's is the Acura experience. So what the heck is the Acura experience. To sum it up W Hotels and Acura have teamed up to offer hotel guests rides in new Acura's within a 3 mile radius of the hotel. Great option especially when it's time to catch the ""L"" back to O'Hare. The service runs from 11:45 AM to 9:00 PM at the W Lakeshore.",N
4897,"My wife and I chose to have our wedding reception here, and we could not have been more pleased.

The reception hosted about 140 people and they were all very pleased with the space, yet coziness of the 5th floor lounge.The majority of our families stayed overnight and we found the price of the rooms, food, drinks and entire event  to be very reasonable  considering the elegant yet very cool surroundings.  From the all glass facade, to the hardwood floors, and everything in between, this seems to be a very ""it"" place to be.Overall, we were obviously very pleased and would absolutely stay there again, if not host another event!",Y
4832,"Nice rooms, good staff, outstanding locations. Within easy walk of several site and shopping. And bus stop right outside for using public transportation to get to those places not so close. Hotel bar and restaurant are slightly above average, prices are typical. Only con is parking. Parking in downtown Chicago is a B***h, thanks to Mayor Dayle. Parking is tight and expensive. Got into town later in evening and closes parking I could find was 5 blocks away (this is why valet parking is so expense at all of the downtown hotel).

2172,"I've stayed here many times because it's right across the street from our Chicago office.  The building is beautiful!  The lobby is grand and welcoming.  The front desk staff are always kind and act like they don't mind being at work (gasp, what a concept!). I've stayed in both towers.  The older tower has smaller bathrooms, but all in all they are about the same.  Although, I do have an affinity for large bathrooms with tubs AND a glass shower.  My most recent stay was in the older tower with the smaller bathroom. The room service is always good, albeit a little pricey.  Thank goodness for expense accounts.  The decor in the rooms has been updated to a nice modern motif.  I love all the pillows on the bed--I tend to surround myself with them while I sleep. I too had a problem with the water in the sink and in the shower.  The pressure and temperature would change, but I can deal with that.",N
4585,"So, I really wanted to love this place and my initial impression was fantastic. The lobby is beautiful & luxurious and I couldn't wait to check-in and relax in our room. And here's where it all went downhill. The front desk clerk was a little on the snippy side. We were given our keys and sent on our way only to find that she had given us a room with ONE double bed which is not what we had reserved.  You would think the front desk clerk would have thought something was amiss when she checked us in.  My husband was standing right there and at 6'6 would barely fit in that bed by himself, let alone the both of us.  I immediately called down only to be placed on hold for an eternity so the manager could be consulted.  The manager never even bothered to speak to us to apologize and had the clerk handle it. I had to tell them that I had the printed documentation/receipts that proved we were guaranteed more than that. At this point, the only room available was a handicapped room with 2 double beds. At least one of us wouldn't have to sleep on the floor. By the way, the first room we were given was quite shabby and on par with a ""Days Inn"" level. The wallpaper was peeling. The furniture looked old & worn. The second room looked like it was more recently updated but still lacked the oomph that nice hotels should have.  It was a failed attempt at replicating the look of Kimpton Hotel properties.  The TV was extremely dated.  No wifi!!!!!! In this day & age???? And, of course, they charge for it. And they charge for the use of the gym!!!!!! Seriously? How can you give your customer subpar accommodations & claim to be a luxury hotel? The only reason they get 2 stars is because of the lobby, friendly bellmen and location.",N
794,"I walked in to the Westin expecting the Westins I saw as a kid that were not hip one iota.  Starwood moved some of the W style over this a way.  Slick lobby with a nice straight modern Eames-esque woodgrain look.  The beds are clearly a big draw as well as a double showerhead that has so much pressure your body may well have some red spots for a few hours if you stay in one place for a minute.  Of course, the location is great for a visitor with all the Mich Ave stuff.  Let's just say H&M saved my ass when I forgot my tie for a job interview.",N
1681,"Ah, the Allegro.  Filled with pros and cons.  The location is pretty decent (although I do hate that pretty much everything in the Loop is closed on weekends.  Come on, Lavazza, work with me here!!).  The lobby decor is definitely more swank than wank.  Apparently there's free wine in the evenings (which I missed, but turns out the glasses are teeny-tiny, so no big loss, I guess).  But the rooms.  Are SO.  SO.  TINY.  Like, maybe even tinier than the wine glasses.  Granted, we crammed four people into a room with two double beds--certainly fun times, but it was like a clown car.  Four people, four suitcases, two beds in a tiny room and a minuscule bathroom (but with Aveda products, woot) makes for a very cramped weekend.  Once I climbed over everyone and their stuff into bed, though, I very much enjoyed the fluffy pillows and cozy bed linens. We attended a wedding at the Allegro, so I can also comment on their event capacity.  The Walnut Room is a nice space for a smaller ceremony, although very dim (maybe that was just this wedding?  I dunno--none of my photos turned out), and the staff is quick to flip the room for dinner and dancing.  Plenty of room for tables, a stage for the band and a dance floor.  I'm assuming the hotel catered the meal, which was good (although I'd pass on the pasta course or be very clear with the kitchen that the pasta should be al dente).  The servers were very inconspicuous and efficient, although maybe too efficient... I'm pretty sure someone swiped my champagne before I had a chance to drink it and I don't think I was being cut off... My last issue is with the baggage check folks.  My husband was given a framed poster as a groomsmen gift which we couldn't haul on the plane home with us.  We arranged to have a city-dwelling friend pick up the poster from the baggage check and we'd pick it up the next time we drove up to Chicago.  The folks at the Allegro were fine with this arrangement, which was a relief.  After Laura B.'s third attempt to retrieve this framed poster from countless clueless baggage check people, Justin had to call the Manager to make sure they still had the item.  They did and it was finally handed over to our friend, but not after numerous wasted trips on her part.  Boo to the baggage people; five stars for Laura for being a great friend and babysitting the poster for us. :)",N
2530,Very small ballrooms and it takes forever to get freight since there is only one elevator to bring it in.,N
1526,"Ok, it gets 5 stars for location, value ($129 Groupon price) and the BEST HOTEL BED EVAH!!! I'm really picky particularly about the A/C issue I've read about... our room has afternoon facing sun and Voila, A/C worked perfectly keeping us at 68 degrees even though it was moderately hot and humid outside.. The gym facility was pretty good too... we worked out at 1PM so was empty, but can imagine prime time can get crowded, but it was good for us... No restaurant in hotel per se, kinda a bar style place, but wife is from Chicago so we drove to Andersonville and had great breakfast up there.. I don't know what they are using for their beds, but we slept fabulously and that is so important... comfy and supportive... The room is very spacious and the bathroom is huge with his/her sinks so no bumping into each other a large tub and separate shower. Bathroom beautifully done in beige/peachy colored marble - nice! That said, I think we paid adt'l $20 for the renovated bathroom :-( Location right on the river, between Michigan and Wabash so shopping and restaurants are nearby... easy to get to, near Lakeshore.. Winning!",N
1007,"I'll start with the negative, just to get it out of the way of the heaps of praise coming... I am very light sleeper; if you are not, completely disregard the next paragraph. This hotel is noisy.  Not so much from other rooms/hallways - but the outside noise was awful.  We were in staying in the back of the hotel with our window facing the alley, and at random times throughout the night (sometime multiple times) garbage trucks would come along and smash and crash through the approx 30-40 garbage bins lining the alley.  After enduring the clanging a couple of nights, I asked to be moved to a room at the front of the hotel, but was told that there was nothing there in the same price range (apparently you pay more for a ""non-alley view"").  But after another couple of sleepless nights, we were finally moved to another room.  It was on a lower floor, on the front side of the hotel and was definitely better without the gargabe trucks, but still suffered from late-night party goer noise. Other than that - this hotel was fantastic! Nicely decorated, high end bath products and double shower heads.  The continental breakfast was good, more than adequate, but the real kicker is the nightly manager's reception.  Wow.  High end booze and fancy snacks (hummous, bruscetta, meat & cheese, etc).  The hotel signature drink, the Amalfitini, is addictive.  Don't be surprised if you wobble out of there after downing 4 or 5 of them - they go down so easy. The staff were friendly, and our room was cleaned every day before we returned from our touring (coming back to a still-dirty room is a major pet peeve of mine). And the location is fantastic - walking distance to countless bars and restaurants, and so many of the city sights. The Amalfi is a great hotel (just bring ear plugs).",N
3718,"Wonderful 3-day stay at the Drake Hotel. It is a Hilton affiliate, so my boyfriend had a discounted rate. It was the most comfortable bed my bf said he slept on, and he plans to get the same mattress for his home. It is an experience to spend nights in a historic place, where Princess Diana, Queen of England, and other Heads of State also stayed. We spent a wonderful Christmas having a 5-course meal that was $100 per person. It seems extravagant, but it was well worth it. It started with a never-ending bread bowl, champagne, fruit, pumpkin bisque, turkey with cranberries and mashed potatoes, multiple servings of all dessert (creme brulee, chocolate dipped strawberries, shortbread cookies). Santa Claus even came by to personally wish each person Happy  Holidays. It was a perfect memory. The gym is also free to use during your stay. The concierge was courteous.",N
725,"Location, location, location, this place has it.  Right across the street form the John Hancock tower and right on the magnificent mile.  An ideal location if your looking to shop! The actual rooms were pretty average, nothing to rave about; stayed in a 2 queen bed room. The door knob on the bathroom door actually came off, so we'd have to be very careful using the door or we'd pull off the knob every time.  The rooms didn't look old, but not new either. When we checked in late at night there was no one at the desk to help us.  We waited for a quite a while, we were all pretty exhausted from a long flight and just wanted to sleep, not very pleasant. I just give this hotel an avg rating, if not for the location I would have downgraded the place to a 2 star rating.  Oh and the price wasn't horrendous either, we had a 3 night for the price of 2 deal through spg which made it bearable.",N
4147,"We had a great value on a room here, upgraded for a small fee for an excellent view of the city. Will definitely consider staying here if we stay in this part of Chicago on our next trip",N
1625,"After both getting some surprisingly great holiday bonuses, my husband and I decided that while we had to attend a wedding reception here, we would make it a staycation. We used http://Hotels.com for booking since they have the frequent traveler 10-night-get-one option and were working towards our free night. The rooms at Hotel 71 were modern and spacious. Usually stark modern hotels are not cozy but 71 rocked it. We had a small issue (they oversold our room type) which was immediately remedied and we got an unexpected upgrade which was a win in our book. We got the premier king river view room and when we walked in, I was pinching myself wondering if a room this nice could really exist at the price we paid. Its hard to find anything worth complaining about so I am giving them a solid five stars. For the wedding reception room there were about 100 people and it was not crammed and the views were great especially since our friend's family came in from out of town.",N
878,"Old World charm + great customer service = Hotel Burnham It's in the heart of the city (the Loop, none the less!) and close to the CTA's Blue and Red Line trains (both are less than a block away) which offers easy access to the rest of the city. Before you run off to book, check it: become a Klimpton InTouch member. This will definitely add slight, but appreciated, personal touches to your stay. Plus, you get a free 10$ gift card to raid their mini bar for doing this. I used it to nab a few snacks for my flight home. I notified them that I was checking in early and when I got there (around 4pm), I was able to get my picking of available rooms which included staying on their top floor: BINGO. The upper levels are maintained historically accurate to when the hotel opened in the late 1800's. Check out the old marble staircase; you can even see foot grooves on the steps! My room's window was huge! It felt like I was looking out in HD; everything was so crisp and clear. The room's size wasn't very big (reminded me of European hotels), yet we never felt claustrophobic probably due to the big windows and high ceiling. Also, we didn't stay in a hotel in the heart of Chicago to stay in and sleep the night away! The cleaning and reception staff were all very attentive and proper whenever I interacted with them. The hotel offers a bunch of stuff for free beyond the regular, complimentary soap, shampoo and conditioner. I borrowed a hair straightener (very clean!) and clothes steamer for FREE! Maybe this is something other places do, but I've never known of it.   If you're into history, you'll like this place even more once you find out more about this hotel and who it's named after.",N
3100,"Located right on Lake Michigan with either great views of Navy Pier or the Chicago skyline, the rooms are modern and comfortable. Rainwater shower heads and Bliss spa products in the bathroom make this hotel feel like a lovely getaway although its located near the pier, river east, michigan ave, etc. Nice lobby bar with a good wine selection. Purrrrr....",N
1604,"decent boutique hotel in chicago. staff was friendly & helpful in helping two inebriated souls acquire lost key cards at 2am. fantastic bleu cheese burger. i am not kidding. i was, however, hungover. perhaps that's a biased account. great shower in the room. great view. great location. i'd reccomend it to out-of-towners who want to stay mostly in the heart of the city, but not to folks who want to do some off the beaten path exploring.",N
365,"I don't know why there are so many haters for this place. I got $50/night deal off Expedia, and had a great experience for that price. Sure the place is a little run-down, but give me a historic hotel with some cosmetic faults and the occasional broken light over a modern eyesore for $200 anyday. Recommend!",N
161,Everytime my parents come to town they stay at The Whitehall due to a friend's discount. We love it there. Its downtown in the mix but its not too touristy and its not too crowded. Great customer service and great rooms. I love going to the bar for a quick cocktail before heading out to dinner. The beds are super comfortable. The Whitehall is just fabulous!,N
2330,"This review is for the public areas and meeting facilities only.   I just finished a two day class at this hotel which was held in its meeting/conference facility.   I loved it.  The entire hotel layout is beautiful.  It's bright, a bit busy and modernly decorated.  All of the staff who I had interactions with, from concierge to the cleaners I passed in the hallway, were friendly and attentive.  Although we were only provided coffee, tea and pastries in the morning and soda in the afternoon the spread was still exceptional.  Everything was fresh and tasty, the coffee and hot water were refilled and kept hot.  I passed another meeting room that had amazing a spread for lunch and then a spread that included cheese, ice cream or fruit for their afternoon snack (I was jealous but refrained from stealing their food).  There is also a Starbucks in the hotel that makes quality drinks (unlike many hotel versions) so there is no need to hit the Starbucks across the street (like I did on my first day) before you arrive.   Another plus is it is in a very central location for shopping and eating downtown.  I was very tempted to shop at Nordstrom during my lunch break.",N
2418,"The reputation far exceeds the reality of this place. Yes, it's old, and yes, famous people have stayed here. That's about it. The rooms are NOT luxurious in any way. The cleaning people didn't even do a very good job. Our tub was always clogged and gross. And the elevators? Horrendous. You'd think with that many people staying at the hotel, they'd have fast moving elevators. No way. The best thing about the Chicago Hilton is the guy who'll call a taxi for you and open the door. That was the highlight of my stay at this hotel.",N
344,"I've stayed in this hotel on two separate occasions, and I dont really know why I decided to repeat my experience there. The first time was out of desperation when my friends and I were visiting from Texas and got kicked out of my friends' place where we were staying.  This place was the cheapest we could find in downtown so we went for it.  The second time I was just too lazy too really research.  My own fault. The rooms are very basic, quite small, little to no amenities, etc.  But you're paying what you do for the location - end of story.  It's steps from Grant Park and the Red Line. But I recommend you spend a little extra money for a hotel with a decent standard of service and hospitality.",N
1708,"Let me preface by saying - this hotel may not be for everyone - this is BOUTIQUE hotel, not a chain. They just had a some odd million renovation (which is absolutely gorgeous) but it still has its quirks and I like that. Came here late on Valentines Day 09 as the last part of a surprise evening from my husband. Upon entering, someone offered to take my bags, we bypassed because we only had a couple. My husband breezed through check-in while I sat in awe of the lobby (if they the movie ""Cool World"" was redone for this decade - this lobby would be in it). I'm sure the rooms vary in size, but we got a huge corner one with enough room for me to do if a flip flop ( I would assume if I were a gymnast). The room had the usual modern updates - iPod clock radio, plasma TV, soft robes, etc, sleek furniture and decor. I felt like a princess as I sat in one of the zebra stripped robes they had in the hall closet while I sat back and sipped on a tiny bottle of Grey Goose from the Minibar. We got room service the next day - I had eggs benedict and my husband the steak and eggs - both were delicious - my limited experiences with room service has been questionable at best so I happy to have warm tasty food that didn't feel like it was just cranked out on a convey er belt (because I mean, it was the morning after Valentine's Day - I'm sure 90% of the hotel was getting room service!) All in all - I loved it. Not all the Kimpton Hotels have as much character as this one - so if you're going to go the Kimpton route - go for the Allegro.",N
2678,"Hip.  That about sums up The James.  Where else could you go and find someone on an elevator pick up on your 'This Is Spinal Tap' reference when someone requests the eleventh floor?  My six nights here were very pleasant.  There were only a few nitpicky details that kept me from awarding the fifth star. The bed was very comfy and The James knows that three pillows are not too many.  Oddly, though, I found the sheets to be rough and actually caused sores on my elbows. Bathroom was spotless everyday.  But the toilet lid would not stay up.  This can make for some awkward experiences.  The James supplies Kiehl's bath products.  I kept taking them and they kept replenishing.  Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and lotion.  I'm going to give them as Christmas gifts I have so many of them. Nice touches include original art in the room and fun books to peruse.  Bathrobes and slippers included.  Free internet in the lobby if you're not traveling with your laptop.   The location is great.  Two blocks from the Mile and about four blocks from the red line.  Plenty of good eats in the 'hood, too. The staff was great, always friendly.  I would definitely stay here again.",N
2562,"The people-watching here is fantastic. The reason that there are black and white photos of boobs on the walls is because the type of men who patronize this place still get a kick out of nudity. Oh, and since they're black and white, they're artsy too. These are also the type of men who have seen ""Fight Club"" way too many times, put too much gel in their hair and at the conclusion of the night, after staring at the same pair of girls for hours, can only muster, ""Do you guys make out?"" The drinks are wonderful, and admittedly, I wonder the same thing about the girls.",N
4794,"I've been staying here for a week, due to my floors being redone at my home. The valet lost my car key, then gave me the wrong one.. The food here isn't great, although the Italian place here is good. State and Lake isn't all that good. The bfast isn't worth a penny... The rooms are nice, large for the price.. I a suite, and that was nice.. The technology in the phones in the rooms are a bit to much, to hard to figure out.. I just want to make a call!! They had free WiFi, but then with out notice, they are charging, I didn't like that!! I also had my family with me, and the crib they provided was something you would have found in an old Russian 1950's hospital.. VARY SCARRY!! We didn't end up using it.. Strange they have people get these cribs for hotels, who don't have kids!! All in all, for the price, I would stay here again, but there's a lot to improve on,...",Y
840,"I'm originally from Chicago, and when I go back I try to stay here whenever it's feasible. The rooms are nicely decorated and some have funky shapes - no standard cube, which I enjoy. Nice staff, great location for downtown activities, and it's next to the L so I can hop on and visit friends just about anywhere in the city without too much trouble. Yes, some rooms don't have great views. But you are in Chicago - if you want a view, go visit the Sears Tower or Hancock Building. Book your room online for best rates. And remember - you can always request a room on the non-L side when you check in.",N
5835,"My company held an event here and the staff overseeing it were FABULOUS!With the exception of the front desk staff, everyone here was polite and helpful! The rooms were nice and cozy, unique from other hotels I've stayed in. Who would have thought that this place used to be a cannery?!? Another minus was the lunch and dinner we provided for our guests. Dinner options were steak, fish, or veggie. The steak was cooked inconsistently, some very well done (and tough to eat), some medium, and some rare. When selecting the steak it was understood all steaks would be cooked medium, unless otherwise specified. To top it off the steaks were very fatty and the size of the steak was inconsistent as well. Some people received huge steaks while others got very small steaks. It was embarrassing to hear one of our attendees make a comment about it. The fish was god awful. WAY WAY over cooked. It was very dry and hard to swallow and this entree also had inconsistent portions of fish. I did not hear much feedback about the veggie dinner, but it did look pitiful.One huge plus is their clam chowder is DELICIOUS! I had 2 bowls!! Aside from the food, everything else was wonderful.",Y

1861,"First time ever staying at a ""W"" Hotel. The hotel has very different vibe - dark, yet lit here and there with a strange mix of futuristic and hip elements. The front check in desk glows with a pink-ish light as you approach. The elevators have a wild 3D-ish material on the walls. The room was on the 6th floor - and somewhat small - very clean and modern. The desk felt like it belonged on The Jetsons. The bed has a night light system beneath the bed - so it sort of glows. Their was a flat panel HD screen mounted on the wall - BUT no HD channels. The bathroom in my room was tiny. But clean, well maintained, and serviceable. The big fail for the room was the AC unit. It was rather stuffy when I arrived. I turned on the AC and it never really cooled off - it just blew air the entire time. I advised the front desk at check out about the AC unit. The hotel staff were friendly and personable. The evening I arrived the Concierge advised me on eating establishments with walking distance. Beware: If you arrive on a Sunday and need to get to a Drug Store - please note you are in downtown Chicago - all Drug Stores around the hotel are closed. I ended up walking a very long seven or so blocks to a 24 hour Walgreens down off of South Halstead Street. There is a McDonald's next door, a Starbucks across one street, and a Dunkin' Donuts catty corner across the intersection - so you do have alternative breakfast options if you don't want to opt for the rather pricy hotel breakfasts in their restaurant. If it weren't for the AC problem - I'd give the place at least 4 stars. I'd stay here again.",N
3854,"Terrific service, awesome location, great views of downtown. Everything here is reasonably priced for such an upscale spot.

I will be recommending this spot to anyone looking to experience Chicago in style.",N
3641,"I didn't have time this trip, but would like to come back here for their afternoon tea service. The interior decoration spells opulence and timeless class.

But when they started the juke music...I thought...I did not pay $10 for juke music, if I wanted juke music then I would've gone to a ghetto high school homecoming. Somehow I think that the crowd is way young for my age (I'm 24). But I think they're some cute looking gay guys there and I made out with him (I'm straight). Hehe.

1835,"Nice hotel.  GREAT location in regards to being able to walk everywhere.  The bar when I was there had some sort of party going on in it, like maybe a birthday party or something and there didn't seem to be any waitresses around to get my drink order but I didn't really care that much because I was simply waiting on a friend to pick me up.  I utilized bag check on my day of checkout and when I went to get my bag the attendant was very prompt.  He was right on it.   The room was very nice and rather large.  Huge bathroom, standard W bed (very comfortable), enormous television.  Seriously, I am not sure that I have ever seen THAT big of a TV in a hotel room before.  LOL   I found the rooms in this while less light filled than the other location to be just as nice and much much larger than the other W hotel. They both have some catching up to do though if I were to compare to either the W Boston or the W Seattle.   I did not try out the restaurant as I was only there one night and arrived late.  Also, there are so many really great restaurants in Chicago that I have yet to try that I, more than likely, will never eat in my hotel's restaurant.  Well, unless I stay at the Burnham sometime.  ;)   I stayed at the other Chicago W location back in December as well.  That one had a much better view but the location for this one in my opinion is better.  This location tends to run better specials too in regards to room rates.",N
2867,"My first and last experience in a Sheraton. This is a review from 2009 but I was not yelping then and I feel that it is important that other people know about my experience. I was booked along with two other rooms for a conference, I am a student and we were traveling in a group. I had a room with another girl and we were taking a nap in between panels when someone walked into our room. Luckily we were awake enough to realize someone was walking in the woman said sorry and promptly left the room. Me and my roommate wondering what the hell is going on went out into the lobby talked to the woman and apparently they gave her our room after being there for two nights. We went to the front desk quite pissed off and even though all three rooms were booked at the same time according to them we only booked our room for the two nights. So without even knowing that we left or that the room was cleaned up our room was given away. The woman at the front desk was a bitch to say the least. She acted as if it was our fault and made us feel grateful that we were not being kicked out of the hotel. I wanted to choke her. The situation was fixed but the fact that someone just waltzed into my room pisses me off. Next year this conference is again being held at a Sheraton, I plan on staying at a different hotel. Also NOTHING was included at this hotel and at the time when looking at the website it gave the impression that things like pool and internet were.",N
4342,"I love old. The history, the people who have gone there before me, the beauty and grandeur of a time gone by, these are all things that draw me to historic places and hotels. The Palmer House Hilton is no exception. Its perfect location close to Millennium Park, nearby shopping, theaters and all that Chicago has to offer makes it a perfect choice when in Chicago. Built in 1871, the Palmer House still exudes the charm and grace of an era gone by. The lobby is breathtaking with it's soaring ceiling painted in 1900 (one of the most photographed ceilings in the world) and the gilded figurines done by Tiffany oh so many years ago. It's quite splendid. As for the rooms, they are okay. They have been upgraded over the years but know given the size of this hotel (over 1600 rooms) that this place gets alot of use so some areas feel a little worn out. On this visit- my room with the soaring ceilings had a large king bed (with some comfy linens) and the bathroom was recently redone. On the down side- there is no coffee maker in the room (it's a Hilton- what Hilton doesn't have free coffee?) they charge a daily fee for Internet use, the TV is bulky and old, there is no mini bar, and because it is an old building, the rooms can greatly vary in size. But here's a trick. If you want those big fluffy towels that I've come to expect from the nicer hotels, tip your housekeeper. The first day I was here- the towels and toiletries were functional but not fancy. Day 2, after I tipped the housekeeper? Sumptuous thick towels and upgraded toiletries. Coincidence? I think not! If you want a drink- try Potter's Bar. And for breakfast, lunch and dinner- Lockwood Restaurant located in the beautiful lobby is open. While there may be a line for weekend breakfast- tell the hostess that you are fine with the communal high top table and you will be seated immediately! Room rates vary so do a bit of negotiating and you should be able to get a competitive rate to other places in the city. And leave the car at home. Valet runs $61 a day (with in and out privileges) or you can park it yourself for about $15 less at one of the nearby parking garages (my favorite is one block south on Adams) It's a piece of Chicago history- still vibrant today. I love the photos of all the famous people who once played in the Empire Room that line the halls of this hotel. I love the opulence and grandeur that are the public spaces. I love afternoon tea in the beautiful lobby. And if I close my eyes, I love that I can almost see the generations that have gone here before me.",N
1958,"If you like staying at a hotel that feels like a night club this is for you.  Lobby had the music and light show going on and then it carries into the dark elevator with 3D effect walls that'll disorient you or keep you entertained till you reach your floor.

1322,"From the moment we arrived, the reception staff at the Ritz were eager to please (and it didn't seem to matter I scored a discount deal on the room through expedia!). We were upgraded to a deluxe room for free, and within minutes of checking in, we scored a reservation at RL thanks to the very welcoming staff at reception. The concierge enlightened us on Chicago's must-see attractions and nighttime hotspots; she made us a dinner reservation at Mercadito and even arranged for a complimentary appetizer for our party, which was a welcome surprise as we were seated at our table later that night. Our room was sparkling on arrival and the housekeeping staff made sure to keep it that way throughout our stay. Overall great experience.",N
2067,"The price is right and the hotel is fairly convenient. It is within walking distance to restaurants and shopping. There is also a bus stop right around the corner which is convenient if you will be heading a bit outside of downtown.  There is also an excellent view of the city from the hotel. However, if you are looking for a place that you'll be able to take advantage of the wireless Internet, this may not be right for you. I had plans to do some work while away on business, but unfortunately, the signal from my room was at one bar. It was very difficult to go on. If you do head down to the lobby area, you will find a Cyber Cafe with a much higher signal. For me, I wanted to be in the comforts and privacy of my room, so this did put a damper on my stay. Overall, it is a nice hotel for the price. The staff was friendly, the fitness center and pool areas were well maintained, and they were also open from 6am - 11pm, which is rather accommodating.",N
5460,"I recently stayed at this hotel for four nights.  I chose the hotel because of its location and I wasn't disappointed.  I have stayed several places in Chicago and this was my favorite location. I checked in about 11:00 on a Sunday night and the front desk was barely helpful.  I understand it was late but I felt like I was interupting them.  However, the weekday staff was AWESOME! I brought my PS3 consule (yes, kind of dorky, especially if I want to enjoy the area, which i did).  I wasn't able to hook the PS3 up to my TV on Sunday and the staff said there was nothing they could do....like I said, they were busy doing something else.   The next day, I asked the front desk and they were extremely accomodating.  The hotel ""engineer"" came to my room within minutes, realized the TV wasn't compatible with a PS3, called the front desk and asked if I could move to another room.  Within 20 minutes I was in a new room on the 21st floor.   The bellman brought the key to me and helped me with my bags.  The engineer hooked up my PS3.  They bent over backwards to make me happy.  Too bad the late night weekend staff wasn't this accomodating or I would have gave a 5 star rating.",N
3490,"I like to hit Chicago once in awhile, this place is in the perfect location.....located in the middle of everything.....Victoria Secrets and Tiffany's nearby....(it's always a happy day at Tiffany's or whatever that movie quote is right).  I love the location, great bars, restaurants and shopping await....just a couple bucks cabride from Union Station (I take the Hiawatha down from Milwaukee) and you are there....excellent service, old school feel.  The rooms are nicely appointed and yes the Hotel is an old landmark but very nicely done.....I have stayed on two different occasions and will definately come back......if you give them your e-mail they will send you deals once in awhile.  It is somewhat pricey like all Chicago hotels located in this key area.",N
5295,"I don't care what anybody else says, this Hotel sucks. 117.00 for room and 36.00 for parking (which they will lie and tell you no other parking is available). I found clothing left by a previous guest under the bed. You had to flush the toliet 3-4 times before it finally had enough power to flush. Hair was on the toliet seat and in the tub. I had to use stck a washcloth in the bathtub hole to keep my bath water from draining because there was no bathtub stopper. The flatscreen T.V remote control had a missing poweron/off button. The volue and channel buttons were confused. The walls are so thin that I heard every word of the guys next door.. When I called to complain, they told me that it was the only room left. What a ripoff. I found out later there is parking down the street that's so much cheaper, bu they siad it wasn't anywhere else to park. The housekeeprs are lazy, rude, and the front desk agents were rude, unprofessional, mean, and I must also add GHETTO!!!! I will NEVER stay at another red roof, more less this one!!!!! There service sucks!",Y
2010,"We just got home from a two-night stay at the Blu Aqua.  Overall - the experience was terrific. The staff goes out of their way to be friendly and helpful.   We had a Groupon for a king room.  I had asked for possible upgrades - including $9/night for park view.  On check-in, we were told we got that upgrade.  I'm not positive the view we had was really what was meant by ""park view"".  We were in 1007 - facing north. Looking straight out - we looked into an office building.  If we looked right  we could see Navy Pier and the river.  Looking left - we could see a sliver of the Wrigley building.  We did not face the park.  I'm not sure if that upgrade included Navy Pier views OR Millenium Park, so we didn't say something. I'm not sure the view we had was worth $9 a night. The room was relatively compact - but nicely laid out.  I loved how clean and new it was.  There was a wood-laminate floor - with marble floor  in the entry area and bathroom.  We had a king bed with great bedding.  It was very comfortable (though the pillows were rather ""mushy"" - it was good we had 6 of them).  The bathroom was beautiful - with a separate soaking tub and walk in shower.  It was also very spacious.   The sliding door to the bathroom was fine for us - but I could see if you were sharing a room with someone other than a spouse, it could be a problem privacy-wise.  It definitely didn't muffle any noises from the bathroom!   The closet area was laid out nicely with three drawers and a good-sized safe.   The hanging area, however, was a bit small.  It was ok for us for just 2 nights - but for a longer stay with 2 people or more - it'd be tough.   There was a good-sized flat screen TV and desk area.   The public areas were very nice.  We enjoyed the bar - and had breakfast one morning in the restaurant.  The food and service were excellent.   We didn't use the indoor lap pool and spa or health club.  The health club area was very large with great equipment and even a half basketball court.   In the lobby area - there were a lot of areas to sit and lounge.   We were rather surprised by the $51/night charge for parking.  That seems rather high to me, particularly as we didn't use or ask for in/out privileges.   We would definitely come back.  It could be nice in the summer with that outdoor pool area.",N
2822,"A group of 6 of us booked this hotel directly by phone line for the Chicago marathon 2008.  We encountered several problems for the first time ever this past year at Embassy Suites. 1.  They charged all 3 rooms for all of the nights immediately rather than when we checked in at the desk when we arrived.   2.  When we arrived we checked in and went up to our rooms only to find one room occupied by former occupants.  The occupants feigned checkout and one stayed behind and let the other back in.  Security had to escort them out of the room.  Housekeeping didn't come to clean that room until after 5:30 that evening, only after asked to come up more than 4 times. 3.  We overheard conversation from another hotel guest exclaiming that they got a ""great deal"" on priceline of $180 a night whereas we were paying well over $400 a night.   4.  There were no apologies made regarding the renegade guest or compensation for the late housekeeping staff.   We will not be returning to this particular embassy suites as the other embassy suites closer to Navy Pier is more than $100 cheaper a night, with better service and no such problems to this date.",N

3852,"I'm going to keep this brief, yeah right. The good: they allowed us to check-in early without waiting (we got in around 11am). The doorman was awesome. Basically, this place was pretty cool as long as you didn't go inside. The bad: THE SPA. Let me go ahead and go into detail about their spa... upon check in, the fiance and I perused their spa menu, and after deciding on a couples massage (with two separate techniques) I gave the spa a call. It was a Friday, so when the receptionist told me their were no 80 minute couple slots left, it wasn't a surprise. Besides, they rave about their spa so it was sort of expected. Naturally, I asked about 80 minute slots for the next day and the employee told me they had an opening, so I took it. Fast forward to the appointment... the floor in the ladies locker-room was slippery so I fell walking out. And slipped walking back in (needless to say I couldn't walk the next day... now I wish I would have filed a complaint). Our appt was for something like 1pm, so we got their early to fill out paperwork and when 1pm rolled around we were taken to the small ""relaxation room."" 1:10 rolls around and two girls get us for our massages. Mind you, no one up until this point has asked us what style of massage we were receiving... we got what they wanted to give. The massage was good, a little disappointing considering I had asked for the ""dana's aromasoul massages"" and what I got instead felt like a sports rub. Well then 40 minutes came up and the girls said their goodbyes. I knew it was too fast for 80 minutes so we asked the front desk and they told us it was a 50 minute massage. Sure, a 50 minute massage and that is why we are sitting in the lobby, DRESSED, talking to you about it and it isn't even 2PM! I was fit to be tied (and massaged a little longer too) but we went to our room and I called the spa back. Finally a manager got on the line, told me they weren't ANY 80 minute slots available when I made my appt the day before and then offered to refund 15%. I told him, first off: apologize. When I call to book an 80 minute couples massage and there are only 50 min slots available: TELL ME. Don't be a retard and book me... that is BS. Second of all: don't insult me with a refund of 15%. Fool. I paid for services rendered. If you are going to go the lame-refund route, refund 100%. In the end, they left a bag of trial skin products on my door knob with $28 with a note saying: 15% refund. FAIL. Now onto the rest of the bad: the staff working in the restaurant ""area"" are completely and utterly confused. We asked where the hostess stand was.. the reply ""um, just stand right here."" Another time we asked the sushi bar if they were serving (at the sushi bar), they said yes. We sit down and 3 minutes later they tell us the sushi bar is closed but we can order sushi from downstairs. So, we sit at a table (this is on that same Saturday before the awesome spa debacle) downstairs and ask for the sushi menu. ""No, we don't serve sushi, only brunch."" Okay, well homeboy 10 steps up said you did. So Mr. Server goes upstairs and comes back no later then 10 minutes and says they can do it. Ordered an iced tea and the guy told me the bartender had to make it. HA!  This place is unreal! That Saturday night there were people screaming until 7am and you could hear them on the 8th floor. No joke. I slept with a pillow over my head which brings me to the next part... We stayed in the ""Tranquil suite"" and it was no where near tranquil considering the maids closet was adjacent to it. SO fail. We brought it to the attention of the employee at the front desk upon checking out and all he said was ""oh yeah, I've heard that before."" Seriously? Oh yeah, their iron ruined a recently purchased shirt... lol, I really don't know how I didn't go apeshit on these people. There were random hoodlums in the elevators waiting for someone with a card to get in. As a girl, this made me feel miles away from safe. Especially when it is later in the evening and I happen to be by myself. We reserved via the website and the site decided it wanted to upgrade our room (after the online checkout) to a MUCH more expensive suite (almost 1k more), so we had issues getting things right a month before we made it to Chicago. This place is so awesome. /sarcasm",N
3072,"I attended an event at the W this week. The catering was not great. The staff was friendly but the passed apps were sub par. Everything that was supposed to be warm was cold and vice versa. The crab cakes were so bad I had to run to the bar so I could get something to wash the taste out of my mouth.   The hotel itself is geared to the trendy so if that's not your speed this probably isn't your hotel. I have enjoyed the Wave restaurant for dinner however, which has a great atmosphere and nice views of the lake. The food was good but not memorable.",N

4738,"Poor customer service, tiny rooms, loud nights, and no frills describes our experience at Hotel Felix.  Don't let the trendy decor trick you!Poor customer service & tiny rooms overcome a great location and modern decor. When you first walk into the hotel, your initial reaction is that you picked the right spot...then you have to check-in. The guy we talked to was smarmy and rude. A week and again the day before arriving I called to confirm a request, both times the staff told me that it wouldn't be a problem & was saved in my reservation. When we arrived the front desk representative told me I was lying about the request because I didn't know who I talked to when I made the request. A lot of other Yelpers rated customer service high so maybe it was an off day or this employee (20-something male) is a bad apple, but our experience couldn't have been worse. When we finally got to the room, we opened the door to find a queen size bed & that was about it. The room was tiny and it took effort to fit between the walls & the bed. Reminded me more of a walk-in closet than a hotel room. The bathrooms were equally small with the smallest, most shallow sink that could be mistaken for a bird bath. Sleeping was more like playing ""Name that noise"" & we were on the 8th floor away from the elevators! The air conditioning was incredibly loud and woke us up every time it turned on. After a poor night's sleep, all I wanted was a cup of coffee to help me wake up. Never mind, coffee makers are not provided in the room instead offering complimentary coffee in the lobby.  Who doesn't like going to the lobby in your underwear to get some caffeine?  I travel a lot for work and cannot recall the last hotel room I stayed in without a coffee maker. This hotel is big on cutting costs and corners. I would have rated Hotel Felix as a 1 star if it were not for the location. Poor customer service, tiny rooms, loud hotel, and no extras describe our experience at Hotel Felix. It is better than staying at O'Hare, but not by much.",Y
3016,"I go back and forth between staying at this W and the W Chicago City Center and realized today I had never written a review.  I am so sorry about that W Chicago Lakeshore - please forgive me...I was not trying to slight you by only reviewing your sister property. The W Chicago - Lakeshore is another great property.  Service is tip top - and that is what is important.  Check-in is always a breeze, everyone always offering to help.  Going to the Bliss Spa is a great way to spend an afternoon.  And having a drink in the Living Room people watching is a great activity. I ordered room service on a Saturday night from my iPhone using the W Hotel App, and the meals were delivered so fast I thought at first this must be an order for another room.  (Use the W app - great to get things sent up to your room right away!) Like most W's, the hotel was a rehab project - i remember staying in this hotel when it was a Days Inn many moons ago.  The ""shutters"" in the bathroom take some getting used to if you have not seen them previously, but it adds to the quirkiness that I love about this place.  The beds are great to sleep in - great view of Lake Michigan - a great pool on the 8th floor - I could go on and on and on. It is a great location.  But note folks - this is a W - make sure you do your homework and understand what a W hotel is like.  Whimsical.  Whatever.  Whenever.  This isn't a stuffy old traditional property - the Ws have a theme and attitude that I am guessing many of the other reviewers misunderstood...",N
4900,"PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!After reading the reviews for this hotel I was soooo excited to go, so I booked this as a surprise for my husband's birthday weekend, it was horrible I think my worst decision yet....First the room looked like a box and this was the Corner King with two walls of floor to ceiling windows. The bed was a queen size I was told it was a king. The supposedly city view was us looking into other peoples apartments and them looking into ours.The plus side tho was that the spa was good but not great.However after we spent our weekend and was given our bill that we signed off on the hotel came back and charged us an additional 200 bucks in error which we are still waiting to get. A bunch of thieves if you ask me.Never again.",Y
3845,"Let me start with a little info:  I've stayed in several Chicago hotels, and this is BY FAR the only hotel where I've actually enjoyed coming back to the room.  This was my 10th wedding anniversary, and I Yelp-stalked several hotels looking for spots that were not just template rooms.  Also, we didn't try the Spa service on this trip. LOCATION: Very nicely situated; the walk to Michigan Ave was drama-less, as was a quick 15-minute jaunt to Morton's off Wacker, and we also had a need to take the El from Northwestern University (Davis Station) to the Chicago Station, and the Dana is wonderfully placed right between that and the Grand Station, 2-3 blocks in either direction. I felt like everything that was important was no more than a 15-minute walk away (except Navy Pier, which was a $8 cab ride because of ""Transformers 3"" movie set road closures....grrr). STAFF: Courteous and professional throughout the stay. Some places you come across apathetic housekeeping, or the front-desk person who's so busy telling a bar story to the other front-desk person that they jack up your reservation, but the Dana staff was extremely attentive. The Concierge was excellent; he didn't just give us the ""take a cab here and get outta my face"" directions, he took the time to offer alternate routes and transportation methods. ROOM: As soon as I opened the door my jaw hit the ground...and bumped into my wife's jaw.....the views are INCREDIBLE. We had a ""Corner King"" on the 20th floor, which gave us a King bed with two entire walls made of floor-to-ceiling windows. Truly a difference maker, I thoroughly enjoyed the view.  The shower was pretty-good, I like the overhead rain-shower thingy, and the bathroom itself was styled well with good ergonomics for the most part. ATTACHED RESTAURANT & PARTY JOINT: The Dana provided us with two $10 breakfast vouchers for the ""Aja"" restaurant on the ground floor, which was cool, but you'd be better-served by walking the few blocks to ""Yolk"" for breakfast (FIVE STARS for Yolk, by the way....). We didn't have dinner at ""Aja"".  There's a pre-party, or lounge bar, or whatever type place on the roof, I forgot the name, but my wife and I tried it one night for a few minutes and we just weren't feeling the atmosphere. Could be that we're fuddy-duddies, but with the deck being closed at that time the only thing to do was drink and listen to somebody's half-assed attempt at techno. GRIPES: Other than ""Aja"" and the lounge, the gripes are very minor. Of course, with the great view out...comes a great view in. There's an apartment building directly across the street and there were a few awkward moments where my eyes met the tenants in a few apartments, but if you don't have a problem being ""seen"", it's not a biggie, just be aware. Also, there were 7 windows...which means there are 7 blackout shades AND 7 separate occluded shades. The most tiresome part was coming back to the room and finding that ALL of the shades had been let down as part of the turn-down service. Minor irritant, but again, just be ready to work to get a night view. The shower has a glass wall where a person in the room can see in the shower...and directly through the shower to someone on the crapper. There's a curtain, but it's on the room side. Made for ""hilarious"" moments for my wife while I was in my ""Thinker"" position. Last minor irritant, the shower doesn't have a door, it has a glass half-partition, so if you're a sloppy shower-er, count on having a wet bathroom floor. Almost forgot about the elevators: There's two of them; one from the ground floor to the check-in lobby (one floor up....), and a completely separate elevator from the check-in lobby to the rooms. The chafing part of this is that the room elevator actually DOES go to the ground floor, but it appears to be used only for vetting the crowd for the lounge. Yet another strike against the lounge....lol....it's no big deal though, I'm just nit-picking at this point..... That's it until my next visit, because I will definitely be staying there again. This is a well placed hotel with a twist and a great staff, and I really liked it.",N
772,"Dated exterior but conveniently close to the Mag mile and the Hancock, this was the hotel I stayed at in July 2006 for the Gay Games. Inside was OK. Probably your usual Westin decor. Loud busy bar that I did not have a chance to try. Beds were very nice and plush. Room was poorly insulated from noise and I could hear some family yammering in Spanish either below or next to us. I expected better for a Westin. They also lied and said they would credit my Starwood account with points they missed but the credit never showed.   I always wanted to stay here and am glad that's now done and over with.",N
3031,"Quite honestly, I didn't really expect to be giving this place 5 stars after our first impression.   1)  The front drop off is very poorly designed.  You'd think the cabbies would get the hang of it since they probably drop people off all the time, but the valets/parking director guys had to constantly redirect people who pulled in the wrong way.  I'm sure this gets very frustrating for them...in fact it's quite obvious it does, because the valets tend to yell at everyone who drives in.  Hopefully not at guests pulling in, but I only experienced it with the two or three cab rides we took back to the hotel. 2)  The girl who checked us in was pretty rude.   3)  It WAS pretty obvious upon entering our room that it had been remodeled from a significantly crappier room...the popcorn ceiling was still there.  Also there wasn't a lot of room for storage. 4)  $52/night parking?!?! But after that initial impression, things were looking up.   1)  I loved the ""Good Morning/Good Afternoon/Good Evening"" mats they diligently changed out in the elevators every day.   2)  I loved the view and location.   3)  I loved the gym (and the view from the gym!)  And the apples. 4)  I loved the stealhy ninja cleaning ladies who managed to find windows to get our room nice and tidy even if we were only gone for like 30 minutes.   5)  I loved the Bliss bath products 6)  I ESPECIALLY loved the concierge who helped us when we had a medical emergency late Sunday night.  I never did get his name but he had longish curly hair and made it a priority to ensure that we were taken care of.  He got us in touch with medical staff on call, and when even they couldn't help us, he called around to get us an emergency appointment first thing the next morning.  He was a lifesaver!!! Yes, it got a little crowded and loud in the lobby/bar/restaurant in the evenings, but it didn't bother us at all.  I was bummed that I don't get SPG points if I book through Priceline, but I got a waaaaay better rate that way so I guess it worked out.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",N

1272,I rented a room here for new year's but it seems as if the Best Western is a hotel chain suited for college students and twenty somethings to have parties at. This is the second BW I stayed in since the first one was in Charleston in southern IL and even they were the same way college students renting rooms and just being an overall disturbance. Because it was new years the pre and post drunken behavior is a given especially for those who don't have much in the way of being considerate of other guests who would like to have some peace and quiet. The hotel should make college students sign waivers so they're put on notice about being asked to leave if they're being disruptive and disturbing other guests and destroying hotel property. Not to mention the train going by every 10 mins which makes it hard to sleep at night. Breakfast was mediocre it could have offered healthy choices like egg whites and skim milk. Not to mention it was rather weird to have some homeless guy saluting buses as they passed on the street and harassing pedestrians as they walked down the street and then dancing in front of the window as me and my boyfriend ate breakfast. Either way the stay could have been better.,N
1764,"I'd go for five stars, but I'm not quite sold on what five stars means to me... Its a hotel with a swanky, distinctive feel.  When I first walked in and saw the wide red staircase, I was convinced I'd gone to the wrong place.  The lobby fooled me into thinking I'd walked into a party room - so much so that I walked back downstairs, got in the elevator and pressed the lobby button, only to arrive back in the same place! My king room on the 14th floor wasn't a room you'd stretch out in, but it was fine by me.  The decor from the rest of the hotel followed me into the room, which was very comfortable and inviting.  The desk chair is great, with plenty of room to work on a laptop and spread things out.  The wide-screen HD television fits into the room nicely and, of course, has a great picture.  The bed sleeps well and the iPod compatible alarm clock is a nice feature. The room layout is funny - I've got two tiny closets, one complete with leopard print tank top and hot pants for purchase.  The bathroom is tiny at a glance, but just fine for your needs.  The vanity is long, so you don't feel cramped when laying out your toiletries.  They are still providing the Aveda products, as other reviewers have mentioned. The free wine hour is still going strong - not $100 bottle stuff, but it's the magic price - FREE.  I didn't try the morning coffee or the room service.  I took a peek in the mini-bar and found what I expect - airplane bottles with big price tags! I couldn't hear the ""L"" from my room, but I faced out over Randolph instead of Wells.  The plumbing noises didn't bother me much either - I think I heard the shower start up one morning out of 4.  The only noise that has been bothersome is that of the neighboring room raising their window shade - like mine, it takes a dozen pulls on a plastic chain that is a bit noisy.  Beautiful shade - poor mechanism. I'd definitely return to this hotel and it makes me curious aobut other Kimpton hotels.  I'd recommend this place to anyone - business or pleasure.  Its right around the corner from the Wells/Washington station on the ""L"" and the Clark/Lake subway station - so a train ride from either airport is very convenient. Oh yeah - for pricing, remember you're staying in the loop.  Nothing comes cheap here.",N
2610,"I really like it here: The music is great and it is a very diverse crows (most days). Yet, let's be real: this is a place for people who like to spend money. So if you are cheap- go elsewhere!

4433,"I went to a friend's weekend wedding reception/event there (& stayed there for that reason).  The lobby is actually on the 2nd floor, but it is very ornate & beautiful!  (It's an old historic hotel).  I initially had a hard time figuring out how to get up there from the 1st floor...stairs/escalators aren't in really obvious places. The first night, the reception was also in a beautiful room with a short staircase entrance just off one end of the lobby.  The 2nd night (yes, there were 2 nights of festivities, which were fun), there was another dinner reception in another room, & apparently, there was another wedding reception going on then in the room next door.  Was kind of tempting to go crash the other one out of curiosity.   Our room was quite big...we even had 2 bathrooms and 2 closets.  It must've originally been 2 rooms they converted into 1.  Great decor.   Only minus I noticed was that the hallway we had to walk down to get to the elevator from our room had an area where the wallpaper was peeling off.  I guess none of the managerial types had walked down this way while we were there that weekend because it remained that way the whole time we were there. There's an multiple hotel serving shuttle to & from Midway (that's where I ended up flying in & out of).  Pretty convenient.  Luckily, I didn't run into any problems when I was leaving, as the Chicago Marathon was that day, but I think it was pretty much over by the time I had to go to the airport.",N

1448,"I think we got a good deal here $600 for 3 nights...we fit 6ppl in a room and it didn't feel too crammed. We 2 full/queen beds and a sofa bed. The sofa bed was not comfortable so when it was my turn to sleep on it, I just slept on the floor. The hotel is very conveniently located. Almost everything was a 10-15 min walk from where we lived. When I had to buy a pair of shorts (since it was blazing hot all of a sudden), I was very grateful that Express was right next door. The hotel itself is a bit old so you have to go up two flights of elevators to get to your room. There aren't many of them and they are slow. You can't even take the stairs if you wanted to since they are for emergencies only. Also, I hate when you request more blankets, they give you those janky, light blankets...how are you supposed to keep warm?? Other than that, the housekeeping was very nice. The blanket thing isn't their fault....she did give us tons of towels. The pool is small, but it's nice to play in if it's raining outside.",N

(I'm not exaggerating the time spent on hold waiting for the concierge before I finally gave up and this happened on three occasions.) After spending three nights at the Hyatt and three nights at the Palmer House Hotel (which we had to move to because the Hyatt was overbooked), I whole-heartedly recommend the Palmer House and discourage anyone from staying at the dirty Hyatt.",N

Most of the things in the hotel are great!Liked:- Great swimming pool and very complete and spacious gym- Rooms are very comfy and the bathrooms come with all the things you want to bring home (shampoos, mosturizers etc.)- Staff is very attentive and corteous- Great free DVD selection- Great location - close to Navy Pier and other attractionsDisliked:- Food. I ordered food to eat in the hotel and I was absolutely disenchanted. Food was not only tasteless but it was hard to swollow. Good thing is that hotel reimbursed me for that- Lobby bar. This lobby bar in the top floor is just not like the W hotel lobby bars that you would expect. This one is tasteless and reminds of bars that are almost out of business. I don't expect anyone to like to go there to celebrate anything or even for a drinkBut, all in all, is a worthwhile experience if you plan to come to Chicago for a good time!",Y
4838,If you like roaches and over priced everything stay here! It's not worth the money they charge and it is a low class place.,Y
4727,"Great Location, little pricey and small rooms. Overall my stay at Felix was fine. I knew going in that the rooms are small, but did not expect them to be tiny. However that was more than compensated by the excellent service and also by the convenience of being close to practically everything I needed.",Y
1832,"Like all of the other W properties, I love the Acura ""driving experience"" chauffeur service (although the times at this property are rather limited). The rooms were spacious, a little bit bare/empty.  There was a pocket sliding door from the room to the bathroom.  If you're visiting as a new couple, keep in mind that the bathroom doesn't provide much ""sound privacy"". I love how they kept the old fashioned mail drop by the elevators. Lobby was very noisy.  Check-in area was rather small. I was there for an event, the 2nd level ""foyer"" has weird ceiling heights, so keep that in mind when planning!",N
579,"I stayed here for a few days in October 2011, shortly after it opened. I saw a great deal on http://hotels.com, and though I didn't know anything about Public, I was familiar with its predecessor, the Ambassador East, and read a few articles about Schrager's remodeling plans, so I decided to take advantage of the great price and make a reservation. Overall, it was a very good stay. The place is quite clean (as it should be, since it's practically brand new!) and sleek. The staff was friendly, though no one went ""above and beyond."" The fitness room was great, and I really liked the location - walkable to the Gold Coast/Mag Mile area and an L stop, but in a very nice residential area rather than in an entirely commercial area of downtown. Some of the decor was a bit too Euro trendy for me -- I could have done without the fake animal skin throw on the chair in the room, and a real bed instead of an almost-on-the-ground no-box spring Ikea-type bed. But all in all, the room was comfortable, if small. Computer area and library/coffee bar in the lobby was a nice touch. Biggest complaint: My room was right next to the elevator, and all night, I could hear the clank, clank, clank of the elevator pulleys and the doors opening and closing. Next time, I'll ask for a room away from the elevator. Overall, a very nice stay at an unbeatable price.",N
3303,"I think this is my favorite of the contemporary designs, actually.  That I've seen here, I mean.",N
502,BUSINESS ONLY.  Other than the friendly tip hungry Italian evening bartender - this place is all business.  Large desks that you can work long hours at.  The front room is quite a nice office.  8am is like a herd of cattle as high heels and luggage rollers rattle down the hallways as coffee slugging kids who take their jobs too seriously rush to another meaningless seminar.  There is a lack of warmth to this place and I only stay here when working long hours.,N
4864,"The Congress Hotel is more than adequate. My wife and I stayed here for 3 weeks, and whilst no one will confuse it with their actual home, we found it to be comfortable. We did not suffer the plumbing problems other people have mentioned. The mattresses do need updating.The bar downstairs is a great place to have a drink. Mike, the bar tender, is friendly and always has an interesting story or two. My wife really enjoys chatting with him, as do I. The whole hospitality staff is friendly and we make a point of stopping in to say hello when I am in town.The strikers are obnoxious, even moreso when one finds out they are actually paid to be there, and most of them have never been employees of the Congress at all. Their  ""outrage"" is well compensated.The Congress is an old hotel, full of charm and ghosts. If you want sleek and new, head to the 'W'. If you want to experience of bit of Chicago history, the Congress will fit the bill nicely.",Y
5403,"We had a very unpleasant experience with this hotel.  We live in the suburbs and came down for an event and chose Indigo because we thought it looked unique.  The front desk service was not very friendly and there was confusion checking in.  We had two room reservations under one name.  They double charged our credit card and we called to clear up the confusion, they double charged it again.  It became such a mess that the credit card company contacted us and had to cancel the card and issue us a new one because they hotel had charged the card three separate times.  The parking service they use which is city parking next door was not very friendly either.  Overall the experience was not a positive one and we will never go back to Hotel Indigo.",Y
172,"It all goes downhill once you get past the friendly doormen.   If I knew then what I know now, I'd take my business elsewhere both for the room and the drinks.  The location is good and the rooms are clean, but that's all the praise I can muster.  Chicago is a huge city with tons of great bars and hotels.  These days you don't have to sacrifice service for a buck.",N
4634,"Overall I was pleased with my stay at the Felix. The staff was very helpful, great bartender (very cute too), good location, and contemporary decor. The beds were very comfortable and dressed with quality linens. My complaints would be tiny and I do mean TINY rooms. In fact everything in the Felix was tiny. Tiny elevators, hallways, bar, and lobby.  Complaint #2 there is no concierge. I'm a girl who makes the concierge my best friend so not having one was a big deal for me. However, the front desk people were helpful in making restaurant recommendations and the doorman gave  decent directions. Overall, it fell short of what I would consider a boutique hotel, but for the price I would stay there again!",N
2470,"3 or 4 stars depending on your mindset: Pros: Gym...Its pretty good Rooms...Spacious Physical plant:  Great lobby with a  very nice, old world look Restaurants:  3 or four decent places Cons: Noise:  You can hear the street, and I was on the 21st floor Location:  I personally like the area around Whitehall and the Drake better Seriously, Chicago is just a great hotel town.  In Boston the hotel would easily be in the top four....In this town, you can almost find a hotel, which matches your particular taste...So there may be better places",N
4507,"The Palmer House will definitely be my hotel of choice when visiting Chicago. Centrally located in the Loop, it is a beehive of activity. A little tidbit of trivia: it was originally built in 1871, but burned down 13 days later in the Great Chicago Fire. It was then rebuilt, apparently ""fireproof,"" making it one of the oldest hotels in the country. The interior has absolutely gorgeous vintage opulence. There is a bar in the lobby area, as well as a newly renovated ""Potter's Bar"" (which used to be Trader Vic's, the oldest Tiki bar in Chicago). Our room on the 15th floor was beautifully decorated; a pleasant step through a time warp to the distant past. The only modern problems: wireless internet & cell phone got poor reception.",N
3643,"Loved the Drake burger. A sizzling patty of corn-fed Midwestern Black Angus beef that was perfect after a long flight from SF. I also loved the sense of history, the location and the immensity of the rooms. The Manhattan I downed at the Coq D'Or was a serious concoction. I hated that my girlfriend and I ended up in a smoking room after explicitly requesting a non-smoking room and I really hated that they lost/hadn't moved our bags from the smoking room to the non-smoking room on day two of our stay. It took multiple calls to the front desk from our new non-smoking room and a visit to the front desk to get this resolved. We got a coupon for a free breakfast for having to stay in the smoking room. For the lost bags they offered another breakfast coupon. Pathetic. I informed the staff that I would stay at the Peninsula on my next visit as a result of the lost bags and the subsequent coupon offer. They ended up giving us 25% off the stay, which was thoughtful, but the damage was done. I recommend visiting the Drake for a drink. Try a modern hotel for your stay.",N
2433,"I stayed here a week ago and was lucky to use some of my Hilton points and was upgraded to the Executive Floor on the 24th floor. The first thing you notice when you walk into the hotel is the decor in the lobby, which seems to span on forever into ballrooms, meeting rooms, restaurants, and small shops. The colors are very warm and comforting as are the staff and everyone that greets you. My room had two beds and two bathrooms which was a bit excessive, but it comes with the whole upgrade. The view was decent as I was on the 24th floor, but I was caddy cornered between two points of the huge building that jut out and it was kind of a limited view. The room was very clean and everything was top class as Hiltons usually are. One thing of note was the gym. It was absolutely huge. If you are into working out when you travel you will truly enjoy the gym experience here. Even though the weights and machines may be a little old, there is HUGE variety for a hotel gym and even a mini track that goes around all the equipment. Plenty of TV's and a great view of the city make working out easy. The location of the hotel is superb. Plenty of restaurants in the Loop as well as shops and sites to see everywhere. My only complaint is the concierge. I needed to extend my stay by a day and I went to ask him what could be done. He said the hotel was booked and then gave me the number for http://hotels.com. THAT is shocking. I'm a Diamond VIP member at Hilton and the last thing I want to hear a concierge tell me is to call http://hotels.com. I'm not trying to be rude or cocky or anything, but he could have at least referred me to another Hilton or Hilton family hotel. Apart from the concierge, I loved the hotel and can't wait to be back.",N
578,"Stunning hotel. Knowledgeable and helpful staff. Room was 'ok', taking on a minimalist decor which i did not mind as much as the lack of comfort i experienced, particularly on the bed. Had breakfast in the restaurant once. Great food, good service and gorgeous setting, but I noticed they put up a 15 minute fuss when I wanted to pay in cash for what was a little more than a $20 meal. i didnt really quite understand what the fuss was all about. Sure, most customers will pay credit card for most payments, but surely a hotel establishment will make arrangements to accept cash as a form of payment. Really? I did think that was was totally ridiculous. They also made me wait 10 minutes before being seated when the restaurant was completely empty; table for 1 that is. However... coffee bar is fabulous with very yummy treats and a beautiful seating area with chess boxes and books to enjoy with your coffee. Excellent location. So close to everything you need.",N
220,"Hotel Indigo is an upbeat hidden jewel in the sometimes stuffy Gold Coast hotel district. In the earlier half of 2006, (while most of my friends and I were still trapped in the burbs) we'd frequently look to Hotwire to find a hotel when a friend's couch was unavailable. On St Patty's Day weekend in 2006, I ended up booking a room at the Hotel Indigo for a friend, myself, and any others that should straggle back to our hotel that night. When we arrived we were taken aback by the look and feel of the lobby. It felt more like residence than a hotel. The decor seemed a little more personal as if someone had built the room piece by piece. The elevators were the old style kinds with grates and although quite sound (they weren't rickety) they slightly triggered my fear of suspension. Truthfully, it could have been that combined with one of my friends jumping up and down once he realized I wasn't a fan of elevators. Ass. The hallways are brightly painted, but not done so that it appears tacky. Again, I felt like I was visiting a large home more than a hotel. This feeling was magnified once I saw my room. Although it had the same 2 beds/mirror and sink combo/separate shower and toilet room setup as most hotels, it felt like a bedroom. I tend to prefer neutral colors in decor, but somehow all the oranges, blues, whites, purples and yellows worked together. Dare I say this, but this is just a damn cute hotel. Unlike previous reviewers I didn't get the beachy vibe as much as I felt cozy and comfy. The staff was also very friendly. We didn't take advantage of room service, but they did look the other way as a bunch of 23 year olds checked in 15 additional guests (my friends are poor planners!), 3 24 packs and a visible beer bong. They were equally as non observant when we boisterously arrived (half of us on piggyback) back at 5am. Hey - St. Patty's fell on a Friday that year. I'd definitely recommend Hotel Indigo for visiting parents (I have a feeling that most mothers will adore the setup) or a nice couples getaway if you can't particularly get away from the Chicagoland area. Hey, sometimes it's nice to shake it up. The location is walkable to many attractions and the Clark/Division (Red Line) and Division (Blue Line) stops so if you can pry yourself out of bed (that bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in) almost anything in the city is mere few footsteps away. I posted a few pictures from that weekend to show room decor. You're going to want to keep in mind that this was St. Patty's Day.",N
3118,"Middle of the road W.  Nothing to special here, but consistent with the brand...which most of the time scores 4 stars at least.  Staff, food, environment and service was on par.  Not the nicest as far as decor...but for the cost, it was great.  Zero complaints.",N
2074,"I was in a wedding and the reception was here. The reception service and food was good. However while everyone loved the steak, they did not like the chicken. The cake was bad (dry, tasteless, even the frosting). I mention the latter because the hotel provides the cake. We had some room issues the first night, but the staff accommodated us and  slashed the first rate night in half. Thank you manager Ben! Room service food was great. Bath towels were scratchy. The views are beautiful. Get a drink at the bar, whether or not you are   staying at the hotel. Parking requires you to schlep up and down a steep stairwell. The location is out of the way, and the cabbies will rip you off.",N
5452,"Sorry... I am a total hotel snob. This is an ok place. The best thing about it is the location. The beds are comfortable, but not like Westin's heavenly bed. The mattresses have to be replaced, as they are just too soft. The lobby is tiny and cramped. The bathrooms are big, but need serious updating. The rooms are actually quite large and there was a great view of Barney's. It made me smile. Toiletries are ehhh... although their oatmeal soap is scented with rose oil (I think), which is quite lovely. Lots of hot water. Good shower water pressure. Fresh orchids in the bathroom... my favorite. Overall, I think this place needs a major facelift. But the location is fantastic and the people who work here are very nice and cheerful.",N
3622,"Review of high tea: PROS: 1) GREAT selection of tea.  I went with 3 friends (4 people total) and we each tried the others' teas.  Everything was fabulous. 2) Good service. 3) Nice variety of sandwiches, scones, breads, and desserts. 4) A harp player!!!  It really set the ambiance and made it a relaxing experience.  We also came with a 2 year old who was entranced by the music and kept going up to the harpist.  She was more than friendly with my niece!! 5) Nice bathrooms! 6) They refill our teapots with hot water quite often, so we always had lots of tea!  And my tealeaves still produced yummy (and flavorful tea) even after the 3rd refill of hot water. CONS: 1) The person who brought our food spoke so quickly that we couldn't understand anything he said.",N
1406,"Pros: Great location (50 feet from Michigan Avenue) Reasonable price (after using several web sites) Nice modern comfortable room Reasonably quiet Front desk and attendants were helpful and for the most part polite Good concierge advice (Giordano's and Gino's deep dish pizza are both within walking distance) If you love shopping: great shopping is blocks away. Cons: Internet was $10 per day One day we needed to use the internet from the ""office"". That was $20 per hour. If you have a car, parking is over $50 per day. There is much cheaper parking a few blocks away. This deserved 3 1/2 stars. What made me go with three stars was the memory of the day I had to use the internet downstairs and I ended up paying $20+ for the hour I used it. My next hotel had free internet in the lobby.",N
3196,"This place uses a modern motif for its interior designing.  I stayed here in the winter when they still had a $109 corporate rate.  I thought to get that rate and be right off Lakeshore is a deal.  Checking in was smooth the front desk staff were polite.  They handed my card key and directed me to the elevators to get up to my room.  The lobby area bar doubles up as a lounge and they were playing chill lounge/electronic music.  I was liking it.  I wish I had the CD.  Anyhow, I take elevator up to my floor; I step out; I'm staring down this long dark hallway and I feel like I'm in some Freddie Cougar movie.  The hallways are damn dark and it's just eerily silent.  I feel like I'm in some haunted house at a theme park.  I make it to my room and open  the door to my surprise the room looks pretty clean.  I still have a wierd complex about walking on hotel floors in my barefeet.  It gives me a nasty feeling about what i'd find if i had a black light with me.   I also take the top comforter and toss that into the closet because I always hear that hotels don't change the bed comforters as often as the bedsheets.  So i've just developed this habit of routine everytime I get to my hotel room.  Bust out the flip flops cus I ain't touching the floor and out goes the comforter.  The rooms also have an LCD TV, but what's the point of one if they're just gonna give you shitty channels to surf through and the delays to change a channel makes almost watching TV painful.  Overall this hotel wasn't all that and I expected it be way more modern chic.  The staff were polite though.  I've never eaten here so I can't rate how good their food is.  There's plenty of restaurants when you get towards Michigan.  Again, since this is a downtown hotel and if you have a car, the parking fees are going to be a bitch.",N
3857,"Worst hotel experience EVER!!! Rooms were small yet cozy, however, the staff could use a lesson or two on manners,decency and customer service. When I called to speak with a manager and explained my issues, he flat out told me I'm not the first one to make a complaint like this and about a specific ""security"" employee who has treated other guests similar...yet they still allow this behavior. Very poor management. I highly recommend staying at one of the more larger established hotels instead of The Dana. It definately was NOT worth the money that was spend to be treated so ignorantly. It was my first experience there and will absolutely be my last. If you plan on booking a room at The Dana, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere. The city has plenty of other great hotels who treat their guests with respect. I'm extremely disappointed.",N
808,Stayed for one night and for $260 total compared to sleeping at the Sheraton Chicago.  The bed was comfortable and the front desk service was exceptionally courteous and polite.  I'd come again for a cheaper rate since all I tend to do in a hotel is sleep so amenities are not on my priority but the location is good for being near a lot of the businesses and some of the northern touristy spots.  But a hike from Grant park if you want to hoof it to see the other sets of the tourist hotspots.,N
2404,"First off, I reserved my room and accidentally reserved the room for 2 nights - Friday and Saturday. The bad thing was my flight came in Saturday so I called the hotel and explained they could give my room to someone else on Friday and I would just eat the cost and still stay Saturday. When my boyfriend and I arrive at the hotel the front desk told me that they cancelled my reservation because I didn't show up on Friday. I told them that I spoke with someone about the mixup and after about 15 minutes of standing at the desk the manager comes out. They said it was their fault and gave us a room. I was almost in tears from frustration but they finally set us up with a room so I was happy - for a little while. After exploring the hotel we went back to our room and tried to turn the heat up but it wasn't working so we had to call up maintenance to fix the heater. It probably took them an hour to figure out the problem and fix it. My boyfriend and I stepped out for 10 minutes to pick up some alcohol and when we came back the room smelled like burnt hair. Gross! It was getting late so we just decided to spray a bunch of my perfume to cover the smell. I was so stressed out that we decided to leave the Hilton and find another hotel. The overall look and feel of the hotel is great, but unfortunately my experience was not so 'hot'.",N
2579,"Valet Parking $15 in a place that is tucked away on a side street, $8 for a beer, $11 for a well drink...segregated awkward crowd...priceless. I was amazed how this place was set up. Walking in, you're in a room that looks pretty nice with tables and lounge chairs, then you walk into another room which is the size of a walkin closet and then a big room with a huge bar and dance floor. Each room had different music and a different crowd. The drinks are ridiculously overpriced and I will NOT be returning anytime soon. I was here for a friends birthday, my friends birthday. I wouldn't recommend this place, aside from the occasional good song, everything else is just. MEH!?",N
4061,"Location, location, location. It was my family's first time in Chicago and we were only going to be there for a few days. Since everything seemed to be located downtown we decided to stay at the Hyatt. What a great decision. EVERYTHING was within walking distance. Millennium Park was two blocks south, you're practically on the Magnificent Mile, about one mile SW was the Willis Tower (and a mile really isn't that far of a walk people), and lastly, you're only a block or two from the lakefront and river boat tours. The concierges were great. We arrived fairly late, around 1ish in the am, and they were very accommodating and friendly. She even asked if I wanted a room with a waterfront view with no extra charge, but  unfortunately the rooms with direct view were all booked. She still gave me the best she could find and we were still able to see the river as we laid in our bed. My airline lost my son's carseat and lent me one for temporary use till ours was found. The concierges took care of switch when my son's carseat arrived with out a problem. My only complaint would be their parking. It cost $50 per night for their valet service (no private lot). I went online before our trip and found that parking at the Millennium Park's garage was drastically cheaper; $20 a night, so expect to pay a little or a few blocks walk if you have a vehicle. Other than that, absolutely no complaints. The Hyatt is a great choice.",N
571,"PUBLIC hotel is  Ian Shregers project of transformation and new beginnings but is it all its cracked up to be? Or is it just a mirage in the shariah desert?   I booked PUBLIC hotel on http://bookaroom.com, loving the price and wanting to try something new besides the occasional Hyatt or Hilton. Being from Ohio and having lived in Los Angeles, I wanted something that was moderately priced, but had a trendy flair. As far as appeal, PUBLIC exceeded my expectations. I liked being greeted by men wearing trench coats and chuck Taylor's and being waited on by beautiful people in a Tom Ford add ( remember I did live in LA), however I felt a ltittle betrayed and left with slight bad taste in my mouth. Everything was great the free wifi throughout the hotel, the clean modern gym, the nice hospitality, but when I payed for the hotel two weeks ago, I thought that was only charge I was going to receive. They didn't mention that there was a 150 dollar holding fee and being that it was a debit card the funds were withheld. You can imagine how I felt when I found out that the card I was swiping for shopping and eating was running empty. When I approached the hotel they were very apologetic and handled the situation very timely. I understand there was a lack of communication and telling people that their is a holding fee is something that is not top of their list. I am really not here to beat down on PUBLIC hotel, throw a few punches yes. I just wanted to warn people of this fee because if this happens again and you caught say a  ""New Yorker"" on a bad day, the hotel will not hear the end of it.",N
2052,"Five stars for the incredible views of Chicago and the river. Three stars for a very average Holiday Inn room with cheesy decor. Three stars for the food. Meh. Four stars from a location that, if need be, allows you to get off a plane at Midway and barely go outside to the winter air to go into the Merchandise Mart where you can look at faucets on your way to the Holiday Inn.

The hotel rooms have been redone and it shows, they are much nicer. Are they Omni level? NO- but- they are great for what you pay for! They are small, but not NYC small.

910,"I have never stayed at this hotel, nor have I ever set foot in one if its rooms. Nevertheless, I am forever grateful for the Hotel Burnham... June 28, 2008... Leaving Grant Park after the most amazing FREE Stevie Wonder show. The music was still in me as I danced down the street with good friends and a bladder full of magic lemonade. The conversation included talk of hopping on the Brown Line and heading to Lakeview, but I knew I would never make it that far. The lyric in my head quickly had  gone from Stevie's "" All I do is think about you"" to that Detrol commercial's ""Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go right now"". I assured my friends that I would catch up with them later and mumbled something about going to Marshall Fields...I rushed down Washington St. on a mission. But I would have needed a time machine to visit the Marshall Fields bathroom, or even the Macy's bathroom (the store was already closed for the night). Feeling defeated as I stared through the locked Macy's door, I turned around and took a huge sigh of relief. It was the Hotel Burnham & Atwood Cafe. I remembered eating there, and having to cut through the hotel lobby and go downstairs to visit the ladies room. I ran across the street, but slowed down as I entered the hotel lobby and smiled at the front desk staff as I made a bee-line toward the stairs. There, at the bottom of the stairs was the bathroom, just as I had remembered. Afterwards, I walked out of the Hotel Burnham with head held high, and the ability to handle the train ride without the threat of a most embarrassing moment. Thank you Hotel Burnham for being there when I needed you most.",N
1264,"Good clean hotel. The only downside was their wireless didn't work BUT they did provide us with an Ethernet cable in less than 5 minutes even though they didn't have one at the front desk.  We were able to connect but even with the cable the Internet was slooooooooow. The location is great as you are 3 minutes from The Metra and buses go by every 3-4 minutes right outside the door.   They have a local restaurant on their bottom floor, it is nothing spectacular but it saves you if you get back to your room late or if the weather forces you to stay inside.",N

They have no more rooms and bring up a man to fix the AC. I called the front desk and ask if they have somewhere I can get some beer. A guy comes and tells me he'll bring some up. I give him a ten and he never returns. He DID tell me his name,  don't give your money to this brother.",N
1525,"Yet another hotel that I booked off of Hotwire. I believe this one I got for around $75 a night. There seem to be a lot of complaints on Yelp about the elevators being too slow. From my experience they were just fine! I never had to wait more than a minute or two, which seems perfectly reasonable. I found the location to be quite convenient for my needs. We were planning on taking the Wendella boat tour, and this was literally across the street. It's a few blocks from a CTA station, but nothing unmanageable by any means. The room was nicely sized, though unfortunately our view was quite lacking. Mostly alleyway, though there was a sliver of a lake view, if I craned my neck just right. The bed was VERY comfortable, and we didn't get any noise from surrounding rooms. Best sleep I'd had in a hotel for quite a while. This hotel doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles. The business center and gym were both certainly lacking. Still, for simply a place to sleep at night, this place was more than satisfactory. I'd never go out of my way to stay here again, but I enjoyed it well enough.",N

3221,"While I really wanted to love this place--Meh-not that impressive. I did not find the staff to be welcoming at all.  The staff did not hold the door for us despite standing next to it outside.  They also did not hail a cab for us when we were leaving.  The check-in process was cold and not very welcoming.  Front desk was not even close to assisting you to find your next attraction.  Concierge was MIA.   The room was spacious, but cold temperature-wise. We happend to go on a very cold weekend, and our bathroom was constantly ice cold.  The tile floor was like standing on ice, and it didn't matter if you turned the bathroom heat on either.  It just never got warm.  We were on the 10th floor and had a considerable amount of street noise in our room. The bar was a total rip off, and they played lousy music.  It has so much potential too...  Overpriced drinks and terrible DJ will drive anyone away.  I don't know why they bother to stay open to 3 am... ZERO novelty there. I don't think I will ever stay there again. It was considerably far enough away from everything, that any *savings* on your room rate will be quickly eaten up in cab fares.  And while they attempt to be a cool hip hotel, the reality is anyone off the street can walk in and take an elevator to any floor.  There's no one standing between the MI Ave entrance and the elevators to the room.  No key-control on the elevator.  Even my JOB has that after you walk past security for crying outloud!",N
2089,Family came for a birthday and stayed here. Nice rooms that we got a good deal on via a hookup. All amenities were present and the staff we very professional.,N
660,"We went thru Priceline and got a great rate on a Tuesday nite. Room was nice and clean and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom was adequate and I liked the Neutrogena products. BE AWARE that the mini bar and snacks on top of the fridge are sensor activated so if you even lift something up to look at it, you get charged!!  We did notice in the hallway that a tray of room service food stayed in the same place for approximately 18 hours which I thought was a bit gross. It is within walking distance to many attractions in the area including Navy Pier and the Magnificent Mile. Our only problem was finding a place to eat late at night close to the hotel- we were there for the Cubs/Phillies game which went into extra innings, so we didn't get back to the area til about 11:30pm and NOTHING was open - not even TGIFridays or ESPN zone. That info has nothing to do with the review of the hotel,  just general knowledge.  Thank goodness for the chocolate chip cookies we got on arrival, they got us thru the night, even though we were looking for appetizers and a glass of wine............",N
1755,"Nice decor, excellent service, but the rooms are so SO tiny.  I mean, c'mon, a closet that is only 7-8 inches deep?  Really?  And the bathroom sink was no better; it only had about 8 inches of depth from the front to the back, making it super hard to hit the target when brushing my teeth.  On the other hand, the quality of the bed, linens, bathroom products, and even the clock radio were all top notch.  For the price, however, I prefer the Hard Rock; it has much bigger rooms and is right next to Millenium Park; it also has free wifi, a big flat screen TV, and even a stereo system and DVD player in each room.  Oh, and the Hard Rock is also about a hundred dollars LESS than the Allegro per night.",N
361,"Ideal location but one MAJOR problem - it's a Travelodge!  My husband and I, along with my mother drove from Detroit for a weekend getaway and stayed in the hotel one night.  The lobby smelled like someone's bathroom, the night shift desk clerk barely spoke any English, and the hallways were badly in need of new carpet and paint.  The room was small, for having two double beds.  Our bed was made and had freshly laundered sheets, but the bathroom was DISGUSTING - it looked as if it hadn't been cleaned in several days!  We were too tired to complain so we didn't say anything.  When we returned home, we called Travelodge's 800 number and reported our problems.  We also filed a dispute with our credit card company.  If the hotel was a better brand name and had better management, it would be perfect!  One more thing...we hated being ripped off for parking, but the hotel garage is the only place to park :(  Only if you MUST stay downtown on a limited budget would I recommend staying here.",N
2714,"I didn't actually get to stay at The James but I did attend the opening party (Mixart) and I got to see a few of the rooms that were open to everyone at the party.  The James is a lovely hotel and the rooms are amazing though I'm sure you'd have to pay a pretty penny to get one.  The beds looked like the linens were spun from clouds and all of the other furnishings were modern and sleek (hello, flat screen tv!).  One suite even had an additional room that featured a bed which was more for lounging than sleeping.  The best part was the projector set up to show movies on the wall while you lounged.  Fancypants! The drinks and appetizers being served at the party were incredible! The ""steak and egg"" was a light egg mousse topped with little pieces of steak, all presented inside an egg shell... ooh la la. Also served were these tasty, tasty pate de fruit and mini sundaes.  I'm sure everything seemed about 50% more fascinating because I was drunk off of free booze but I'm sticking to my recommendation.",N
2725,"I did not know about the complimentary breakfast either :\ Either way, this boutique hotel was a great treat. I live in Boystown but decided to have a night away and stay at the James. I felt like I lived in the modern condo of my dreams with the room's decor. The Kheil's bath products were great for a little pampering. We requested that a lamp be fixed and an additional vanity kit be brought to our room and it was done when we arrived home that night.",N
1059,Run. away. quickly. Seriously this place is gross. and weird.,N
2922,"The Good Stuff-- Close to Navy Pier & Michigan Avenue. Friendly staff, great concierge services. Decent restaurants & good drinks (EXCEPT the pomegranate martini which tasted like cough syrup). The Not So Good Stuff-- Really, really, really uncomfortable beds--unless you like being stuck in a marshmallow.   Elevators are slow - you have to build 'commute time' into your schedule.",N
1403,"Just returned home from a 3 night stay in a standard King room at the Millennium Knickerbocker.  I lived on Lake Shore Drive in the Streeterville area for 10 years, so I was pretty familiar with the area.  It was nice to visit my old stomping grounds and see what's changed in the area. Pros:  great location, close to everything.  A historical landmark, and right across the street from from the Drake Hotel, an even more historical Chicago landmark.  Room size is average for a downtown hotel, which means ""not very big"" - but the bed was comfortable and bathroom was nicely decorated with modern fixtures. Cons:  in the hotel's attempt to be eco-friendly, they installed modern, low-water-consumption toilets that aren't powerful enough to flush anything down but liquids - I had to call an engineer to plunge the toilet when we checked in.  Also, there was some evidence of yellowish-brown crud in the corners of the bathroom (gross).  The shower was another issue - they installed a nice ceiling mounted shower head as well as a handheld nozzle, but the shower itself (no bathtub) is very small and the glass door opens INWARD, so when you turn on the shower you either get shocked by cold water coming down from the ceiling, or you drench the door and bathroom floor if you choose to turn the shower on first and let it warm up.  Not a very smart layout. Additionally, if you have a car, valet parking is mandatory at $53/day (there's no self-parking) but that's downtown parking for you.  On the plus side, the valets are very friendly and pleasant, and are very prompt with retrieving your car when you call down for it.",N
3154,"I had the experience to enjoy happy hour in the lounge and I loved every bit of it.  Ambience, drinks and great crowd! One of my fav's..",N
4048,"Oh dear. As many a teacher has written in a pupil's exercise book(s), ""Could do better"". This is a large property that finds its Front Desk and other services becoming overloaded all too easily - a housekeeping issue took over a day to resolve. And there is a design ""issue"" with the West Tower - there are either an insufficient number of elevators, or they run much too slowly ... 10 minute waits are simply not acceptable! My recommendation : look for something else .... !",N
2302,"We stayed at this location for a conference for 5 days in June 07. The location was nice but I was not impress with the hotel at all. I rather stay off of Michigan Ave. if it meant we can stay at a hotel where it is cleaner and spacious. We arrived during the conference and it took awhile for us to check-in. Unfortunately, it was during high school proms, the lobby was swamped with 4 different proms the weekend and the attendees of the conference (McCormick Convention Center). I was not impress with the wait in the elevators and because it was so crowded with unsupervised teenagers and professionals, getting to the top floor was a hike. The hallway was very narrow and gloomy with unattractive 70's carpet. The room was very tight. It was two double with a 'view' but it was not much of a view. The got us excited during check in but the room/ window was against a wall so we can only see out at an angle. The bathroom was very ugly. The tub was standard and small. Very dated. The toilet was old and the seat was chipping so I can't tell if they cleaned the toilet or not. The closet door did not slide; we called someone to fix it and not one came by to fix the door during our stay. (5 days of neglect). The iron did not work so we had to call for another one. We needed to iron our clothes for work. That was also a drag. Bar was small and dingy. The desk did not know of late night restaurants. Getting a cab was about 20-30 minute wait. I was not impressed at all. The city is full of fun things to do but at the end of the day, we dreaded coming back to our room. I have to go to Chicago every year for the hubby's conference and this is one hotel I plan on never returning to. I felt like I was in a run down old Vegas casino-hotel. ****Update**** as of Summer 2008, this Marriott Downtown location went through a major renovation. Looks amazing and with a sexy bar - t.v.'s everywhere. I would stay here again if Amalfi's booked.",N
3378,"Five stars for the service and value aspect.  It's not a ""five star hotel.""  It's not the Ritz.  But as a choice for out-of-towners for a downtown wedding - this seems like a good choice.  At least it is for me - we secured a rate with them for next year for a wedding that is almost half the cost of the other rates of local Michigan Ave hotels.  Consider the hotel is a little outdated - currently a renovation (soft remodel) is planned for December thru March of next year.  They'll be updating the rugs, rooms, walls, floors, lobby, etc.  The rooms are currently clean, efficient, perfectly placed on Michigan Ave - and the hotel has a shuttle that will take you up and down Michigan Ave throughout the day.  They also have a pool with a lifeguard which is in an atrium.  It's not the Ritz, but if you don't need your shoes shined - it works.",N
3225,"A great idea for a hotel! As someone who would rather crash at a friends place when visiting an old city of residence than stay at a hotel in a tourist destination, it was a nice change for once. My friend and I had a Groupon for a good rate, and we had a nice room! It was on a lower level than advertised, but it was still a good view. Right in the heart of some nice places to drink. Each level has a theme for each band and a piece of memorabilia relating to that band. We had the Rolling Stones. I got to stare at David Bowie taking a wee, and sometimes if you're in the right place at the right time, you can run into minor celebrities! Unfortunately, the Check In, Rock Out program requires a $1,000 guarantee in case of any damages. What would have been a potential incentive turned out to be something we couldn't do due to the extraordinary price for a guitar that costs less than that, even for a nice model! However, this was only minor as the experience was very well-received. We also were given a code for free wi-fi that didn't work. We didn't say anything since we didn't need it for anything important. And thinking being a Groupon user would make them incorporate some crazy fees, we only had to pay extra for taxes. Not bad for a one night stay!",N
1466,"Perfect location, rooms were nice and clean, but wasn't overly impressed with it. Believe it or not, I've had better service at lower priced hotels. ""24"" hour business center was closed, breakfast was so-so. It's a nice hotel for downtown, but I don't think I'd go back. There are plenty of other hotels DT or cheaper that I've experienced better service at.",N
204,"I stay here about ten days a year. They are human, they make mistakes. They also do thier best to make things right when they do. Good rooms, some nice views, and right next to all the mag mile shopping. The bar downstairs has gone down hill in the past year though, not the place to go anyway.",N
2314,"Yes, the location on Michigan Avenue is great, there is also a fairly busy bar scene if you feel like mingling with out-of-towners, but the decor of the place is a little crazy.   The bathroom is small and the room service food wasn't great and the worst part is that I asked for breakfast to be delivered between 7:45-8:00 and they came knocking at 6:30 (that's 3:30am in California).   Notable fact-if you need a FedEx Kinkos they have one on the second floor of the hotel, they'll also charge you a $55 service fee to deliver boxes, you've already paid to ship, to your room from their second floor facility. Wow.",N
4772,"I'm not experienced with hotels in Chicago so maybe its normal to spend $244 a night for a hotel and have to stay in a room big enough for a king bed and thats all. There was a dresser with a tv but the bed was so close to the dresser that I could not open the drawers. Internet you have to pay for (about $8 an hour). No fridge, or any other furniture in the room. There was no coffee maker (because they want you to buy the crappy expensive coffee at the starbucks downstairs). I can deal with a small room but I like to have my coffee first thing and I hate starbucks. I've stayed at Comfort Inns that were better than this. I guess what you pay for is the fancy bar and restaurant and lobby. I would never stay here again. Also the security deposit is about $51 a night and parking is $38 (self park) or $61 (valet) a night.",Y
3956,"My wife and I stayed here with my Son for a short trip.  This is an old hotel, but we had a great experience.  The room was nice and clean and everything worked perfectly.    Its an old hotel so our expectations were not overly high, but the price for the location was great.",N
4676,"I stayed here over a year ago and I should have known better.  I read reviews from it but didn't heed any warnings.  They were complaining about the carpet being wet.  So when I was going through the reviews before booking this hotel I figured, there is no way they would have this same problem, since the review I read was written a year prior to me checking into this dump.  Sure enough when I check in, they still couldn't fix this problem.  That was complaint #1.  Complaint #2, their bed fills up the whole room.  I rate this place pricey because no matter what kind of bargain you may find online, it's not worth the trouble.",N
4954,"I'm not sure if employees are putting up reviews on here or what but the Avenue hotel is way out of their depth. First of all, the people who work there are so stuck up and have zero class. I'm a meeting planner for a very large, top rated company in Chicago and I merely called to get some information on service charges the hotel may charge. This helps me decide which hotels I'll consider using or not and since each hotel varies, I thought I'd call.  Knowing the Avenue is somewhat newish on the scene, I figured I'd give them a try - what a mistake! My first attempt at getting someone resulted in me getting transferred back to the operator only to have to repeat to him 5x that I needed to speak with someone in Sales and Catering. He didn't understand what I meant, he only understood if I said I wanted either, sales or catering. Uhh, let's use some common sense guy, transfer me to either. I'm a potential paying customer so the last thing you should be doing is arguing with me. Then I got some snarky guy Rene or something on the phone from the Sales office. I simply told him I was planning a meeting and wanted to know his hotels service charges. Rather than be friendly and answering my question he continued to badger me and ask where I was from, why I needed to know and what type of service charge did I need. He spoke to me as if I had no idea what I was asking. When I mentioned that I didn't want to give my company name and deal with RFPs at this time, I really just wanted the service charges, he just was so snotty and rude. I would NEVER use this hotel for business or for pleasure. I mean, I was even extending myself calling them. No one even knows who or what the Avenue is... get over yourself!",Y
4233,"I came here to babysit while the parents were in town for a wedding. I arrived and went to the front desk to have them call up to the room. Oh no... that is too much to ask. The desk person pointed and barked at me to use the phones to call the room. I then get to the elevator and nowhere am I told that there were two different elevator banks. I go all the way up only to have to come back down and run across the hotel to the other elevator bank.  I knew I'd have time on my hands so I brought my laptop to get some work done. Once the baby was asleep I decided to get rolling on my work.  Imagine my surprise when I was told that I had to pay for internet. Really?  You can go almost anywhere now and get free WiFi.  Luckily, I was prepared and was able to work around this. THEN I ordered dinner. I was paying cash and told them right away that I did NOT want them charging the room and that I was paying cash. The food came and the gentleman who brought it did not have change. My meal (mind you, it was just one meal...chicken sandwich and a diet coke. It was nothing fancy and nothing more) was $28... I gave him $40 and he had to go downstairs to get change. He returned an hour later with it. I was not too impressed with this place and, in the future when I travel, I may just steer clear of any Hyatt.  If they can't get it right in Chicago, I doubt they will get it right elsewhere.",N

3871,"Great hotel, great service. We got here early and valet checked our bags, which were delivered to our room when we checked in later with no problems. My husband had arranged for a bottle of Prosecco, which was waiting when we arrived. The bill was from a wine shop more than a few blocks away, so I was impressed with the effort they made to get what he wanted. We had tried to book a massage at the hotel spa, but they were booked, so the concierge also booked us at a nearby spa at a discounted price. A+ service. The room decor was great - we had a cozy king, which doesn't have the floor to cieling window, so it was a little dark, but that was fine with us. Having a balcony was really a plus. The shower is amazing, and the beds were comfortable. The room was small, but the space was well-used. I was really dissappointed with the restaurant and the vertigo lounge upstairs (which I reviewed separately), but I would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone wanting to stay near the Magnificent Mile.",N
3768,"Stayed here on a business trip and I have to say this one of the trendiest hotels I've stayed in.  This hotel is very comparable to the W Hotels , but more on the boutique side. I arrived around 10pm at night and was greeted by the friendly door man w/ dreads.  I was really hungry and he recommended me a couple of good places to eat throughout my stay.  He offered to help me with my luggage, despite me only having a carry-on.  Dana Hotel, if you're reading this, please recognize your doorman w/ dreads (or braids.. not sure!?!) As another reviewer was saying.. this place does have the sexiest shower ever!!!",N
5243,"I've stayed in Chicago four times in the last few months, in four different hotels.  The hotel was by far the least desirable of the four.  The staff was inept, the room wasn't that clean, or that nice, and the service at the restaurant was horrific.",Y
2042,"Attended a wedding here a few weeks back and overall it was pretty decent.  We enjoyed the Cityscape Bar quite a bit, it's a nice layout w nearly floor to ceiling windows allowing for some great views, right at the bend in the Chicago river.   The food from the reception was above average, considering it was wedding food where it's rarely memorable.  I think it was a NY strip with potatoes and veggies.  The steak a bit overcooked (still v flavorful) but again, to expect a 5 star dining experience when the staff is tasked w serving hundreds of people at the same time, is a stretch and unrealistic.  In fact, I would recommend this place as an option to those who would consider doing a wedding reception here.",N
1129,"Stayed here for a friend's wedding. The rooms were very nice and decent sized, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the location was excellent. The price was high, but I was able to walk or take public transportation anywhere I wanted or needed to go. As long as price is not an issue, I would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a place to stay in the heart of Chicago.",N
2432,"I'm actually not that impressed with the Hilton Chicago, where I've stayed the last two nights, but it might be because the conference I'm attending is at the Palmer House. For $260 a night, the Hilton is just a bit too little. The lobby area isn't that great, there are way too many elevator banks, and it's occasionally unclear which elevators you can use to go to which floors. Then, when I arrived, they'd assigned me to a smoking room, even though I'd requested a nonsmoking room. The room didn't smell too badly, so I didn't bother changing rooms at the end of the day yesterday, but the room itself was confusing. Two beds, OK. But two bathrooms? I've never stayed in a hotel room with two bedrooms before. Which one do I use? Which one do they clean? Bizarre. That said, the wifi was relatively inexpensive, and the signal was strong. CNN was on the TV. And the alarm clock worked. I slept well, the Net worked, and that's about all that mattered. There have to be better hotels.",N
4568,my DH and I went to a wedding at the Empire Room and we both agreed they served some of the best seafood we had ever tasted. they offered i think halibut (?) for dinner and italian inspired seafood h'orderves. the historic gold and black touches made the ballroom very elegant. the gold leaf and elaborate candelabra really stood out. the lobby is as good looking if not better than the ballroom. the balcony that overlooks it was a nice touch for the cocktail hour. we did not stay there so i cannot really give any insight to the rooms though since we were only there for the wedding reception.,N
2167,"Great Chicago hotel on Michigan avenue.  We had a really great stay here in a 15th floor corner room overlooking Michigan avenue. The room was really big but I can't recall if we had something up from a standard room.  We had 4 windows on Michigan Ave, 1 window facing north and two facing south.  The views at night were just amazing and really made for a sublime weekend. The bathroom was quite nice with an oversized bathtub and glass enclosed shower.  The bed and pillows were excellent.  One of the better beds I've had at a hotel. The hotel bar is really cool and fun.  It's open on two sides so it makes you feel in the center of things.  It opens and extends into the lobby. There is also a restaurant in the hotel called Eno on Michigan Ave.  This is probably the best wine bar I've been to, or at least the one I most enjoyed myself at.  It has very subdued lighting and a somewhat dark and rustic decor making it very romantic.  They have 700 varieties of wine and killer cheese plates and hand/home made chocolate truffles. Another great thing about this hotel is it's unconventional layout.  The first few floors of the hotel are a twisting and winding maze of mixed levels, mysterious statues, large doors to ballrooms, chandeliers, and places to peep out over the lobby. All this and it's actually reasonably priced.",N
2308,"This is a review of their banquet facilities only; my graduate school alumni board, of which I am a member, recently held an awards ceremony at the Marriott and I think that it wound up being what is expected from a top-tier banquet hall, but with a few outstanding perks: *The entrance immediately gives you a feeling of being somewhere important. You walk in the door to a stair entrance down to the lounge/lobby and bar area, which is very welcoming. *The first course, a tomato bisque crostini (crostada? crostadelicious is all I have to say) was impressive- rich tomato cream soup served in ramekins covered with a pot-pie like flaky crust. Pretzel rolls and a variety of others complimented the first course really nicely and had me excited for the rest--dinner (chicken/mashed potatoes) and dessert (tiramisu) were fine but not noteworthy. Average wedding food fare. *The decor: strange jellyfish/bubbly like chandeliers that weren't so weird as to be distracting, but were still pretty enough to comment on. The room decor and lighting overall were pleasant. Also, to enter for dinner, a guy walked around with a mini-vibe set playing to get our attention to announce that it was time to sit down. Old school style.   Otherwise this was a pretty average experience. The house red wine at the bar upstairs (7th floor was where we were at) was Estancia, which I have found is becoming increasingly common. It's okay but not preferable. I'm sure that has to do with our budget as well as the Marriott's own choice. Anyhow, it's a nice venue with a few defining factors and it served our purpose quite well. I would use it again.",N
898,"My folks (and sometimes I) always stay here when they are up in the Chicago area. Nestled in downtown Chicago (and basically across the street from Macy's for all you shoppers), this is a great place to stay, unwind, have a drink, or grab some dinner. The Burnham is more of a boutiquey type hotel with a lot of quirky nuances. The decor is very Algonquin Circlesque (I know that isn't a word, but whatev) due to the fact that it used to be an office building from the 40s-50s. The rooms are cozy and the service is fantastic :) Also, they are pet friendly so feel free to bring along your trusty travelling sidekick!!!! Bonus: They offer a free wine hour for all their guests at, I believe, around 5pm for most (if not all) nights :) A great way to unwind after a long and eventful day in the city!!!",N
1098,"3.5 stars -- This is a nicely renovated hotel located in a pretty accessible part of downtown Chicago. Good business hotel, and perfect for our Lollapalooza weekend due to its proximity to Grant Park. The service staff are all professional and friendly. Two points to note: 1. I partied all night on my last night there and went to sleep at 730am - asked for a 1030 wake up call. They called twice, and of course I didn't hear the phone.. and because I didn't pick up, they sent someone to knock on the door and wake us up. That's service. 2. My friend B dropped his wallet at the entrance when he left for the airport before us, and they immediately tracked back to which room he stayed in.. called us, and told us to let him know asap. Good thinking guys! The reason I'm only giving it 3.5 stars is because I noticed that the bathroom wasn't cleaned that impeccably for a place that costs $300 a night. The towels were replaced and all, but the floor wasn't swept and the T.P. was almost not replaced in time. So that was the only bad thing. OH.. and they don't have a swimming pool. That's kind of a bummer. Internet also costs $15 but that's generally how it is with fancier hotels. AND.. they forgot to replace the tea bags that we used. Oh well!",N

My only complaint is the layout is a bit confusing and took me about 1.5 days to figure out.",N

The cab ride into the city is short though. The check in line was long but it moved quickly. I wasn't happy to see that the self check in kiosk wasn't working. Those are relatively new! They should work! But whatever, the front desk guy was fast and really helpful so human interaction was actually preferred in this situation. Our suite was GORGEOUS and everything was perfect. They have great amenities and a HUGE lounge with a little shop for coffee, snacks, reading materials...ect. The valet and bell hop guys are very nice...plenty of room to handle many cars. The cab line downstairs at the peak of ""going out"" time was sort of long but it moved quickly.

My family of 4 squeezes into a single room with double beds - BUT that type of room has 2 enormous bathrooms with marble. Rooms are clean and since it's an old hotel with thick walls - quiet. Like the other reviewers stated - staff is friendly and very good, but prices for amenities and restaurants are outrageous.

986,"Note to self: When planning a last minute trip to Chicago, don't choose a weekend when 60,000 doctors are in town for a medical convention. For a quick family trip (my mom, dad and brother), we decided to head to Chicago to visit old friends. Unfortunately, because of the convention, every last hotel room in the city was booked. Finally, we were able to find one last room at the Amalfi Hotel. As a 20 something, the prospect of sharing one hotel room with my parents and my younger brother was frightening. Fortunately, the Amalfi made it an amazing experience. The room was spacious enough with it's 2 queen sized beds and large bathroom to accomodate us and our stuff. Upon check in the concierge remembered my mother from their phone conversation a few days prior and was so sweet, friendly and helpful. She gave us great recommendations for places to go for dinner and drinks which really made the trip all the more worthwhile. One of the best perks is the free happy hour from 5:30-7pm every night. They served tons of antipasti appetizers - cheeses, breads, olives, bruschetta, etc. They also had a bartender making any drink you wished. The complimentary breakfast was great too! They had one on every floor and served standard croissants, bagels, yogurt etc. The gym was also great - plenty of cardio equipment, free weights, and fun movies playing on the tv to keep you entertained. The location was great too, which a few bars and restaurants within a few blocks and the Magnificent Mile a few blocks more. This hotel had everything you needed and wanted for a place to stay in Chicago and great staff and amenities to make the trip even more pleasant. It's more of a boutique-y hotel then say, a giant Hyatt, but for me, that was exactly what I wanted. Thank you medical convention for forcing me to stay at what is now one my favorite hotels!",N

658,"Check in was fine.. I had such a long day, I couldn't wait to take a nice hot shower/bath. I stepped into my room to find a used washcloth in the middle of the entryway. Nasty!  I also found a used napkin in the minibar tray! Gross!!  There isn't a tub, only a shower. Low and behold the hotel gives me a handicap accessible room that has one of those removable shower heads. The shower head is stuck in the lowest position. I hate those removable shower heads, especially if you have to fight with it to stay in place, much less try to keep the shampoo from getting in your eyes. I couldn't get the locking mechanism to stay in place, so I called to ask if they would change my room. She said unfortunately, we are sold out and I will call maintenance to fix the shower head. A half an hour later after 2 trips and 2 men, the shower was finally fixed. The bathroom looked run-down to me.  The mirror was broken and jimmy rigged to the wall; the seal in the shower area was worn and coming off. The floor I was on was pretty noisy and I checked in pretty late, like 11pm. Also, I went to the hotel website to pull the spec sheet, which is right on on the website notes a ""hot breakfast bar"". No such luck!  Know before you go.. no breakfast offered other than room service or the bagel shop downstairs.",N
2482,Nice hotel in a great location! My only problem was the breakfast on the executive floor was too crowded and ran out of food and coffee quickly. You had to bus the tables yourself before you could sit in one. I think anybody can go up their whether they are supposed to or even are staying their because they never check to see if you are even a guest.,N
4402,"Wow - great spot for a party! I hadn't been to the Palmer House since I was a kid until this week for a work event.  I have to say, it was one of the nicest work events that I've been to.  From what I could see, everything was done beautifully.  The meeting rooms/ball rooms we used were beautiful.  The coordination of moving a large group through the hotel was done nicely - with staff members directing the group.   The sound for the meeting and the band later was fantastic.  Everything was set up nicely in terms of food, bars, dance floor, tables.   Based upon the fact that most people stayed until the end of the night - dancing up a storm, I think that the party was a success and I think it was a great venue!",N
2746,"Stayed at the James on our recent trip to watch the Cards maul the Bears.  Great location with lots of food options nearby.  Very friendly staff, and nicely appointed room, though quite small.  The bed was super comfy and the linens and pillows were awesome.  Big-ass flat screen TV, but as is the usual deal in a hotel, no HiDef, meaning crappy-looking stretch-o-vision.  Wouldn't normally care but we did catch the Sunday night football game in the room, and could have used a decent picture.  Oddly, the TV kept turning itself off randomly.  But enough about the TV, it's quite inconsequential.  The bathroom was great, with a nice shower and high-end toiletries.  All in all, a very comfortable place to spend 3 nights, and would definitely do it again and recommend to anyone without hesitation.",N
4658,"I stayed here back in late October 2009. The rooms are a little small, but they are very clean and comfortable. Perfect for a couple or someone visiting the city alone. The staff was very friendly and they let us check in early, which worked out great! Parking was free if you have a hybrid- we don't, but could have saved a lot of money on parking if we did! There is a small spa in the hotel. We had thought about scheduling massages, but it didn't seem to get much service which concerned us. So, we decided against it. There is also a restaurant that connects to the lobby. We had free breakfast tickets from the hotel. It was overpriced for what it was, and they were short staffed- and service was horrible. I wouldn't pay to eat here, but it was alright for a free meal. Despite the restaurant, spa, and smaller rooms, I would stay here again. The rooms and bathrooms are very clean (newly remodeled) and comfortable! I would definitely recommend it!",N
2827,This is a great hotel in a great location!  Their continental breakfast is one of the best I've ever had and the beds are so comfy!,N
5503,"I would have never thought that a Best Western could be this nice.   Great location, too.  Right in the heart of the party district on the corner of Roscoe and North Halstead. There was even a coffee maker, refrigerator/freezer and microwave in the room.  The front desk folks were very helpful and friendly, too.",N
4699,"I was so worried about my stay at the hotel after reading some of the reviews online, but maybe the hotel felix is aware of their inconsistent reputation and is working to change it. I booked through a third party online site for a very low price for a friday night stay. I was traveling with my aunt, so it wouldn't have been a big deal if the room only had one bed, but I called two days before our arrival to put in a request for two beds. The representative I spoke with was very kind and accommodating, and told me she could not promise that the room would have two beds, but that she would note it on my reservation. When we checked in, the host had already set us up in a room with two beds, and away from the elevators. The room was a perfect size for one night (maybe not so for a family). The beds are not queen-sized, but they are so comfortable. The room had a pleasant smell, was quiet (although there is some noise from the hall), and the H2O spa amenities are fantastic. The sink in the bathroom was odd, but was not too difficult to use. I really liked that there were makeup removing towlettes, q-tips, and cotton balls available, as well as a small hair dryer. The shower was big and had a rainfall showerhead. The lobby is really beautiful, and in the morning they serve metropolis coffee! The doormen are so friendly, and had big smiles for us even at 7:30am in the very cold chicago morning. I would definitely stay here again!",N

5448,"Sutton Place in the Right Place: Being Chicago suburbanites, we had decided to ""vacation"" in Chicago for an evening. We looked for a hotel that would allow us to be close to the things we wanted to enjoy and The Sutton Place Hotel had the right location. (Be sure to check for specials and consider the different types of rooms. The prices vary widely.) Our first impression as we checked in was that the lobby was dark and the staff was unfriendly. Once we got to the room, things were much better. (The elevator was one of the fastest I have ever ridden.) The Deluxe King Room was spacious and had a nice view of Rush St. The bathroom was huge for a hotel. The tub was big enough for two! The room included a nice sound system with a CD player and a few CDs. Unfortunately the CDs had seen better days and there was a lot of skipping. The location of this hotel is great if you want to experience Rush St. with a minimum of travel. We went to dinner at Gibsons, had drinks at Dublin's Pub, and listened to jazz at The Back Room without walking more than a half block. Many drinks later we retired for the evening. A soak in the tub was a perfect way to wind down. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were fluffy. The A/C was very quiet, but effective at keeping the room cool. In the morning we went to The Original Pancake House which is right across the street. The apple pancake was delicious! Once again, the location of this hotel was our primary reason for choosing it. As we checked out after a wonderful stay, we were surprised by the steep cost of valet parking. I thought that $40/day for a guest of the hotel was a little steep. Overall we enjoyed our stay and will definitely keep Sutton Place in mind for our next trip to Rush St.",N
3161,"Really modern and kinda swanky when you walk in.  I like the overall setup.  The gift shop is awesome and has some really interesting one of a kind jewelry items and it has some cute purses and shirts too, but they are a little on the pricey side.  Both times I stopped in it was the same girl working and she is super cool and personable.  I have never stayed in a room so I can't review that part of the hotel.  I also attended a Style Chicago event here on one floor.  It was nice enough, can't say the views were too great from whatever floor we were on.",N
892,"I was prepared to love Burnham Hotel. Being from San Francisco I was well aware of the Kimpton boutique hotel experience but... I walked into the lobby through a rathr ghetto underwhelming awning that needed an update.  It revealed none of the glamour that envelops you when you enter the lobby. Glorious red, wood, and marble transport you to another time. I walked into my room using an old fashioned key with a pendant emblazoned with their signature Celtic armor/motif that repeats throughout the hotel...  Only to find a woman brushing her teeth in her bras!  Clearly I've been assigned the wrong room!  Ok a fluke...  Not a big deal. My new room was located on the 5th floor with a view of Washington street.  No woman in bras but I was greeted by beautiful yellow wallpaper, fancy electronics and striking blue and white room scheme. I nestled into my bed, and cozied with a beer and organic kettle chips from the honor bar. I had a all day meeting starting at 6 a very important that I get good sleep.  So far so good Except I was woken up at night constantly by the sound of construction of a new building across the street. It was a jackhammer (are jackhammers allowed at that time of day??!!)  what was more  perplexing is that a lot of rooms faced Washington. Am I the only one who couldn't sleep through the noise?   Travelers beware. I love this hotel but please ask for a room away from Washington if you want sleep!",N
5251,"I stayed here for a conference and was happy with all aspects of my stay. The building was beautiful and being inside McCormick Place made life much easier. I enjoyed great service from start to finish - the doorman, bellman, front desk, concierge and room service. The room was a good size and clean. Best of all, I had an excellent view of the Chicago skyline from my room. I did find the room a bit noisy at night though, which made it difficult to sleep. I also want to bestow extra praise to the housekeeping staff. They found and returned something of value to me that I had left in my room after checking out. There are still honest people in this world. I highly recommend staying here if you are going to be at the convention center. It's a lovely hotel and so convenient to be able to return to your room and relax for a while after being on your feet all day.",Y
3895,"¡hola hermana! I am writing you from a hotel that may have been great once upon a time. It boasts to have once been the ""home of presidents,"" but it has since fallen from grace. All that remains are the reminders of it's former glory, mostly in the form of it's ""coat of arms"" that is prominently featured on blankets, sheets, drapes, shower curtains, wallpaper, and at the top of this letter. I opted to stay here because I read it was one of the most haunted hotels in all of chicago. Unless the shrieks from the nearby blue line rail are the cries of restless spirits, i'd say the only real fright is the lack of air conditioning. Although it has lovely offerings such as a gym, a bar/lounge, two eateries, and whatever this ""gold room"" thing is, they neglect to offer what every traveler needs...FREE INTERNET! What is this, 1998? They are grasping at the past to prove their greatness, but everything looks like just that, including the strangely dressed staff. Everything looks like it should be cool, like in a wes anderson sort of way, but it falls short and comes off more as ironic than anything else. You know me, I am not above spending nights in my car, but as it is a dream of mine to live in a hotel and have a driver, this falls quite short of my vision. It lacks any sort of real charm. Maybe if it had some spotted mice... Love, Brian (Your brother)",N
1535,This hotel is wonderful. We had a great experience with the front desk and they even gave us coupons one night for a late dinner. The rooms are fun and somewhat art deco style along with the rest of the hotel. The view was amazing and the rates were very fair. The only thing I have to say is the elevator is a little slow but add character to the place. We plan to be back.,N
1558,So they made it write - i got a call from the reservation manager and she apologized for the slew of unfortunate incidents and gave me a bit of a refund. i do like that they called me back and took it my complains seriously. says a lot about a business. i would now consider staying here again. Thanks.,N
2712,"A couple years back my boyfriend took me to this hotel for my birthday and I still think about my stay there to this day. From the moment I stepped foot in the hotel the staff made me feel special. They were extraordinarily attentive and the customer service was excellent. Our suite was gorgeous, with a beautiful view of the city and modern, hip, yet comfortable furniture and decorations. The staff brought up my surprise birthday cake along with a bottle of champagne all beautifully presented. When we were looking for a place to have a special birthday/valentines dinner the hotel representative patiently weighed out our options with us and helped us find the ideal spot we were looking for, they even made the reservation for us! The James Hotel definitely made my birthday one to remember!",N
3015,"Have you ever met a drink that just changed your world?? The mango mojitos are just to die for! These babies can probably bring world peace and end all wars after one sip or gulp.  They are made right in front of you with fresh fruit and mint. (Thanks Mitchell now I crave mojitos! haha) They do come in other flavors as well, but who doesn't like mango???? You can take your fabulous mojitos and sit out side on the warm nights or days...there is lake michigan in front of you. Word to the wise it can get quite packed on weekend nights, so go a little early. The hotel its self is not too bad. Good views over all.  Great guest service. Bliss soaps, shampoos and lotions in the bathroom. Its also a great way of trying out Bliss products instead of shelling out the 30 plus bucks. I am not a big fan of the whole wooden window thing that seperates it from the room. Couldn't they just use frosted glass like aloft??? Overall, the rooms are good. There is a pool upstairs, but it is small and not heated in the winter...bburrr!!! The W also has a bar on their top floors. Before it used to be open to who ever, but now you must present a key to get up there. Nice for their guests safety. Since it is now just for guests, the bar can be a hit or miss with the crowd and music. Recap: Bar upstairs (meh) + hotel room and stay (good) + lobby bar (good)= we will give you a 3",N
2858,"A++ for the fluffiest down beds & 4 overstuffed pillows! Waking up grumpy was not  an option & these *blissful* beds did the trick. - Location- Great! $5 taxi ride to the Blue Line if you are coming from O'Hare. Walking distance to Michigan street (shopping!) and the Chicago River Walk ( sight seeing and waterfront). - Room-  Room Service was average....hot breakfast after a long night goes a long way. But it was NOT HOT enough.  Major * faux pas* Room itself was basic, but again, extra points for the BEDS! - Amenities- Awesome gym complete with free weights and bosu ball. There is a sun deck off the gym too- which is perfect for a Seattlite in need of some vitamin D!  NOTE  If you sign in they will bill you $12.95/day. Let your conscience be your guide.

3695,"I stayed here in July '08 for 4 nights and wasn't blown away by the hotel. I struggled between a 3 & 4 star because I expected more since it was ""The Drake"" but overall my stay was fine. Although it does have the historic charm, the location is great and the service was ok overall, there were little things that I didn't particularly care for which is why I gave it a 3 star rating.  If I could, I would of given it a 3.5 star rating. 1. When we first checked in, they gave us a room that was not made.  The bed looked like someone had laid on top of it, there was garbage in the trash can etc.  I went downstairs and they changed my room but I didn't like that the person from the front desk went to the back office to check to make sure that the room really wasn't made. 2. I assume the elevators are still from the 1920's because they move incredibly slow.  Doesn't sound like a big deal but when you have to wait several elevators (they are full from so many people waiting) in order to finally get in one during peak times (ie. check out time etc.) it's a little annoying.   3. It was pretty warm when we were there and we wanted to get ice. Well the ice machine on our floor was broken.  When I flagged down someone that worked there to tell him, he said that I'd have to go to a different floor and try the machines there.  I would think being a high end hotel, I expected him to have offered to get some for us but I guess I was expecting too much. 4. The room itself was ok although I thought the carpet needed to be changed.  It looked really used and worn in and definitely needs to be updated.  The bed was comfortable though which is a big plus in my book. One of the good things about the hotel was the gym.  The gym had just been remodeled and it's very nice.  There are some cardio and weight machines.  There is also a section that had free weights too and there are flat screen tv's there too. Overall I wouldn't mind staying at the Drake again but I don't think I'd go out of my way to stay there again.",N
5272,"I really enjoyed my stay here.  My best friend and I went here for a girl's night out and had a great time.  The room is beautiful and roomy.  We had a view of the park and a partial view of the marina on Lake Shore Drive.  The location is great..nearby to Michigan Avenue and great restaurants and shopping in the area.  We decided to eat at Aria, the sushi bar downstairs.  I had never tried sushi, but I have an open mind and have to say it was very good.  Also, we had the spa package...excellent spa and service A+++",Y
858,"Besides the wall paper and that's not really important, I can't think of anything bad to say. Staying over the New Years holiday I picked this hotel and the ""L' is really about 20 feet to the left of the front door. You're only seconds from going anywhere you want in town. My room was at the front of the hotel and I didn't find the noise of the train to bother me at all. The staff was very friendly, and the room was extremely clean (I cleaned rooms in a former life so I'm picky). I plan on using this hotel again when I come back and the price was such a bargain for the room and the parking, that it makes it hard for me not to use them again. If you like older hotels with charm then I suggest this one, but if you looking for water parks with in room electronic activities then this is not your hotel.",N

Overall, the room and hotel was very clean. I'm an OCD neat freak so this is very important to me. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I really loved the location of this place. It was within walking distance to great shops and food. This hotel is very unique (in a good way). I read the reviews before staying here, so it didn't surprise me that the rooms were small. The TV was in a very odd position, at the side of the bed, but we didn't come to Chicago to watch TV so this didn't bother me. The only problem we had was after the second night, both of our room keys stopped working. We went down to the front desk and they took care of us right away. I would stay here again.",N
1370,"The location was great and the rooms were fine; the bathroom was great in fact. In terms of customer service, however, it failed miserably for me and my students. I was there with 6 students of mine for a field trip to visit art museums. So as a group, we checked out 5 rooms. First of all, the hotel had a $75 authorization charge per night per room which I never had to deal with before, and it was something the hotel didn't inform us about when booking the room. For some of the students, depending on the bank, the funds will not be released for 3-5 business days. Problems: 1. When checking out, the bill that was slipped under the door noted that I had stayed there for one night (which was wrong since I had stayed there for two nights) and that I owed them for that night. Again, not true since the room was paid in full in advance. 2. The day after we arrive back home, a student of mine notifies me that her bank account had a $368 dollar charge from the hotel. First of all, it was only supposed to have been a $150 authorization. So when I called the hotel, I was informed that it was a mistake and they have no idea why the person checking her in did that. !!!?? How do you not know how to type in 150 and instead type in 368? So that is 200 dollars that this student won't have access to immediately, not to say she already had 150 dollars that she wouldn't have had access to. Pretty bad.",N

The curtains, pillowcases, bedspreads are all very bright and may even be shocking to those not used to such unconventional designs. The ""L"" tracks run by the west side of the hotel.

The valet/parking people have really upped their game. I have no desire to deal with parking when I'm in the loop and they just dropped their prices by more than $10 (I know right, in this economy?). 2. The food is phenomenal. 3. The staff inside the hotel are friendly Downsides: 1. Don't get a room too low to the ground, the view sucks 2. The front desk is more like a zoo than a service station. Although they do ""care"" they are very busy and unless you are Ghandi your personalized service is not going to be very personalized. 3.

I told the front desk it was my birthday and they sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne and the best chocolate torte I have ever had. Yummmmm I chose the special rate which includes parking (normally $51 per night) and two free drinks at the bar.  It was well worth it.   They also have a complimentary Acura car service which I took full advantage of.

2189,"In short... decent room.... terrible service. I was in Chicago last week on business and my company put me up here. I wont say it was terrible but I have experienced better. It is a good thing I didn't have to pay for the stay or I would have been really mad. I had a standard room, it was clean and nicely decorated. In another review I saw someone complain about a chair with stuffing spilling out. I don't know if I was in the same room, but I also had a chair with stuffing hanging out. However, the leather that the chair was covered with was amazing, I only sat in that chair. I don't blame them for not getting rid of it and I don't think that it could be repaired. The internet is outrageously overpriced 14.95 per 24 hours. I was in desperate need of internet so I bit the bullet and signed on (I am responsible for incidentals). They had to take my card for incidentals and said they would put a $50 hold on my account. The second day I was there they had put additional holds on my account. I went to talk to the front desk about it. I am a veteran of the Restaurant industry and I know that treating people badly never gets you what you want, so even when complaining I am always calm, polite, and patient. In discussing the issue with the front desk they were polite and attentive but ultimately treated me like I was stupid. Kept saying there was nothing they could do about canceling the hold, I would have to call my bank. In the end I realize that the issue resulted from my not being informed. At check in I signed a form, I asked to see a copy of that form, it clearly explained there would be a $125 hold placed for each day that I stayed. A little excessive if you ask me. But why couldn't the front desk just explain to me that that was hotel policy? I would have understood. Instead they acted like they had no idea, and claimed there was nothing they could do. I was there for two nights, and did not want to pay $30 for internet access, so I only signed on the one day. At check out I made it a point to mention that the only incidentals would be the one day of internet, and confirmed that the holds would be credited back to me less one day on internet. Then the front desk tells me the internet was complementary! WTF it would have been nice to know that when I checked in!!!!!!!! I don't know if breakfast came with the room, because I didn't ask and they certainly don't volunteer helpful information.",N

5854,"Short Version: I am very torn about this place because there are some great things, but then there are things that I think are pretty bad for how much it costs to stay here.  I booked three nights for a standard king.  Long Version:I'll start off with the good:1. The door man, and I cannot remember his name but you'll know him when you see him: he was suuuuper nice and remembered my name after the first time we met.  The valet guys and the guy who helped me take my luggage to my room were all nice and accommodating.2. I was afraid the location was a little too far north, but it was actually at an ideal spot.  I was able to run to the lake, walk to Millennium Park and there are stores everywhere.  It was really convenient for me and at night it was nice to just walk around the neighborhood.3. The bed was so comfortable and the tub was great for relaxing.  Part of the reason I chose the hotel was for the tub.Now for the bad:1. As someone else said, this place needs a ""facelift."" My room showed a lot of wear and tear, especially the shower.  I had to forcefully open and close the door every time because it had this weird rubber stopper on it that was falling off.2. You have to pay for wi-fi: $10/day.  I just think that's really steep, especially since other hotels that aren't as fancy give it to you for free.3. The bed doesn't have a fitted sheet.  I think that is so weird and you can just see the mattress from certain angles.  And flat sheets never stay put, so with one pull you're all of a sudden on the mattress.4. I paid $45 a night for parking and I found out later that they just park the car outside somewhere nearby.  I thought it would be indoors at the hotel.  If I had known that I would have just parked in a parking garage because the whole point was so that my car would be in a building and close by. I had to wait 30 minutes for my car (even though I called down for it 15 minutes before and they assured me it would be there in 10 minutes).  Also, my clock and radio surface is warped so I can barely read the time.None of these things are horrible, but for a place that touts itself as a luxury hotel and charges that much money for a night, I just don't think it's worth it at all.",Y

It is small (only 6 floors) in an office building.  So even on the top floor, you are not going to get that 'fabulous city and lake view' that other hotels boast.  But the location is great.  It's a few blocks from State St. shopping and still only a few blocks from the south end of the Mag Mile.  Lots of restaurants within a block each way.  It was a 20 min walk from AMC River East.  I asked why they picked this hotel vs. the Inter-Continental which was a few dollars cheaper and I was told it was because of all the great reviews and the free cocktail hour(s) and continental breakfast every day!  Each floor has their own breakfast so you don't need to go into the lobby with someone watching over you as to how much you take.  There is coffee, juices, mini-bagels, muffins, bread, etc and the cocktails are served on the 6th floor and is taken advantage of by probably most, if not all guests.  The lobby isn't your usual hotel lobby, they have a piano (that actually was playing cd's), contemporary furniture, and 2 counter-top table like ""front desks"".  There is a fitness center that I did not use but no pool so not a big draw for families although there were kids staying there.  The rooms were good sized with nice furniture.  Our tv didn't have a good picture as everyone looked white.  The bathroom was pretty big with a some-what large counter top and a shower with double shower heads!  Either the tub was too small for the double shower heads or the drain was clogged b/c by the time I got out of the shower the water was up to my ankles and took a long time to go down.  You can even bring Fido with you as they take in dogs.",N

3502,"I stayed here for a graduate school interview and was pleasantly surprised.  The place doesn't look so hot from far away (see pic), and the lobby on the first floor is tiny and dark.  But once you go up the elevator to the real lobby, things are much better.  It's really annoying that you have to change elevators to go up and down, but the location of this hotel is excellent.",N
3825,"A fantastic hotel top to bottom. I stayed here for a few nights when I was working a conference at the McCormick center. The room was sleek and modern without being cold. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was very nice. I wish my house looked like this. I got a free voucher for breakfast and took advantage of it every morning. The Dana Breakfast (eggs benedict with smoked salmon instead of ham) was amazing. The fruit smoothie was only okay, but good for breakfast on the go. I also ordered food from room service and it was very good. The door person always remembered my name (even days later) and was very friendly. Overall, I experienced great service. Finally, I took advantage of the spa for a hot stone massage. My therapist (Dana) was nice but not chatty and totally professional. It was a good massage, but not the best I've ever had. However, the price was lower than I am used to paying in SF, so I was satisfied. I really would recommend this place for anyone looking for something in this area of Chicago. It's chic, not expensive, and really nice.",N
4197,"The Hyatt is one of the largest hotels in Chicago, so there are tons of business people sporting badges on their fronts as they shuttle to and from their conventions and seminars. This is a very big and busy place, so one can easily get lost amongst the various public levels, escalators, and meeting rooms. The main lobby is enormous, featuring what was known as the largest bar in the world. The rooms are pleasant enough, but there is no excitement in the overall standard design at all.",N
5819,"I used priceline to get a room at this hotel. I was unsure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. The room was beautiful and clean. The staff were extremely friendly, welcoming and helpful. The retail price of $189-229/ night was a little steep, but I used priceline and did not have to pay that much. For what I paid, I was extremely happy.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone who needed to stay in the area.",Y
3417,"Small room, but it did the trick. Very clean. Ok service. Bar is a rip off. Location is great. Hotwire deal was for $89/night. I'd definitely stay here again for that price. Free wifi in the lobby only. They charge you to use it in-room.",N
5434,"Just getting back from Chicago! My second time, I love Chicago. Definitely, go on the Architecture Tour at Navy Pier, it's a 5-star!! The moment I saw the river i fell in love with Chicago :) The Tremont, it was mediocre. We got a good deal on the price, so we can't complain. Which may be why our king size bed was out-dated, not the luxury pillow top style. And no screens on the windows, which you had to open. But like I said, it's not to complain. Just simply my opinion, so you are informed, in the event these features mentioned are your deal breakers! The week we were there, was mid 60's, beautiful. The lobby very cozy and nice but.....HOT, wow. The front desk gal, not so friendly or enthusiastic but gets the job done and answers your questions accurately. One elevator, slow and old, sometime we jumped in the service elevator haha. TV not too many channels, ESPN2 didn't have sound, not a big deal for me the boyfriend begs to differ. House cleaning did an excellent job everyday, much appreciated, always nice to come back to a clean and straightened room after a long day. The air conditioning didn't work and the only option was to open unscreened windows. Why? you ask......it's that time of year and they switched over to the heating system. This was the only downer, everything else we could roll with. With that being said.....if the price is right we would stay their again. It's in a excellent location. Ditka's restaurant is in the hotel, John Hancock building a half a block away, Mag Mile half block, everything else is a cheap taxi ride away a $10-$12 taxi ride hear in Seattle only cost $6.",Y
889,"The marble walls and ceiling and the ornamental metal elevator grills of the Hotel Burnham will be impressive to the architect in your life, should you choose to take him along on your stay here. He'll appreciate this adaptive reuse of a historic landmark. It's even on the National Trust's Historic Hotels of America register! And spacious rooms ensure that you won't trip over one another. I even managed to get several hours of work done at the desk during my stay, which is not usually the case at cramped in-room desks. The location is excellent. In the short time I had between my arrival and when I had to be at work I managed to visit Millennium Park, take a picture with the bean and find a dress and shoes for a wedding I had to go to that weekend. Any frequent Kimpton Hotel guest will come to know their nightly wine hour. But the Hotel Burnham doesn't just offer red and white wine, they also offer Cracker Jack! Staff here goes the extra mile - spending nearly half an hour trying to hail cabs for customers stranded in the rain, always greeting guests with genuine smiles. The Hotel Burnham would be my top choice for a stay, be it work or pleasure, in Chicago.",N
5421,"For those of you planning a wedding and considering the Carleton, look no further!  The hotel itself is gorgeous, especially if you consider yourself to be an appreciator of the finer details and have a little vintage in your soul.  The hotel dates back to 1892 and showcases beautiful sitting rooms, stained glass, cast iron chandeliers, and the privacy of your own wing for the course of your wedding.  What's more, the food delivered for the price is incredible.  Our guests had a choice between NY Strip Steak (which I specified at medium rare and which was served at medium rare), Pan Seared Tilapia with kalamata olive and mediterranean vegetable risotto, and a Grilled Vegetable Plate with the most incredible au gratin potatoes.  Everyone raved about the food and I frequently heard, ""this is the best food I've ever eaten at a wedding.""  My husband and I both value the quality of food highly and were worried that our insistence on a sit down dinner would break the bank.  Not so here.  We chose a Sunday in March and the sales/catering manager Anne Parker was open to negotiation.Speaking of Anne Parker, I cannot say enough good things about her.  She is warm, kind, sincere, and very good at her job; in other words, she has all the qualities you want in a planner without hiring your own.  She arranged our tasting, linen selection, and even recommended an outstanding florist (who did the flowers at her own wedding).  She was always available and in touch, and the lines of communication remained open all the way up to the wedding.The Carleton is located in Oak Park, IL, a suburb that boasts the vibe of a quaint, small town and that comfort and boutique quality definitely translates to the hotel and its accommodations.  The restaurant in the lobby is excellent and breakfast at Poor Phil's (on the Marion Street side) is absolutely delicious!  The rooms are clean, well, kept and nicely adorned (albeit slightly pricey even with the group rate).  Want to watch the budget and offer rooms to guests?  The Motor Inn, despite the unfortunate title, has been completely rehabbed and the rooms are excellent and well priced.All in all, we had an amazing wedding--not just the day itself, but all the phases leading up to it--on account of the Carleton and its team of dedicated staff.  Once we had decided the venue, everything fell naturally into place.I highly recommend it!",Y
5607,"Stayed here during a conference that was held in the downstairs area and everything was really spot on and luxurious feeling. First, my room: very nice. I was on the 10th floor with a view of the crazy round beehive buildings that are just across the street (and a slice of the river if you wanted to crane your neck.) The room contained a lovely chaise lounge by the window, an extremely comfortable king bed, a fluffy robe, a delightful high-pressure shower head, etc. Overall my only complaint would be that the in-room internet is on the slow side. Next, the food, while tending towards the heavy, meat-laden side (not that meat-laden is a bad thing) is delicious. Meals served during the event, a meal I ate in the bar and in-room dining were all super. The sushi bar in the lobby is a nice touch and the burger I got delivered to my room was huge and amazing. Room service took about 45 minutes to arrive, so that is on the longer side, but it was worth it. The conference facilities downstairs were classy. Good lighting and a high level of service from the staff at all times. But one thing: not enough plugs! Location is central and close to local attractions, restaurants, the river walk, etc. No complaints there. Overall, an excellent place to be if you have to be in Chicago for a couple days.",N
3950,"I was a little iffy when my husband told me where we were staying on our surprise overnight stay in Chicago, however upon arriving I warmed up to the old girl as she greeted me with her memories.  Our room reminded me of my house growing up, old wooden doors that have been painted over a thousand times, really high ceilings,  water that takes a long time to warm up and a bed that felt like a hand down from your Aunt Mary.  Realizing that being this old it must be haunted, I searched the internet for confirmation, sure enough there were many reports of odd and unexplainable happenings.  My only two experiences with that were, a loud bang that came from within our room,  and while just dozing off to sleep the phone rang a half ring, being that no one knew we were there and it was midnight, it spooked me right into my husbands arms for the rest of the night, which is an added perk for the guys!  We both slept very well considering there was a massive thunderstorm that night (adding to the atmosphere).  I would like to have seen a few more amenities, trash can in the bathroom, a more comfy bed, new carpet etc....Just a little fresher.  But honestly I am ok with not so perfect surroundings for the incredible history and ambiance of a very graceful old girl.  Awesome location and price, staff was very friendly.",N
4416,"BEAUTIFUL!!! I was amazed by the lobby and all the history that went with it. I loved my stay there. All the staff were awesome. The only complaint is that there wasn't a flat screen TV, but that is a small complaint. The peacock theme in the newly-remodeled rooms is well-done and I loved it. I would definitely stay there again.",N
1674,"Stayed here for my sister's wedding.  The rooms were nice, and I hear we got quite a discount on them.  There was a computer issue that resulted in us being placed in an occupied room - and then a second time the desk receptionist misheard my name and put us in my aunt's room.  They were extremely apologetic and gave us a $40 voucher for the hotel restaurant as compensation.  It really wasn't that much trouble for us, though. If you join the Kimpton InTouch membership club (free), you get free wifi connectivity in your room as well as Raid the Minibar privileges, which allow you to get up to 2 items, for a total of $10, from the minibar for free. The hotel has a lot of great lounge areas, and the 312 restaurant is good as well (separate review for that).  They did a fantastic job with the cocktail hour and reception, and everything else was great. I've since lost a key to my car, and I've called them numerous times to check back if it's been found, and their lost and found office is fantastic.",N
202,"Rooms are OK, quite roomy, but that's expected for a hotel of suites. Every night was quite and the location is great.  Easy walk to lots of great restaurants.  The staff was great.  Front desk was one of the friendiest and happiest I have come across in awhile.  Even the Starbucks on site had two friendly Baristas.  Staff that kept up the meeting room was beyond excellent!  They saved the meeting because the food was bad.  Breakfast omelet day was OK, but everything else was poor at best.  Do yourself a favor and try the food before you have a meeting here.  You may want to go to Rosebud across the street for your meals.  That place is good!",N
1867,"This is just a review for the bar: Dark, plenty of seating, expensive but decadent cocktails, luxurious setting. This bar makes me want to wear stilettos and fancy jewelry, in a good way.",N
1869,So I stay here on business and must say for an upscale hotel charging over $300 a night it is pretty crappy. It is very loud at  timess (Some rooms near the L must drive people crazy).  I have had several rooms where the drains work very poorly.  Some thing never work in the hotel (Interent being one of them),N
5033,"I totally forgot to yelp about this place while I was staying there last Saturday. My friends and I stayed at the W hotel last Saturday while I was in town visiting my BF on tour for the night. This place was nice. I usually tend to stay at W hotels but never here in Chicago. It was clean, decor was nice and most of all very accomodating. We ended up with a great rate. We had a really nice view from our window. We booked two rooms to fit us all and they were able to put us on the same floor.  Although I stayed one and a half days here it was a great experience.",Y
749,"Is it time to roll out the red carpet just yet? Perhaps. I stayed here about a month ago with my boyfriend and I must say that I enjoyed myself. The rooms were big and very modern. I'm a stiffler for bathrooms and I absolutely must say that I'd probably eat off the floors of these bathrooms than the plate of some Chicago restaurants. The beds are big and comfortable with white linen and comforters. I, personally, prefer sheets with a little more pizzaz but it's a subliminal thing: white equates with cleanliness. So, I get what they were going for. I was very pleased with the cleaning services as well. I requested my sheets get changed at the end of the night -- because, of course, the beau and I dirtied em up acting like 12 years olds, jumping around like fools -- and it happened rather quickly. The cleaning lady even engaged in a nice conversation with me as she cleaned. Very pleasant. I thought we had a great view and I was quite sad we had to leave and venture out into the real world. I'd love to have known more about the extra amenities of the hotel, such as the gym. And, it'd be awesome if they could toss a couple of iPod radio docks in there for those who just want to enjoy the view and listen to some tunes. Oh, and we didn't enjoy that you had to pay for wi-fi. Seriously? All-in-all please do check the place out. Loved it.",N
755,"I really do like the Westin more than other business class hotels. The heavenly beds are fantastic, but they really need to figure out the heavenly shower thing. It's not that heavenly or different from other hotels. This hotel in particular was great! It has a prime location on Michegan Avenue, next to the John Hancock building. The only thing that I might complain about was the noise from the elevators (try to get a room away from them), but I won't dwell on that, because the staff was fantastic. They were very helpful and supportive during a very bizarre incident that involved my husband losing his mobile phone on the street and the attempted extortion from the crackheads that found it. The staff performed outstandingly, and, for that reason, I would stay here again.",N
4027,"If I could give 3.5 stars, I would. Since I'm between 3 and 4 and can't really say I'm a fan, 3 it is. For the price, the hotel and our room were surprisingly good. No free wifi but otherwise the amenities were satisfactory. Apparently there was a renovation recently - the room was clean and comfortably modern. Checking in and out was relatively smooth. There were two main things that bothered me. First, the chaotic nature of the hotel lobby. It was a busy weekend (air and water show) and I felt like they weren't quite prepared for it. It was raining the first morning, and it took about 30 minutes to get a taxi through the teeming mass of hydrophobic hotel goers. There wasn't much organization and the hotel didn't seem to have any pull to get a good supply of cabs. Second, the concierge desk was overall pretty useless and almost, well, snotty. Also, it costs $20 to rent an umbrella. It's refundable, but you can't put it on your bill and you can't use a card. It's $20 cash or kick rocks. The location is good but I thought the hotels a bit further north gave a better starting point to get around the city.",N
1486,"This was another deal snagged by boyfriend on Priceline.  The hotel was very centrally located and everyone working there was extremely nice.  We had a room perfectly suited for 4.  Two of us got the closed-off bedroom and the other two got the (comfy) sofa bed.  The flat screen tvs were a great addition to our room.  Although the room itself wasn't too spacious, it was perfectly fine for our 3 night stay.",N
3613,"The Drake Hotel is like a hug from your grandmother, comforting and familiar, a little worn-in and cozy. I loved my big king bed - and my room was larger than my apartment in Brooklyn. So nice! The towels were kinda shitty, the shower curtain was worn, the wallpaper was a bit peely in the bathroom, but it was clean. If they could fix that, and get better bath products, it'd get 5 stars.",N
3012,"This is the standard against which I compare all the other Starwood hotels I stay at. I have been coming to this hotel since 2005, and have only high praise for the entire staff and the complete guest experience here. Some of the highlights: The valets that assist you on arrival (and greet you by name after the first time they hear it), and come find you when your car service arrives outside. Front Desk staff with exceptionally welcoming attitude, demeanor, and helpfulness. +1 for being able and willing to accommodate and change my rooms when I found loud air conditioners or neighbours with barking dogs upon arrival. +1 again for being able and willing to work with me when I needed to cut short my stay due to a hurricane bearing down on my home. A concierge desk that I can happily blame for helping me put on about 10 pounds due to extraordinary restaurants recommended to me during my stays. Most impressive was their willingness to research matters that they didn't know off the top of their heads, and get back to me shortly thereafter. Whatever/Whenever staff that actually respond to orders submitted via the iPhone app (other W Hotels please take note!). I usually ""make a green choice"", and whenever I've needed things in my room restocked, W/W are very much on top of their game. Great bartenders in the downstairs lounge. I usually only expect my local bar to know what to pour me when I walk in, but after two days, the Living Room had my orders at a glance. Good bar nibbles as well as proper meals on the premises. The high-floor views are unparalleled, but go to Whiskey Sky for the fireworks shows. I know part of it is SPG recognition (some years I'm Gold, some years I'm Plat), but all in all it seems to be the way they do business, and very few other hotels compare.  I've strayed to other hotels in Chicago just to see what's out there, which has only served to remind me to come back ""home"" to the W Lakeshore.",N
5805,"I can't see how anyone would have anything good to say about the place. I almost stayed here before I moved from Dallas but chose to sleep in my rental car by the lake instead. The rooms were disgusting! The carpet was laid unevenly, the bed felt like a piece of plywood, there were roaches galore despite the powdered insecticide everywhere, the bathroom was a complete mess, and every floor had a distinct and awful smell. I think you are better off sleeping in a park.",N
1488,"I loved this hotel.  Very spacious, comfortable, and clean.  We were lucky to be given a top floor room with great views of downtown and michigan avenue.  I especially appreciated the seperation of the living area from the bedroom with french doors.  Each area also has a door to the bathroom and the living area has a flat screen tv and a wet bar.  I was told all rooms at the Omni have suites this.  Unfortunately, we were there for a short weekend, two nights.  We ordered room service late night and it was good food.  The lobby is on the third floor and you have to take two seperate elevators to get to top floors from the ground floor.",N
4918,Best Hotel ever !!! Stayed with my sister and two young children and it was wonderful,Y
3130,"Like all W Hotels this place is very trendy and cutting-edge and somehow feels like a lounge/club masquerading as a hotel. In contrast to the downstairs concierge/bar/restaurant area the guest rooms and hallways are all very dimly lit and decorated in shades of black, grey and dark pink. Everything is modern, hip and edgy, including the staff. Although after working in a W Hotel on the west coast myself I can definitely say that the employees here were  not as friendly or helpful as those in the other Ws I've been in. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my stay here and the location simply cannot be beat -- very central and the only hotel in Chicago that is actually right on Lake Shore Drive. Don't plan on a weekend stay unless you are prepared for the social scene which can include loud late nights full of drunk people wandering around the lobby who are just as likely not to be hotel guests.",N
5613,"My boyfriend and I treated ourselves to a mini-weekend getaway here this past Valentines Day weekend we left feeling relaxed and restored. I first found myself at the Westin River North in May of 2008 because my sister set up a block of rooms here for her wedding. We stayed in the bridal suite and it was pretty s-w-a-n-k-y. The view of the river was gorgeous and a wonderful thing to wake up to on her wedding day. Anyhow, I digress. Back to my stay this past weekend. We checked in on Saturday afternoon and it was quick and simple, we were up in our suite on the Executive Floor within 5 minutes, now that's efficient! Our suite had an iMac, a giant king sized bed and a nice view of Marina City. We decided to really indulge and order room service (we had dinner reservations at a nearby steakhouse). After calling and placing our order, the food arrived in the exact amount of time they told us it would arrive...to the minute. Impressive. And then, 15 minutes into eating room service called us to check up on us and inquire if everything arrived as we had ordered it. The checkout here is quick too, they have an Express Checkout option where they slip your bill under your door and you can enclose your keycards into the same envelope and drop it in a box at the lobby. No fuss checkout is always a plus isn't it? You obviously have to pay for any charges not on the bill -- but since you sign all your purchases (food or services) you are aware of it in advance. In. Out. And relaxed, thank you Westin River North....",N
532,"The least pleasant aspect of the hotel was trying to relax in the whirlpool tub while there were young children in it. The rules sign says children under 14 are not permitted but both times we tried to visit it there were children. The first time a mom brought 4 young children in who were splashing around and knocking into me and my boyfriend. I mentioned to her that children weren't allowed but she didn't do anything. I told the front desk as we were leaving that day. The next time I noticed it before we got in, so I called from a hotel phone to the front desk to let them know. They said they would take care of it, but I did not see a hotel representative during the next hour or so we were there, and again, children were in the whirlpool. I feel that the staff of the hotel should regularly monitor and enforce this rule, since the parents seem unwilling to follow it on their own. We tend to really enjoy the pool/hottub at hotels we visit, so I'm not sure I'd come here again... The free breakfast was a little similar but reasonably good each day, especially the make-your-own fresh waffles. Wifi worked well, staff was friendly and responsive (except for the whirlpool issue). When it was raining they let us borrow a couple of umbrellas. Only a block from the Grand stop on the red line.",N
4182,"I can't say any negative about this hotel. See the reasons why; 1. Location is great. You are on Wacker Road and a block on Magnificent Mile. 2. There's a Corner Bakery close to the hotel for breakfast (1 block). 3. A minute walk to major bus stops. 4. There's BIG BAR!!! (see my other review). 5. Room deco is minimal - no fancy stuff but it's very clean. 6. Millenium Park (a block), The Loop (about 3 blocks), and shopping area is a block. 7. There's a 24 hour deli which is a plus. Take note; 1. At first, I was disappointed because of the location. I wanted it to be noisy, crowded and a touristy area - maybe close to small restaurants etc. (Stay at The Loop Area or Magnificent Mile area if you prefer it that way). But it was a good decision after all. Wacker Road is a major road and it's very convenient when you are a tourist (bus stops). There's a BIG BAR open at night in the hotel and it's always crowded. I mean crowded until 2am everyday even on weekdays! 2. No free breakfast and internet. Complimentary coffee and tea though. 3. Employees are great and helpful. 4. Hotel lobby is not boutique style - it's actually convention/airport like atmosphere. Always crowded and noisy (lobby only) - the way I like. 5. Ok, just one thing... if people are talking on the hallway, it echoes to your room - I think it's an acoustical thing. It happens when we arrived there at about 10am. We usually go out at 10am so no problem at all. At night, nice and quiet. Yes, I recommend this place.",N
5194,"Great location on the river , perfct view of the river and the city. Bed (MEGA KING ) was one of the best I have sleeped on. If you want to stay downtown and have a great jump off point to the rest of the city ... this is it. Charles the door man was one of the best, he will provide you with a feeling that you are special and appreciated as a customer. Joe and Hope from Alaska",Y
184,"This is a nice hotel in a good location.  If you are going to Chicago to specifically visit the American Girl Doll this hotel is ideal.  It is about two blocks away from the  store and the rooms at this hotel are suites so they're perfect for families  That wasn't the case for us, but I think a point worth mentioning.   I liked that we were in close walking distance to everything on Michigan Avenue but yet not right on that street. The staff was friendly. The best part about this hotel was the price.  We booked online at Priceline and paid $95 for the room.  Can't beat that!  They get you on the parking, $55 for 24 hours with in and out privileges but let's face it, who is driving their own car around when they are visiting downtown Chicago?   In the grand scheme I guess that is the rate you are going to pay for overnight hotel parking in a major metropolitan city so there really isn't an alternative if you have a car.   I would definitely stay at this hotel again but next time I come to Chicago I want to take the MegaBus.  By no means am I a cheap person but  I absolutely hate paying high prices for parking.  Anything over $20 a day sends me into a tizzy.   If I could I would get rid of my car altogether but the city I live in does not have infrastructure to be car free :(  OK, no more ranting!",N
139,"A decent location that I managed to book for a cheap price (~$110 per night).  We checked in early, which the concierge was ok with it.  We had some glitches with getting our room (from broken door to non-functional heating), but the staff was professional about it that we ended up in a room on the 15th floor with 2 king-sized beds (when we started with a 3rd floor room with 2 queen-sized beds). The hotel is under some renovation, so there were plastic sheets on the ground of every floor.  It wasn't a big deal to me. Overall, for the price and the location, I was quite satisfied with the quality of the room and the staff.  Would definitely consider this hotel again when I visit Chicago next.",N
692,"This is really a very solid property just off the Mag Mile, which means things are quieter.  In fact, I barely heard a sound in my room, and turns out there was a young family in the room next to me with noisy kids (according to them).  Property couldn't be more convenient to many dining choices in Streeterville, River North, and Mag Mile.  If looking for a quick sandwich, Timothy O'Toole's is a below-street sports bar with good burgers and salads, albeit noisy.  Ask the hotel concierge for a 20% coupon.  Multiple convenient Zipcar locations nearby as well. My room was smallish, but very clean and comfortable.  HVAC was quiet and easy to set.  Yelp check in special at Viand next door (enter through hotel lobby) was very nice, and I recommend this place in the evenings for a quiet drink in a nice space.  I also recommend the breakfast buffet in the am next door at Viand.  Great waitstaff and good food, clearly there were a lot of regulars and the employees loved their jobs. Only complaint about the Marriott is that at check out time the wait for an available elevator may take a while.  The hotel is very popular, and for good reason.  Very reasonable prices and a great location make this a very good choice.",N
130,"I really can't say enough good things about this hotel.  The entire place is recently rehabbed back to it's 1920's splendor and it shows.  The lobby, elevators, hallways are ""old hotel small"" but that I think adds to it's charm.  The rooms decor is top notch - Granted we were in one of their suites. Our room was loaded with antiques in great condition.  The bathrooms are very nice - hand-laid tiles, plenty of room.   The staff was very attentive, very responsive to inquiries and really were what you'd expect from a old school hotel like this. The location is perfect - a short block from Hancock and Water Tower Place, TONS of shops within easy walking distance (if that's your bag) and many top-notch restaurants also within 3 blocks in every direction. (not to mention a pretty good Itallian spot right in the hotel). This is definitely a hotel from an era long gone - but still at the top of it's game. *The price I listed as ""Moderate"" but keep in mind that that is in comparison to the other hotel options in the area.*  For the Gold Coast, it is a great price.",N
3794,"*This review is for the downstairs bar at the Dana Hotel A friend suggested we head to the Dana Hotel for drinks after dinner.  The bar area was small but we were able to snag a seat by window. This isn't a place I would hang out normally but I did like it because: 1) It had great people watching from some dude that looked like a professional wrestler with his ultra-blonde girlfriend to cute foreign guys (several were French), to some guy that got out of a Bentley convertible.  Also, there were several drop dead gorgeous black women working here. 2) The drinks were STRONG. Like scrunch up your face and make a noise strong. If you're gonna pay $10+ for a drink in my book, it better be strong. Sangria was tasty. 3) I dug the décor. We checked out the upstairs/hotel check-in area. It was cool-swanky. After this experience I wouldn't mind trying out their upstairs bar, Vertigo, for a special night out.",N
1162,"Downtown, free parking, indoor pool, fitness center, and free WiFi....for less than $90 on Valentine's Day!  Looks like it doesn't get any better than that...right?  On paper this place looks great but it didn't rank very high IMHO...I would have given it 1 star but the free parking was worth a star. Checking in, I got the first glimpse of their customer service...or lack there of.  We got a standard king, it was a little smaller than I expected...but not so small that I felt claustrophobic.  The Internet access was a piece of cake to login to.  The noise on the street wasn't too obnoxious from the third floor.  However, the elevators were ridiculously slow...I was better off taking the stairs. The icing on the cake in our hotel experience...finding there was NO hot water in the morning!  My hubby had a big meeting early that day and was less than thrilled to discover this fact.  When I called the front desk, I was told maintenance wouldn't be available for another 2 hours.  Nothing like a cold shower to wake you up. While the hubby was at his meeting, I took full advantage of the fitness center.  It was pretty lame, only 4 pieces of equipment: treadmill, elliptical, stationary bike and multipurpose weight machine in a tiny little room.  Lucky for me I was the only one there and had the place to myself.  Not only was the fitness center small but it was HOT, there was no air circulation, venting, fan or window I could open.  It was a little hot box.  Plus, the water jug they had in there was empty. I checked back on the status of the hot water issue before heading back up to the room and the front desk said that maintenance didn't find anything wrong with the water and they were sorry for the misunderstanding.  I'm pretty sure the hubby didn't misunderstand that he had to take an ice bath of a shower earlier that morning. One star for free parking and one for free wifi & location...never going back, Chicago has a ton of other hotel's.",N
3926,"I loved the historic feel and ambiance of this hotel. Crickety old elevators and solid wood furniture in the room. You don't see that much anymore, good solid wood craftsmanship. I got the hotel for a really good price. The room was clean and stayed cool even with a real real old air conditioner. I think my only complaint is that the hot water took about ten minutes to get hot enough for a shower. I don't know so many people are knocking this hotel. I loved the location and all the staff were very friendly and my room was clean. Yeah its a little outdated but I think that is the charm of the hotel. I would definitely stay here again. I loved it.",N
4683,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend vacation in March. It was $80 bucks a night, which we thought was a great deal. The negative reviewers here need to suck it up. The rooms are small, but big enough for me to work at a desk while my girlfriend watches TV, and big enough for us to dance around the room after consuming several bottles of wine. No coffee machine in the room? Waah, waah, you actually have to WALK TO AN ELEVATOR for free coffee. We loved the Hotel Felix and will be staying there whenever we visit. Here are things we liked:  -The hotel seems to have a real commitment to sustainability  -The bed is extremely comfortable  -The black-out curtain is AMAZING  -The entire hotel has a consistent and appealing visual style  -Free Wifi  -Friendly staff  -Good location, close to the Red line and many buses Things that weren't so good:  -The fitness center is small and lacking some equipment  -The bathroom sink is really hard to use",N
4338,"The Palmer House is a worthy destination if only to spend time in it's magnificent lobby, which resembles more than anything, the most opulent and bizarre of Masonic Lodge interiors. Sadly, the current management of the hotel leans totally on it's great historic beauty; it in fact exploits it. What should by all rights be a ""luxury hotel"" (which one expects when reading about it's historic beauty), fails miserably; the experience can be characterized by mediocre service and a noticeable lack of amenities; it is a wasted treasure, misunderstood and poorly managed by it's current overseers. On a specific note, we were very irritated by the terribly inconvenient internet situation, they had NO wireless and charged $14.95/day for a direct cable connection at a desk in your room - this means you are chained to the desk for all internet activities. This was a real inconvenience. (but do see my photo of my handsome husband, Jon, chained to the desk by a short DSL cable!). Having said all this, the location (in the heart of downtown) is great - very convenient to public transit and taxis, centrally located with easy access to museums and many interesting neighborhoods and with several excellent restaurants nearby. And honestly, the huge, spectacular, historic lobby, in all it's splendor, makes it all worth it. The rooms are clean and acceptably appointed, if not inspired. The price is reasonable and it's a far more interesting place to stay than the cookie cutter hotels one tries to avoid. In a nutshell you will be sufficiently comfortable and you will get your moneys worth from the sheer character of the place.",N
3681,"meh. it's a landmark, but it's an old, small landmark. great view, but tiny digs. i've stayed at the drake twice for business and the room has been teensy each time. room service food was pretty mediocre and the pay-per-view didn't work (but i wanna watch step up 2!). great location, that's for sure. i needed to buy a nice top to wear to a bachelorette party one hour before it started, and all it took was a quick jaunt across the street to j.crew. problem solved in under 30 minutes. what really knocks this place down into two-stardom is the cab line. it took an hour to get a cab in the morning! someone at the drake needs to make friends with some cabbies, so they're not tempted to pick up only from the westin around the corner.",N
3351,"This is a great location when it comes to accessing Grant and Millennium parks or the Museum Campus. This is why you stay at the Essex Inn. It's several blocks to the L unless you want to take the bus or taxi. They offer a complimentary limited service shuttle to Navy Pier, Magnificent Mile and the Museum Campus throughout the day. The exterior is a steel and glass modern structure with a huge neon sign and stands out a bit (easy to find) from the other stone and brick buildings along Michigan Ave. The lobby has a modern feel, but the carpet is a tropical dated thing of the past. It just doesn't match the lobby furnishings, the new hotel restaurant (Tribute) and the renovated guest rooms. They have nice amenities like the 4th floor rooftop deck, indoor pool and gym. The deck's garden is gorgeous with nice flowering beds and small trees for shade. It overlooks Michigan Ave and has nice views of skyscrapers in both directions. It's great if you just want to listen to the bands from Grant Park during Lollapalooza. The standard king room is decent size with modern decor. The hotel and rooms are clean overall. The housekeeping staff are very accommodating and pleasant. The front desk staff are nice and customer focused - they took care of us in recommending restaurants and addressing room needs. (especially Ryan and Reggie at the front desk). It's not a luxury or budget hotel, but it is comfortable, offers the basics, great room prices and great access to the parks. During Lollapalooza, they bring in additional security and take additional measures to make sure that guests are comfortable, safe and enjoy a pleasant stay. It is a perfect location for Lolla and isn't a party hotel.",N
3229,"My first hotel review? I think? Just remember when checking in that the entrance is not on Michigan, but on East Wacker. When you walk in, it kinda has that rock star quality to it, a snazzy bar, cool seating area and young staff. I am cool with that, I am hip with it. ;-0 The staff actually were very helpful, patient, and eager to answer your questions...so that was a plus. Also a plus was that they kept part of that beautiful lobby/elevator area not as renovated, which looked great. The rooms were ok, clean, newly renovated (most of them), so the decor was nice. Be ready for the reminders that you are in a Hard Rock hotel, so eg guitar embroidered on pillowcase, posters of artists around the room, and such. In our bathroom, David Bowie watched me brush my teeth, so that was, well, different. Two cool factors, and even then, other than location, the hotel was just ok: every floor represents a different artist and has a piece of their memorabilia.  That provided a little entertainment for us. (We were on the Cheap Trick floor, if you ask the front desk they have a whole list.) Also, they lend out guitars (electric and acoustic) for free, first come first serve, so you can have a little jam session in your room. Otherwise, I am just glad they kept their gimmicky stuff in the store so we could enjoy our stay.",N
3683,"We stayed here recently for our annual Christmas shopping trip. Since we primarily shop Michigan Ave we alway stay on the Mag Mile. This was our first stay at the Drake and we've stayed at them all with the exception of the Marriott on Michigan Ave.. The Drake was nicely decorated for the holiday and the staff is VERY attentive and professional. We arrived WAY early but our room was ready. We had a King size bed in a room that was about 450 sq. feet. Although the Drake is a older hotel it is VERY clean and well appointed. While it is old it feels very charming not run down like some. The room was warm and very quiet with high ceilings. The bed comfortable although a little lumpy with pancake thin pillows. Hallways are very wide and bright.  Elevators are fast and some have little benches in them to sit down (cute!). I'm not sure what others are talking about for 'slow elevators'. We saw the band that night in the Palm Court. A bit crowed but nice. TINY dance floor for a swing band. We arrived 30 minutes to the band starting and told we would have to wait about 45 minutes for a table. The host took my cell phone number and would call me when the table was ready. 10 minutes later we were at our table! Drinks are expensive but not potent. Nice hotel, great staff. Older but a very clean, stately hotel. The only draw back was there is no free Wifi and this is a big sticking point for me. In this day and age where you can get free WIFI just about every place you should really get it at a hotel where you're paying a premium to stay. This is VERY important and might be a deal breaker for me in the future.",N
830,"BEST LOCATION YOUR MONEY COULD GET! We checked into the Silversmith on Yelp! and found us an upgrade to a suite. We were there at 4pm, and check-in time was 3, so that's why I think there were still suites available for upgrades.  The room itself was older, but it did not have that smell of an older room. You can tell they take good care of their rooms. The staff were all friendly, and are eager to help us out with the easiest bus routes to certain places. I think I read reaviews on it could potentially be a bit noisy because the hotel is situated right next to the train line, so we requested a room away from the streets and got our peace that way. I could barely hear passing trains when I wake up in the morning. Again, I cannot rave enough on their location. It was our first time in Chicago, so of course we wanted to go everywhere, and this hotel was really smacked dabbed in the middle. It took minutes to walk to the bus stops that would take us anywhere south or north of downtown. I'm so happy we chose the Silversmith. p.s. free wifi and an in-room fridge definitely earn this hotel another half a star. This would be a 5-star review if they have a microwave in the room to heat up my delicious Chicago food leftovers.",N
5028,Stayed here MANY years ago after a friend recommended it......loved the bar area!  Atmosphere was awesome......loved the whole feel of this hotel!,Y
3258,"I think it's a great place... I stayed there for a long weekend and had a penthouse suite ... fantastic views, oversized marble bathrooms, large bedroom, huge living room with a very cool sitting area, large plasma TV, they even had an 8 seat conference room with an all glass table... it was very cool.. one of my favorite was a bowl of M&M's in the living room that was very neat looking and was getting re-filled by staff on daily basis.. .needless to say that weekend my calories intake was astronomical",N
2900,"I've only stayed here once so far, but I'm not sure I would do it again.  First I'll go with the positives. - As has been mentioned, it's got a nice view.  I'm usually in my room for sleeping, so the view doesn't matter all that much to me. - Pretty good location.  I got in late (O'Hare lost my luggage, who would've thought), and I was pleased to find a restaurant (PJ Clarke's) and grocery store (Dominick's) within close walking distance.  Dominick's is open until 1am which helped out a lot. - Concierge is helpful.  She pointed me in the direction of the places found above. Now on to the negatives... - Room feels old.  The linens reminded me of my grandparents linens from the 70s.  The bathroom was antiquated with old fixtures, decent shower. - Dirt in my bath tub.  Not sure why and it washed out fine, but seriously. - Ethernet cable didn't work.  I called to put in a request to fix it, went to get take-out and to the grocery store.  Got back about an hour later and no one had come by to fix it.  Called again and they sent someone up shortly, but you shouldn't have to call again. - O'Hare lost my luggage, I notified the bell man that they would be delivering my luggage over night.  He assured me they would leave me a message if it came letting me know it was in.  Wake up the next morning with no message, assume it has not been delivered.  Check on the airlines website and it says it was delivered overnight.  Sure enough, went downstairs and it was there. Overall just wasn't the greatest experience.  Cheaper than the Westin, but I prefer the Westin River North to the Sheraton.",N
416,This was the perfect hotel for someone who wants to be fairly close the action but cannot spend a fortune. I thought the rooms were nice and the employees were very friendly and helpful. The layout of my room was weird (the closet door opened right against the bathroom door) and the elevators were down a lot but overall it was a good experience.You are in Chicago so you won't much time here anyyway.  Be sure to ask the concierge about good places to eat they have coupons for many places. Also you have to eat breakfast at Eggsperience. It was eggcelent!,N
1989,"Love this place. The interior is gorgeoussss. Everything is shiny, textures everywhere, colors and mirrors... very modern yet comfortable. Okay, now on to the ramblings. Excuse the unorganized paragraph(s) below. Our room was amazing! The second you enter, there's the smell of freshly laid out wood floors... which to me, smells great!  We got a corner room facing Millennium Park and the room itself was surrounded with floor-to-ceiling windows. LOVE IT! We got our own balcony which wrapped around the room (unfortunately, this didn't get much use due to the cold weather.) Awesome King Bed with pillows I wanted to steal. The shower has a rain fall shower head and also a wand that sprays water which after using once, I couldn't figure out how to turn on again. There's a huge bathtub to relax in. Cool little corner toilet which you can close off. And all this is WHITE WHITE WHITE - in other words.. CLEAN! Heater kept us warm. Large flat screen TV if that's important to ya. Free Wi-Fi. Free coffee/tea station in the room. Ipod/radio deck. Wine glasses, mugs, cups, AND to-go cups. bottle opener with a cork screw attached to it. Mini-bar/fridge. What else? 1 robe (why one?), ironing board, laptop sized safe.. plenty of conveniently placed plugs/outlets to charge phones and cameras. Literally like a block or so away from beautiful Millennium park. Few blocks from the trains. There's a CVS next door. Fillini downstairs is beautiful. We had two free drinks voucher so stopped by and had fancy cocktails before heading out. There are two floors dedicated to a pool area, game room (which consists of a pool table and cards table), a community room with a fireplace, food area with microwaves, gym with brand new equipment (lots of it!), basketball court, sauna & steam room, outdoor garden and running track. What doesn't this hotel have, right? If we weren't limited on time, I would've liked to actually use all the amenities. Best of all... they allow check out time as late as 6pm!! (depends on availability)... 6pm! That's practically a whole 'nother day/night. We didn't have to rush out of the hotel early with no where to go and luggages in tow. Although, I felt kinda bad because the house cleaner wanted to finish our room so she could leave for the day... I would definitely recommend this hotel. Location is away from the noise and people, but still close enough to enjoy what Chicago has to offer.",N
4842,"As we arrived to the hotel's proximity on Wacker, we could hear its name being shouted before we saw it. The base of the hotel was covered in groups of picketers with angry signs beating pots and pans. Once we made our way through the angry crowd, we found the lobby to be very impressive and immense. It took us a few minutes before we could locate the actual front desk that was up the escalator and on the second floor. Our room was on the Regency Level on the 34th floor with amazing views of the lake, Chicago River and the downtown skyline. The bed was very comfortable and the room was of a modern style. It was a nice looking room; however, it was pretty dusty. In the bathroom, the water pressure was so weak that it was a let down since they had such a nice looking shower. Another upsetting factor was that you could still hear the angry crowd from the street below banging their pans and shouting at all hours of the day from the 34th floor! It was horrible. The first night that we were there, we had a lady use a key card and enter our room (even with our privacy sign on the door) a bit after 10pm! We were in bed and were very shocked to find a person opening our room's door. We immediately called the front desk who then transferred me to security. About 20 or so minutes later, security arrived at our room to ""interrogate"" the lock. He said it was most likely a ""benign"" situation and probably housekeeping (after 10pm!?!). He fiddled with the lock and then disappeared without a final explanation to me and my husband. Needless to say, we didn't sleep well that night. With every noise we heard, we thought someone was coming in our room again. With us being unsure of housekeeping, or who ever was coming in our room, we decided to not have our room serviced during our stay. From the sound of it, they wouldn't have serviced it anyways. We spoke with another family in the building and they had been there three days waiting for someone to service their room. They were starting to make bets on whether or not their room would be clean each time they went back into their room. Basic cleanliness is a necessity for any hotel--it doesn't matter how large and how many rooms you have. In result of the picketers, more than half of the hotel restaurants were not in working order and were closed. In addition, there was no room service. We specifically chose a Hyatt hotel in the Chicago area so we would have restaurants close by since this was our first time to the city. This was a let down after flying from the West Coast. We decided to eat at the breakfast buffet on our second day and I would not recommend it. For the two of us, it cost $40 some dollars and the food was less than impressive. I only ate a third of a Denver omelet (the eggs were runny and the vegetables were crunchy), a piece of cantaloupe and some yogurt. Should have left the hotel for some real food for a fraction of the price! The proximity to sightseeing things and the ability to get a cab in a hurry is great. Just remember, you will have to walk through picketers to get in or out of the cars. All in all, we will not be returning nor will we recommend this hotel to anyone--family, friend or stranger. I actually joined yelp to share this story because I know how important reviews are and people should know this hotel is having some major issues. Don't let this hotel ruin your Chicago getaway!",Y
232,"Really liked the pineapple stools at the bar in the lobby and the saltwater taffy. Beautiful decor, but the nautical theme didn't fit the location. Parking garage is conveniently next door. Smoking. Can smell it in the hallway. Would I go back? No. 1. Booked a king, but got a queen 2. Price of parking was absurd. 3. Size of room is pretty outrageous, expected in NY, but not Chicago. The windows looked out into the back of the building next door. 4. Overpriced 5. Lobby doesn't offer coffee.",N
4692,"Hotel is very clean, staff extreamly nice..  downside paying 40 bucks a night for parking, and room is just a bed and shower absolutely no space.  The shampoo, conditioner, and soap is from the store around the corner called H20, very nice stuff.  We asked for a better view and they were more than willing to upgrade us for free.  So overall very pleased. The bed was very cozy, didnt hurt my back as most hotels.",N
2651,"I booked The James Hotel through Expedia for a great deal. It really did live up to all the reviews. This was our first visit to Chicago so I wasn't really sure what to expect. Location: This hotel is close to so much. We were a few blocks from the train that we used to go to Wrigley & the airport. We were able to walk to Navy Pier, Millennium Park, Grant Park, and the beaches. There were shops, and restaurant galore all around us. It was raining the one day, so the complimentary car service took us to our brunch destination. That was very nice and so much better than a cab ride. Also, there is a Trader Joe's across the street where you can get some wine & beer,water, and snacks, rather than using the very expensive mini bar in your room. Staff: The concierges, doormen, front staff, and housekeeping were all extremely nice, helpful, and professional. We were greeted at our arrival by wishing us a Happy Anniversary. The evening of celebrating our anniversary they even had complimentary desert waiting for us in our room! It was something small but so very thoughtful and made us happy. The Rooms: We spent a good portion of time in our room for some pre-dinner drinks and TV watching in the morning. We never felt confined. We just had the basic King Room. The room is spacious and the beds are super comfortable. Even the bathroom had plenty of room to get ready and spread all my stuff out. The rooms are cleaned twice a day(turn down service at night, with a treat). It was so nice to come back after a night out, and have the room clean again. We also went to the gym daily, which was very clean and more than enough machines. Fresh water, towels, and even oranges were available for your workout. My husband and I loved Chicago and had one of our best vacations. It definitely started with The James and would return if and when we make it back to Chi Town.",N
5782,"Boo Marriott. You may have comfy beds but hospitality could be SOOO much better. I arrive around 9PM on Wednesday and head to the front desk. The lady asks me how my day was. I reply well, it's been trying. I was stuck for over 4 hours in Long Beach Airport because of the wonderful Chicago weather. Being this is my first time to Chicago, not really enjoying it too much.  To top it off the organizer neglected to tell me that there were so many stops on El train from Ohare to here, so it was close to another hour of traveling. I'm tired and hungry, which causes me to start to get headache. Marriott asks for my name, so I can check in.  She then tells me...""Oh, you're not supposed to check in until tomorrow."" I'm thinking ""WTF, do you not see me here?""  Then proceeds to tell me there's no space available. She doesn't offer to help me find a new place.  Mind you this is my first time in Chicago and I have no idea where to stay. Luckily, my organizer just steps in from dinner. I tell her what's up and she's gives the front desk a piece of her mind. By chance, one of the other conference attendees also got stuck and couldn't fly in to Chicago so I was going to take her room since she wouldn't be able to check in.  Mind you my conference organizer is the one figuring this out NOT Marriott. Marriott doesn't offer to find me any alternative housing, if that room wasn't free due to circumstances, I have no idea where I would have been sleeping. BOO!!!!! I finally get to my room at 10PM, I have no energy to go exploring and I have a full on headache now but know that I have to eat or I'm going to feel like sh!t. Sadly, my only real option now is room service. (Mind you I never order room service this was my first time). Order their chicken portobello pasta but then get a call back later that they're out of portobello. *sigh* I've lost all energy to argue and just settle for plain mushroom.  Of course it's still priced a ridiculous amount of money, I should have gotten it cheaper. I don't blame the kitchen staff. He was nice man.  He throws in bottle water for free and does apologize and is sincerely sorry.  Can't blame him. I blame MARRIOTT. BTW their internet should be for free. Waaay too expensive. Should have thrown some perks in for all the crap I had to deal with.",N
4923,"I had a wonderful time here.  This is exactly how traditional afternoon tea should be.  The attention to detail was superb, the tea, the fine china, the lovely sweets and clotted cream...everything was top notch.  The harpist was elegant with a soothing repertoire.  She was an amazing musician.  In a city full of slick lounges, the old world charm at the Drake is a special treat.If you are a local, and not staying at the hotel, I would highly recommend having the valet park your car.  It is reasonably priced.  Besides, who wants to deal with parking blocks away when all you want to do is relax and enjoy your afternoon tea?My only critique is that the air seemed a bit stuffy, perhaps air circulation is not the greatest in the hotel?  Old HVAC?Overall, I highly recommend it.",Y

443,"So a month later, the issue with my sister's missing ipod touch was finally resolved.  It took more phone calls and emails over the ensuing weeks before anyone finally contacted me, which I still find annoying, but the manager claims that they did look into the issue and speak with the housekeeper, who of course denied everything.  Whatever.  All I know is they sent my sister a gift card to the apple store to replace her ipod touch so the issue is finally resolved, but I still would not stay there again.",N
2050,"I found the Mart Plaza through http://hotelplanner.com. They were able to give me a very good rate for a block of 12 rooms at $129/room per night. Although we didn't have our wedding at the hotel, our guests were encouraged to stay here for the following reasons: 1. Great location for public transit, cabs or driving. (Parking is expensive at $34/night, but you do get in/out privileges.) 2. Great rate for Chicago. The city views (if you're lucky to not get a room overlooking the pool roof) are out of this world. Just stunning! 3. Great service. I worked directly with the sales office (thanks Diane and Charnita!) and they were able to accommodate some people that missed the reservation cut off. And they gave them the special rate as well. 4. Our room was huge! I had asked nicely about getting a comp room (being the bride and all, I thought I'd ask!) and was pleasantly surprised that we were given a suite! The room had a king size bed and a big sitting area with couch, coffee table and four lounge chairs (Rm 2048). The view was a northern view of the lake and the Hancock. Very, very nice! Only drawbacks: 1. The bar was packed on the Saturday night (I think there were 2 weddings going on in the hotel) and service was slower than molasses, but the view is awesome, so waiting wasn't that huge of a deal. 2. Having to go all the way down to the main building lobby to smoke. Yeah, I know, that's really not the hotel's fault and I really should just quit, but it is a pain in the ass when you're super anxious about your wedding day and having to wait on everyone else to be ready so you can get ready, etc. etc. 3. Room service prices were ridiculous. I recommend you go down to the deli in the main building lobby for breakfast! $4.25 got me an egg, bacon and cheese bagel sandwich and a cup of coffee. The same would have cost around $14 from the room service menu. Blah. Overall, I'd definitely say we enjoyed our stay at the Mart Plaza. Thanks to all the great people who made our day special!",N

We will definitely recommend this hotel to all of our friends",Y

1694,"It's been a few years since I stayed here.  But I recommend it frequently to friends and associates based on the positive experience I had. I prefer the small boutique hotels in general because they tend to be more accommodating and offer cool extras.  Like the wine reception, or how they sometimes have a DJ spinning in the lobby in the evening.   I will say the decor is a little funky and the stripes in the hallway made me feel like I was Alice in Wonderland in that hall that seems to go on forever getting smaller and smaller *lol*. But considering how great the location is and what the median rates are in the city, they're actually quite affordable.  You can (usually) get a room around $199 and considering the Hampton Inn charges more than $200 and doesn't have half the style or amenities I much rather choose the Allegro if it was available.",N

There are two bus stops right across the street from the hotel, the 8 and the 20, both of which are very useful. Behind the hotel is a Walgreen's, as well as Greek Town. The staff at the hotel was always helpful and friendly, of course we only used them to check in, check out, and find the pool. And yes, they have a pool, well, not technically. But they give you passes to get into a pool in a residential tower two blocks away. When we got to the pool, it was an entire health club at our disposal. One more thing about the Crowne Plaza is that they had one of the best shower heads I've come across in a hotel. It was a rain style head with three points of articulation. Oh yeah, free wifi in the guestrooms was a major selling point as well.",N
775,"As a frequent business traveler, I am usually very pleased with Westin properties, but my experience at The Westin on Michigan Ave was absolutely horrible. From the unnecessarily long line to check in to the hotel to the uncomfortable beds, my stay was not am enjoyable experience. The conference taking place at the time didn't add to my stay, as there were dozens of people taking over the lobby and the elevators, and led to a very cramped experience. Additionally, valet took forever and I had a hard time retrieving the packages I had been expecting. Never again will I stay at this hotel, especially because there are so many other great hotels downtown where one can actually be treated well.",N
4760,"Walking into the main lobby of the Palmer House for the first time is a great experience. Everything is beautiful with high open ceilings, historic woodwork and molding, great fixtures and tapestries. This is definitely a historic place in Chicago that anyone visiting should see.The hotel is close to many great things in Chicago. We came to see a concert at the Chicago Theater and it was an easy walk to there.I'm giving it three stars because we booked our room online and it was supposed to be 2 queens. When we arrived, we were notified that they had awarded all the 2 Queen bedrooms to Hilton Honors members and all they had left was single King rooms. I was with a relative, and we decided we could bare sleeping together for one night. When we arrived in the room, it looked as though this was at one time a janitor's closet converted to a bedroom. The room was absolutely tiny. Our bed took up most of the room and there was very little space to walk around or place our bags. The mini-fridge didn't even open all the way because it hit the end of the bed. Plus, our mini-fridge wasn't even working.Sooo....unless you're a Hilton Honor's member, I would be leery of booking rooms here. There are no guarantees and it definitely felt like they treated people who booked from on-line discount sites (such as http://hotels.com) as second class citizens. Still, if you can get a good deal I would recommend you give it a try because it is such a beautiful and historic building.",Y
769,"Just came back from a quick 1 night stay celebrating our wedding anniversary (and being kidless for a day/night) at this Westin. Overall =4 stars Location = 5 stars.  super easy to walk anywhere in the vicinity. hancock tower is right across the street.  shops, restaurants, etc are everywhere. Service = 5 stars.  have read the other reviews about shoddy service, but ours was excellent overall, except for the car parking folks who took forever to get our car and didn't acknowledge that we were there for 15+ minutes.  We would give 6 stars to the front desk if possible - EDYTA Fizmaurice checked us in and she was super pleasnt, efficient, and friendly.  She is the front desk director - if you see her, get in her line or ask for her. Room quality = 3/4 stars.  4 stars for the great view of the loop.  3 stars for the very bare room and just ok bathroom. Parking = 1 star.  get that it's chicago. get that's it expensive to park anywhere, but $57 for parking, seriously? Price = 5 star.  we got an amazing deal right off the westin website literally the week before at $89+ tax.  You can't even stay at a motel 6 for that in the downtown area. Misc = 5+ star.  about an hour after checking in, we get a knock on the door saying we had room service.  and we didn't order any.  it was a suprise of champagne and strawberries - on the house - in honor of our wedding anniversary.  that was an amazing touch and had us smiling from ear to ear. Overall, we would stay here again even if it's not the best Westin property around.",N
5496,"Very modern, posh, roomy king rooms. Stylish decor. Simple elegance. I was on a higher floor per my request (the 19th floor), and the bed faced a wall that was a complete floor to ceiling..wall to wall window! So cool!! The bathroom was spacious, clean & inviting with a deep full length bathtub and a stand alone glass shower. The modern vanity area was stocked with complimentary toiletries & a sitting chair for primping and grooming yourself in front of the mirrored walls from all corners! The room had a well stocked mini-bar, complimentary, shoe shine service, and wi-fi Internet for a fee.... of which I used none.   The only issue that kept me from giving a perfect 5 star rating was the bathtub needed to be rinsed lightly cleaned before I would get into it. And I saw a hair that did not belong to me or my husband. This let me know housekeeping did not have a great cleaning day that day, (I am very particular hotel room bathroom & bedding areas) but OVERALL the room was clean & neat. ADDITIONAL INFO: My stay was prompted by the purchase of a recent Groupon deal. I treated my husband to a night out to dinner and an overnight stay. It was a very nice room for the Groupon price of $159 (normally a weekend room of that grade goes for twice as much..) My deal included half-off valet parking ($22.50) and a Continental breakfast at the hotel's Whiskey Bar Restaurant",N

2883,"Please AVOID this hotel at all costs. As indicated in other reviews here and on Expedia, and unless you're accustomed to a Motel 6 experience, this is a two/three star property at best, with outdated rooms, '70s style era Moen/Home Depot-cheap  fixtures, cramped rooms, pathetic service (leading all the way up to the CEO of Starwood as I've found) and room service...that NEVER arrives. And like other reviewers here and elsewhere, I too was FRAUDULENTLY charged for items/services never ordered and never received. Now we're getting serious here as this is the stuff people go to jail for especially if it's part of a pattern of abuse and indeed directly or indirectly endorsed/encouraged by management. Stay tuned on a possible CLASS ACTION notification that will destroy this company. Like many of us, I've been in great/good/bad properties all over the world, I've NEVER had this treatment happen to me and this is only part of the story. PLEASE help put this dying dinasaur out of business. Pathetic.",N
1424,"Still delivers the goods two years after my initial review. Smaller than some of the other chain hotels in River North/Gold Coast, the Knickerbocker has a nice boutique hotel feel to it.",N
356,"This hotel has a very European budget feel. However, we are in America. I can handle an old building. What I cannot handle is elevators that do not run properly, are extremely stuffy and slow, and GET STUCK, requiring you to press the call button to be rescued from the elevator by the maintenance crew. This hotel has 2 modern elevators and 1 manual elevator. Why they still have a manual elevator is beyond me, but thank god for that thing because during my stay only 1 of the modern elevators was ever running, and when we got stuck in it the manual elevator aided in our rescue mission. Only staff can run the manual lift, so that meant that all guests across 12 floors were using 1 elevator. This created a big hassle and long waits to get to and from your room (we were on the 12th floor - stairs not really an option). I also just did not feel safe in the elevators. The location is great, staff are nice and competent (expect for the housekeeper - she was rudeness to the max), wi-fi is free, and luckily our room was quiet. But the furnishings are very cheap and outdated. The double beds are just doubles, not queen size. And housekeeping would only give us 1 roll of toilet paper at a time. We had 4 people in the room! Needless to say we ran out of toilet paper each day of our stay. Also, we had a suite with a ""kitchenette,"" but there was really nothing that you could do in this kitchenette other than store leftovers in the fridge, heat them up in the microwave, and then eat them with your bare hands. There was no silverware, plates, glasses, nothing - just some paper cups. So if you want to take advantage of the ""kitchenette"" you'll have to bring the same type of gear you'd bring on a picnic. I expect more from a national chain!",N
4181,I so lucked out by getting this place through Priceline for my cousin and I!  It's right on the riverfront and centrally located to so much.  I loved the look and feel of the place as soon as I walked in.  The hotel just seems so open and lighted.  It almost felt like you were outdoors.  The front desk was helpful.  The rooms were decent size and the beds were INCREDIBLY comfy!  I almost thought we weren't going to be able to get up the next morning! :)  They also have this one bar called Big which outlooks on the city.  The only thing that was disappointing was that I didn't have time to check everything out. I would definitely stay here again!,N
1788,"I was pleasantly surprised at this hotel. Very cool updated interior design and fixtures. I'm sure this is an old building but you wouldn't know it by the looks. I was super happy to find I could strut around my room in a cheetah, yes CHEETAH robe while my man wore his zebra robe. These are also available for sale along with a set of cheetah PJs (his and hers) and some cozy socks which were in our closet, just in case. The mini bar is extensively stocked with not only beverage and snacks but also things you may need like toothbrushes, razors and even a ""love kit"", all for purchase if needed. These items were quality brands and eco-friendly in most cases which was nice. The shampoo and lotions were Aveda which also made me happy, they just smell great and have great products. I actually liked their towels, most hotels even some of the better ones have inconsistent and possibly scratchy towels that make you paranoid that you might get stuck with the itchy one. These were consistently plush and didn't reek of bleach. My only negative would be the lack of counter space in the bathroom. The chic table-top sink on a granite counter just doesn't lend enough space for your toiletries but we managed by shuffling the hotels accessories around and using the back of the toilet. I must give kudos to the front desk for upgrading our room to a slightly larger room for free, we booked as a package deal on Orbitz. We tried to purchase an upgrade for the jet tub room but they didn't have any available. Didn't eat there so I can't speak to that, but the area is in the theatre district and close to some good eats. We also had a great corner view room and could see straight down one of the streets (??) and not just at a window of another building which is often your view in a big city. Great hotel, great service, helpful nice people, elevators were fast. I'd go again!",N
2850,"Four stars for accommodations and location, 1.5-2 stars for some bad-apple service encounters, giving this place overall three stars. Hotel accommodations were well apportioned, and at a perfect location in downtown Chi-town.  My room was clean, very comfortable and very well cared for throughout my stay.  I would have enjoyed my riverside view room more if I weren't so busy during my business trip.  Great views of the waterfront, lakeside and riverside.  Walkable to the Magnificent Mile and other touristy areas of interest like the Art Institute and Millennium Park.   Great amenities, but they sure nickel and dime you to use them unless you pay a flat rate for your stay or you're a platinum-level Starwood Preferred Guest member.  It's an obnoxious ploy these higher-end hotels play, and of course we sucker into them and succumb to them.  I will rejoice the day they stop playing games and stop with these peddling charges.   Service was attentive, but not consistent.  If you get unlucky you'll get a receptionist that's very strict, not accommodating, and otherwise arrogant.  One reception who I got at check-in was friendly and listed the amenities included during my stay.  I got an obnoxious young lady at check out that charged for internet.  I told her it was supposed to be included and she said otherwise and that I should have checked when I checked in.  Since my stay was taken care of by my work I didn't bother to argue, but that didn't make me less annoyed with the service. I'd definitely keep this hotel in mind for my next stay for amenities and convenience of location, but the nickel and dime-ing of USING the amenities and the sour reception/customer service will by no means make me run to the place.",N
1656,"A little older, but still charming. I got a suite once with two bathrooms and one had a jacuzzi tub, which I took advantage of. Big comfy bed! Their evening wine hour is cozy, and casual offering beer wine. Sometimes, servers circulate with little bites. I tried the Zumba class once, which was a fun work out with 8 or so other women (including a couple Kimpton staff). They had pitchers of water in the back of the room. As other Yelp reviewers have noted, it can be cramped, but seems like a decent room rate for its location and excellent Kimpton service.",N
1498,"I can't say enough about this hotel.  From the front desk staff to the bartender who made restaurant recommendations AND reservations for us to the way friendly (not to mention hilarious) gal who answers the phone at room service, I don't have a single complaint about this place.   Lovely room, comfy bed/linens, indoor pool & spa and they still have old-fashioned bed turn-down service each night (who does THAT anymore?).  Within walking distance to almost anything.  Everything else no more than a $10 cab ride away.  Worth every penny!",N
3717,"I came here for the afternoon tea and it was a wonderful experience.  For under $30, we got great sandwiches, scones, and pastries.... plus a harpist and a beautiful fountain to sit next to!  The service was excellent and I'm looking forward to going back!",N
4156,"I booked this hotel through Priceline's name your own price. The hotel is in a very convenient location. Right next to the water and not right in the middle of downtown were traffic can be congested. Our room was on the 26th floor and had a great view. They had a floating bed which was pretty cool. There was a convenient bar/restaurant in the hotel. The food was decent as well as the drinks. The bad. There was no bed cover sheet on our bed. It was simply a regular sheet that was tucked in. For someone who moves around while he sleeps, the bottom sheet constantly came undone and was exposing the bare mattress. Not very comfortable. The room size was a little small as well. As soon as I walked in, the doorway was narrow and there wasn't much room to maneuver around. Also, the walls were very thin so we could hear everything from our neighbors on both sides. Overall, this hotel was decent. Again, for the money, it wasn't a bad selection. However, I don't think I would want to stay there again.",N
1618,"I was able to book this hotel via smartphone while at the airport just before midnight. I got downtown and checked in without a glitch. I got a 38th floor room with and AMAZING view! The one downside was that my room literally surrounded the elevator bank. The room was nice, clean and comfortable. Room service was adequate (but I think they added $3 extra to the ""service charge""). Great location. Great staff. Would stay here again.",N
4896,"While my stay at the Dana Hotel and Spa started with a very helpful and witty valet, it has ended as the strangest hotel experience of my life - and I travel often.  It started to go downhill when we realized that we had to pass through a ""V.I.P."" rope to get to our ""V.I.P."" elevator.  I'm not sure if people are just that hungry for fame, or if we just didn't understand how popular we were... but it was completely unnecessary and total overkill.  While the service can be confused with politeness, its completely fake and unauthentic.  Being chased down a hallway to thank me for my business for the third time is simply not necessary.  This hotel is very cool as a structure, but the human beings that run it are incompetent, groveling fools.",Y
3853,"Visually, The hotel is modern, creative and pretty. However, it's good design does not make up for the so-so staff.-I only saw one employee, a bellman, dark man with braids, who provided exceptional service. I watched him from the bar as he kept guests dry from the rain, continually keeping the elevator ready, and carrying luggage with a smile. The bar wasn't busy and the nice bartender unfortunately couldn't multitask well. **the elevator requires your room key and it continually didn't register with many guests.. And one point, it wouldn't work for a bellman. The elevator wouldn't allow me to go to the Vertigo room either.. That was frustrating and I tried both days. I didn't ask the staff for help b/c like I said, they didnt really seem that helpful. I did love the comfy king room. The bed itself felt like heaven. There was a personal patio and an awesome shower. The layout of the room was creative. It felt as if you were in a loft.",N
4731,Left a bag behind and it was a nightmare to get it returned only to find a bracelet missing which they took no responsibility for.  The rooms are very small and there is no room for a make-up bag in the bathrooms.  Bad processed and customer service.  Too many optons out there to settle for this hotel.,Y
2935,"On a recent trip to Chicago, this was my home for 3 nights. I love the location of the hotel, it is in very close proximity to all the major attractions in Downtown Chicago such as Navy Pier, shopping, etc. When you drive up to this hotel and even when you walk in the lobby, you get the feeling that this is going to be a fantastic hotel with the grand entrance and the beautiful lobby. However, in terms of the rooms itself, I was kinda dissapointed especially because it is a Sheraton Hotel. We got what I believe is a standard room on the 18th floor and even walking through the hallway to get to the room, all the doors look dated and worn down. When we arrived at our room, my travel companion commented on how the lock looked as if someone broke it to it before. The room itself was also looked pretty dated with some heavy wooden closet doors, older looking bathroom and dated decor. The chair I'm sitting on even creaks like crazy every time I move. Though I have to say the most annoying part is the heavy doors to the rooms that slam shut everytime someone walks in and out of their room on the floor, so loud that I'm woke up every time...boo! But the bed itself are ok, pretty comfy. In terms of the other facilities offered by the hotel, the fitness center is equipped with some very nice treadmills (with the tv built in) and a full set of weights available for arm workouts. The pool itself, although indoor and relatively small is a nice place to relax after a hard workout as well. Since both are located on the 7th floor, you get a beautiful view of the Lake when you sit on one of the chairs around the pool. Another nice feature is the sundeck where a few sun chairs are set up and where you can soak up some sun. Unfortunately the sauna was broken or else I'd love to have used that as well. Overall, it's a great hotel in a prime location and awesome facilities. Would stay here again next time I'm in Chicago.",N
4572,"Something always seems to go wrong when I visit Chicago, last time our car got towed at 2am (course our luggage, maps & most $ was in the car ) so we had to wander the streets of Chicago aimlessly... This time the issue was the hotel: Plus 1 star: location Plus 1 star: gorgeous lobby, historical hotel Minus 1 star- for PAPER THIN WALLS Minus 1 star- for being woken by maid each morning Minus 1 star for not only not allowing my boyfriend in the room when his card stopped working & not being helpful to him in any way. I have travelled throughout the US, Europe & Asia and I don't remember any hotel, motel, or any other lodging where the maids come before checkout or at least 11am.  This might not have been that problemmatic but the paperthin walls did not help. FRI:    9:23am Maid service next door (to those that flew in late & are on CA time that felt like 7:23am about 5 hours BEFORE I had planned to wake).   We're not talking about faintly hearing the vaccuum, we're talking hearing her push all the hangers in the closet together ... that's how thin the walls were. I crawled out of bed & put a ""do not disturb"" sign up.  A few minutes later our door starts shaking and this weird noise like someone's rubbing against the door Apparently they polish them every morning  -- I'd have to say she didn't read the sign about NOT DISTURBING US. Later that night got to listen to our neighbors have sex. SAT:  Maid service comes through at 8:30am! (which, to someone on PST felt like 6:30am wakeup, esp. after being at a wedding reception until midnight the night before!). SUN.   3:14am woken by screaming fight next door (apparently some jerk ditched his GF).   7:00am woken up by someone in the room on the other side decided it was a good time to SING. 8:30-9:30am Maid knocking on neighbouring doors woke us up later that morning (we'd finally learned to put the do not disturb (or polish our door!) sign up at night). Went out to visit a friend about an hour outside of Chicago.  Get a call from my BF.  His card won't work on the room. He went to the front desk & since his name wasn't on the reservation they wouldn't give him a new card (Fair enough, appreciate their not giving one to just anyone). What really pissed me off was they refused to consider any reasonable alternative to prove his claim or assist him. I mean he did have a hotel card, he knew the name of the person in the room, he knew the room #, he could describe the room & our luggage, offered to give them the credit card # the room was charged too - he wasn't just coming in randomly & fishing for info. They told him having me call & verify him would NOT be enough to let him in. He then asked them to look at the key and see if they could see why it didn't work.  Theyclaimed the key was fine and if it was valid it should work (accusing him of not only having found a key but mysteriously knowing the room # & name associated with the card)?.  They also refused to send someone up with him so he could prove the card didn't work and that his belongings were really in the room. So he called me upset that he wasn't allowed in our room, he was exhausted from a long day and I was not expected back for at least 4 hours and was at least an hour away. I called and demanded to speak to someone who would attempt to assist him and got someone to add his name to the reservation and they let him in - but it definitely soured our afternoon. Other things that I would not have bothering mentioning except that I was so sleep deprived & cranky about the above instances : The front of the building is under construction (which is a shame, would've liked to see it).  It would have been nice if they told me this on the phone when I called for the address, they gave me the street that had no entrance, instead of the street that had a working entrance). And I suppose it was my fault for asking for closest subway line when coming from the airport (not knowing there were separate train/non-train lines), so instead of giving us the stop 15 feet in front of the front door that was exactly on our line from the airport - I was told to get out at a stop about 5 blocks away... still, deductive reasoning should have told her that confused tourist from out of town coming from Midway on the Orange line, probably wants the closest Orange line stop, not to spend more time transferring to some other line for a further stop & then toting luggage to the hotel.",N

2185,"My experience was with their lobby bar, I have not stayed at the hotel.  I was working with an out of town News Crew for elections, that was stationed outside of the Tribune Tower next door for two long 14 hour hour days.    And it was very cold.  Since the News Station had the team staying at a hotel all the way down by Hancock, it was impossible for us to go back and forth all day long. We hung out in the lobby bar for two days, and ordering all of our meals and coffee drinks.  I was so surprised at the quality of the food and the service. When you have to be outside every half hour in the cold, you need a warm refuge.  And this was the spot.  Even though we were not guests of the hotel, the staff treated us as such.   During the second day, as I was getting more and more harried, I rushed in to look for one of our crew and a waiter met me at the revolving door, saw the look on my face and said ""Ma'am, your guy is over there.""  Talk about paying attention! Great stuff!",N

1655,"This hotel was the perfect start to our mini-vacation: a long weekend in Chicago.  The location is awesome, right in the loop so super close to any line of the El train.  Also was within walking distance of all the restaurants I had chosen.   Everything from walking in and having someone jump up to hold the doors for us, to the grand staircase as we entered, to the super funky décor of the lobby told us that this was going to be an experience in itself.  Little did we know... I had done my research ahead of time to know that not only does the hotel offer a free wine reception every evening (sweet!), but they also have a ""code word"" that you can use to get a special surprise when you check in.  I was expecting a $10 voucher for the restaurant, or something of that scale.  What we actually received was a king suite on the top floor of the hotel.  I think that's the biggest hotel room I've ever been in.  Our jaws dropped as we entered and began to look around.  I crossed the room to the bathroom where I saw that we had a Jacuzzi tub!  I called out to my boyfriend to tell him, only to find out that he was also checking out a bathroom.  For those not keeping up, we had two bathrooms.  Man did I ever feel pampered!   The décor in the room was awesome too.  Definitely nothing like what I would do in my own home, but I loved the funky design of the wallpaper and the blue picture of a cello.  It was so nice that we didn't even mind when I got heat exhaustion and spent the second half of Sunday in the room!  We ordered delivery from Lou Malnati's and relaxed. My only complaint is that the walls were pretty thin, so we could hear the tv in the bordering rooms sometimes, but it didn't really bother us at all.  Also, for at least one day two of the three elevators were out of commission, but they worked on that fairly quickly, and allowed us to use the service elevators in the meantime.  Honestly, everything else was so amazing that I'm going to give it a 5 star rating anyways! All in all, I loved this hotel, and would definitely stay there again.  Thanks for an awesome weekend Kimpton!",N

282,"I stayed here upon my arrival when I relocated to Chicago. Heres my .02 for what its worth. My disappointment was that for the money the room was a little rough.  Nice, comfortable, functional, but kinda rundown . In fact, I think the rooms are converted studio apartments for business renters.  The kitchen was fully functional.  It had a refrigerator, range, microwave, plates, glasses, pots, pans, etc. etc. The bathroom was very small, and lit very badly. The furnishings were also nice, just dated . On the upside, the hotel staff was very nice. The location is great, just east of the John Hancock. Great starting point for any Michigan Ave. day adventure. So if you are looking for  a hotel room with  functionality, the Seneca definitely fits the bill.",N
5592,"Very disappointed with this Westin because of their reputation and I usually have great stays at their hotels. I stayed at this one for a night downtown with my fiance. The location is great and the decor is exactly what you'd expect from a Westin. The woman at the front desk was very friendly when she checked us in. We ate at the lobby restaurant, which was a HUGE disappointment. Our waitress was extremely frazzled and kind of made us uncomfortable because she was going 100mph and blaming others who worked at the lounge for how long it was taking our food. Originally we sat off to the side because no tables were open (we were joined by a friend for dinner) and the waitress approached us and we told her we'd like to wait for a table to open up. We saw one open and she said it wasn't in her section (we thought ""so what?"") and then told us she'd clean off a table in her section and then proceeded to seat us there. We ordered off the sushi and dinner menus. The sushi was a huge disappointment. I was expecting really original, creative rolls but there was nothing too extraordinary. It was good, but I'm not too picky. I've definitely had MUCH better sushi. My fiance ordered a spider roll (he gets one every time we get sushi) and barely touched it because he said it tasted awful and was the worst spider roll he's ever had. Off the dinner menu, I ordered the ratatouille ravioli and my fiance ordered the pork chop. My ravioli fell short of my expectations. My fiance's porkchop was bland, the ""fries"" that came with it were dry and the brussel sprouts... oh my goodness. Like I said, I'm not a picky eater, but I took a bite of half a brussel sprout and wanted to spit it out. It was awful. My fiance was in a bad mood after dinner and said he wouldn't mind spending so much money on food if it was actually good. After we checked out the next day, I realized I left a pair of heels in the room. We called and the hotel said they didn't find any shoes but would let us know. I thought the service would be better that whoever cleaned the room would've notified someone and then we would've received a call, but I guess not.",N
3370,"The hotel was fine. The room was clean, quiet, and most things in the room worked. Things that worked: AC, Shower, toilet, sink, TV, outlets, lamps. Things that didn't work: Heater, Internet. Regardless of where the dial was, it would only produce cold air into the room, thank goodness it was summer time, but i'd hate to see what would happen if it was during winter... or fall.. Anyways... my biggest gripe with this damn place is the internet. 5.95 a pop  and it's extremely slow. i'm talking about 600+ latency and 0.05 or Less Mbps. The 3g on my iPhone was much faster. Very bummed out about that little prospect. The pool and gym area were clean and as described. Very happy about that.",N
3349,"My latent belief that it's inhumane to live anywhere but New York had reason to rear its head about eight seconds after I entered the ruthlessly no-frills lobby of the South Shore's least expensive hotel. The staff's mild Midwestern manners didn't ameliorate my impatience at my check-in time being delayed, or the elevators crawling at snail's pace, or the unimpressive (but clean) room. They definitely didn't stop me from kicking myself -repeatedly; with vigor- that I'd shelled out considerable greenbacks for a Shore address - and gotten considerably less than any of alternatives situated on lesser avenues. Take my advice and book a room off the Shore - they're guaranteed to beat the lowest-end Shore offering.",N
1750,"I really liked this place!  Best accessible room I've ever been in.  Staff was very helpful and friendly.  Bed was so comfy, I slept in a couple of mornings.  Room was a little small, but I was by myself, so it didn't matter.",N
1520,"This hotel is in the middle of everything.  One of my gfs and myself went to Chicago on a whim b/c of the Virgin Airlines Groupon and she found a $99 per night Groupon for this place.  Great location, right across from the Trump building and on the river.  It's right off of North Michigan, near the Magnificent Mile and between Grant Park (0.2 miles away!).  It's close to the L line from O'Hare ($2.25 per trip every two hours) or you can walk everywhere.  The corner bakery is several yards down from the hotel and there's a Walgreen's and 7-11 closeby. Bar downstairs, pretty flowers, nice desk people, complimentary internet and biz office for printing out boarding passes, nice waiting area, pleasant door staff.  Would come back!",N
5674,"With at least three bona fide 5-star hotels in the immediate vicinity of the Talbott I know that throwing out my own 5-star rating might seem a little generous. But those other 5-star joints are internationally known and with that comes the crowds, the lack of personal attention and outrageous prices. And then there is The Talbott Hotel. I'm a big fan of boutique hotels and The Talbott is one of the best I have ever experienced. No you don't have a massive lobby or numerous restaurants and shops inside the structure. But you do get a wonderfully appointed room with a large bathroom. The furniture is new and above all comfortable. Flatscreen televisions might not be the norm at all hotels but they are at The Talbott and they are HD. But I think it's the little things that really make the Talbott special. Their bath towels are huge and soft. They have complimentary Aveda products in the bathrooms. There is a full sized umbrella in the closet. There is a telephone next to the toilet just in case you need to do business while you are doing business. If you stay at the Talbott expect to be warmly greeted by everyone that works there. And I'm not talking about simple hellos but ""How are you today?"" and ""Where are you travelling from?"" types of questions. Every employee at the Talbott made me feel welcome which you don't always get at bigger hotels. I am already looking forward to my return trip in 2011.",N
2960,"I've actually only been to the Sheraton for an event and will definitely never go back.  I watched some guests trying to get off the elevator, and a bellman literally pushed them out of the way.  Each member of the staff that I came in contact with acted like the guests were a hassle.  The service here is horrible.",N
4973,"This hotel is fab.I'm on my way back to the UK via USA from backpacking and I can still afford to stay here.  $77 per night for 2 in a petite room.  The room is way bigger than I expected and is lovely.  Air con/heater, clean, super dooper shower, comfy bed and we even had internet access in the room for free which I don't think was suppose to happen but try your luck if you have a lap top. They do have free wi-fi in the looby though and free fresh coffee in the morning. The in room service menu is also pretty reasonable (mains for about $15).It's quiet at night apart from the odd siren of the ambulances going to the nearby hospital but it's not disruptive at all.Location is great too.  Red line metro is 2 blocks up on Chicago st, the buses are right outside and it's easily walkable in about 20 mins to Sears tower and Grant Park etc.If you stay here I would recommend going to The Soupbox up on East Chicago st, that was a fab place to get gorgeous soup for $7 and I'm picky about soup.",Y
2176,"What can I say about this hotel? First of all, it is in the perfect location and I mean absolutely perfect.  It is very beautiful, but for $500 a night can a sista get some heat?  I woke up at 3am freezing my butt off because our heat would not work properly.  Also, there was a huge spider on the ceiling that sent me into the restroom crying.  For the expense, you would also think internet might be free - wrong. Overall, the experience was OK, but I've stayed in better places.",N
4417,"I didn't stay here, but I love this hotel. I can only imagine, based on the common and conference spaces I've been in over the last two days, what the rooms are like. The lobby is beautiful. Look at the ceiling and fixtures. Breathe it in. Sit a spell. And the conference areas are solid. The catered food is good, and the coffee strong. And the wifi? Provided by the conference organizers, sure, but the signal has been strong in almost every single room I've been in, even the breakout session rooms with awkward pillar-dominated designs. Minus one star because the traffic flow for stairs and escalators isn't always clear. Outside of using the elevators, the floors don't connect well, and it can be hard to find your way around.",N
2039,Bare-bones hotel in terms of room and amenities but the view is just absolutely spectacular. Met all my expectations and certainly exceeded it with the bar and the view.,N
2979,"The lobby and lounges on the first floor are very nice.  We did not use the restaurants so I can't comment on them.  The pool was out of service during our visit which was an inconvenience.  It is very small so my kids probably didn't miss much.  We were able to use the Swiss hotel pool instead.  It was nice, but the walk across the river in winter is not recommended.  Our room was below par.  The bathroom was in poor shape and not well maintained.  We booked our visit through Priceline which listed the Sheraton as a 4 star hotel.  That rating is a stretch.",N
2145,"Instead of falling victim to an overpriced and underwhelming New Year's Eve ""Bar Party"" my boyfriend and I decided we would do it up nice and stay d-town in a hoighty-toighty hotel.  After much research, we settled on the Intercontinental because the price wasn't TOO outrageous and location was well, perfect.   First the bad.  Upon check-in at 3PM, my bf was presented with a ""contract"" promising he would not bring booze into our room. Um, OK.  Hopefully that was just a NYE thing because it was totally LAME (and I may have snucky some booze in anyway. Or not.  Shhh).   Also valet parking was 40 bones.  After the room price, that is a little steep but fair I guess for downtown 24-hour parking. As for the good, our room was very nice.  The bed was heavenly and I think I could live in it (I found refuge in those pillows as we painfully watched the Bears blow it.  Awesome we had planned our evening around that).  I also found the room to be really clean (but who really knows these days, especially after watching Dateline when they show those microscopic bugs - ew). Highlights included the bar - great people watching, especially that night because there was a wedding.  Drinks were pricey as expected but the staff was nice.  I did find a SHARD of glass in my martini before I was, oh about to swallow it (wouldn't that have been a Happy New Year?) but the bartender apologetically gave me a new one at no charge.   Shards aside, I had a good experience at the Intercontinental.  It's pretty solid and RIGHT on Michigan across from Nordstrom.  I would recommend that an out-of-towner shacks up here for a visit.",N
2591,"""Pretty average and ordinary for my taste. I've been here twice - first time, we were in the main lounge with a table service. Decor is OK, and there is enough space to move around - but music is quite poor. Too many pretentious, gel hair guys. Second time I went there, we had the private room with our own DJ for a b-day party, and it was better. The private room is cozier, especially if you can get a group of ~30 people or so. Be careful with the table service, they might rip you off (paid $250 for one bottle of Absolut!). Overall, I don't enjoy this place much mainly because of 1)the crowd, 2)poor music.""",N
1474,"This is a fabulous hotel. My room was a suite and overlooked Michigan Avenue and the Apple Store (with its grass roof...very cool sight). The room was sparkling clean, the internet access was fast and easy to access and the room was quiet. They even do a turn down service in the evening...something I hardly ever see any more. I was there for a conference. All food and service was excellent. This is also a great location with shopping and restaurants everywhere adjacent. I very much recommend this hotel.",N
3451,"Stayed here for free while on a grad school interview, so I didn't know how much it cost at first. The location is perfect; the lobby, lounge, and bedrooms are very classy, and the beds are super-comfortable.  However, given how expensive everything seemed, I was disappointed with the amenities. Even budget chains will often provide free cable TV, wifi, and continental breakfast service, but I was faced with the following: a) WiFi is free in the lobby, but $10/day surcharge in your room. What a ripoff.  Obviously they have it wired already, so I feel they're being malicious in asking us to pay for it.  I was able to pull a usable open signal from the hotel next door. b) No TV.  They advertise ""free cable TV"" in every room but mine sure didn't have any. Instead you have a fancy LCDtv with a truly crappy hotel-installed interface, where everything is pay-per-view.  Want to watch a recent episode of TV?  You only have a few options.  I chose 30 Rock... and was asked to pay $5 to watch a recent episode.  What a ripoff.  You are being asked to pay for what is basically Hulu.  There are movies for ~$15 of course, but that is pretty standard. There is a laughable ""free"" section on the menu but it consists of crud that appears to be free videos from the internet.  One had Tom Arnold, one was called ""Naked Wine"" and featured naked wine reviews. Except the woman wasn't attractive... or naked (it shows from the shoulders up). WTF Allerton, I feel you are just TRYING to be jerks. Plus originally the TV wouldn't turn on; then there was a period when it would keep turning itself back on. c) No breakfast, not even tea.  Ok, so I didn't care about the breakfast. It's just an observation.  I REALLY would have liked some tea though.  In the morning they had coffee in the lobby, but NO TEA!  Maybe this is a midwest bias that I can't understand, coming from California. d) As others have mentioned, there is no storage space.  Closet is a decent sized but you'll have no dressers to keep your clothes. So I was pretty disappointed with the place, until I looked up the prices. Turns out to be somewhat of a budget hotel: $100-150/night for a single queen or double full room, which is pretty good actually.  I was forced to reevaluate in light of this.  I'd say that this is a great place to stay if you want to feel like you're staying in a luxury hotel but paying economy prices.  Located right on the Magnificent Mile, it doesn't get much better.  Just try to get a room on the upper floors, to enjoy the view.",N
4331,"I stayed here recently. It is an iconic property, but I would recommend the lobby and restaurants over an actual stay here. The rooms just seem extremely antiquated and dated, and they are not as comfortable or visually pleasing as one would hope. It's probably just a matter of personal taste, though! The lobby area is one of the most grand and gorgeous in all of Chicago, and I recommend it without reservation for drinks/coffee/food/etc.",N
663,Solid place.  I went there with my brother for a weekend of site seeing and drinking... mostly drinking.  Nothing really going on at the hotel.  Place was nice and the beds were comfortable.  Close to navy pier and michigan ave.,N
3616,"First impression?  The valets outside could give a rat's ass about you.  I was staying there for 3 days and each time I had an interaction with them, it was like I was disturbing them.  Really annoying and the reason I only gave 3 stars. Location is great.   Historic hotel which is fun to stay in.  Owned by Hilton, but you don't feel like it.   I ordered what was likely the WORST Old Fashioned I've ever had in my life.  I think the bartender was Russian and maybe didn't learn that one in Moscow.  Anyway, great ambiance in the bars. I'd stay here again because you're almost going back in time and you can't beat the location.",N
4142,Muy kick ass place. I used to come here for SoxFest. Rooms were well laid out and decently priced. It's a shame the sox left here for the Palmer House.,N
685,"I have a personal understanding of the hospitality industry and I know how hard the business really is. This is why I'm super impressed with my stay at this Marriott and plan to write a personal email to the front desk managers to honor some extraordinary staff members of his such as Crystal Kwak and John. My stay at the hotel began with a sour note, due to my flight delay i didnt not arrive until 11pm and came to find out that there is no room at this marriot for me even though I have a confirmed reservation. John, the front desk staff, explained the situation and a room was quickly rebooked for me at James Hotel which is just 1 block away. Without me requesting it, a staff member, Rick, walked with me to James hotel for safety measures. Exhausted from 15+hour of travel, my stay at the James hotel was a pleasant one. The next day, when I ""re-check in"" at the front desk I was greeted with Crystal Kwak, an assistant front desk manager. I told her my name and she had the look immediate that she knew me, she told me how sorry she was to know that I had to get re-booked to another hotel last night and that she's so glad I'm staying here now. Her warmth and sincerity resonated with me and I, too,  was glad to be back in Marrriott. Afterward unpacking my bags, I had a surprise room delivery of a complimentary bottle of Merlot, 2 iced bottled water and a large box of mint chocolate. Needless to say, I went back to Crystal the next day and thanked her personally to make my stay a pleasant one. This hotel has amazing location, close proximity to just about everything, staff is courteous and thoughtful, and this is for an extremely busy hotel that's buzzing all the time (yes even at 11pm!) Which only makes me appreciate all the personal touches even more because it's easy to forget a customer's value in a sea of customers but they didn't do that. I would come back and stay here again and would recommend this hotel for your downtown Chicago stay.",N

2595,"I was here on Saturday, and I really enjoyed the place.  It's definitely off the beaten path, but once inside it has a great atmosphere.  My only complaint would be that there is no seating unless you're doing bottle service.  The staff was friendly, as were the patrons, and it was one of the more attractive crowds I've seen out.  Drinks were good, as was the food - I was pleasantly surprised by their sushi, which apparently has won awards (?).  The DJ was good too.  I'd definitely go back.",N

The room I stayed in last week did not have a fridge/mini-bar, no coffee maker or water heater of any sort, an old 23-ish inch CTR TV that could only muster a grainy image. Another great amenity was 7$/hr wifi in the lobby. Also, their famous brownie is not very exciting at all, skip it.",N
3285,"got a great rate on line and within walking distance of soldier field which was our goal for seeing U2 ... alas the concert has been postponed but we headed to Chicago anyways, well because it is chicago! In a beautiful old deco building - lobby is a large open space that flows from couch area to front desk to bar -- the bar was playing vintage 80's and 90's videos though the music being played wasn't the same which was a bit disconcerning. I arrived early but was given a room which was great ... although the view of a wall, roof and air ducts pretty much blew .... the room was very quiet though which was a nice trade off. Bed was beyond comfortable and the bathroom clean and well stocked. But whats with all the dim lights? between the very dark hallways and all the lights in the rooms seeming to be 15 watt bulbs ...is that the rock star style? lol i didn't mind though a lit magnifying mirror in the bathroom would have been a really nice touch. Carpet was a bit worn - but that could be forgiven i'd stay again as the location is great and had no complaints with staff or room ...",N

I'm from Cali, so I'm a strictly warm weather gal). Perks: Nice, comfortable beds with fluffy pillows and soft sheets. Clean, modern room. Free breakfast and shuttle service to/from the airport (although keep in mind: the shuttle only leaves once every hour). And the staff was very friendly. Would have been nice if there was more in the area in terms of food, drug stores, liquor stores (mmmm red wine), etc. But overall a great and affordable place to crash for a chilly layover.",N
3939,"We stayed at the hotel on the following days: August 20 - 22 2009 and August 24 2009. We reserved the rooms on http://priceline.com and pain $129 for lake view rooms on Aug 20 -22 and $99 non-lake view rooms on Aug 24. The lake view rooms had gorgeous view of the Buckingham fountain. Their age does show though, but it's charming. The lobby was gorgeous and the employees were extremely friendly. The first night there, there were very loud hotel guests who came in around 4a.m., however they quietened down immediately after we placed a call to the front desk. The non-lake view rooms has a view of the lobby roof and they were very small with no bath tubs (they had standup showers.) As noted on other reviews, there were picketers outside the front entrance, (very depressing) but didn't really take anything away from our visit. The location was awesome, and the bellhops were extremely knowledgeable. Parking was $28 with unlimited in and out. Overall, I'd say this was a descent hotel for the price we paid for the accomodation. Keep your expectations descent and you'll be pleaseantly surprised.",N
5851,"ost things about this hotel were nice. However, as a light sleeper, the alley was ridiculously loud, and many of the rooms face the alley. One of the air conditioners made such a loud erratic noise that I was unable to get a good night's sleep. IN addition, garbage bins are rolled down the alley late very early in the morning and added the the noise. I would suggest somewhere that actually has working, quiet air conditioners and does not have so many rooms facing the loud alley.",Y
657,"As mentioned, great location. Staff was great, cookies are a great touch and a nice room. Also, a small thing, but I do like the Neutrogena products. I was kind of surprised that the nice HD TV offered no HD programs. I also see how the mini bar could create a problem with unknown charges as mentioned. I overheard a lady talking in the restaurant how she must have moved something on the weight-sensitive trays and was charged. I don't know why they have to set it up that way. It should allow for a delay in case something is picked up and examined. Maybe five minutes. I was also a little disappointed that the free breakfast with my Gold status with Hilton was only a continental breakfast and to get anything hot it was an extra $6. The free for Gold members at the Hilton Garden Inn up the street was much better. Nice and hot in the Weber Grill Restaurant. Not a bad stay at all, but didn't blow my socks off. If price dictated I would stay again, but might not if price wasn't a factor.",N
574,"The wife and I stayed here for a night as a reward for not going insane after being cooped up with our newborn for three months.  Yes, probably a Holiday Inn would have been quite fine at that point, but i tend to believe i am a good judge of things, and the Public Hotel deserves my accolades.   The staff were incredibly friendly to start.  The lobby was beautiful, with lots of places to relax if you needed a break, but didn't want to be in your hotel room.   The hotel room, which was reasonably priced compared to some other local hotels, was really cool and modern.  They did a nice job with the old bathrooms, without having to completely redo them.  The bed was cozy, and the bath products were top notch.  There was a nice flat screen with an easy to use operating system.  My only complaint on the room was that there was a gap between the door bottom and the floor, and when our neighbors returned to their room at 5AM (must have been a good night), we heard their whole conversation through their and our closed doors.  I opened the door and knocked on theirs and asked them to keep it down. We ate at the restaurant that evening, and the food was excellent.  I had the Pork Tenderloin and my wife had their Weiner Schnitzel.  The Schnitzel was outstanding.  They also had a good wine list, however later i found out the glass of $12 Chardonnay i was drinking retailed for $10.99 a bottle.  That is some mark up. After dinner we had another drink in the lobby which turned into a total 40 to 60 year old meat market.  We went to sleep early, but i hear the crowd gets younger as thee night goes on.  It was good people watching anyway. Brunch in the morning wasn't bad, but next time i will meander over to the Original House of Pancakes off Rush street. We also loved the location of the hotel.  It was in a quieter area, but only minutes from the action by foot or by cab.   We would definitely stay here again.",N
3095,"What a disappointment.  I recently became a Starwoods Reward Club member, so rather than stay at the Palmer House Hilton the way I usually do when I'm in Chicago, I decided to scout this place out instead.   It was raining miserably during the time I was here, so I didn't venture out around the property, but here are some observations about the hotel itself. High Points: *The concierge has a list of restaurants that will deliver to the hotel.  This is an excellent feature because room service for dinner is rather awful (see low points below). *The room itself is very comfortable and clean. *I lost an earring.  Housekeeping found it and placed it where I would see it.  I was very pleased. *They have a nice facility for a gym *They have an Acura car service that will take you around the city for free, as long as you sit through a 1 minute video on your ride and listen to the driver talk about the car and fill out a short survey.  (Service is available from noon-7pm only.) *Navy Pier looks like its in walking distance.  I could see it was close from a hotel window. Low Points: *Hotel room service is bad and expensive!.  I had the chicken pot pie for dinner which was just gross.  It was a lardy mess and not really a pie at all with the tiniest pieces of chicken and veggies almost like the kind that you would find in a can of condensed soup.  I also ordered a $12 slice of carrot cake, which for the price I hoped would be amazing and it was small and just 'meh bordering on not good.   *The shower kept changing temperature!!!  I took two showers while I was there, one long and one short (I know, TMI huh?). During the long shower the water temperature got cold at least 5 or 6 times.  And during the short shower at least a couple of times.  That is just plain old unacceptable! *They have a popular happy hour.  That in and of itself is a good thing, however, the bar is right next to the reception desk.  The music and crowd was so loud that I could not hear the front desk staff as I was checking in. *I got a double room when I asked for a King. * The hallways are noisy in the evenings, sounded like hotel staff. Other points: *They have a very interesting menu option: fresh fruit with chocolate sauce, whipped cream and......a disposable camera.  Enjoy! :)",N
683,"Such an wonderful location to be staying while visiting Chicago. I had a room that faced Magnificent Mile and it was such a great view to see the architecture at eye level and then look down and people watch. The room was really spacious and open. Shopping is at your fingertips and there are so many good eats around that you need not travel far. If you are looking to venture out a bit, the train is really close or my favorite way to explore a city is just to walk around. Chicago is an extremely walkable city but if that's not your thing then their train system is pretty good too. This Marriott is kind of in the middle of everything with the hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave right there you can pick a direction and just go and you'll get somewhere where you want to be. North, South, East, or West point and go. Location means a lot when picking a hotel and this is a great one. The concierge here is so friendly and even funny to boot. Great suggestions whether you give them something to go off of your tastes and likes or not. It's a really busy hotel whether it's late night, early morning, or the middle of the day and you can kind of get lost in the mix but the staff is pretty attentive so even though you may feel like it might happen... it probably won't *Overall You get what you pay for. This hotel is a bit on the expensive side but the staff is as excellent as the location so if you're willing to pay for that then you'll be happy here. Try to get a room on the Mag Mile side for the great view. Rating: 4",N

2350,"Marriott is my favorite regular hotel for business trips, and I stayed here often before relocating to Chicago.  The best feature of this Marriott is its location, in the heart of the Magnificent Mile and so close to great restaurants and shopping.  The free Navy Pier shuttle is across the street on Grand and Rush, and the Westfield Mall anchored by Nordstrom is a stone's throw away.  I will say the concierge lounge in this location (2nd floor) offers so-so food compared to most other Marriotts.  I love the exercise and weight room behind the pool area (treadmills are in a separate room right beside the elevator bank); equipment is state of the art and I have never found it crowded.  The quality of the rooms is on par with most Marriotts; this location is a little older and shows its age in that regard, but furniture and cleanliness are good.  Wifi is free in the lobby but not in the rooms (unless you're a gold or platinum member).",N

Next cross the street your in the bean park, cool to see and walk around. The ""Hard Rock"" hotel is a cool looking older building with lots of  great looks as of many of the buildings in the area. The staff will help you with bus info. The bus stops are within 100 yds. to all the important bus routes. Also there is a ""Walgreen's"" next door for the stuff you forgot. great place to buy you bus passes, drinks and maps!  P.S. don't move the stuff in the mini bar it has a sensor in it that records the items as removed and bills it to your room! The cleaning staff filled us in on that! Great to know, not for your ""leftovers"". Found a deal on our room for $120.00 plus tax a night. @ Travel-Ticker.

The wedding was beautiful, and the food was much better than I could have hoped for.  The view over Michigan Ave was picturesque. The only things that did not suit me were the patented Westin Scent in the lobby which was like a song stuck in my head, and there was no onsite hotel bar, which is often the best place in a hotel.",N

I highly, highly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to town or anyone having guests come to town. It is absolutely fantastic design-wise. The first time I stayed there I had a corner room with two flat screen tv's and a huge bathroom. The smaller rooms were not as decked out but still amazing. Be sure to check out the alarm clocks that project the time on the ceiling. They have 24 hour room service which is awesome, their mini-bars are incredible (they even have intimacy kits - hilarious) and their James Martini's are AMAZING!!",N
3673,"Well, it is know for being the RItz carlton of Chicago, and had played the host to Diana, Monroe, Sinatra but those were years ago. Saying that you had staryed at the Drake is cool to flaunt to your friends, but at some point where you are at the intersection of classic, chic, prestigous and quality driven, meets old, in need of repair, and dated, you have a slight problem. Chicagos architectural splendor is all around and the Drake still looks cool, but the stay is only for those who are willing to spend money for a name and a Burger, not a quality stay. I would stay at the swiss instead of the Drake. it is still a must see for the city though and when you are coming down into the city and pass the playboy building, its hard to miss.",N
3226,"WONDERFUL HOTEL!! My husband and I arrived in Chicago very early one morning and stopped at our hotel to drop our bags off and then go off and find some place to eat breakfast. To our amazement, Hard Rock let us check in early and grab a quick nap so we could start Chicago out right. The front desk staff were wonderful and let us know about all the food and night life around us. They gave us suggestions almost every day about where to eat and what to do. The rooms were great. The bedding is possibly the softest I have ever felt. I wanted to take the pillows home! But i didn't!! Don't worry. The room was very posh and seemed more expensive than we paid for. I loved the bathroom. Bathrooms are deal breakers in hotels for me. This location is great. You are about a block away from the bean and there are food and bars galore! There are bus stops everywhere but we mostly walked down Michigan avenue to do shopping and sightseeing. I would recommend this hotel to everyone! Usually I like to try out different hotels but we will definitely stay here again during our next trip to Chicago. You don't fix it unless it's broke!",N

4094,"My best friend was celebrating her 25th birthday downtown so we decided to get a room so that we wouldn't have to drive around. Just as other reviewers said, we booked with hotwire/priceline and were given this hotel. We had actually stayed here in the past for NYE and enjoyed it so we figured this would be a good experience, boy were we wrong! First of all, this place is huge, there are two different wings and it can become frustrating if you hop on the wrong elevator to get to your room (you'll end up on the opposite side of the hotel). The lobby is kind of corny but it's cute and I can guess its for tourists. The rooms are decent, nothing to run home about and definitely not 5 star material. We went to check in and were told that there was a 100 dollar authorization charge (never heard of 100, usually its 50...but whatever), we gladly paid and went to our room. We got to the room and everything was fine until I noticed we didnt have any cups/ glasses. So we called for them and they didnt come, we called back and they sent them up (30 minutes later). We went out that night, came back into the hotel and literally as SOON as we got off the hotel a male security guard began following behind us. I became alarmed because I did not see any Hyatt branding on his clothing but he was holding a walkie talkie....anyway he began to ask us if we were guests at the hotel and we told him yes. He then demanded to know what room we were staying in, I didnt tell him and continued to yell at us and follow us to our room. When he saw that we had keys, he walked away. I was highly upset and decided to place a call to the front desk to complain, the gentleman on the phone told me it was procedure for their guards to do that. I told him there was no way in hell that was procedure and demanded to talk to his boss. The boss got on the phone and immediately apologized, he said that was NOT procedure and that it should not have happened. He then offered us two breakfast and lunch vouchers and made the security guard come upstairs and apologize. overall this hotel is average...but their customer service sucks...I will NEVER stay here again...EVER!",N
816,"My Husband and l couldn't find a baby sitter to watch our toddler on Valentines day 2009 and so we decided to have early dinner with our son.The only places we were looking at going were Hotel restaurants because we knew they would be family friendly and so we were glad to have a reservation at the Westin hotel, it had a nice location, not crowded at 4.30pm,we were happy when we arrived.However,all that changed when our waitress arrived.Oh my God, talk about taking away the joy of Valentines,She never smiled, she aggressively asked for our lds when we asked for our drinks,it was not the fact that she asked for it,it was HOW she asked, you would think she was a cop.She brought my steak well-done after l specifically requested for it to be medium rare.Our Whole dinner was ruined, it was such a beautiful restaurant and this silly woman had to ruin it with her negative energy. l reckon you must have a heart of stone not to respond to my sons smile or very bubbly personality and she did not once for the entire dinner say anything friendly to him,even though l could see her being friendly and smiley to another couple at another table not too far from ours! l did not think it necessary to complain.Personally, l would never be back. All that negative energy, unfortunately, took away from the lovely gesture of the restaurant giving out Valentine roses to everyone and the smiley faces of the other waitresses and staff of this place.If only we had a normal waitress,everything would have been perfect!",N
4241,"Check in was a nightmare and so was check out. They also ""misplaced my car"" it was eventually located after a half hour and then tried to charge me double. Along with attempting to charge me for everything in the mini fridge. I guess if you bump it or something you get charged. I got all that removed but still.",N
1110,"Had a great stay at the Fairmont! Hotel was spotless. Reservations desk was friendly and very prompt. Room was clean, airy and bright with great views of a park and the lake. Towels were fresh, bed and pillows were plush. Bathroom had a wonderful rain shower. Walking distance to Millennium Park, Macys and all the other downtown spots.",N
3297,"I'd definitely stay here again. They've got a great restaurant in the building, nicely decorated rooms and a convenient location. My only complaint was the music options in the room. You would think the hard rock hotel would at least have some way to play your iPod in the room. But no. They did have a 6 disc CD changer and Sony receiver, but unfortunately I didn't bring my CD collection with me to the hotel. Come on guys, its 2009, the least you could do is offer up one of those clock radios that has a dock for an ipod. It's a minor complaint, but I'd really expect a hotel who's theme is music to not be stuck in the 1990s. Next time I guess I'll bring a few Pixies and Dinosaur Jr CDs so I can at least use their equipment...",N
4227,"All right.  Me, I usually can be found staying in budget class hotels, like Super 8,  Red Roof Inn, and places such as that.  But this place changed my outlook on everything.  Now when I'm stuck at the Budgetel, I long for a place like this.  I stayed here after a north side pub crawl.   The room was fabulous in itself, with comfortable furniture, dark colored upholstery (but not depressing), mini-bar (I do have to admit- I had to have myself a Jagerbomb.  I just wanted to know if the $12 airline-style bottle of Jager was any different than the regular bar variety!) data-port, big comfy beds complete with lots of pillows!  To me that was heavenly.  Not to mention the in-room coffee maker complete with Gevalia coffees (Double-yum!).  So to someone who is usually budget conscious, this was heaven!  The next morning, we went downstairs to the breakfast buffet, and I was even more impressed.  The custom-made omelet I had was off the charts (Swiss cheese and Portabella mushroom!)   and the strawberry kiwi smoothie I had accompanying it was good as well.  The only problem I encountered during my stay was upon check in; they seemed to have lost our reservations.  So the process to get checked in took a bit longer than normal.  But the staff was very friendly and apologetic about the whole situation, which made the wait bearable.  If I ever need to stay the night downtown again, this is my spot!",N
167,"Great location for a cozy hotel at a fraction of the price of the hotels within a block or two. Older, smaller rooms, but I liked it and I appreciated the delightful people who work the front desk...when looking to visit Chicago or for a ""staycation"" for those in the suburbs over a special weekend for shopping or downtown sights.",N
2340,"Gorgeous property.  Magnificent lobby.  Great rooms.  Free breakfast downstairs at the restaurant for higher status members.  Great concierge food.  Right next to the mall.  Walking distance to everything.  Only annoyance I've found is that bath tubs are slow drains, meaning 30 sec after turning on the water your feet will be under water.",N
4016,"My favorite hotel in Chicago, hands down! And not just because of the Big Bar... I'm going to go ahead and not take a star off for the room next to me in which two very... aggressive... individuals decided to... how do I say this... what's that song? ""Do it like they do on the discovery channel?"" Yeah. All night long. FML. They're also heavy smokers and I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to do that here. This morning I woke up to the sounds of them throwing up -- not even kidding. But that's not the hotel's fault. What I love most about the Hyatt Regency is that much like the city it's in, it's so busy all the time. This has to be one of the busiest hotels I've seen and I love the energy, plus the people watching is superb. As I mentioned before, a trip to the Big Bar where you can pick up an oversized drink, is definitely in order. There's also a Starbucks in the lobby which is more than convenient. The room service is prompt and comes along with a great menu... this morning I had the ""green and white eggs"" which comes with kale, avocado, and sprouts... they have certain things designated healthier than others which I'm always a fan of. The Hyatt also has a late night menu that runs I believe until 6am, for those of you who party your pants off in Chicago. I love the energy of the Hyatt Regency, and when I told the guy at the front desk I was from St. Louis and our Cards just took game 6, he upgraded me to a king size room with a gorgeous view. Highly recommended for a downtown Chicago hotel!",N
2339,"I stayed at the Marriott this weekend because I had friends in town and I wanted to stay downtown.  The hotel was pretty nice but the rooms are tiny (although gorgeous view).  The bathroom was barely big enough to turn around in.  I was a little disappointed with the room itself, but the service was really good - extra towels in less than 10 minutes, the concierge was nice and fast and the front desk staff was helpful.  If you're looking for a hotel downtown this one is definitely worth a try - I would stay here again, but I would think twice before stuffing 4 people in a room.",N
3864,"The standard rooms are small but make efficient use of space.  The modern decor compliments the hotel's modern design and materials.  Despite much glass, cement, and metal, it still feels very intimate and warm.  However, if you are easily awakened, bring some sort of white-noise device, as we were constantly disturbed by car alarms and sirens a full 20 stories below.  My only complaint was the bellman tried scaring me into using the hotel's overnight valet service for $38 by saying I'd be towed if I parked overnight on Erie Street.  Minutes later, I asked a parking enforcement officer, who informed me that overnight parking was legal and free, but that I'd need to begin paying again at 8:00 a.m.   Despite that, I'd definitely go back.  The location is great, and the hotel is very unique.",N
4459,"The location of this hotel is great if you want to be in the heart of downtown Chicago!  It's close to pretty much everything! We also got a great deal, a single king-sized bed room for $89/night.  The hotel itself, was gorgeous-the lobby ceiling was breath-taking! The one con with the hotel was that the room was TINY.  It's the smallest hotel room I've ever been in!  But I guess being in the City, you're not going to spending much time in the room anyways.",N
1895,"I recently spent two nights at the City Center W and had a fine, but not overwhelmingly positive, experience. As other reviewers have mentioned, W hotels try to cultivate a ""club like"" feel. The purple lights and throbbing techno music don't do a whole lot for me, so I'm thankful that they're restricted to the first floor and the elevators. The room my partner and I stayed in was small but adequately furnished with sleek, modern furniture in neutral colors. There was a king sized bed, desk, chair, a few cabinets, and plenty of conveniently placed outlets for cellphone chargers, laptops, etc. Because we were placed in a corner room, the placement of our television was a bit awkward (it's my understanding that most of the rooms have the television positioned on a wall facing the bed, but our bed faced an exterior wall with windows and the television was mounted off to the side -- had we actually been using the television, this might have posed an issue.) The bathroom was adequately stocked with plush towels and Bliss brand toiletries. My only complaint is that the sink was borderline miniature. It seemed like no matter how careful I was when I brushed my teeth or washed my hands, I always ended up having to grab a hand towel and mop some water up off the floor. The hotel is located near stops for both the red and blue L lines, which was perfect for my partner and I. We utilized the L in favor of cabs throughout our stay and were able to get to the majority of our destinations via the red line (which conveniently runs all night.) The staff was friendly and efficient, willing to offer directions and dining recommendations. I used the ""Whatever/Whenever"" service once to request foam pillows instead of down (allergies!) and considering that I called well after midnight, they arrived promptly. My one real complaint (aside from the tiny bathroom sink) is that the in-room wireless is not complimentary. There is complimentary wireless in the lobby area, but the club decor/music in the lobby doesn't exactly facilitate a good working environment. So, if you need to keep up on your work e-mail and are without a smart phone, you'll likely have to shell out for in-room wireless.",N
3122,"Ugh. I will never stay at this hotel again. I am the one who picked the W in the first place, so I'll take the blame. It looks so plush and stylish in the photos. The first thing we noticed when walking in (besides Billy Zane getting into a limo... now I know it was an omen) was a club atmosphere in the lobby. There were lots of martini drinkers sitting around in sunglasses... The receptionists were too trendy for their own good, and I suspect that the one on the right was faking his English accent. (Oh yeah, they actually tell you to ""take the lift"" here...) In my opinion, it always is a mistake for a hotel staff to come off as condescending, and here, they definitely did. (There are plenty of high-end hotels who operate with friendliness.) We reserved a room with two queen beds, since my sister-in-law was joining us for a couple of days. We got off the elevator (which was scented, a nice touch) and, despite it being full daylight outside, were plunged into club-style darkness. The halls are very dark, with colored lights to guide your walk. When we opened our door, a lot of light was coming in from the big window. (We were on the west side of the hotel, so we had a crappy view of the building next door.) Ambient club music was playing from the small CD alarm clock, and the room looked really clean. Another look, and I realized there were Ws on everything... everything. My God, the room was one big marketing campaign and attempt to sell merchandise (including a $22 bottle of water that had been picked up and passed over so many times the logo had worn off). It was highly annoying to me. I started obsessing about finding everything that was W-branded -- and my finds included a teddy bear, the CD of music playing when we came in, coffee mugs, t-shirts -- and started seeing a lot of wear-and-tear on the room and furniture. Actually, it reminded me a lot of Design on a Dime... like it might look good to last through the photo/filming session, then all the cheap Scandinavian-style laminate furniture and other cost-cutting features start to fall apart and reveal the hotel for what it really is: the illusion of luxury and exclusivity. The most annoying thing, though, was the ""divider"" (yes, I said divider) between the bathroom and rest of the room. There was no solid, latching door, just a woven sliding panel that made comfortable privacy impossible. To boot, the panel in our room was BROKEN, so there was a hole in it. Also, there is a shuttered pass-through between the bathroom and bed area that doesn't fully close off any view or sound. I understand the concept (you can be in bed AND watch your lover take a shower... although the shower curtain was opaque, so I'm not sure what else you could watch), but when a room has two beds, there should be some consideration that lovers might not constitute a full party staying in a room. Not be be crass, but... there's this book called Everyone Poops. I think the W got confused and thought it was called Everyone Needs to Know When Everyone Poops. I give two stars for the beds being comfortable and room service (when requesting towels) being very prompt. Plus, we didn't get robbed... except for our dignity.",N
4369,"I would live here if I could..okay, maybe not... but Palmer House Hilton has been the venue for a number of conventions and events I've attended and every time I'm here, I never want to leave!   This hotel is classy and worldly.  Not pretentious classy, more sophisticated, aesthetically pleasing and I feel like I'm on vacation in early 20th century Europe.   I just love the majestic ambiance of the entire hotel- the ballrooms, conference centers, and lounges are beautifully classic! The facilities are gorgeous (and squeaky clean).   I was here one week for a work convention, and the next weekend for the White Sox fest.   My every experience here is magical, no matter what the occasion is! My imagination has a lot of fun here, which it doesn't get enough of as an adult:)",N
4684,"One of my most favorite hotels...in the country. Have stayed here twice: 2009 and 2011. Fun, eco-friendly boutique hotel in downtown Chicago (great location walking distance from Mag mile) with a stylish looking lobby and bar area. The beds are so comfortable. Modern decor, nice amenities such as a spa but old city charm. Of course, quite clean. The staff are quite helpful and nice, hotel is not too big. Feels comfortable and not over the top like the chain hotels. AND, it's affordable! Call for the best deals or look online for specials. Highly recommend.",N
4711,"Although hotel Felix is certainly not the worst place to stay, I would say that ""upscale and luxury"" (as stated on their website) is a relative term. We stayed there last November and I'd say that $200+/night was too much. If you can get a discount it would be Ok place to stay. The rooms are very small and definitely meant for 1 person; for 2 persons it is a stretch. Closet space is tiny even for 1 person (it may be Ok if you travel without luggage or planning to stay just for one night). Admittedly, it is a very well kept place (probably in part due to the fact that it was just recently renovated). The shower is huge especially in comparison to the room size, but the bathroom sink has the weirdest design I ever saw. It is so shallow that it's difficult to wash your hands. Internet connection is painfully slow. The elevator's capacity is not enough for the amount wanting to use them. On the bright side, hotel staff is very friendly and attentive, but every once in a while it seems that they simply get overwhelmed and line to check in/check out can be quite sizible. The restaurant (Elate) is exceptional. We ate breakfast and lunch there on 2 separate days and the quality and taste of our fare was amazing. I would definitely recommend to try it. Location is good and fairly central, so you can either walk a take a short cab ride to downtown. Overall, it was Ok experience.",N
884,"I stayed in the Burnham while I was in Chicago for a conference. It's a small, boutique hotel owned by the great chain Kimpton. All the Kimpton hotels I've stayed at have been lovely and the Burnham is no exception. Rooms are decent sized for such a small hotel. I happened to get the handicap accessible room so my bathroom was oversized (NICE!). Good water pressure and and nice toiletries. Big flat screen TV and a mini-bar. Towels and linens were good quality and the bed was very comfortable. My room faced the street and you could definitely hear the city sounds so if you don't like honking and such, ask for an interior room. But interior rooms have no view and I was able to watch the city speed by, which I like. There is a restaurant attached and while I didn't eat there, I did get a glass of wine both nights. The menu looks very nice. There is also a nice manager's happy hour in the evening if you would like a glass of wine. I would recommend the Burnham highly. It was in close proximity and walking distance of the river, Miracle Mile, and Millenium Park and museums. A great location!",N
1943,"I stayed here a few nights while working on a project.  In fairness to this hotel property - I suppose it was true to itself, but it just wasn't me.  I just couldn't get comfortable.  If you like clean line architecture, modern decor and darkness with smatterings of artificial light - this place might feel like home for you.  However, it wasn't just this that I didn't like so much  - it was number of things, one being the uselessness of the room set-up.  The rooms were clinically beautiful, but the Plasma TV was at such an angle that when you pulled it out to watch from bed, the remote sensor was covered by the molding, rendering the remote useless.   Also, I went to retrieve ice from one of the ice-rooms and my key wouldn't work, so I called down to the staff and they stated that every floor's ice room had that issue (they offered to promptly bring me ice).  But I just couldn't help but wonder - every ice room on each floor wasn't functioning?  Really?  I also didn't like the fact that there wasn't a terrace or any place I could ""go-outside"" and maybe read a little bit.  The property was very constricted and cold.     This isn't about the staff - honestly - they were insanely helpful and courteous.  I just don't get the purpose/model of the hotel.  It reminded me of going to a pretentious French fusion restaurant where the entrees are big on pretty and small on taste.  A little confused I guess.  I've been to other W's and they were very nice.  This may be an anomaly, but I think I'll check out the other hotels in the area.",N
3462,"Hotel with Style and Impeccable Service. I'm staying three nights here and it is one of the best hotel experiences I've had (even compared to Four Seasons & the Ritz).  The hotel is a bit smaller than the chain hotels, but has oh so much more style and glamour! It blends hip and history all into one-- what a unique boutique hotel should be! The service is excellent, from the reservations team to the front desk, to the concierge, housekeeping, waitstaff- you name it.  I'm not going to say that there haven't been minor mistakes- like I had to call twice to change my reservation, etc.  But overall, the attitude is consistently caring, professional, and there is attention to detail everywhere. Main lobby and lounge area are very inviting- nice relaxing space to meet up with friends/colleagues or just surf the net on your laptop.  The rooms are fresh, upbeat, modern, extremely clean, and very quiet.  I was upgraded to a suite (even though I was paying a corporate rate-- nice!) It has a stylish sofa/hideaway bed with a work area and plasma TV.  The bedroom has a large king bed (surprisingly comfortable- NOT hard or hollow like most hotel beds), a beautiful large floor length mirror, make up table, another plasma TV and a bathroom in floor-to-ceiling marble. Downtown Chicago hotels are not cheap-  You may be able to get this between $150 - $209 if you book ahead and stay multiple nights and use corporate or AAA rates.  This is definitely a great value- it really feels like a small luxury hotel without the big name.",N
2564,"Really beautiful place, but the staff is so snobby and the music tends to be poor.  I was also not impressed with the fact that you can't go into certain areas because they're hosting private parties--get a partition or something! I would complain about the cover charge, but just get to know the bouncer and they won't make you pay--enough people pay without complaint, so they can afford it.",N
1519,"Completely new find for me on a recent business trip to Chicago.  On the Chicago River, it has AMAZING views of the river and city at night.  Gorgeous, large rooms, great bathrooms, fantastic decor and a staff that couldn't have been nicer. A fabulous bar inside of the hotel, Hoyt's....not as intimate or cozy as I would have liked, but since I was solo, not as important.  More of a sports bar.  Good calamari. Located on East Wacker, you can get to a lot of really cool places, easily from this location. The modern, warm vibe of the hotel also makes you feel as if you are more important than you really are...:) They let me sleep in til 1:30pm the next day for late check out.  Superb! I'd definitely come back and take in more of the town.",N
2908,"This is the worst Sheraton I've ever stayed at. The staff were horribly rude. I did not feel welcome when I checked in. They don't give upgrades to Gold Starwood members like the other Sheratons - you have to be Platinum. And you have to pay for anything other than the room (i.e. internet, gym, local calls). They charged me for things in the minibar and I didn't eat any of that expensive crap! The housekeeping staff was extremely slow. It took until about 5pm for them to come to clean the room. And get this - they didn't extend the wedding rate for the parents of the bride so that they could stay there an extra night! I will NEVER stay at this hotel ever again unless I can get a room for less than $70.",N
2551,"I was conflicted on rating this establishment ""A-ok"" or ""Meh"". Frankly, it's possible to experience both in one night depending on what happens.  The Victor Hotel was good, the music was lively, there were a barrage of lovely women dressed beautifully and the music almost seemed to compliment their desire to feel gorgeous and enjoy a night of fun.  To this I salute The Victor Hotel and promise that I will return.   Additionally, I had a chance to have a meeting with Carlos Zambrano, I bought him a glass of red wine, I had never expected that he would be a wine drinker but you know ""Qu'il en soit ainsi, ainsi soit-il"".  I digress, this experience too increased my fondness of The Victor Hotel. Conversely, The Victor Hotel tried to put one over on me and maybe it is not the establishment per se, maybe its the management, maybe even the staff.  Whomever it was, I was brought down quickly  from a sense of enjoyment to the bitterness of reality.  Bartenders, in my experience in communications both verbal and nonverbal one intentionally expresses amicability and in the service industry it pays off.  Wrong night.  Bartender was not friendly, she threw drinks at me, and she visibly rolled her eyes at me when she could not hear me over the music.  I am not saying here reaction was targeted at me.  In fact, I think everyone likes me and everyone wants to be my friend.  So, I continued on my way and use this yelp review as a sort of awareness blog.  Check your ego at the door.  Oh and ask for an itemized bill.  The Victor Hotel adds both gratuity and service charge...suspect I know",N

3476,"Ken B. said it best:  ""I give it 5 stars not based on luxury hotel standards, but based on the money I spent per night and damn right, it gets five shiny stars."" We stayed at the Allerton on a holiday weekend and got an amazing deal on Hotwire. (I paid more per night to stay in a dingy motel in Santa Monica, but that is an entirely different review.) I read the Yelp reviews before I came and was bracing for the worst-mainly that I would be sleeping in a closet, but I was pleasantly surprised.  We stayed in the Standard room, which I think is their smallest room. It has a full sized bed, and a tiny bathroom (so two people can't get ready at once) but was otherwise spacious and clean. The fitness center was also well equipped with new treadmills, ellipticals, weights and a TVs on all the equipment. The location is also in the middle of everything. A stay at the Four Seasons it is not, but for the price, it really can't be beat. All in all, I think this is a great boutique hotel that has been renovated quite nicely and I would definitely stay here again. I am taking away one star because of two things: 1) the elevators are the SLOWEST most awful elevators ever. I know this is beyond management's control since it is an old building and they probably had to work with the existing framework, but OH MY GOD. Don't stay here if you anticipate being in a hurry at any point during your stay. Or stay on a floor you can walk up to; 2) the tv channel selection is really limited.",N
3190,"The hotel itself, including the restaurant and top-floor bar were great but I have an overall negative impression of this hotel because of the terrible customer service.  The employees would rather chat with one another than help address my needs.  When my key card stopped working repeatedly, the girl at the front desk actually rolled her eyes at the fact that she had to reset the card again.  When we ordered breakfast up to the room, they brought me a mug for my tea that had dried out coffee at the bottom.  When I called to say they brought me a dirty mug and only decaf tea, they did not return for over 20 minutes when I just had to leave to make it to my meeting on time.  When I called to say not to bother with the replacements, they didn't even apologize for the mistakes or inconvenience. I will never stay at this hotel again.",N
4354,"The only thing I liked about this hotel was the lobby. I went to Chicago for a cousin's wedding and we decided to stay at the palmer house because it is such a historic place. When we first got there we stood in a long line to check in and when I finally got to the receptionist he was not very friendly and freaked out when the reservation was under my moms name and not mine and made my mom come down out of her room to confirm I was telling the truth. Anyway when we got to our room it was rather small. No coffee pot, no fridge, a large old box TV. The room was clean but nothing special. When I was getting ready for the wedding I needed to blow dry my hair and the blow dryer in our room didn't blow hot air so I had to go to my moms room to get a blow dryer. This gets me to my next point: THE ELEVATORS SUCK! Well first off all they put me on the 12th floor and my mom and her husband on the 18th floor. Not necessarily a big deal but the elevators at the palmer house are in three different groups and go to three different groups of floors. What I mean is in the lobby I had to get in the elevators for floors 10-15 and my mom got in elevators for floors 16-20 or something like that. So every time I needed to go to my moms room or vice versa I had to go all the way down to the lobby and then catch the other set of elevators to her floor. HUGE PAIN IN THE ASS! Also because we were there for a wedding, I was supposed to receive a gift bag with snacks and info about the wedding. Well I never got mine and I spent 20 minutes running all over the hotel looking for it with no success. Also at the Palmer house if you need to use a computer or the internet you have to pay a big price. Anyway my mom had to do a reading in the wedding and she lost the piece of paper so I went down to concierge and there were about three of them standing around doing nothing and I asked if they could print this off for me really quick because it was an emergency. They rudely told me to go to the business center and print it off myself. Anyway the service in the lobby SUCKED. However I will say that the cleaning staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Usually when I stay in a hotel just one night I don't need the staff to clean my room so I put the DND sign out. Well we were leaving to go see the sights one morning and the cleaning lady was right there and said oh I was about to clean your room and we said it was fine and then she suggested to give us at least a set of clean towels. VERY NICE CONSIDERATE CLEANING STAFF. Also avoid the restaurant they have in the lobby. The Lockwood I think. Horrible experience. See my next review. But I probably won't be staying at the Palmer House Again. There are many much nicer hotels in Chicago that offer fantastic customer service. And I only gave them two starts because the lobby is beautiful and the housekeeping staff rocks!",N
752,"Great location..right across the street from a funky looking Cheesecake Factory.   Parking: Overpriced..try parking elsewhere or don't bother renting a car if you're staying in the central vicinity.  When it's nice outside, the walk around that area is nice. Rooms: Bed are comfy but I agree with other yelpers that they need some refurbishing.  Could be more updated for the price you pay.  Friendly staff and front desk.  Concierge gave us some passes for local nightlife around the area and the suggested places were fun.  Although the crowd was a bit random, I would still go back. Location: Prime location with lots of things nearby and local transportation.  Near many of the shops and a quick 15 minute walk to Garrett's Popcorn.  What can I say...a definitely PLUS!",N
2068,"Typically you get a crappy room when you check-in after midnight but we somehow lucked out.  Yvonne checked us in and when she slided the room key over to us, she said that we were really going to enjoy the room.  That can be ominous coming from a complete stranger.  Hmm. If you can at all, request a river view.  Or room #1612.  It is a corner room that is more like a suite in terms of size.  The major attraction is the view of the Chicago River- you get both the east-west and the north-south branch, plus the gorgeous 333 Wacker Building across the water, the L trains, Merchandise Mart, boats and the many bridges.  The furnishings are ok, the bathroom not updated, but who cares when you get this much space and an amazing view! Can't comment on the food served here.  There are plenty of options close by (not so much for a sit-down breakfast) or you can get chain-restaurant food court next door in the Merchandise Mart.   Or hop on the L and get out of River North for a spell.",N
4914,"Not very impressed...The rooms are extremely tiny and poorly designed. Couldn't open the closet all the way because the TV stand was in the way. The bathroom was super small and did not have a built in fan. The entire place had a upscale/elegant look to it (which I understand due to its age), but with closer inspection the construction was poor. The trim and paint was chipping and uneven, the carpeting and wallpaper was old and needed updating. The walls were very thin and you could hear EVERYTHING going on in the rooms next to you and in the hallway. The worst part of the stay was the service of the staff, which wasn't bad but I expected a lot more from this supposedly high end Chicago hotel. The staff wasn't rude or anything but seemed to have no emotions at all. A smile and hello goes a long way. A positive was the lake view my room had, facing Lake Michigan. Usually when I stay downtown the room is facing a brick wall or another window.",Y
1524,"4.5 I was pretty concerned about my stay after reading unfavorable reviews, but our stay was surprisingly very pleasant! We took advantage of the Groupon offer ($110 a night for a standard 2-queen bed room). The service was fast AND friendly. The location was amazing. The room was HUGEE (for comparison, it was about the same size or even slightly bigger than our 1 bedroom suite at the Intercontinental Chicago). The furnishing was relatively nice too, MUCH better than I anticipated (no ugly yellow checker-board pattern to my delight!) The only minus that prevents this from getting a 5 star is the horribly worn out bathroom. Our room was pleasant, but our bathroom was not. It's extremely old and worn out. Pro: VERY spacious room. You would not find a room this big ANYWHERE in Chicago for this price point. Con: Furnishing may not be up-to-par with other boutique hotels, but I personally think that the very spacious room easily makes up for that. It really comes down to decor VS. space. You could either choose another boutique hotel with amazing decor but small space or Hotel 71 with lots of space and a nice, but not amazing, decor.",N
3812,"I stayed at Dana for Valentines Day and loved it. I'm definitely going to make excuses to go back. The hotel is very romantic and modern. Beautiful views, comfortable beds, even the blow dryer was the best. We stayed in a standard king. The shower was my favorite thing about the room - having the option to see in to the room (or for someone to see you in the shower) was sexy.  Having an amazing restaurant in the hotel and lounge on the top floor was very convenient. We received breakfast with the room and it was the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had with complimentary Bloody Marys. The only thing is, you may want to close your shades. I think the residents who live in the condos across the street could write a book on what they see. Floor to ceilings for them and for the hotel rooms probably makes for some funny stories. As I was in bed watching TV I looked over and saw the guy across the street doing the same thing plus a glare in his windows showing the guy in the hotel room under me walking around in his tighty whities. I wouldn't penalize the hotel for that though, if it makes you uncomfortable you have great dark shades - I thought it was still dark out when I woke up. Very nice.",N
5304,"A great lil' boutique-style place to stay in Chicago - terrific and personalized service from a genuinely nice staff (they printed out our schooner tickets for us at the front desk), and a great restaurant, the Atwood Cafe, with an amazing bartender (Ray) and a first-rate executive chef (Derek Simcik), really made this a place that we were tempted not to leave at all!  In the end, we did wind up going out, though, since the hotel is within walking distance of attractions like Millennium Park, the Theater District (got 11th-hour tickets to Alison Krauss's only show at the the Chicago Theater totally by accident - we only knew she was there because we could read the marquee from our room!), and the Chicago Institute of Art (with its amazing new wing). Definitely worth checking out!",Y
2478,"Going to the Internet Retailer 2010 at the last minute and this was the only hotel left available with shuttle services.  First of all, from reading other reviews, now I know I got ripped @ $249 a night when Priceline folks are sniping these rooms for $79 (albiet, I got free wifi). The hotel is nice; but it can only get so nice for an oldie...no matter how much money you dump into it.  Shower head was really low (I'm 6'1""), water pressure was low.   It is in a decent part of town with a hype bar close by (check out reviews on Yelp!) For some off reason I ended up with two double beds (they asked me a few times if I was traveling alone). If traveling here: 1 - make sure you get a better deal than I did 2 - confirm your exact needs with reservation over the phone and in person 3 - Don't have super high hopes My room was neither up to par as a business class (although the 22nd floor is called the executive floor) nor was it a good fit for the romantic couple...it wasnt even spacious enough for those last minute get awayers (sp?) trying to save money.",N
1249,Food here is ok... Spent thanksgiving here... For the price of $29 a person... I really could have eaten somewhere else and payed a lol more for the quality being served... However service was top rate... People working here were super friendly and attentive!,N
987,"1. IF YOU'RE HERE ON BUSINESS, IT'S OK.   2. IF YOU'RE HERE FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN BUSINESS, MEH. Sorry for the caps, I just wanted to make it clear that this place can serve a purpose, but it shouldn't be your first choice for a nice stay with the Mr./Mrs. Good:  The staff is friendly, no problems there.  Rooms are spacious and clean.  90 min. freek cocktail time on weekdays is cool.  The beds are super comfy. Bad: The nicest part of the hotel is the lobby.  The rooms are way overpriced for what you get, a glorified Holiday Inn with a terribly-obstructed view.  There's no room service, they partner with Harry Caray's across the street till about 11pm and I hate Harry Caray's.  It costs $44 to park/valet your car here!  Park your own car at one of the self parks next to the hotel, trust me. All in all, not a horrible place, but you can do way better.  I recommend Hotel Sax a block south of this place if you're trying a romantic weekend/night.",N
4801,"I will never go back to Roof at the Wit Hotel... what a horrible experience there today 01/01/11... The service sucks and people that work there were very unprofessional &   extremely rude! They think that walking around patrolling the bar with their little secret service ear pieces make them feel more powerful, They are wrong about that, this give them a sense of power that they DO NOT have! We had been with some people that had been staying in the hotel that weekend. We had been ordering drinks and having an OK time, I then wanted to suggest a couple songs from the DJ ""Trentino"" AKA the Midget! who sucked By The Way! And then we had been quickly confronted by one of the security personal that obviously had napoleon complex and a power struggle complex, because he swiftly told me that I was not allowed near the DJ booth and he then proceeded to stand in front of me trying to be a jerk, He and the other security officers had starred me down and then shortly after this ordeal we had been taking pictures of our party and the security asked us why we had been taking so many pictures, like its a crime! And why we had been taking pictures of the security, like that's a crime as well! Then they gave us our check and proceeded to escort us out and that's when one of our party members wanted to know after we had spent a good deal of time there and lots of money why they thought that we should leave??? The security then became very aggressive and physical with one of the people in our party. This escalated to the security getting aggressive and then they physically started to push our friend who was staying at the hotel out of the bar, then after they had him in the hallway by the elevator 2 more security officers joined in the physical activity and proceeded to physically assault our friend which ended up physically harming our friend. They said that he was going to go to jail but they released him from their custody shortly after they had held him. The only thing that is worth any thing at the wit it is the cool city view... won't recommend to anyone to go!!! So save your money and go to all the best places our Chicago has to offer!",Y
484,"I stayed here for 3 nights and while it's not the best hotel I've stayed at downtown, it has some perks. 1) Free breakfast. And I mean a full breakfast, including cooked to order items. I didn't take advantage of that, but they had pancakes, bacon, eggs, pastries, breads, etc. It can get really busy so it might be difficult to find a table at times. 2) Big rooms. It was very nice to have a separate living room and a bedroom with a door on it. The rooms also had a mini fridge and microwave. 3) Super comfy beds. I mean seriously, they were awesome. 4) Convenient location. 5) Fast elevators. This can be a challenge at some hotels, but the wait was never long here. I definitely wouldn't pay full price for these rooms, but if you get a good rate it's a nice place to stay. If you're looking for luxurious, go someplace else.",N
3642,"I'm always a little nervous when I book a hotel through Hotwire, not knowing what you're going to get. On top of that, I don't know the area well since I'm not from Chicago. I got really lucky, getting into The Drake Hotel for only $139 per night in November. The service was excellent, room was fantastic, and very comfortable bed. The location was great. We walked everywhere. Minutes from all the shopping. The only downside was the gym. Not that I would have used it much, but it would have been nice if they had a pool or gym that was complementary to guests. Instead, you had to pay $10 to use the one in the hotel or a little bit more for a club across the street.",N
3034,"Wow....We have been very pleasantly surprised by the W here in Chicago!  Been here the last few days to catch a Cubbies game and are glad we stayed at the W.  When we walked in this last Thursday night I had a flashback to walking into the first W in NYC on Lex in the late nineties!!  The place was just buzzing!  Music playing, people everywhere, a total scene.  The Staff is EXCELLENT...I have a problem dealing with brain dead hotel people.  The staff here actually appear to enjoy their jobs which reflects in how they treat their guests.  The rooms are quite nice!  LCD TVs, large comfy beds and a very nice view of the lake!  We will definitely be checking back in next time we're in Chicago!!",N
4555,"3.5-The Palmer House will not disappoint you in the realm of aesthetics.  The Palmer House has a beautifully painted ceiling that was restored by one of the same artists that restored the Sistine Chapel ceiling.  The light fixtures and the ambiance is incredible.  You will see bellhops and a few stores in the hotel (including Starbucks).   The negatives go with the rooms mainly.  The room that I stayed in was a little small, and it had a smoke smell even though it was supposed to be non-smoking.  In addition, the bathroom and decor did not look very well kept.   For the price that you pay to stay at this hotel, more amenities should be included in the price.  You will have to pay for wi-fi and the business center. The location of the hotel is convenient.  You can walk to shops and to the Millenium Park to see the Cloud Gate (o.k. no one calls it that...aka the 'silver bean').  I gave it a 3.5 due to these factors.",N
3596,"I still love this hotel and am excited to see what it will be like after the renovations. My guy likes to stay at the Drake when in town. The executive suites are fantastic - they are spacious and have TWO closets. Ask for one of the rooms with over-sized marble bathrooms. The words over-sized and marble, when put together, make me incredibly happy. The chandeliers in the lobby and extravagant floral arrangements also make me incredibly happy. Also, who can complain when you have Chanel in the same building?",N
2316,Airline boarding pass kiosk in lobby. Express checkout is through speed dial and TV menu. If you call for late check out there's a fee.  No wifi in room.  The front desk can cash checks or change currency.   There's a business center and baggage storage.  If you smoke in the room they charge $250.  Same day dry cleaning if you submit it before 9:00 am.  They will refer a babysitter if given a day's notice.  Wired-for-business Internet is $14.95 per day.   24 hour Fitness Center on the 9th floor   Concierge can send mail through DHL and UPS.  Ice machine on every floor. They'll leave you a voicemail at the room if you receive a package.  You can hear the club lounge from the elevator.,N

3636,"This hotel offers possibly the best experience in Chicago!  The staff here treat you as a foreign dignitary and are always offering to help.  I've only stayed here twice, but I go to the high tea every time I'm in Chicago.  The hotel has a fantastic location.   The hotel rooms are very both sumptuous and comfortable.  Some of the rooms have wonderful views of Lake Michigan and Michigan Avenue. The high tea is great, and should be on everyone's list when they visit Chicago.  It is an experience which will not be regretted!",N
3359,"Pros: the location is stellar (right on Michigan Ave, by Grant Park & Millennium Park, and an easy walk downtown), beds are uber-comfy, rooms are clean, staff is very friendly, and they have a big pool & exercise room Cons: the initial price is pretty cheap for a downtown hotel (we paid $80/night), but the additional fees were kind of bogus -- $36 for mandatory valet per day/night, and an additional fee for holding our bags past check out time (I've never been charged for this before at any of my previous hotel stays).. after tacking those on, the ""low"" price wasn't as big of a draw Overall: I'd definitely stay here again for comfort & convenience, though I'd look around for cheaper prices",N
3809,"Back in November I checked out the Spa with girlfriends who all agreed we could use facials.  Admittedly, I'm a huge Spa snob, and my favorites are either the Peninsula or The Four Seasons.   The service was not the most professional as the esthetician kept taking her hands off my face and then harshly re-starting the facial with cold product.  Normally they keep a hand on your face during almost the entire facial to avoid the jumping reaction that happens when they touch you again.  But the most disturbing part was the women going to extractions with her fingers rather than a tool.  Ewww! Perhaps massages here are better, but I would definitely NOT recommend this place for facials.  Yuck!!",N
2916,"The hotel bar had one of the best dirty martini's I've ever had. Now with that being said the Sheraton was in a great location and my friends and I had a great time :). We didn't spend much time in the room, but from what we did everything was enjoyable.",N
4177,"First of all, I've been in the hotel for an event and I thought it was well run and the staff was very nice.  This past weekend my friends stayed here while visiting for New Year's Eve.  I thought the room was a little small but decent enough, and again the staff was fine.  However, the hotel was having a huge NYE party and made all the guests wear wristbands.  That's fine, but no visitors were allowed without purchasing wristbands for an extra $25 and this information was not given to my friends before making the reservation.  The upstairs bar was also way understaffed way too close to midnight.",N
39,"40 minutes to check in ... Drafty windows which made the room damp on a very rainy day and the heat is shut off in the summer (It was 57 last night) The sink stopper was broken, the shower backed up. The elevator makes you feel as if you are being buried alive (if it is working) otherwise, you get to use the service elevator from the kitchen. Which smells awful! All for 300 bucks a night! There was a convention in town and am sure prices were raised accordingly. It's like camping in Goldcoast! Here's the best part - I asked the front desk agent to call me a cab ... She walked me to the front door and whistled and walked back inside ...",N
5505,"Quaintness in the middle of Boystown.   We set my in laws up here when they came for their first visit after I stole their daughter away to the big scary city!  Needed to find someplace that wouldn't make them drag her back to Texas with them.   This is also the closest hotel to our apartment which helped as well.  They absolutely adored it here!  Their room was practically two rooms with lots of space, nice sofa - all the goods.  They loved the patio outside to enjoy their coffee, cigs and morning papers.  The people who worked in here was so incredibly friendly and accommodating.   They've already informed us that this is where they're going to stay the next time they visit.  Hands down.  I think it's because they discovered Ann Sather's across the street though....we kept trying to get them to go somewhere else, but Miz Ann won over every darn morning!",N
2534,"All this place has going for it is that it's clean (and there is a lot to be said for that!) and it is convenient for taking the L.  It is way over priced.  If my company wasn't putting me up there, I would definitely not have stayed!   The lobby is beautiful, but the rooms are drab, dated, and a little creepy.  They are also awkwardly arranged.  I thought it was just me because I had a corner room, but several of my colleagues mentioned it as well.  I had a room with 2 beds.  They were unusually small for hotel rooms (I'm small so it wasn't a big deal, but if you are big and/or like to move around when you sleep you should request a king, otherwise you may roll onto the floor).  Anyway if you get some crazy deal like some of the other reviewers I say go for it.  Otherwise, it's NOT worth the price!  I recommend the Hotel Majestic.",N
4846,"Paid more than $200 per night in this hotel with high expectations and after I had heard so much about it in Yelp. One of the most disappointing stays I have had in such a talked about hotel. I had been told I was getting a room with two queen beds. When I checked in, I was told the room is not available so I was given a king sized bed in supposedly a renovated wing of the hotel. After getting into the room, I found out that it was renovated for sure - the room was still smelling heavily of paint. The bed was a king size roll out bed - yes, you got that right! A roll out bed for $200+ per night. There were no lights on the side of the bed so one had to get up everytime and go the the lights at the corner of the room to switch them on/off. All night, there was periodic slamming noise come out just outside my door after every 30 mins or so. I was too tired to find out and just wanted to get a night's rest. In the morning I figured out, it was the ice machine and all night due to some issue, there was a crashing noise coming from it. I would stay at a Marriott Courtyard anyday, at least I know what I would be getting for a much better rate.",Y
4554,"Dates: February 14-16 Price: $76 a night via priceline (Actually 3.5 stars) This place exceeded my expectations, albet those were low based on the price I paid (chicago in february apparently not all that popular). The star of this place is the lobby, which is really what all hotel lobbys should be. Beautiful high ceiling was old school without being stuffy. Very cool white marble bar set right in the lobby, not pushed off to a secluded corner. Many leather booths with table service for afternoon tea or late night drinks. Location is not great, particularly on the weekends, athough it is 2 blocks from millenium park, and a block from a bunch of train lines. The low light of the trip was the rooms, small, not particularly modern or lush at all. Service wasn't really great, although that rarely bothers me very much. Corner bakery outside is so-so.",N

452,"Shockingly bad service. I booked one of my salesmen for a three night conference here. I booked over the phone for him, and I have the gentlemen at the front desk the salesmen's contact information should the need arise. He briefly told me the times of check-in, but I didn't note them as being anything unusual. Come to find out, check-in here is between the hours of 3pm and 6pm EXPRESSLY. If you don't check in during those times, they lock the doors and their system cancels your reservation. My salesman's flight didn't even get in until 8pm, so color him surprised when he shows up to a darkened porch and a locked door. Jorge, the manager on-site came to open the door after a certain amount of noise was made and let him in begrudgingly. He told him he was late and that they assumed he wasn't coming. They couldn't call to check? To make matters worse, on my salesmans 3rd day, he returned to the hotel to find Jorge waiting for him with bad news. Because he checked in late and his reservation was cancelled, they had double-booked the room. The couple waiting to check-in to his room was currently waiting in the bar. He was given 20 minutes to pack and get out. When he asked Jorge to call him a cab, Jorge told him that cabs don't come to that area and that he would have to walk four blocks to catch a cab or a bus. HONESTLY! My salesman is a better person than I as he handled it with grace, but I am furious over the way he was treated and how the situation was handled. It's a shame too, because the space is gorgeous and we would probably use it again if it weren't for the ludicrous business habits of the staff. Stay away unless you plan to play by their crazy rules and pay their crazy prices.",N
131,"You know, say what you want, but this place is precious. I call it ""the regular man's Four Seasons"" because it's right across from The Four Seasons Chicago which means you can go to the Conservatory at TFS and put on airs if you see fit, then go back to your quaint room at The Whitehall, nobody the wiser.   But honestly, dollar for dollar, I like this hotel better because of the charm. TFS has great service, sure, but the Whitehall is the little train that could, comparatively.  They try harder with less and do better. It's a different hotel.  Nostalgic, quirky, comfortable, neat.  The bar staff in particular rocks my world --- if Poppy is still there then management is damned lucky indeed.   Funny story about the series of shenanigans I encountered at this fine establishment but we won't go into it now, here.  What I'm saying though is maybe I'm sentimental and maybe you wouldn't feel the same if what you're looking for is The Four Seasons or The Pen.   But I've been to both those and many others and quite prefer The Whitehall in the final tally.  When I'm back in Chi, you'll be finding me there.",N
2973,"I am surprised that nobody has mentioned this: the Sheraton Chicago is the stingiest hotel I have ever encountered.  There are lots of hidden fees.  Let me count the ways in which you are charged and taxed for every small item. --there is a continental breakfast available on the 33rd floor.  However, it is only for ""club members"" though this is not made clear to you.  After you sit down with your coffee and bagel, you are given a scrip of paper to sign which states that you will be charged 19 bucks plus 18 percent tip for a continental breakfast.  WTF?  You would much be better served to go across the black to the NBC building, rather than this overpriced bagel shop. --The POOL costs money.  Huh?  a 300 dollar hotel room won't pay for your pool?  This is too cheap for my tastes.  Otherwise it costs 12 bucks a day or 20 bucks for your entire stay to dip in the the not-so-olympic sized pool.  Instead, I took a hot bath.  In my quickie tour I didn't see a spa or a hot tub either. --The restaurants are overpriced.  My girlfriend and I at the ""Chi Bar"" and the drinks were about 12 bucks for a Mojito.  I got a screwdriver with the house vodka for 10 bucks.  Huh?  The drinks at the top of the Hancock Tower, where at least the view is remarkable was only a dollar more per drink.  For a small glass of orange juice and smirnoff vodka 10 bucks just ain't right. --The hotel room itself was tiny tiny tiny.  Evidently our company footed the bill on the room, so we didn't care too much about the 300 dollar price tag, but the room was not very big at all. --the TV gives you about 24 channels.  Ok, whatever, but the annoying thing is that if you turn the tv off then turn it back on, the channel is switched to the continuous Sheraton informercial, which is a peeve. --Another small charge: starbucks coffee cups and a small coffee maker are on the desk next to the bed, far away from the mini bar.  However, these cups of coffee cost 3 bucks a piece.  Is ANYTHING included in the 300 dollar hotel tag?  What will Sheraton do in the future, charge us each time they clean the sheets?  My god. --Another thing: it is cheaper to take a taxis than the hotel shuttle.  Yup, they charge for that as well.  They want you so bad that they charge you 27 bucks each way to ride in a van with uncomfortable seats crowded with other suits.  The van concierge actually told me and my girlfriend to take a taxi, and not their own hotel service, and for that he did us a big favor. To recap: at Sheraton, everything has a price tag, and if you can waste money, then this place will gobble it up.  However, if you want a luxury hotel room, then don't go here.  Your 300 dollars will not give you anything more than a bed to sleep on. So basically, the experience that you get as a customer at this not fine establishment is that they are out to make the quick buck on you, not to provide you with comfort.  Hidden fees and charges are not cool, and a 300 dollar price tag needs to include more than a bed and sheets.  I have been to model 6's with more service.",N
3327,"I was skeptical about this place but I found a good rate on hotwire...and hence...made reservations. Much to my surprise I really liked it. The room was very nice and the staff was very helpful, especially for the affordable rate. The concierge made three restaurant recommendations that all panned out. The bar can get rowdy so if you are not into that, just avoid it. That is what we did. I would stay here again on a repeat visit.  Oh yeah, the location is just perfect.  You are right on Michigan but not in the shopping section.",N
1215,"Let me preface this by saying that we were in town to see U2 at Soldier's Field.  The show was our #1 priority so the hotel was really secondary to the whole experience.  This hotel was the closest we could find to Soldier and it was ""alright.""  Our room was comfortable and clean.  The fitness center is well-equipped and open 24 hours a day which is a really nice feature. The downside: For what you get, this hotel is overpriced.  It's a totally average business-minded hotel.  The lobby is great, but the rest is very very average.  It is not close to public transit, downtown, etc.  Also, the folks working at the front desk are unfriendly and borderline idiots.  They managed to: - eff up our reservation - charge us for our room twice* - waste a lot of our time - almost lose our bags Needless to say next time I am in a similar situation, I'll be staying at the W or the Park Hilton and cabbing.  Way better service and more bang for your buck.   *Also..... to the folks at the McCormick Hyatt: I am still waiting for those charges to come off my card.  You will be hearing from me again.",N
2048,"Got a pretty decent deal on Priceline with ""name your own price"" at the Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza.  The location is fantastic: close to a variety of el trains, the loop, and other neighborhoods and shopping.  The views are beautiful and the bar is a great place to unwind as the sun sets and the city lights come on. However, I've had better experiences at other hotels.  Upon checking in, the front desk continuously tried to up sell me.  It would cost another $20/night to have a room on the outside, that had a view.  We declined, and got a nice room with absolutely no view in the interior corridor of the hotel.  They also claimed there were no rooms with king size beds unless we upgraded.  I'm not sure if they could see the price we paid, but if so, is there a certain price threshold that grants you access to the nicer rooms?  I'd be pretty upset if I paid close to regular price on priceline but still had to pay another $20/night for a nice view. But if you won't be hanging out in your room much, this hotel may be a good bet.  The fitness center and pool were pretty large and were open from 6AM - 11PM.  The bar had a happy hour which included a complimentary buffet of jalapeno poppers, wings and a crudite platter.  The bartenders were friendly and made some excellent cocktails.   The only other minus was since this is on top of a convention center, it is somewhat hard to get to.  You enter the doors, go down a hall, take an elevator to the 9th floor, cross over to the other side of the lobby, and then take an elevator to your floor.  Not the most convenient entry.  Just break up the long trek with a drink at the bar, and it's worth it.",N
1217,"Here is the update on this hotel after my stay this last weekend.  I can really tell they are working hard on their customer service skills...this time was alot better and if I was coming in without the bad experiences, I would probably rate at 4 stars.  The restaurant was open at the time we needed with a buffet that was affordable and kid friendly.  The front desk manager ( I think), Sarah was extremely welcoming and went above and beyond.  This was the biggest improvement of all and I believe the most important.  I still have the unresolved phone issue that is affecting my view but maybe by next year, I can get over that.  All in all, much better this time.  The location is still an inconvenience though.",N
2527,"this beats holiday inn any day!  probably the most bling ive seen at a hotel...ever!  its huge and its no wonder why they hold large conferences here!  the rooms were rather basic, but from our window, you could see the ""married with children"" fountain...and you wont even have to walk far to get to buddy guy's blues bar...its within walking distance and yes, he hangs out there, so you will most like be able to take a picture with him...",N
5740,"The place looks good... but you don't get much for its 5 star price. If you are an easy spender, most likely you won't read this site. This is for the frugal travelers. Been to a few Crowne Plazas over the west coast. There are big space here for conferences. Good for them. But you won't get much here comparing to other Crowne Plaza. No pool and no gym. No mircowave or fridge in the whole building. If you want to heat up your food, you may pay a fee to the independent restaurant in the hotel. There is complimentary gym pass with very vague description even when I ask. I will let you experience this yourself to decide if it's worth the hassle and attitude. So travelers, if it is not for a conference, I won't stay here. There are better hotel out there for the price with more free amenities.",N
3054,"Great views if you get high up. The patrons are a bit douchey for my tastes and didn't have great manners. It is not steps to public transportation, so if you are relying on that vs a cab...well, you are not in luck. Service was the same as any W I go to.",N
1141,"Top-notch service, a spacious (for a big city) and spotless room, great location, a wine bar in the lobby--no complaints here!  Room service was excellent, too.  On the pricier end of the scale, but there are deals to be had if you time things right.",N
5622,"Oh, Westin. How I want to love you. Really. But you don't make it easy.  You don't have connecting rooms (even though that's what we originally booked). Ok, we can deal. But your heavenly beds weren't that heavenly (dare I even say it sloped a little?) and your housekeeper forgot (refused to?) clean the fridge that housed the drinks that was messy before we arrived (and never did get cleaned). And the power outlet or two that didn't work. And the spotty wifi in the room (that still cost $10). So why even 3 stars? Because the rooms are otherwise good and spacious (nice TV, nice showers too), the location is great, the staff was quite friendly and helpful and the downstairs restaurant exceedingly friendly to small-ish kids.  And the room rate was fine. So, it's not a bust. You'll enjoy a stay here. You just won't say ""wow"" when you leave.",N
4643,"Stayed here for a business trip for the first time and was mildly impressed, but not blown away. For a boutique hotel, the Felix meets my expectations of being very simple, clean, and small. I'd go so far to say this place reminds me of ""the poor man's W Hotel."" The standard rooms were uber-small (sub 200 sq ft) and the nice-looking amenities are of cheap quality. Seriously? It seemed like every time I turned in my smallish room, I would: (a) bump into something and (b) break off a plastic component to something... The sink, the desk light, my bed, etc. The gym and business center were also very small. The vastly superior thing about this place was that the service was great during my two day stay-- including a very friendly doorman. Props to that guy!",N
229,"By far the cutest hotel I have ever stayed in.  This is the perfect girl's night out hotel.  I hosted a bachelorette party a while back, and I reserved a few rooms here for all of our out-of-town friends.  I discoverd the hotel while jogging one day, I lived right down the street at the time, so I got the neighborhood discount.  The rooms were set up so perfect for her pre-party/personal shower.  There were plenty of space and seating for all of us.  I came in early and decorated, it looked really nice.  Everything was clean, and comfy.  Our view was pretty cool too, we were nextled amongst the city buildings.  Our out-of-town friends loved it! If I did not live here, I would stay here everytime I was in Chicago.  The lounge in the lobby is perfect for cocktails, and the ambiance is amazing. P.S. The pictures shown for this hotel are NOT of my group of friends.",N
5605,"Another fine Westin property.  I especially enjoyed drinks at the bar where the bartenders surely found my group to be a bit boisterous...my girls from South Carolina and Georgia can be a bit out of hand.  I stayed here 3 years in a row during the RSNA conference that takes over Chicago right after Thanksgiving.   The bar is reminiscent of the previous property style of the Nikko, Japanese and serene. A decent sushi bar when you don't want to head out into the cold Chicago winterness.   The rooms are nice, I would definitely ask to be on the river side for a nice view.  I love when it snows and to watch it cover the city in a soft white blanket from your cozy hotel room...that is the best! This hotel is within walking distance of several fine restaurants, shopping, and the theatre district.  Great location, since its not on Michigan Avenue, it doesn't have the crowds making noise outside your windows.  Harry Caray's right across the street, House of Blues and a decent Thai place on Clark.",N
1842,"I like to stay at W Hotels because I get Starwood points and use them in Europe or NYC. I stayed at the W Chicago for 3 days, and it was only memorable in how painful it was to stay there! Upon checkin, there was a line a mile long in the hotel to the point that the bar was taking drink orders from guests waiting to check in. Not free drinks for our trouble, but we had to pay and still wait! Then, we had made arrangements to receive a very important package at the hotel. When I checked in, they told me it was in security, and when I asked them to retrieve it, it was nowhere to be found. This carried on for 8 hours, until 1am when it finally appeared. Pretty annoying. The customer focus at this hotel is completely lacking. I asked to have the package shipped after we checked out, and I told them, no rush I don't need it sent overnight. I arrive home the next day and lo and behold the FedEx guy is at the door - and I've been charged for overnight service. Ever get the feeling people don't listen! Sorry - hip doesn't cut it.",N
3858,"My wife and I just stayed here for our honeymoon and we had a wonderful time. We weren't used to staying in such a swank, chic place, but it was totally worth it. The location is great - just a mile or so north of the Loop - and it's conveniently located near a Whole Foods and Starbucks. Our room was moderately sized, but the bed was huge and comfortable. The shower was amazing - maybe the best one I've ever used. If you like ergonomic, eco-friendly hotels and rooms then this is the place for you. The food was also exceptional. We got $20 off our breakfasts for two consecutive mornings and the food was great. The portions were huge and absolutely tasty. Try the chocolate chip pancakes and the Dana Breakfast (their fried potatoes were magical, like pixie dust was added to them or something :).",N
2061,"Decent hotel, cool view. Beware if you book through Expedia! While we got a room super cheap, it was also next to the RIDICULOUSLY noisy service elevator. I cant tell you what it sounded like except I was dreaming there were dinosaurs and elephants in the room.",N
1767,"Nice hotel with a boutique feel to it. The daily wine and cheese ""complementary"" happy hour is a great pre-party spot. Only downside is that it's in a business area, so nothing around it stays open late including starbucks.",N
298,"It's an old building. Noisy radiator heat, and one thing that bugged me, is that the dorrs are stiff and don't auto-close. I came back to my room multiple times to find it OPEN. Not cool. It's discrete but I'm not sure it'd be a good place to hook, as it may leave several clients feeling exposed. You must walk down a very long hallway to the reception desk.",N
4041,"We stayed here this past weekend for 2 nights, and I must say, it's some of the best rest I've gotten in a hotel bed ever. The beds, pillows and comforters were so comfy! Had drinks in the Bar 151 inside, and also the ""Big Bar"" - nothing like paying $6.50 for a domestic bottle beer and $11 for a Bloody Mary, but I guess that's the price you pay for convenience of being in a hotel bar. The bathrooms were nice, could have used a little more counter-space but whatever :) I like a fairly roomy bathroom and they had good ones. I wasn't a fan of the toiletries in the room, NO one in our party liked the lotion (LOL, we had two adjoining rooms) but I always bring my own anyway. Usually if I don't use it, I'll lift the toiletries for a future trip, but in this case I passed. Not a huge deal but sometimes getting these little extra ""freebies"" is some kind of treat. Good location, friendly and accommodating staff, and I love that they allowed us to leave our bags after checkout on Sunday for a few hours so we didn't have to lug them around the city until we departed. We were on the 28th floor and I didn't find the noise level to be too bad. I didn't notice any inconsiderate neighbors, but we were nicely located at almost the end of the hall. The view wasn't the best, but interesting. Our room was facing two office buildings. Saturday it was pretty empty, but on Friday afternoon when we arrived, people were still working and we had fun peering in and commenting on the activity going on with working strangers across the way. Overall, a very nice stay!",N
3587,"I don't get it.  I just don't get it.  I'm a big gross sweaty mess, even though IT'S TWO DEGREES OUTSIDE.  Why why why why why why?!?!?!?!? (Shut up, it ain't menopause, bitches) So who knows what's going on, but I'm sweating up a freaking storm as I'm waiting in line to check in.  I'm surrounded by a Christmas tree, train tracks, fake presents, and lifesize wooden toy soldiers.  Gag. The line is moving really slow - there are only two people at the check-in counter, and we're about 6 people deep.  I can't help it, I notice a small pool of sweat dripping onto the old carpet.  Seriously, what's wrong with me?!!?  I finally get to the front, check in, get my keys, and turn around to go to the elevator.  Except for I trip.  And I fall.  Like HARDCORE fall.  I throw my luggage up in the air, it knocks over a toy soldier.  One of my shoes comes flying off and hits a guest.  I land face first into the 90 year old carpet.  OH GOD I FELL INTO MY OWN SWEAT PUDDLE.  As I stand up, totally embarassed, I notice MY NOSE IS BLEEDING.  I'm leaving a blood trail on their 90 year old carpet.  I'm a TRAIN WRECK. The Drake Hotel staff runs to my side, asks me if I'm ok, has a towel on my nose, has already adjusted the fallen over human-sized toy soldier, has my luggage on a cart already, and is putting my shoe on already.  Someone hands me a glass of water.  DAMN.  That is SOME SERVICE! Minus two stars because the Drake gave me the wrong key to my room FOUR times.  Which means I had to go back to the scene of the accident FOUR TIMES.  And be stared at by the staff who so thoughtfully helped me FOUR TIMES.  And had to relive my epic fall FOUR TIMES.  How would you feel having to pass by the same person who just saw you flowing BLOOD THROUGH YOUR NOSE again not just 2 minutes earlier?  Might I remind you I hadn't yet gotten a chance to get to my room yet... so I still had BLOOD STAINS on my clothing.  Oh, I don't know if I mentioned - FOUR TIMES.",N

1430,"I stayed here while on business.  Our room had been updated and was very comfortable although the lighting was horrible.  I understand the 'mood lighting' and don't mind it generally, but I draw the line at the bathroom.  You've got to brighten up the bathroom at least.  I couldn't see to put on make-up.  Annoying.   Everyone was super friendly and accommodating during our stay.  I didn't dine at the restaurants but I did feel the in room meal prices were too high.  We spent $55 on (2) egg breakfasts and a pot of coffee (after gratuity).  $55, Really?!  Are you kidding?",N
3017,Was truly  disapointed!! it has GREAT lake views and of navu pier as well but thats all it  has going for it. The rooms were okay - quite open concept with a window in the bathroom which opens up ito the bedroom - not sure why you need that? LOL! the lobby and hallways are dark and loud - the W way. We got carded at the bar upstairs and downstairs which was annoying - we were old enough to buy  a room there but not a drink! really?,N
1866,"WOW OH WOW OH WOW! Boy do I love the W hotel chain in general, and this hotel did not disappoint.  The hotel has a beautiful modern feel and the rooms are decorated to the nines.  This place is just beautiful, and is especially wonderful for the young, or for those that want to be young.  If you are in your 70s or older, you might understand the whole idea of ""mood lighting"" that is featured in this hotel (as my father did not think this hotel was anywhere near fantastic).   The rooms are actually bigger than I expected.  The way they were architecturally built allow for the most room possible which is nice to see in a big city like Chicago.   If you are staying at this hotel make sure to ask about the free Acura car service that will drop you off 24 hours a day for free within a 5 mile radius of the area.",N
3603,"I've only walked thru the lobby of this hotel, and had drinks in the bar. This, though, is Classic Chicago Oldskool RichKid Elegance. I've never stayed here (why? I live in the city!) but wow, want to! The location is primo - doesn't get any better than that. Hip since the 20's. Pop! Six! Uh, uh, Cicero, Lipschitz! The iconic ""The Drake"" sign that is visible from Lake Shore Drive on the approach to Michigan Avenue could not be more classic. It's what I dreamt about living in LA, when I'd decided to come back to Chicago. I knew when I saw that sign, driving down LSD, that I was back home in the City that Works! Even though it's owned by Hilton now, elegance and real class still live here. Thankfully, it's still alive somewhere!",N

They have great rooms with flat screens....they also have a cute lil bar inside the hotel.....you get a great view, and it's walking distance to so many great restaurants and stores.  Plus, they provide you with cotton balls and q-tips in the bathroom...how great is that?  haha  =)",N
2797,"The good - the great concierge, front desk help, and the food for breakfast set this place above the pack.   The rooms were also big and cheap for a nightly stay through Christmas. It's also got a pool and hot tub that I used, as well as a free business center, which made me happy for when I was checking in for my return flight. The OK - The layout of the atrium is a bit confusing. Only one staircase down leads to the first floor? Weird.  And of course, since it's downtown, it is ever so difficult to find reasonable parking. The bad - the layout of the kitchen and dining area needs major major rework. Supremely confusing. So am I supposed to simply bypass teh ENORMOUS LINE of tourists if I don't want a omelette? Or am I supposed to suffer through 30 minutes of wiating for just simple french toast?  And the capacity isn't as big.  And the employees showed their frustrations ... I would be as crass and rude as their employees during breakfast if I had to get my butt out of bed super early just to have thousands of people go through a terribly laid out place. And about that room ... the thermostat was either broken or the place couldn't heat up well.  I had to set it to 80 deg just to get it a normal temperature (a sensor I have in my phone put the room at 70 when the thermostat said 80). Also, paid wifi? WTF? What is this, 2004? Also, what is happening to parents in this country? Control your idiot children and out of control tweens please!   Finally, the bathroom needed a little cleaning around the edges. Nothing super terrible but still, after seeing the air vent directly above the showerhead with grime on it, I had to clean it myself just so I wouldn't be bothered by it. Protip: if you're going to have free awesome breakfast, expect traffic! Major rework is needed to keep up with capacity and how utterly confusing it all was. Would I recommend it? Of course.  Just get up at 6:30 for breakfast and you're set and you bypass the long line of tourists also there, and bypass the majority of the complaints I have.  You also can't beat the price for the location.",N
2910,"The Good: clean and nice mattress. Fabulous views. Shula's Restaurant in the hotel is a good Steak house, expensive, but very good. The breakfast cafe was also good, and the catered meals were very good. Chibar was excellent, with good service and a great mojito. The Bad: lackadaisical maintenance. In my room alone: the door lock did not work. The armoire was probably unbalanced because the door and all the drawers would open by themselves. If I got up at night, this trap blocked the path to the bathroom and could have nailed me if I'd not been alert. Some of the staff demand tips. The bellhop held firm to my bags until I took out money for a tip (he hadn't helped with the bags, I brought them to him, and then retrieved them on my own when no help was available). The doorman passed me over twice until I took out cash for a tip so I could get a cab. Haven't had people this agressive for tips since I was in Bangkok Thailand where they live on tips alone. They charge for an internet connection, so I'm glad I brought my own hotspot. I was here for a convention. The escalator from the lobby was out for most of my stay, so we had quite a hike from one end of the hotel to the other and back, plus up and down multiple floors. Seems like they converted lower level space for meeting rooms as an afterthought because meeting rooms are split between 4th floor and the first floor, and there are no elevators to 1 and 2 below the lobby.",N

They will claim to give you a ""good rate.""  Then you will find yourself either (A) explaining to your guests why should pay a higher rate than necessary when they can get a better rate on their own, or (B) eating the cost of the rooms you reserved because your anticipated guests all got the lower outside rate.   2.  Then when you do get someone to agree to help you out and give you a more reasonable rate, you will find that the rest of the hotel ""didn't get the memo"" and spend several hours on the phone.  You call your contact, who will assure you that it will be taken care of immediately, only to find that nothing continues to happen.  Then you get to call again.  I think of it as the ""Chicago Hilton"" cycle. 3.

The staff there is great and I didn't encounter much difficulty checking in, getting my room or ordering when it came to dining at the hotel's restaurant located in the lobby. Price wise, this place is superb. Good deal. The rooms were super spacious and had nice contemporary decor. I had a basic suite with a king-sized bed. The bathroom was a girl's dream, being that it was spacious and included a sliding door closet. Wacker St., where the hotel is faces, offers a great view of the skyscrapers and the waterfront. During my stay, I was lucky enough to see the set-up of the filming of 'Transformers 3,' so this hotel was quite popular then. Wi-fi is also included at this hotel.",N

3363,"probably one of the few reasonably affordable ways to get yourself into a room on Michigan ave. Obviously, the location is great. Walk right out the door to Grant Park.

There is an indoor pool, fitness center and a deck on the 4th floor that looks out over michigan ave. The rooms are fine, maybe a bit a small. However, the rest of the inside, like the hallways, stairways, are kind of creepy. Internet there is kind of expensive, and probably the most annoying was that our room didn't have a fridge (we ate two huge meals out in chinatown, and since we didn't have a fridge to bring the doggie bag back to, we threw the food out the second night, which was sad, and went into food coma the first night, which was painful and gross). Oh yes, and agree with the reviewer below that the mandatory valet parking thing was kinda annoying.",N

From the time of making the reservation to departing from the hotel we were very pleased.  The hotel staff was accomodating in providing corner rooms that were adjacent to each other - both had reasonably nice views.  The only complaint about the rooms would be that it was difficult to control the temperature gauge - we were either very cold, or warm.  Otherwise the rooms were comfortable and clean.  Guest Services was very helpful in arranging dinner reservations, and providing directions to the restaurant for Saturday night.  We had Sunday breakfast in Shula's, and that was an EXCELLENT meal.  Bottom-line:  I would (and have) recommend this hotel to any who are looking for a reasonably priced and very comfortable stay, in Chicago. Bottom",N

We were sitting in the lobby waiting for them to tell us our room was ready.  After I got ready in the lobby bathroom, my husband went up to the gal again to ask her how much longer.

Kind of strange to have Yoko Ono and John Lennon staring at you from over the loo. Staff is polite, effiecient. I enjoyed a drink at the bar before going out. Again, the environment is nice. Check out each floor. The have one Rocker's  memorabilia displayed simply at each elevator lobby. Both times we enjoyed our views from the room.

We did not book directly online because we were ale to get a better deal by searching. Try to get on a higher floor For the views - the city noises are audible (well at least the emergency vehicle sirens are). After settling in, we decided to park our car at the Millennium or Grant Street Garages for $29/day VS Hard Rock's $46/day. Pay attention to your phone messages, you may get an announcement of live music at the bar.",N

19,"As Martha would say, ""What a dump!"" Although not without its charm, the Tremont is old and with the apparent exception of the penthouse suite described below, not very well kept. The elevator creaks and makes thumping noises. My room smelled mildewy, the wallpaper was peeling, and the paint was chipped. The AC (which had an ""on"" setting and an ""off"" setting) pumped dusty air through a rusty vent surrounded by a corona of water stains in the ceiling. At 11:30 pm, I awoke to the sound of a door slamming over and over and over again. I staggered out into the hall to confront whatever ingrate was making the noise only to find that the elevator was stuck on the floor and the door was opening and slamming shut. During my three night stay, my key card magically deactivated four times. Don't be fooled by their website, which lists room amenities that you may find within. There is no room service, no in-room coffee pots, and when I asked about the promised in hotel ""fitness center,"" the desk clerk said I could go to the Westin Hotel around the corner and, once they called the Tremont to verify my status as guest, use theirs. The TV in my room offered a dim, warped, off-color view of the five available channels. There are no window screens and a card on the desk cautioned that opening a window would lead to bugs, attracted by the lights, flying into the room. Because I am soft, I gave the place three stars because the employees are polite, helpful, and well-practiced in coping with angry guests. The lobby is also gorgeous and I had a pretty decent view of the Hancock out of my window. It is also cheap as hell for a hotel off Michigan Ave. Still, if you are looking for a hotel with more comfort and less character, and you can afford it, stay somewhere else.",N
689,"A rather forgettable hotel, I'd even forgotten that I stayed here a weekend ago until I was going through receipts. Because of business, I was delayed checking in until 6 AM. (Yes, 6 AM. Yes, business.) At the front desk, I was told that they had cancelled my reservation because I hadn't shown up. I pointed her to my watch and indicated that it was still before check-out time, so I'd please like my room. I also mentioned that I have Platinum status with Marriott. She quickly reinstated my reservation and checked me in. The room was just right for a Courtyard with a view looking west. Oddly, it was two separate windows with one of the support pillars in between. After crashing for a few hours, at 2 PM I took the ""do not disturb"" off the door and headed back to the client. Returning much later, the room had not been done up. I was too tired to complain. The little tent card in the room clearly said that rooms are cleaned until 5 PM. Oh well. Bed? Comfortable. Room? Clean. Bathroom? Clean and stocked properly. Would I stay here again? Probably.",N
3329,"I stayed in the hotel from 9/5-9/7/09.   We enjoyed it. We had a two double bed room, with three people.  It is an average size, clean, and has nice decor.  I was surprised there was a high def wide screen TV, but I'm sure a lot of upscale, big city hotels are probably moving towards having them standard.  The climate control was fine, and the room was quieter than we expected for a city.  The valet, bell boy and front desk personnel were polite, helpful and professional.  The elevators are quick.  Something to consider is to go to each floor to see special items from bands.  I wouldn't do it, but several other people were doing it. A shirt and a guitar from Prince was on our floor by the elevator. We had the buffet breakfast 2 mornings in a row at the China Grill restaurant, which is attached.  The staff is abundant, professional and polite. This hotel has a nice location.  Grant Park is one block away.  Cabs and public transportation are available.

3933,"My wife and I booked a room at the Congress Plaza Hotel.  We found what looked like a water cockroach in our bathroom.  We called the front desk and was put on hold for over 10 minutes without explanation.  Two staff members who did not identify themselves showed up at our room door.  When we told them there was a large insect in our bathroom, they immediately denied the existence of the bug.  They went in and quickly glaned inside the bathroom and maintained their denial of such insect.  I had to literally point it out to them in order for them to believe me.  They identified it as a water bug that comes up through the toilet.  What did they do?  They flushed it down the toilet!  Right after they said that's where it came from!  They did not remove the bug from the room or kill it. Finally the front desk took us off hold on the phone.  I informed them of what happened, and they said they only had 1 room in the entire hotel to offer if we wanted to change, but it was much smaller.  Whether or not that was true is yet to be revealed but at that time I did not believe it. The next day we checked out and was not asked whether we enjoyed our stay, so we took the liberty of once again voicing our displeasure. We were comped a free breakfast which honestly made no impact on our confidence of this hotel.  Why would we eat at a place we feel does not put priorty in cleanliness of their guest rooms? The front desk attendant apologized on behalf of the hotel and we never spoke to the manager face to face.   Overall, the only thing worse than finding a roach the size of your thumb sitting on your toothbrush, is the inexplicable indifference shown by the management to resolve our extreme discomfort over the whole situation. Never again will I stay here, nor will I recommed to anyone.",N
2150,"God help me if my Irish Catholic mother ever reads this review because of what it implies, but here goes.... I used to have 2 roommates and a boyfriend. So when Valentine's day rolled around, I decided that a better way to spend it was to NOT stay home on the couch watching tv with my boyfriend AND 2 roommates.... So I booked us a room here for a romantic Valentine's mini-getaway!! Service at the hotel was very courteous and prompt, from check-in to check-out. From reading the other reviews, I'm guessing that the hotel has different rooms in different sections. Well our room was gorgeous, a high floor, no street noise and a kickass view of Michigan Ave. The bathroom was large with marble countertops and shower/bath, but most importantly it was clean! The Intercontinental is located right a decent section of Michigan Ave with lots of good restaurant options in the near proximity. As a result of that, we definitely did not eat at the hotel or order room service. We tried to have a nice romantic walk down Michigan at night, but February in Chicago = COLD!!!! So we went back to the hotel and went swimming. The pool area was really nice and WARM. I'm willing to bet that they have one of the nicest hotel pools anywhere in Chicago. Note to parents: it doesn't seem kid-friendly, the minimum depth at the pool was like 7 feet. All in all, we had a wonderful, relaxing and romantic time staying here, and I got a beautiful diamond necklace from the boyfriend as a gift. So what can I say?? That's worth at least 4 stars in my book! Oh yeah, and Mom??? If you're reading this... our room had 2 king-sized beds. ;)",N
4325,"Beautiful hotel in a great location with friendly staff. The one-bedroom suite is a must- give yourself a little more room and a little more view. If you're looking to self park, it's a bit of a walk- about 1.5-2 blocks. I wouldn't recommend self parking in the winter time. If you're looking to walk around at night, this is not the hotel for you.. not too much going on after the shops close around here. Some rooms do come with a refrigerator- if you need it, ask for it. Food and drinks are pricey and not too special. I'd suggest getting out and finding one of thousands of great restaurants Chicago has to offer.",N
1412,"the shuttle from O'hare was long, but the driver was nice enough to inform us that the knickerbocker used to be one of the first gentlemen's club in the area and YES the hotel hosted Playboy back in the days. the location was great! minutes from everything imaginable, lake, shopping, even OPRAH winfrey's home [the big white house on oak st 2 blocks down] the room was small, but the decor made it cute. morning breakfast was served and it was a gigantic meal for the price, quite fulfilling. the hotel staff were nice and accomodating. the bartender at the martini bar made a martini like no other, ONE martini each and we were done for. one of the best martinis i've had. the price was fair, considering a million and one conventions the weekend we went.",N
2334,"I stayed here for a convention over Memorial Day weekend. Like other reviewers mentioned, the location really cannot be beat. It's right in the middle of everything, and it was an excellent location to explore the city from. From my experience, the staff is incredibly helpful and kind. Downsides are definitely the lack of mini fridges (!) and the size of the rooms, which were a definite squeeze for me and the 3 other people I stayed with. There was almost no space for our luggage, which was a problem. What irked me most though was probably the paid internet. This place isn't cheap; if a Motel 8 has free wi-fi, why doesn't this hotel? Overall a good experience though. Would recommend.",N
1828,"Ws are a little bit hilarious and a lot awesome. Some of the hilarity is purposeful (the extra roll of toilet paper in the room came in a tidy little bag labeled ""backup plan""), but other things are hilariously unintentional, like the SNL-worthy ribbed black turtlenecks all the lounge staff was wearing. Sometimes I wonder if the W takes itself a little too seriously while trying to be the ""anti-hotel"". While my suite was more than roomy enough and felt clean, spacious, and modern, I did notice that I could hear hall noises so clearly they felt like they were happening in my own room. I didn't hear any neighbor noises (maybe I didn't have neighbors?) but whenever someone was walking down the hall it sounded like my door was just standing open. Fitted black turtlenecks or not, the service was flawless. The W staff came through for me in two major ways. (1) I bought too many pairs of shoes and couldn't fit them into my suitcase, so they sent up a FedEx box and form, and took it away from me once I packed. That was huge! Saved me either extra baggage fees or having to tromp through Chicago crowds to find a post office. (2) My flight got cancelled and I was able to scoot back my checkout time until 1 pm, no questions asked, no additional charges. Speaking of charges, this place is a tad expensive (WiFi was outrageous... don't they know the young, hip crowd likes their internets?), but it was definitely on par with other hotels in the area. When you get to a major downtown location, I notice there isn't much variance in the room prices anyway. I figure you have every other opportunity to stay at a ""normal"" hotel, so stay at a W when you can. It's fun, and the usual gripes can be found at any hotel. At least make it your ""Backup Plan.""",N
4709,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night. The door man was helpful and attentive, although the front desk was busy, they too, were attentive. The bartender was lacking personality, but the lounge area was aesthetically pretty awesome, and the drink prices were more than affordable, (especially since we had just walked out of a bar with a $10 cover charge and $15 drinks). Honestly, from a monetary standpoint it was probably cheaper (and more relaxing!) to drink in the hotel lounge all night versus go out to the bars. Yes, the room is small, but it was clean! The ""complimentary"" bottled water in the room actually turns out to be a $10 ($5 each) charge on your credit card upon check out. I also had a $45 charge for valet parking, when indeed I self-parked and paid cash. I called the front desk to report the issue, though, and they immediately refunded me. I love the absence of bureaucracy at Boutique hotels like this one. I would stay here again. Oh! And another plus - no charge for the fitness room or for internet usage!",N
3044,"I've never stayed at a W before, but W on Lakeshore was pretty good.  It does seem to be a little older... you can tell the rooms are a little worn, but everything is still pretty nice. The breakfast is really good here, so if you're somehow able to get breakfast in with your rate, it's totally worth it.  My only complaint is that they initially charged me for breakfast even though it was part of my company negotiated rate.  We solved that pretty quickly though, so I was satisfied.  I'd definitely stay here again if my company was paying or if I got a really good rate.",N
1875,"Stayed at the W City Centre over the marathon weekend, and had mixed feelings. The location was perfect for the marathon as it was close to the start and finish, and it is very close to the theatre district as this was convenient for when I went to ""wicked"". Travellers must note that this hotel is located in the Financial district. On weekends, it's a ghost town around there, not many things like restaurants, cafes or shops are open. I would stay north of the river around the Magnificent Mile, that is where al the ""hubub"" is. Rookie Mistake! As for the actual hotel, the room was tiny (not surprised). If you check into a W dont expect a spacious room. The washroom amenties were top notch, and of course the Bed was Heavenly. The rooms were very chic, but the walls are paper thin, nothing more pleasant than hearing the person in the next room going to the washroom. The concierge staff at the hotel was below average. I always felt like they had no clue. Either that, or they couldn't be bothered to make an effort. The front desk staff were excellent. They were very helpful and friendly. If not for them, I would have downgraded the hotel. The restaurant at the Hotel was disguisting. The food was brutal and the service was even worse. I don't ask for much, but when I say Thank-you please acknowledge me. When I ask for some water, please acknowledge me. When I am ordering from the menu please look at me. The lobby is one of the coolest places. The design and ambience is very funky. It's kind neat checking into a room and having people ordering martini's a few steps away. Whiskey Blue is a fun place to hang out, as well. Overall, I don't think I'd come back. Unless, you need to be close to the financial district.....stay at or near the Mag Mile, and maybe pop in for a cocktail at Whiskey Blue one night.",N
2163,"This review is just for the lobby bar--never stayed here. A great place to catch a drink after shopping or before going to the movies.  Leather sofas and armchairs, no tv overload (1 flatscreen), and a quiet, ""men's club"" vibe.   I can also attest to the greatness that is Intercontinental's Kir Royale.  (the Kir is good too) But can't wait until this place is non-smoking--the guy next to us was instrusive with his smoking, not to mention his rosary.",N
3271,"My rating from this most recent visit would be a 3.5 star rating, but since it was a gracious offer from the hotel to stay there in light of our last experience, I will use 4 stars instead of 3. The check in this time was smooth as silk. The front desk team was polite and attentive, and patient as my kids were acting like asshats before my husband got there to meet us. We had 2 rooms that were joined by a door. I loved the layout of this. It added in a funky hallway. Unlike some other Yelpers, I actually liked that the room wasn't overly bright. It was very relaxing. Aveda products in the bathrooms, big plus for me. I love Aveda. We ordered a banana split and some wine that night. We ended up with a full tray of food. The only problem? While we got a great surprise with all this stuff, they forgot the banana split....and my husband didn't see the note (thanking us for returning, and letting us know that some of the items were as thanks for coming back) so he thought the whole order was wrong. A bit of a miscommunication there, but all was well. My only other comment would be the TV and its reception. While I don't expect every hotel to have some HD tvs in there, the reception could at least be clear. The reception there was all fuzzy, almost like we were watching tv with the old bunny ears. So, a HUGE improvement from the 1st  visit....all in all, a good visit to the Hard Rock.",N

56,"The whole family stayed here for 4 nights this summer as we moved youngest sister into DePaul. The rooms were clean and well kept during our stay. The building is super old so there's some interesting character to the layouts. The lobby is comfortable, and the complimentary breakfast was standard warm continental. The desk staff was friendly and had maps available for us to take with us when we ventured out to explore. Met my expectations for a budget hotel, nothing stellar but no complaints. The best part obviously is the super convenient location: an easy walk from the train station, an easy walk to the park, zoo, lots of restaurants and shops.",N
3598,"As a wedding gift a friend who couldn't make it got us a room for the 4th of July.  In a city where it's next to impossible to get a room on that night, we thought this was a neat idea!  And the reservation aid lakefront view.  Nice! When we checked in we got a 'congratulations' and a 'let me see if I can find you a good room'.  Oooo, thanks! Good room apparently is NOT a lakefront room.  It's facing Michigan Avenue.  And it's under construction.  Boo.  But it was in the corner and the silence was wonderful!   Nice staff, sloooow elevators (but hey, it's old!) and very vintage rooms made for a nice vacation in our own city.

4573,"stayed five nights here for a conference last summer.  this was the chosen conference hotel so this was where we stayed.   what i loved: the hotel is gorgeous.  the lobby &amp; ballrooms speak to an era of opulent charm.  i think i gave myself a stiff neck because i couldn't help looking up at the beautiful architecture. the doormen &amp; bellmen are super duper friendly and helpful.   it is located in the middle of everything.  there is so much to see and do and it's all a nice, leisurely walk or cab ride away. shopping!  there are several stores lining the block of the hotel, and even more a little ways down if you don't mind the walk. what i didn't like: while the hotel didn't lack for elevators to get you to your room, if you had other people in your party who were staying on a different floor, there was a big chance you had to hop onto a different elevator from the one servicing your floor to access their room. cell phone reception in some of the rooms sucks.  especially if you have at&amp;t.  i thought i'd be fine with my iphone as my internet connection, but i couldn't get a signal in my room.  if i walked down the hall towards the elevators i got full bars.  but that's not convenient when it's  2 am and you want to make a phone call home. other reviewers are not kidding when they say the walls are paper thin.  you can hear full on conversations from people walking down the halls and in adjacent rooms.  luckily, no one was staying in the room next to me. it's almost like a lottery on what size room you will get.  i booked all the rooms for our staff (single occupancy king beds) and some people got large rooms, some got closet sized spaces.  my room was fine since i was the only one staying in it, and i actually had a large bathroom compared to other co-workers rooms.  the reason was my room was renovated for ADA accessibility, so i had a wider door and railings in the restroom, a lower closet rod, and a second peephole at belly-button height.  good for accommodating someone in a wheelchair or a little person.  not so good when you're an average height person and you need to hang some long dresses. for the number of rooms the hotel boasts (over 1,000) and it's ability to accommodate conference crowds), i wasn't too pleased with the concierge/housekeeping accessibility.  i called each at least three times during my stay and was left each time with an endlessly ringing phone. hotel amenities are not free?!  it costs extra to use the hotel pool and the gym?!  now that is an extreme rip-off, expecially when lots of folks are paying a couple hundred bucks per night's stay.  even when i asked  for an extended check-out from 11 AM to 12:30 PM, i was told it would be a $25 charge. overall, it did it's job in providing a safe, comfortable place to stay while in chicago.  i would stay here again, but it probably wouldn't be my first choice of places to stay.",N
401,Moderately priced overall - well priced for its location.  Hotel room was on par with other Hilton Garden Inn's...but it's all about the location!,N
3471,"Horrible service. I stayed here this weekend and i would have to say one of the worst hotel experiences i have ever experienced. First off we called the hotel 6 times before showing up there to see if we could check in a little early, and they never answered. Then once we got there and let them know that we tried to call, they never apologized but said that our room was ready and we could check in. but not 30 seconds later we were told that we had to wait, and that they would call us when our room was ready. Once we got a call, about an hour later, we went up to the room (the hotel is old and elevators take forever! but its not too bad) which was small, but clean and nice. The room itself was not bad. Since the building is old everything is smaller, from the rooms, to the hallways, to the elevators. The walls are also SUPER thin, you could probably hear your neighbor sneeze if it was a good one. The worst part of our stay was that the hotel NEVER answered the phone. No matter if it was to ask for more towels or to verify the time of the check out. And if that wasn't bad enough, when we checked out they didn't even say 'thank you' or 'hope you enjoyed staying with us'. All we were told when we got down to the front desk was 'you guys already paid, you can go'. If that's not great customer service i don't know what is! I recommend finding another hotel in Chicago to stay at. You can find deals on hotels for about the same price all over the city. So save yourself the trouble.",N
4605,"Frankly, I got the short end of the stick at Hotel Felix. Three day trip, late September. Roughly $200/night. (not that cheap!) Word to the wise, when you book via the hotel engines (Hotwire, Expedia, etc) you are typically filling up the most...err...undesirable rooms. Not always, but sometimes. You might end up in a great hotel, but be forewarned that you might get the ""blah"" rooms no one else wants. In this case. Most definitely. If you get assigned an ""01"" room at the Hotel Felix, try to get reassigned. it is DIRECTLY in the elevator bank basically. My boyfriend checked the floorplan and most definitely they carved an entire elevator out of this room, leaving it roughly at about 100SF, if that. It is TINY. Not just small, but terribly uncomfortable for any length of time. Impossible for two people. Claustrophobic. No closet space. Other than that this hotel is fine... Pros: *above average hotel restaurant: Elate. (and decent room service!) *great location, non-busy street. (Huron) in River North. *easy metered parking exists, 2 hour limits. *Staff is quite nice. *Free wi-fi Cons: *Room size *The coffee is always empty in the morning in the  lobby *$42 valet All in all fine, but was not totally comfortable in that size room with an elevator dinging ALLLLLL day/night.",N
2226,"I stayed in this hotel for a week. I thought overall the hotel was good. I was irked that they have the balls to charge $12 PER COMPUTER, PER DAY for Internet. I consume lots of ice, and I was disappointed that the ice is only on the 7th floor. The room was a decent size, and they have a good plasma TV. Actually you should bring your media players because they have all kinds of connections including HDMI!!! Whoohoo! The place has a Starbucks in the building, and a nearby Walgreen's. You have to pay for the gym, but the pool/sauna is free.  Not bad.",N
4398,"I spent a few years working in hotels before moving becoming a meeting planner so I feel like I can give a fair judgment of a hotel and I am just not sure I would return to the Palmer House. I understand it's a historic hotel, however I was in room 21-167 and beside the room being the smallest hotel room I've ever been in I don't think it was maintained very well. The carpet is worn and and needs replacing (felt the same about the hall and elevator landing) There was black hair on the shower walls, mildew on the shower grout, trash BEHIND the trash can in the bathroom, and it looked like the bath amenities had been used and not replaced. The woman who checked me was was in training according to the badge she was wearing but it took her forever to check me in, she didn't say more than 2 words to me so it was mostly awkward silence. The remote in my room didn't work and when engineering came up with a 2nd one that didn't work. I was told that they were in the middle of a shift change so someone else would have to come up and it took almost 30 mins, that guy brought a remote & did something to the TV before telling me it was fixed (I was working at the desk). However, when I went to turn the TV off the 3rd remote wasn't working either. Because I arrived at 1:30pm, left at 4pm, returned at midnight and went straight to bed, got up at 6 am and left at 6:30 for a flight I didn't say anything to the hotel, it just wasn't worth the hassle of moving. However, if I had been there any longer I would have complained to the front desk. No wireless Internet in the guest rooms. They get 3 stars because: Convenient location, the doorman who got me the cab to get to the airport was very friendly, and the 3rd star out of hope that I just had an off experience. The hotel has a ton of history in it and has been around forever, plus it's a Hilton which is an overall good brand.",N
45,"If you want a reasonably priced, clean, non-chain downtown Chicago hotel that's close to the Gold Coast, Mag Mile, CTA, etc. and can live without trendy decor or practically any amenities, this is a good option. As others have said, the decor is outdated, but the antique-like furnishings do give this place character, and it's very clean. You can't beat location -- stores, restaurants, lakefront, etc., are all very walkable. With the exception of wi-fi and shampoo/handcream in the room, this place offered absolutely no amenities -- even the free continental breakfast they offered last time I was here is gone, and they charged me $3 to store my luggage for a couple hours after I checked out -- every other hotel I've ever been to does that for free. All in all, I wanted a reasonably priced, clean, convenient place to crash while I was in Chicago, so this was a great option, but on trips to Chicago where my company is paying or I want a little more comfort, this would not be at the top of my list.",N

3759,"Beware of the half-naked 50-70 year old women! Being part of a bridal party, we booked a couple of rooms at the Dana Hotel this past weekend for the bachelorette party.  The hotel itself is very nice, clean and has a super friendly and knowledgeable staff and an extremely friendly and helpful doorman.  The one thing that I could have done without was seeing women who were no joke, in their 60s and 70s and dressed in what could have been found in their provocatively dressed granddaughters' closets. Aside from the wardrobe no-nos, the hotel rooms are very clean and the beds are super comfortable.  The only other odd thing was the shower--the inside of the shower was very spacious and had a waterfall faucet along with a handheld faucet, but instead of a wall, there was a huge piece of glass so the person showering could be seen from the bedroom side of the hotel room.  These rooms are definitely good for those who are looking to get a little frisky, but there is a curtain for those that like their privacy while showering. Overall, we had a great experience here and hopefully I'll be able to return someday!",N

1073,"I do so love Fairmont Hotels . . . Vancouver, Whistler, and, of course, San Francisco . . . so when coming to Chicago, we definitely stayed at the Fairmont Millennium Park. The lobby is beautifully appointed, with the check-in counter on one side of the circular lobby, the concierge on the other, and ENO (their lobby bar dedicated to wine, cheese and chocolate) dominating the middle. By the time we got our bags and the cab took us from O'Hare to the hotel, Lynn and I didn't check in until around 7:45-8:00, but our room was (naturally) waiting for us, and the bellman brought our bags up to the room immediately (good thing, too, as we had 8:30 dinner reservations). Our room was on the 15th floor, with a spectacular view to the east, of the yacht harbor and Lake Michigan.  The pillow-topped mattress was perfect; the bathroom large and roomy, the shower good, the Bose sound system paired with the flat-panel TV sounded great; so did the iPod player, actually, that was built into the base of the desk lamp, and the room came with free wi-fi.  The mini-bar wouldn't open, but we didn't need it (see below) except to store leftovers in, and they immediately brought up a small refrigerator to our room. The room was also on the opposite end of the floor from the Fairmont Gold Lounge, meaning breakfast, cocktails, and a concierge were mere steps (rather than floors) away . . .

3096,"There were a lot of hotels I wanted to stay at in Chicago and finally decided with W @ Lakeshore. Great hotel, when I come back, I'll be here again. Intimate, plus and private. Love the minimalist designing of the hotel (and all W hotels). Book the hotel if...: if are young or ""feel younger"", into or somewhat into ""urban chic"", and you are plan to take advantage of the hotel's offerings. To book the room isn't that expensive but to take advantage of what the hotel offers, is. For example, their Whenever Wherever policy - you can basically get whatever you want, when you want it (like White Castle burgers at 3am delivered to you by the hotel staff). Rooms: made for couples. Don't plan on coming here with your family or if you do, get separate rooms. For example, there is no bathroom door. Rather, it is a sliding wood door that it not on rails (it's a ""casual-optional"" door and there is a wooden window from the bathroom to the bedroom that is meant to be kept open. LCD's in every room, minibar has everything you want from food to booze to hats to ""love packages"" (condoms, lube, mints and some other stuff). The toiletries are from Bliss so yeah, actual name brand stuff unlike most hotels since most top hotels have their ""exclusive"" brands but they don't mean anything because the dealer only deals to them; so it's actually generic). If you're crazy about spa, they have the Bliss spa experience. They have a great pool (indoor of course); it's open to all hotel guests so no need to do the spa if you don't want. They have a club/bar upstairs that has an AWESOME view of Chicago. If you're a hotel guest, just flash your card since there will be a line to get in on weekends. If you want feel pampered (and you are willing to spend the money for it), you  will have a great time here. You can also be discreet to and enjoy all the amenities. Friendly and very-knowing concierge desk. Since it's at Lakeshore, this part of the city is relatively quiet compared to the inner-city. Even with the lounge downstairs and club upstairs, you won't hear anything in your room if you want peace and quiet.",N
4,"This place is disgusting, absolutely horrible, it is my second stay here, there is a strange stain on the other side of the bed I stay on, and my friends and I are rendered air conditionless, but it is 55 for downtown Chicago, what am I suppose to do?",N
49,"I have a fondness for older hotels that are a little down on their luck, so I ignored all the moaning around (on several sites) about the Tremont being . . so . . . so . . . OLD!  Yeah, well--my wallpaper is peeling too.  I found the Tremont to be very comfortable if a little overpriced (what downtown hotel isn't?)  From my twelfth floor room I had a lovely view of the Lake--or would have if that damn Hancock Building hadn't been in the way.  The Tremont is close to all the shopping on the Magnificent Mile, the Looking Glass Theater, Water Tower Place, the Hershey Store, Bistro 110--all the jostle and jump of the Water Tower neighborhood.  Even though the Tremont is no more than a block from all the activity, Chestnut is a peaceful enough street that my room was quiet at all times.  The Tremont staff seems polite and helpful; the bathroom seemed recently updated.  The Continental Breakfast ($5.00) was only okay, but it was a sufficient jump start on Saturday morning. I was very happy with my stay at the Tremont and would recommend it to anyone except the most persnickety Felix Ungers out there.",N
4514,"We just had a long weekend getaway to Chicago and the Palmer House took good care of us. We prepaid online for a room on the Executive Levels and got a great deal. The room was large, the bed was so comfy, the sheets were very nice. The lounge on the 23rd floor had cookies out in the afternoon, hot hors d'ouevres in the evening (plus a cash bar), light breakfast fare in the morning, and coffee and drinks all day long. This was a really nice bonus to staying there. The lobby is beautiful, the bar closes a bit early though for a city like Chicago. The staff was friendly, the location is near several train lines for zipping around, the nearby restaurants weren't the absolute best but overall I am very glad we chose to stay here.",N
3545,"We stayed at the Crowne Plaza during a recent Chicago visit in late July. This is mid-market for downtown Chicago but the hotel is in a terrific location on the Magnificent Mile within walking distance to shopping, restaurants and Navy Pier. A 24 hour Walgreens is two blocks away. Overall we were very happy with the experience. Service - just outstanding. Everyone was exceedingly helpful and we were immediately upgraded to a suite since my wife and I were traveling with two children. Questions were easily answered and any minor problems were quickly addressed. Staff tried very hard to accommodate all our requests. See below. Room Quality - solid if not spectacular. Beds were comfortable. Plenty of room. Bathrooms were clean. Refrigerator is a full mini-bar with no room for anything else. We took things out to put our own drinks in. Initially we were billed for the things we took out because, evidently, if you move items it activates a sensor. The staff was very nice about it and took the charges off the bill. They even comped us the 2-3 snacks my kids ate. Hard to complain about that. TV was a little small but who, eh, really cares. Go do stuff. Amenities - my kids loved the rooftop pool and went up there almost every day. I never made it but the kids said it was great. Free WiFi! - you can't take this for granted any more. Very easy to use. Slower than optimum but not unduly so. This was a factor in choosing the hotel, if you can believe that. Business Center - Lower marks for the business center. Internet was unbelievably slow and problems were encountered because of the odd customized browser installed which led to unnecessary complications with printing and disabling pop-up blockers. Not to pick on the Crowne, since this is an endemic irritation with most hotel business centers. Make sure you aren't in a hurry (e.g. rushing to buy and print event tickets) if you use this. The printer looked brand new though! Pricing was highly competitive given the location. We booked through a Travelocity deal. We would absolutely stay here again.",N
3475,"Pro: Cleanliness. Location.  This one probably makes up for all the cons below. Online deals seemed available. Con: Told I would have a room with a view.  The view was of the a/c unit that blocked all but an inch of the window. Staff not that helpful if you're not in the ""trendy"" crowd. Airlines use this hotel for their staff, and if you're there when they are coming or going, good luck trying to get an elevator, a cab, service from the bellhop, etc. The elevators can fit maybe 1 person with luggage and 1 other person.  They are extremely small and there are few of them so it takes awhile to get to your room.  I waited 6 minutes for an elevator, which doesn't seem like much.  But after a day of touring the city, tired feet, being hungry, etc., 6 minutes is 6 minutes too long to be waiting for an elevator.",N
4080,"It's rare that I'll give a hotel 5 stars. To be quite honest, I probably wouldn't give them that fifth star, if it weren't for the following situation: Last Thursday, I came down with the flu. I was planning on staying at my apartment, but my landlord still hadn't left for Singapore. I went back to the Hyatt after making new reservations. The concierge (who, at this point recognised me by sight because I've slept in their bed more than I did in my New York apartment) took one look at me and asked me if I needed some medication. I got to my room, and within five minutes, he'd personally brought up Tylenol, because he didn't want to have the usual 5-10min delay that would happen if he had housekeeping do it. Yes, he got a nice letter written for him afterwards :) Another story: 2 colleagues and I were staying at this hotel. Since I was staying longer (did I mention I spent more nights in the Hyatt than I did anywhere else this month?) than them, we were on separate reservations. They screwed up their room -- they gave them what is basically a party suite -- one bed in one room and the other room had bunch of couches with a pull-out bed. They were upgraded immediately to the executive floor, with zero hassles. I guess they wanted to keep our hotwire.com-based business ;) To be fair, the rooms are slightly dated -- no LCD TVs, lacking iPod docks in every room, etc. Even the executive floor (don't know about the suites) look a little dated, though they are nicer. The beds are comfortable, though, and the view can be great if you're lucky -- either to Millenium Park or towards the Maginificent Mile.",N
780,"Probably the best hotel stay so far. I'm generally unimpressed with the price to service ratio at these fancy-ish hotels, but I think this is my new favorite. Location: AWESOME. Right across the street from the Hancock Observatory and the Water Tower Place. There's no lack of food in the area, from cheap (mostly in the mall), to the more expensive, to the moderate (cheesecake factory). There's ""The Grill"" downstairs but it's pretty expensive. I took a cab to all the major landmarks for around 10-$15 (cabs seem to be rather expensive in this city, the places weren't very far away). Rooms: My room was great, I couldn't hear any neighbors and the bed was super comfortable. Room Service: Food was awesome, and I was surprised that when I got hot chocolate with my breakfast that it wasn't a couple packets and some hot water. It was served in a caraffe that stayed hot all morning. They also have EVERY necessity that you may have forgotten that you can have delivered to your room. Price: My room was discounted at $195 for an event, definitely worth it if you ask me. I was very pleased with my stay. The hotel was on a scent theme of ""White Tea"" so the corridors and everything smelled marvelous, and all of the in-room soaps and shampoos smelled like White Tea also (my favorite scent, btw). If I had to complain about anything it would be that during the day, the paid wifi internet is VERY slow, but I was able to hook into the wall for no extra charge so no big deal.",N
1427,5 Stars for the bed - quite possibly one of the most comfortable beds I've been in.  The pillows are soooo SOFT.  I had a pleasant stay and all I could think about while I was at work was getting back to the room so I could sleep!,N
1394,"Stayed here for 4 nights & had a very enjoyable stay.  Check in time says it's 3pm, but we arrived a couple hours earlier & were able to check in & unwind right away.  Desk staff, doormen & bellmen were all very friendly & helpful - quick to give directions or recommend a place to grab a bite & a drink.  The hotel bar is basic, but the stools are comfortable & the bartenders are quick with a refill & a joke. The room was very small, but unless you are trying to fit more than 2 people in the room, it is fine.  The bed was not as comfortable as I would have thought, but it was OK.  The rainfall shower was nice, but the pressure wasn't too strong (use the handheld attachment if you need to get shampoo out). Would definitely return here.  I have heard people were treated differently when booking there through Hotwire or Priceline, but I received great service & would return.  They also let you print out your boarding pass for free.",N
3589,"After braving the Chicago River Architecture cruise in 40 degree weather (and brief flurries) tea at the Drake Hotel was a welcome (warm) activity for my mom and me.  We were seated right away with no reservation and slowly thawed out while taking in the ornate room and lovely, live, harp music.  Warming up with a wide assortment of tea, amazing snacks and beautiful surroundings- I could not ask for anything more!   For about $30 each you get your own pot of tea (no need to decide on one to share, everyone gets their number 1 choice!).  4 types of finger sandwiches (one of each type per person), a piece of sweet bread (like banana) a (warm) scone and all the lemon curd, strawberry jam and Devonshire cream you can imagine (I used all of my willpower to not eat the lemon curd by the spoon full). The meal is completed with beautiful offerings from the pastry chef.  You can also get champagne to compliment your meal and complete your outing. I love how accommodating and consistent the service is. Our pots were toped off with hot water frequently, the snacks were brought out almost immediately and the server was always around to answer questions and grab us anything we needed (and to take a picture of the mother daughter outing).  I do want to mention that each time I am here I see men enjoying tea as well and I like that.  It is not just a mother's day activity- it's for anyone who wants to indulge in a delectable nibbles, tasty beverages and beautiful atmosphere in the middle of the afternoon!",N
4344,"Golden peacock embroidered doors and bright hollywood like blue illuminous lights entice you, elegantly into the world of the Hilton. Not just any Hilton but the Palmer Hilton. Door men available 24/7 becking to your every call, every eyelash, every breathe. Monroe street, named after one of the most iconic women in the world, her beauty bedazzled and created a vision. A vision many like to recreate, renew in her honour. The same can be said by the centre piece- A golden statue of Romeo and Juliet. This hotel was made in the name of love. Sure the ending was no fairytale, but what real life story is? Its the journey that counts...I dont think any couple could put that across better. This is what the Palmer is about, falling in love and leaving. The lobby was sensational, something a Leonardo Di Vinci would be proud of. In fact I don't think I'd be surprised if someone said he heard this place was being constructed so he came to life to leave his final masterpiece. A bold statement I make, true as hell I mean it. It wont disappoint you. A historical fact about this outstanding and prestigious hotel, Its the birthplace of elevators. That's right, the man that constructed this hotel had a dream. To build a hotel that kissed the sky and gave people a taste of heaven, in the most versatile, incredible city in the world- Chicago. The winds may shake my faith, they may shake my soul...But the windy city will not shake my love for it.",N
3158,"Want to stay at a hotel with rude staff? This would be it. Room wasn't ready at noon; my girlfriend at the time and I left for lunch and came back. It still wasn't ready. The next day, we were out all day and came back at 5pm. The room hadn't been made up. I tried addressing these issues with the manager and she wouldn't have anything to do with it. The only saving grace was the awesome view from the room, including Navy Pier at night. A pretty terrible W experience, when it has been good for the most part.",N
238,"I've stayed here about 10 times over the last few months, and will continue to stay here. The hotel is a bit outside of the loop, and it can be difficult to catch a cab occasionally in the morning. Great on-site fitness center, with multiple nice machines, 2 treadmills, a bike, a stair stepper and a small selection of free weights. The staff is friendly, although I've had very little interaction with them other than check-in/check-out. Rooms are clean to an 8/10 - some mildew spots on the ceiling of my shower last night and there are little details here and there that should be tended to, but good overall. Would like coffee in the lobby, but that would take away from their little coffee shop at the back of the hotel. There's a Jewel-Osco grocery store around the block if you like to buy groceries (no fridge or microwave in the room though), and the CTA Red line is around the corner also if you prefer to catch the train to downtown rather than cab.

4971,"What a relief...I came upon this sight and started reading the reviews the day before we were set to check in. I started to think I made a big mistake. Well, I am pleased to say that not only did I NOT make a mistake, I couldn't have been HAPPIER with my decision. My daughter and I had a small suite with a king bed. Yes, these rooms are a bit smaller but really people...this is an old hotel! The room was neat and clean and due to the fact that we were staying a week I was able to request a small fridge to keep snacks and drinks. The front desk staff was polite and on point, check in was a snap and requests were fulfilled promptly. I decided to try room service for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised...the food was great and well worth the price for the quantity. The last two nights of our stay my husband showed up to surprise my daughter and we were even able to get a roll-away bed for her. We didn't even notice that is was there since it fit right into the sitting area of our suite. Each time we went out and needed travel assistance the guys downstairs were more then willing to give directions, recommendations and then ensure that we had a cab right away. A BIG thank you goes to each and everyone of you who made my daughters stay ( I say that because all of her friends were at a different hotel for the National Honor Choir) in Chicago everything she could have wished for and more. She loved telling everyone that she was staying at the Allerton and that they should have too!",Y
3299,"Kinda has a rock star feel/appeal to it....which works, if you're feeling like a rockstar. ironically enough i was hanging with the amigos, who also were in town and ready to party like rockstars for one more nite in 2009. The top suite was the seen for this rowdy group, which didnt seem big enough, although it was very slickly designed. We had a great view, and the lounge, lobby, and adjoining bar made the scene complete for our big night out to see Sister Hazel. It wasn't anything super special, just looked good and over-priced...plus I think we were expecting the suite from the Hangover movie...minus the tiger, I guess. In any event, it did the job, and the chick at the desk after the show (around the 12:30-1am time frame) was unbelievably helpful and nice...just like everyone, the staff was always amazingly helpful.",N
3928,"Stayed here for the U2 concert in 2009 at Soldier Field.  Our first room was okay, if you're fine with less-than-lukewarm water.  We called down the the front desk to tell them about it.  No one came up to check on the situation after 45 minutes, so we called again.  Lo and behold, 20 minutes later, a maintenance guy shows up, saying he was checking on the wrong room.  He checks our hot water, which was about 70 degrees and asks us if that's okay.  Maybe for the end of a shower...so we got another room, 10 floors up.  This room had hot water, and frightening paintings on the wall.  Naturally, we covered them up with towels.   I had high hopes for this hotel, with it being fairly old and having some history to it.  But the fiasco that went on with our rooms, and the non-stop strike that seems to be going on outside the hotel let us down.  That and it was ridiculously expensive for what we got.",N
2804,My boyfriend and I met his mother and her friends here. They were staying for a girl's weekend getaway. Their room was fantastic. Perfect for the four ladies to enjoy themselves. Two queen beds. A very large bathroom with an awesome tub. The front room had two couches to relax on while watching tv. Very nice and clean. The bar area was open with a loud waterfall. Guests drink for free during certain hours with their room key. The ladies were happy about this. There were tables set up and it was great to catch up with everyone. They claim they will always stay at this location due to its close proximity to the sites in the city. Bike parking on the street (street sign poles).,N
4648,"I actually believe that Hotel Felix is worthy of 4.5 stars but couldn't feel good about giving them 5 because my room was located near the elevator on my floor - I could hear nearly all of the noise out in the hallway. I am not sure of there is a sound barrier issue in other rooms because my coworker was in another room (on another floor) and didn't come across the same issue. It wasn't terrible because the floor happened to be fairly quiet but the ding of the elevator's arrival during higher traffic times of the day was an annoyance. Now that I have gotten my witch ways out of the way....I can start to tell you why I am so smitten with the Hotel Felix. Here's a breakdown: 1. Location is fantastic and within walking distance of many conveniences that include Whole Foods, restaurants, bars, and shopping. This is just a short cab-ride away from practically everything else. 2) Hotel Felix did a fantastic job sticking with their Eco-friendly mission. I appreciated the fact that they utilize Organic materials, renewable resources and even the hotel's plumbing is most impressively energy efficient. Being a stickler for the word ""Eco-friendly"", they passed the test when their high-quality toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, soaps, and lotion) were all not tested on animals either! A++++ 3) Although, there is no denying that the rooms are not large in size, Hotel Felix did utilize the space extremely well. My room had a small window in the far right of the room without a good view but it still shed enough light into the space.The stylish platform bed with drawers below, closet nook, and desk all fit nicely. The decorator did an amazing job of making everything look clean, modern, and cozy without looking like an IKEA catalog.The bathroom was spacious and well thought out with a large walk-in shower, vessel sink, and cabinetry for all of my ""products' to be neatly nestled into. This could easily pass for a well manicured studio apartment in NYC without any complaints.... 4) The Westin's ""Heavenly Bed"" has some competition because this bed was so comfortable! I could have laid in it all day! I also loved the neutral color throw that was at the end of the bed. Perfect to cuddle with. 5)The staff were always incredibly friendly and efficient from the front desk to the valet. I had forgotten my toothpaste (bonehead move) and a staffer delivered to my room a large sample size and even offered up a toothbrush! 6)The restaurant on the 1st floor, Elate is fantastic! I loved my experience there so much that I am writing a separate review! I would definitely recommend Hotel Felix to anyone who is looking for a not so vanilla experience. This boutique hotel is the way to go if you need a place to stay in downtown Chicago. TIP*** Just be sure to request a room that is not across from the elevator",N
2957,"Although it's not the newest or hippest hotel in the area, it boasts of a convenient location and good staff.  It's not too close to the craziness of Magnificent Mile, but it is just close enough.  Although it sits right North of the river, it is not far away from the attractions on the South side.  The Navy Pier is also close by. Rate are affordable and the room is more than adequate.  I will stay here again.",N
4326,"In general I dislike Hiltons.  You always pay to much for what you end up getting when you stay there.   This Hilton you could buy wifi for $7 an hour in their Starbucks. And the elevators were SO FREAKING SLOW.  HORRID. Staff were not friendly - even the peeps behind the desk at the Hilton Rewards check in line were very put out by all the distasteful guests that were showing up and wanting to check in.  The nerve of us. Never again.  Not ever.  And seriously, Hilton, I am doing what I can to stay away from you in general if I can from now on.  You just are not worth the money. Its not me, its you.",N
4536,"Well, one Hilton may be annoying (i.e.) Paris, but this Hilton is glorious!  I used to hang out in their lobby just to bask in the beauty of this grand old hotel.  It's a classic.  The staff is first rate and the rooms are nice.  A fantastic location too.",N
1768,"I would definitely stay here again.  The staff were all very friendly, and it's centrally located - near the el, but chances are you'll walk everywhere.  It's next door to the Ford Cadillac Theatre, and a few other places are nearby - I recommend the Baton Club if you haven't been yet.  Our room was a nice size for the price, the mattress and pillows were new and comfortable.  No oversized tub to hang out in or big fluffy bathrobes - I missed those features.  Good room service food, and be there for the complimentary wine reception in the evenings.  Recently renovated.",N
437,"The Good: It's cheap, clean and away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Chicago. The Bad: It's away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Chicago. That's pretty much it right there. You're literally on the edge of everything and to go anywhere, it's either a mile walk, or a short cab ride (something I loathe). There's no coffee service in the room, no room-service. If you want anything to eat, you either have to take a cab somewhere, or order delivery from one of the local establishments. For those, like me, who stayed there to save money on he Hyatt (if you're attending a trade show), it's a very brisk 15 minute walk/trot to the Hyatt, and if it's cold, I wouldn't recommend it. So far, the only real plus that most other casual traveller hotels don't have, is a really deep tub to soak in (that was nice!).",N

4663,"Hotel Felix is a swanky boutique hotel downtown Chicago. Definitely a prime location if you are going to be spending a lot of time in the loop. The decor is trendy and classy. The idea of the hotel being very eco-friendly is what really drew us there and it is true. Eco-friendly products, procedures, etc. The front desk staff was very friendly  and helpful. However, the bar staff was rude and short with us and not very knowledgeable about local restaurants and sites as I would imagine they should be. The rooms were decently small and lacked some basic items, like cups. Great boutique hotel if you are willing to spend a decent amount.",N
3280,"I stayed here for NYE for two nights. It might have been a bad time to choose this particular hotel, but I still dont think I;ll be going back. The staff seemed more worried about their hair and Armani  than anything else.  When you walk off the street into the dark ""trendy"" lobby, it all just feels a little silly. We had a view of a back side of some building, and a little slice of Millenium Park. Whatever, views arn't a huge deal to me. The rooms were nice, I was a big fan of the bathroom. But...But..David Bowie was in our hotel room. On some sort of ...mirror. It was odd. If the staff hadn't been so ""better than thou"" it would have made the stay much better. The best staff people we encountered were the room service staff. They were great.",N
1285,"It would be a sin to give this Ritz anything but five stars. Everything is flawless there. It's almost too flawless. From the valet's perfectly tailored clothing to the decor with not a smidgen of dirt to be found anywhere, this Ritz puts on the Ritz in their own hotel. I must admit, I felt a little grungy when I was a guest here at the Ritz and I'm far from a grungy person. But even wearing sundresses and pants with nice tops didn't seem to be quite elegant enough for the Ritz. Had I known, I would have packed my pearls and worn tailored dresses the whole time. That's what everyone else was wearing at least. The men were in suits or should I say, ""casual suits"" during the day and the women were in the same. We were about 30 years younger than any other guest at the Ritz so maybe that's why we got so many looks. But attitudes and guest attire aside, this hotel is spectacular. The lobby is on the 12th floor of the Water Tower so don't let the street entrance fool you. That's just a precursor to the glory. You exit the first group of elevators and enter a majestic setting of floor to ceiling windows and a huge lobby, lounge and restaurant overlooking the city of Chicago with the first view being of the Hancock building. Plus, don't forget about the Roman-like fountain placed perfectly in the center of the lobby. The rooms are just as magical as the lobby. Everything is clean. Everything is quiet. I didn't hear one peep from one guest or staffer my entire stay. It's like you enter into your own little royal world when you stay in a room at the Ritz. Some highlights include: - The beds. Oh heaven...the beds. I could have slept my way through vacation but the city of Chicago deserves more from me. - The bath products. They provide L'Occitane products in the bathrooms. Splendid. - The service. Completely perfect and professional from the minute of check-in to check out and this includes the run in with the maids and the valet giving me an umbrella when it started to rain. Some tips: If you are looking for five star service, in a five star setting, in the heart of Chicago, you can't do much better than the Ritz. Be sure to find time to sit in the lounge/bar area overlooking the city for a drink and if you are there on Sunday and have the time and funds, enjoy the Sunday brunch. I didn't eat it, but the smells and appearance told me it's worth every penny! So goodbye Ritz, until hopefully one day when I can visit again. I promise next time, I'll remember to pack my pearls!",N
4461,"Stayed here for three nights.  Luckily, I got this room bundled with my flight through United Vacations, so I didn't have to pay the four star prices.  The lobby is really nice, with comfy seats perfect for grabbing a drink from the bar.   The room itself, well, it is obvious this used to be an old hotel.  Extremely small.  With only one bed in the room, one would expect it to be a king, but no, it is just a double.  The bathroom was tiny.  If you have the bathmat down, you can't open/close the door, since it will catch the bathmat.  The sink is horrible.  One of those modern giant bowls protruding from the counter and the water sprays everything on the precious little counter space.   The bed is comfortable, though, with the down comforter and duvet.  The curtains completely block out the light, which explains us sleeping until noon and one pm.  This was not uninterrupted sleep, though, as the sound from the hallway really carries through the door.  I could hear the clanging of room service trays and housekeeping staff.   The gym is adequate, but was a hunt to find.  There were treadmills, bike, ellipticals, steppers, free weights, cables, a ball and mat.  Unfortunately there are no TVs.  Signs indicated that there will be some wonderful new gym/spa.  But for now, it is located in one of the salons next to conference rooms.   Overall, the location is great.  Next to the red line, couple blocks from the blue line connecting to O'hare.  If I were to get a decent rate again, I'd stay here, but I wouldn't preferentially chose it.",N
387,"This hotel is definitely in a prime location on the mag-mile. That being said, watch out for the homeless people that prey on tourists over here after dark. Lol. That aside, the hotel itself is good. I mean, it's standard. Now that I've been living in Chicago for the past few years I have been to way nicer hotels, but for the price and the location, the Hilton Garden Inn has much to offer. The pool is very clean and the business center is completely accessible. The service was good and everyone was pretty friendly. Even at 5 AM when we checked out, the person on duty was very attentive and helpful. Also, I need to add that the Weber Grill attached to the building is definitely tastey and convenient. As far as I know, the Hilton Garden Inn does not offer as many local discounts as some of the other Hilton hotels in the area (like the Palmer House). It is nicely decorated, but isn't by any means any competition to the Wit, James, Palmer House, Drake, etc. I wasn't disappointed with this hotel at all and it offered some pretty fantastic views of downtown Chicago.",N
3721,"Probably my favorite hotel in Chicago.  I have stayed here several times for leisure and absolutely love everything about it.  Unlike some of the other Chicago hotels, it has retained its classic, elegant decor despite the push to become ultra modern.  It has all of the amenities of a first-class hotel and very friendly and kind staff.  I just feel great staying at the Drake.  This is a great place to come for those looking to spend a fun weekend in the city.  Never pretentious and always timeless, the Drake is the best place in Chicago to hide out from the  and bustle of city life while still having access to all of the great things this city offers. I especially like the interior decoration and the suites with a lake-view.  In comparison with similar European luxury hotels, the Drake really is not too expensive.  So I really do hope you treat yourself and someone special to this fine Chicago institution.",N
3036,"I felt like a sleeze in this place. It was not classy at all. It was like trashy trendy. The rooms are soooo beyond outdated and the wooden shutters that hide the bathroom from the rest of the room?...Ew.  Who in the world came up with that idea? Did they assume everyone would be married and totally turned on by the sights sounds and smells of each others bathroomtime? I was only here for my job but upon immediately finding out that the W was where we were planted, I reserved myself a completely different hotel and I'm glad. My coworker said she didnt sleep a wink that night because the AC was so freakin loud. Room service was terribly slow (60 min wait time) and the food arrived cold (should've known)...  The dessert with icecream on the side was totally melted.  They sent us back up new orders at no cost and the food was much faster/better that time. Thank goodness. I am glad I got to experience this place for free because it was about the same class as a trendied up days inn.",N
5745,"Stayed here for one night while I was in town to catch a rock show at the Empty Bottle club (maybe 3-4 miles away and Crowne Plaza is one of the closer hotels to it).  Got a good deal on the room and I've stayed at CP's in other cities when going to shows and events, so I'm kinda used to them.   The desk staff, as usual for a CP, were not great, but were decent.  The concierge and doormen were somewhat better. The bathroom seemed pretty clean and new, and the room had a balcony which was a nice touch if it didn't overlook a freeway/ parking lot/ garage.  Nope, you're not paying for ""view"" here.  The balcony is also secluded by concrete walls from adjoining balconies, which made me feel somewhat more secure than if it hadn't been. What did NOT make me feel secure was the doors that could be opened to connect my room to the adjoining room.  The door on my side did NOT lock securely - the deadbolt would only go a little way in instead of the whole way in, causing the door to be able to be opened with a good punch, kick or vibration.  Sure enough, a party of loud young guys showed up to stay in the room next door and opened the door on their side thinking probably it was a closet (same mistake I made initially).  The walls between our rooms were paper thin and I could clearly hear these bro's conversation, plus I could hear when they went out on the balcony and started yelling to their buddy down in the parking lot.  Fortunately they went out after that, and I didn't have much luggage with me, so I put my few valuables in the storage safe and went out to the show.  I thought about asking for a room change but I was on a tight schedule so I just decided to put up with it. I got home about 2:30 am and my door was still ""kinda locked"" and the next door room was quiet, so I went to sleep.  I woke up at 6:30 am to find that the door on my side of the room was open like it had been pushed or vibrated open.  The door to the next room was shut.  Nothing like my purse or money (all of which was out on the nightstand next to my bed) had been taken which made me think the door either vibrated open or the guys next door made a mistake again, realized it and then locked their door and left me alone, but it was scary, especially since some of the patrons of this hotel are kinda skeezy looking (though not all; there were some families with little kids, some budget-tourist couples and the like as well - basically a mix of what looks like budget/ family travelers and people who want a room to party all night).  I told the desk girl about the bad door lock and she seemed concerned and said she'd have someone fix it right away.   On the plus side, I had the mushroom ravioli from the restaurant for dinner.  It was reasonably tasty and came with some rolls and herbed honey butter that were REALLY tasty.  Better than what I expected from a place like this. Edited:  It's now a couple months down the road and the more I think about that situation with the door that didn't lock, the creepier I feel about what could have happened, especially given that some of the people staying at this particular hotel looked pretty dern ghetto, so in retrospect, I'm gonna knock it down a star.  I really can't recommend this place at all after an experience like that.",N
5428,"My son and I stayed here for a Cubs baseball trip . It's location is great about a mile from Wrigley Field . You can walk it or catch the bus . It had been a Comfort Inn years ago . Check in was quick and the room we occupied # 112 a bit dated . The neighborhood Lincoln Pk/Lakeview offers alot to do . So we did not spend alot of time in the room .  The room was however clean and nothing I could complain about . Water pressure was fine and there was plenty of hot water . Contnl breakfast was cereal,juice,muffins, toast and fresh coffee . For the price of $ 109.00 two beds I thought was fair . Yes we would stay there again .",Y
507,"By far, one of the best deals on a nice hotel in Chicago.  My mom stays here when she comes to visit, and after seeing some of the other hotels she has stayed ta in the city this is by far my favorite.  The rooms are two room suites, which give you tons of space.  Free breakfast with made to order omlettes, yum- I tried them and they get 5 stars for sure!  Free open bar from 5 to 7 I think.  This hotel is blocks away from Navy Pier and blocks away from Michigan Ave.  I think the average price for a night is about $115, which is super cheap for downtown.  Very clean and all of the staff seemed very pleasant.  I would recommend it for anyone looking for a nice hotel on a budget right downtown.",N
1226,"The hotel itself is fine (facilities, staff, etc.). However, unless you are attending a conference at the attached convention center (and do not plan on doing anything else in Chicago), do not stay here! THERE IS NOTHING AROUND THIS HOTEL! 1 star if you are not attending a conference.",N
3774,"This was my 2nd stay so an updated review. WIFI is still free and this time is was very fast. A definite upgrade from last time. I was on the 23rd floor with a corner suite. The room was spacious with a separate living area and bedroom. A couple complaints about the room: - The sliding doors between the living and bedroom never stayed open and would constantly slide closed. -The living area was very large but a lot of wasted space. There was a kitchen area which was nice and also 3 tall bar stools. However, they were randomly placed and there was no bar or a kitchen table to use them with. I feel as though someone took the table out and never replaced. -TV selection really small and only 1 remote was annoying -Phones did not work in the room and when told they never came to fix. Overall, I'll stay again. The restaurant, AJA is good. The check in is quick and the service is great. The rooftop is very nice. The location is awesome. An easy walk down state and to michigan. lots of good eats and shopping nearby as well.",N
3903,"Stayed here 11/4/11 for the weekend. I am never one to complain and I usually make the best of any mediocre or sub par situation, i think trips are what you make them with your attitude, but this hotel was awful for the price. Long story, but we got 2 nights at the hotel from a friend who couldn't make the trip. That being said it was ok since we paid half of what he paid for it. At $170 a night for two people (before taxes/fees), I was appalled by the experience. I have stayed at nicer hotels on Michigan Ave. for cheaper and with better amenities for the price. I can't believe what hotels think they can get away with. We had a double room on the top floor, it was tiny and felt like a dorm. The view was an interior room of the other side of the north tower we were in. There were two beds when clearly in the past this room was made for one bed. The bathroom door wouldn't even open all the way from the bed being in the way. Our room was so hot, it was unbearably uncomfortable. Maybe it is common, but I have been in hundreds of hotels and have never had a room where you couldn't choose between having AC or heat.  I realize this hotel is old (it definitely needs updates) but the entire hotel was set for heat. Our window only opened 2 inches and we had to keep the room door open whenever we were in the room just so we wouldn't be smothered by the temperature. For the cost you think you could get something nice out of it. Asking for a fridge was extra. Internet was $11 a day. Room service was average and overpriced, not available late at night, and are subject to 11% tax, added gratuity, and a delivery charge! I just hate added fees. The mattress and bedding was the cheapest I've experienced at any hotel. You could feel every spring and the linens were scratchy and thin (not that you needed them to stay warm). The website for this hotel is EXTREMELY deceiving!!! It looks like the pictures for this hotel were taken 30 yrs ago. The same could be said about the pictures the hotel features on its postcards, in room service binders, and room keycards. The furniture is not the same even in the lobby. The furnishings and decor do not match the styling or updates made decades ago. Parking was $28 a day. Nuff said. Only pros: location right on Michigan Ave, flat screen tv, clean room/bathroom, nice concierge.",N
860,"Great place to stay! Got the free room upgrade with the yelp checkin. Front desk staff very friendly. Very clean sheets and comfortable. Rooms are very relaxing, as well as lobby. Made me feel right at home. Very good central location.",N
3181,The room and hotel was very trendy. I loved the view from the elevators and some of the rooms. Everything is very close. I stayed with 3 other girls and it wasn't too expensive. I would definitely suggest this hotel for anyones stay.,N
1751,"Not my first time in a Kimpton and I can't complain because I booked 2 king rooms at $105 a night!  Crazy deal in the summer in Chicago.  This hotel was in a great location and we walked most everywhere or took cabs which were about $8 plus tip to most locations.   Hotel Pros: Great Location Cool old building updated to modern features Really fun lobby Free wine at 5 (my favorite) Clean rooms Quiet location Great deal Kimpton Points and free internet with my rewards membership Good water pressure in shower Aveda products (don't have to lug shampoo) Free coffee Hotel Cons: Door lock broke and engineer had to come replace it (but gave us a $30 comp) Power blew with hairdryer use (took 30 mins to get power on - building is old) Slow / busy elevators VERY small rooms (but we expected this in the city) THIN walls (you can hear your neighbors) Bar downstairs sucks - tried to use our comp there and the cocktails were HORRIBLE (but they gave us something else b/c we told them so) In the Loop - ideally would have liked to stay river north but this location was worth the price savings Restaurant ACROSS the street from the Cadillac theater is awesome - but closed on Sat and Sun Hotel restaurant was overpriced and not that good for breakfast Would I stay here again?  Probably if I got as good of a deal.  Not necessarily a 4 star hotel though, more like 3  1/2.  I still can't hate on Kimpton though.",N
2786,"I love the modern take on this hotel. The little things like the vintage luggage ""art work"" in the lobby was cool, and bed style with pictures not hung but layed on top of the head board was unique. Location is definitly a plus. Being in the River North area, not far from many phenominal eating and entertainment spots, along with the Red Line a very few short blocks away. I thought the elevator was very shotty. That was the only thing that really showed the age of the building. I might as well of been walking on concrete in the room, because there was no padding at all, but hey, those are just litte things. Overall, The James is a great stay. The price was fair, but I believe it was a stay 2 nights and get one free special at the time. Truthfully, I wouldn't stay there if there wasn't a special though. J Bar is also a plus if you want to finish off the night with a couple cocktails right in your hotel.",N
1567,"4 stars for the location.. In the heart of downtown, right by the River and Trump Tower, near Michigan Ave and the Bean at Millennium Park! Too bad didn't get around, was on a business trip.. The room was clean, although the bath tub wouldn't drain. I'm not the complaining type so I just left a note to housekeeping and they had it fixed the next day. Room service was very good. Had an awesome Chicken Salad sandwich with a side of fresh fruit salad. In the morning, the good ol' egg white omelet with side of fresh berries oatmeal. The room was also quiet (maybe because I was on 28th floor!) but there is plenty of action if you have time to check out the city.",N
5170,What can a say?  What a let down.  I have stayed at the W Lakeshore and enjoyed the contemporary design but this place is laughable in comparison.  Thank god they didn't destroy the beautiful ceilings and marble with tacky furniture and design.  The room was quiet and we had a narrow outward view.  Bedding was cheap and the bathroom felt dated with a paint job.  Another thing I noticed immediately upon entry is that the front desk is hidden away in a corner.  I probably won't stay here again unless there is some sort of mega-sale.  NOT a fan.,Y
1881,"EVERYTHING was fine BESIDES the room size. I stayed in a horriblely small room. I guess it was a standard room, but if I'd known it was very cramped I would of paid for a bit more. The next day I checked out and stayed at the W - Lakeshore and have been extremely happy ever since. The location at W - City Center is a bit better for transportational purposes than Lakeshore, but that's really it.",N
2868,"Lobby: nice Elevator: meh Room: ick! The beds are great and that's about all. The room is old and run down and it feels like you are staying at someone's house that has lived there for 30 years. Also, the room has a terrible stale stench to it. Other cons: have to pay for wifi and gym use and there isn't an iPod dock in the rooms. Staff is fine, but certainly not great. I'll stay somewhere else next time.",N
4888,"The Staff at the dana is amazing... Adriano, a staff member,  was the ""hero of the night"". I had lost everything i had on me.. And by an hour later..Adriano had everything back in my hands.. He is beyond a true professional and someone who goes beyond the job..... and i will be back to the Dana Spa And Hotel for any event because of Adriano.. XoXo",Y
797,"yes, this is what a moderately expensive hotel is supposed to be.  it is always always always the same; service, rooms, healthclub (well that's actually been upgraded in the past few years).  you can't find a nicer valet guy...wish i could remember his name cuz he always remembers mine, like a scene from a movie.  not that i even stay there thaaaaat often but this older gentleman always says, ""Ms. my last name, you're back.  Good to see you.  How's Champaign?"" the crowd here is so focused on work that you never feel like wishing it was ok to shush people...everyone is already shushed.  i've never had a single bad experience here.",N
4749,"Stayed here for a weekend . Very convenient location.   I had minimal interaction with the staff, but the check in was quick and easy.  Really nice boutique hotel.  The rooms are great.  Very clean, modern decor.  Several convenient parking options in the area.  The hotel offers free parking if you drive a hybrid car- which is a huge bonus if you qualify because parking anywhere in the city will cost you an arm and a leg.",Y
1253,Checked in for participating a conference. Quite high rate.,N
2701,I am only rating this four stars instead of five just because it's older..It's pretty clean though and very nice.  The people that work there are very nice and helpful in the lobby.  It's right across the street from Trader Joes which is awesome.  The downstairs restaurant is super as well.  We have had Thanksgiving dinner there twice and really enjoyed it.,N
5491,You could not ask for a better location. My wedding was at the Newberry so this was a super convenient place for us as well as out of town guests to stay. The rooms were nice and the beds comfortable. Staff was friendly and helpful. Definitely a great option if you want something in the heart of the gold coast.,N
3142,"I dig the ultra modern, sleek vibe at the bar here. Both the lobby and the Whiskey Sky bar are pretty cool (in addition to the bathrooms!). It's definitely a mixed crowd up in here, but it's a great spot for chilling with some drinks in a hip setting. The mojitos were great.",N
1213,"I stayed in this hotel while attending a conference in McCormick Place West, and it was pretty nice.  The location was very convenient, so after working a full day on the exhibit room floor, I could escape to my room pretty easily, just by walking over the bridgeway. There isn't much around it to do though, so if you're looking for more to do in the evening than stay in and watch TV, you should try for something further north.  It is close to Chinatown, though you should drive there or take a cab.  There's a patch of a bad neighborhood between McCormick Place and there, so walking is not a good choice. But the room was nice (mine had a little bonus living room area), room service was excellent (better than a Westin I stayed at a few days later), and everyone there was welcoming and friendly.  There's an attached parking garage, with valet available, and you can easily get to downtown or down to 55 from there.",N
1611,"One of the best hotels I've stayed at!  Great room, great service and great location!!  Just need a better tv, but hey it's Chicago so who needs tv ;)",N
2175,"Ah, the venerable Intercontinental.  You definitely get the charm of an old fashioned grand hotel here.  Lobby is spacious yet comfortable and navigable.   The pool is special, if you like to hang out at indoor pools when you travel - probably great for the winter.  My hotel preferences lean towards the modern Hyatt -style places for business trips, but vacations feel more like vacations when you stay at a place like this. Pros: * surprisingly quiet * elegant without being pretentious * comfortable rooms with nice amenities * old building that doesn't feel like one * if you or your significant traveling buddy live to shop, then you can't beat this location and hotel - I can't think of a better place in Chicago to drop after you've shopped. Cons: * my room was really small - not much room to move around * limited views of anything but Michigan Ave (which is not really that bad actually)",N
4765,"Our reservation was for 2 people. Two people whom were not a couple. We were given ONE King bed room and told that's all there was. This room was book well in advance but we were treated as if we walked in off the street. This over priced room small as a closet, to make it worse early am I was woken up by the people in the room next to us having sex. I'm no prude but I could not believe the walls were that thin. No worries it was over quick, LOL and I was back to sleep. Getting my car from valet the next day was another story in its self. Bad Hotel, Bad Service!",Y
919,"This place was great! I was drawn to it because of the historic building, and I loved all the design touches. The rooms are lovely and the hallways still look like old office buildings. Our window had a great view. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and unpretentious. The location was very convenient, we were able to walk around the Loop and we very close to parks. The bed was comfortable and the room was nice and quiet. I recommend it and plan to stay there again.",N
3497,"I visited Chicago for a quick event in October, and was so surprised by the southern hospitality.  I loved it.  From the moment I stepped out of the cab to the moment the Bell Man saw me off the following morning at 4:00 AM... I felt like they cared about making an impression.  Without request I was offered a room upgrade which ended up being a mini-suite.  I loved it. I have and will continue to recommend this historic, yet posh hotel to my friends and clients.  Bravo!",N
2713,"I loved my stay here!!!  I loved my room!  So spacious, I felt like I had a studio apt. in the heart of Chicago!  The bed was great, the shower had great pressure...though a little slow on drainage.  I loved the lobby and the service from David Burke's restaurant.  We took bikes out for a ride on the Lakeshore path.  And we took advantage of the hotels driver to get us around.  I loved the decor and the location -across the street from Starbucks and Trader Joe's.  Plus it's a block or two off Michigan...great location....definitely I'll stay here again.  I've stayed at the Dana which is just a block or so away...and I prefer the James....I like carpet and not so many windows.  Sleep well.  Cheers!",N
1530,"A pleasant surprise, indeed. I have driven, and walked by Hotel 71 countless times- and somehow I always got the impression that it was an outdated hotel in a great location. Well, I was wrong. Very wrong. I had a Groupon to stay at Hotel 71 for less than $100 a night. Quite the feat for this part of town. Given that the rate was so low- I chose to upgrade to one of their King River View Rooms for a few more dollars. An excellent choice as my room was on the 12th floor- and looked right down the Chicago River, and all its bridges- a beautiful view day or night. When I arrived at the hotel- the valet took my car ( a little pricey at $43 but in line with other places in the area) and I walked up to the front desk. The front desk clerk was welcoming and pleasant and had no issue in dealing with my Groupon or the special request that I had of him. You see- I was staying in town to go to a concert and I had a couple of tickets I was leaving for friends at the front desk. Given the value of the tickets and the fact that the concert was that night- there was little margin for error. He said it wouldn't be a problem, they do it all the time and he was right. My friends picked up the tickets with no problem. Nice. My room was large with a plush king sized bed with tons of pillows. The bathroom was also large and came with only a shower- no tub. The amenities were similar to a mid range hotel- nice but not luxurious. The towels functional but not sumptuous. The toiletries fine but not high end. But all in all a good deal for the money all the way around. If you want something to eat there is a cafe on the ground floor and of course room service. All it seemed to be lacking to me was a bar area where I could have had a drink while waiting on a friend of mine. But since the weather was so fine- I wandered across the river and had a few outside at Smith and Wollensky instead. Check out was seamless. The valet brought my car out in less than 5 minutes and I was on my way. But not before thinking was a great deal this hotel is- right in the heart of the city!",N
2450,"Whenever I have the opportunity to recommend a hotel to anyone, I always give them the Hilton as my first choice. All the history behind this place, combined with the comfort and overpowering amenities make it a great place to stay. The bars downstairs are great, and the food in the restaurants are above standard for hotel food for sure. There is also a lounge area next to the check-in desk as you would find in most hotel lobbies, but they do an exceptional job of keeping in mind that this is a classy place. The only downfall is that it's a little far south if you're coming here soley to shop. If you're going for comfort and convenience to the loop, you are crazy if you don't consider booking.",N
765,"The best hotel stay I have ever had.  A whole lot of bang for very little buck.  I mean, it's the price of every other Westin, only this one is right off of Lakeshore - so minutes away from fun in the sun.  It's right across the street from the Hancock center.  It's on the same street as ALL the amazing shopping any obsessed shopper (like me) would ever want.  AMAZING LOCATION!  It's right in the middle of everything.  I loved it! When I first walked in - it was like no other Westin.  The lobby is long and beautiful.  The room was nothing extravagant but still nice.  And the beds were perfect.  We had a great view of that little courtyard area in front of the Hancock center.  I loved that they had a gym - so my gym schedule wasn't interrupted.  The staff was very informative of the happenings around town.  Especially with the nightlife!  I will DEFINATELY stay here again when I come back to the Chi :)",N
1527,"I'm not certain how to go about this review...  How about a pro/con list Pros:   nice hotel. I think it was recently remodeled. Nice sized bathroom From the 28th floor the views are nice There is a closet in the bathroom which I find very helpful because I had to leave before my wife and baby son woke up. If you don't have a fridge, they will get you one Great location ... In the heart of the city Friendly staff - they must be trained well with customer service Big rooms Fast elevators Cons: No pool No continental breakfast Small elevators - but they are fast and it really isn't an issue AC is by the window and doesn't cool evenly Pros beat Cons by 4 stars",N
5800,"Noisy hotel, small bathrooms, dimly lit.......ambulances and sirens will keep you up at night. Could hear the guy next door throwing his shoes on the floor and taking a shower. Comon! Did they ever think of sound proofing? Bellman was great though, as was the concierge...",N
1887,"I arrived here at about 11 PM on a Sunday night exhausted, grouchy, and a little irritated after a 4 hour flight from San Francisco.  I had a 7 AM meeting and work to finish before I went to bed. The lobby itself was beautiful, low lighting, candles, modern furniture but a little small but still very chic.  A lot cooler than the one in my hometown of SF.  Sorry.  :-(   My room was nice, big king sized bed, flat screen TV, desk, the usual amenities for a nice hotel.   Things I didn't like: - $20 plus breakfast of oatmeal and coffee.  WTF?  Is it organic oatmeal?  Is the coffee hand delivered by Juan Valdez?  I know there is a premium for room service but it's just oatmeal.   - Ugly views, really, my window faced another brick building and was located near the train.   - Pretentious front desk staff.  Do I sense a little snobbiness?  I can tell when you're being rude, and acting catty, I maybe sleepy, tired, but I'm not STUPID!  I would appreciate it if in the future you didn't give me certain looks. You know which one, ""I wish you'd hurry up...""  or ""This smile is fake, but I'm doing it because my manager is watching me.""   A ho hum experience, nothing spectacular.",N
2625,"I will never stay here again. I've had better service at the best western. Where do I start... 1. Did not follow thru on a promotion running (stay 3 nights, get 1 free) even though we booked on time - we contacted the manager twice via email about adjusting our bill but never responded to us! Once they get your money at the time of reservations, forget about it after that. Their non refundable reservations are a bunch of BS! 2. Projection TV did not work 3. Toilet stopped working mid-stay 4. Maid service did not clean room one day -- arrived at 5pm after a day out on the town to find a dirty room. 5. Stained couches and filthy shag rug 6. My friend forgot a gift for her baby in the room, no one followed up with us about the forgotten gift. For a boutique and fashionable hotel, the service and follow through is horrible. Not worth your money at all! It was a horrible place to spend my birthday weekend in Chicago.",N
3174,"I like that this W has a living room, cozy feel looking out over the lake.  The rooms are pretty cool, especially when you have the SPG points and get a  lake-side view.  I also really enjoyed room service.  As far as W Hotels go, this is one of my favorite ... but both of the Chicago ones are cozy.",N
105,This is the old Cass Hotel...Which is originally why I started staying there on my weekend trips to Chicago. Call me vain :) The staff are always friendly and the rooms are clean. They do a great job with their loungey area and the decor is very mod. It's totally centrally located right off of Michigan and in the heart of all the shopping (If that's important to you). The rooms are teensy-weensy so do not be surprised. The walls are a little thin too as it's a very old building.  It always ends up being one of the cheapest stays which has kept me coming back...Even though they ditched my namesake.,N
2091,So much fun to stay here. Fantastic location and good size room. The view from the bar at night is a must see. Room service was pretty good.,N
5165,"When I walked in, I was taken aback because it looked like a club during happy hour.  It took me two laps to find the concierge and check-in (go straight back, to the left).Pros:The king bed was super comfy and I didn't want to get up in the mornings.The music and club atmosphere I actually enjoyed.  It made the experience different, new, and memorable rather than the typical hotels with the granda-esque drapes, blankets, and carpets that make you feel like you're in a 1950's hotel or your grandma's house.The concierge was friendly.  He made reservations at a local restaurant and called a cab for us.They have Bliss Spa products in the bathroom!!!Everyone there were young professionals.  Its definitely a popular happy hour spot.  We started at the lobby bar, went out for the night, and ended up back at the lobby bar for a night cap.  Then I just walked to the elevator and up to my room.  That was too easy :)Cons:The train is half a block away and could wake you up.There is a halogen light outlining the bed with its own light switch, kinda neat but kinda annoying.  I thought the glam factor was a bit overdone in the rooms.  They should keep that in the lobby.Watch out for the $8 Fiji water's in the room!  There's a 7-11 next door, dunkin donuts and subway across the street.They charge for internet/wifi ($15/day) unless you have a corporate deal.The bartender's didn't seem to have a very broad knowledge of drinks, but they were accommodating to our requests.There is no Bliss Spa at this location :(Overall:I will be staying here again next time I visit Chicago.",Y
4209,"The Regency Hyatt...is one of my 4 favorite hotels in the city (others being Sofitel, Swissotel, and W). Basically, it offers the most luxurious rooms you will ever experience anywhere, and saying you get much more than you pay for is an understatement. Thick, soft pillow top beds, Oreck air purifiers with ionizer and fragrance inserts, ipod docking station, 5-disc cd changer, large-screen tv, fresh tulips, white callas, or some other exotic variety of long-stem flower in a crystal vase in your room daily, solid cherrywood furniture, brass desk lamps, memory foam pillows with extra pillows and blanket in the closet, 600 thread-count Egyptian cotton sheets and comforter that feel like silk against the skin, and the bathrooms...aaaaahh...no expense spared on anything! The layout of the rooms represents a perfect melding of design, aesthetics, and  function.   I have ABSOLUTELY no complaints or disappointments, and that says a lot because I am one picky bastard. Expect rooms to run about $180-237 per night. Also, when you're confirming your reservation, ask for a complementary upgrade to a king on the Regency Club level floor (this is the limited access uppermost penthouse floor). If you're lucky, one will be available at no extra charge and you will be privy to one of the best views of Chicago. This is one of the few hotels that will make you feel guilty upon check-out and as you settle your bill...knowing you would have gladly paid $200-300 more a night for the kind of luxury you enjoyed during your stay.   I can go on and on about the Hyatt, but  I will stop here because the 4-star+ ratings already speak to how amazing your stay will be. RECOMMENDATION: YES...DO the Hyatt Regency EVERY CHANCE YOU GET! Special occasions, for a weekend of downtown partying, whatever excuse you can think up to get you there! Get a king room on one of the upper floors (if you can, do the Regency Club level...there is no better view of the city). Try their website's special promotions when you're booking first, but if you're only seeing $200+, then hit Priceline or Hotwire...they tend to have the best deals for all of the nicer Chicago-area hotels. I also suggest parking your car in the garage about a block away (can't think of the name of the street for sure...but just off Wacker and Columbus Dr..by the bridge). That garage is not affiliated with the Hyatt, but only charges $26 a day.  If you do Hyatt's parking/valet service, expect about $46 (after taxes) a day with in/out privilege. I know...OUCH! ...but hey...it's Chicago. Also: Lobby level floor...huge open restaurant, lower-lobby level...bar/lounge area where drinks are served in the evenings. You will also find the Hard Drive nightclub here, which is situated in the middle of a fountain/pool...so surrounded by water. Check out pics. DISCLAIMER: My experience is limited to the Regency Club penthouse level, however, I had many friends stay in regular king rooms and reported experiences similiar to my own.",N
1940,"Definitely not up to par with other Ws, but considering the area, it's not a bad place to stay for business.  The rooms are a little cramped (even the upgraded rooms), but it's clean and the Living Room can be pretty entertaining.",N
3353,"Chicago's Essx Inn was the perfect hotel for my boyfriend and I on our first trip to Chicago. We stayed for a long weekend and needed a cheap hotel that was on Michigan Ave (as to have easy access to all the sights). We checked in very late (almost midnight on a Thursday) and were still greeted as if it were a bright and sunny summer day. Our room was a little on the small side, but last time I checked the purpose of a hotel room is to sleep, change clothes, nap, and shower. This room was definitely adequate, but not 5-star quality. The bathroom was a bit small... especially the sink! I could put my hand over the sink and it could easily span the diameter. The light in the toilet/shower part of the bathroom was pretty dim, but they do have one of those timed heated lights to turn on if you'd like. The features in the room itself included a nicely sized mini-fridge, a flat-screen TV with plenty of channels (including many HBO channels, too), and a heater. The heat system is a radiator, and although it has an ""auto""/""manual""/""off"" switch, when it turns on to heat up the room, it made a loud clanking noise that all of us who have ever had radiators and gas heat are very familiar with. We would keep the heat on during the day while we were out and shut it off at night. The room was very very comfy (not cold at all) even when it was below freezing outside. The pool and fitness area is one of the best I've ever been to at a hotel. The pool has multiple lanes for swimming laps and goes from 3 feet to 8 feet deep. It isn't very cold, so in the winter (when we were there) it was very refreshing. There is also a lifeguard on staff, which many hotels don't have. There is a dry sauna, but no hot tub. The fitness room has a number of cardio machines, weight equipment, mats, and stability balls, along with TVs. The hotel has free continental breakfast on weekday mornings, a restaurant on the first floor (although it was being renovated during my stay), and a free shuttle bus that takes you all the way up Michigan Ave to downtown (by the John Hancock Tower, etc.). We didn't use the shuttle because location of the hotel is fantastic. There are lots of bars in the area, a few restaurants, but when we wanted to go to any of the touristy stuff (Millenium Park, Art Institute, Chinatown) we would just walk. We even walked from the hotel all the way downtown and then to Navy Pier! It was a pretty long walk, but that's city life for you! And if walking isn't your thing, there are a number of subway and Metra light rail stops nearby. It took us 5 minutes to walk to a Metra light rail stop to go south to the Museum of Science and Industry. So easy! My boyfriend and I definitely want to go back to Chicago again, and I expect we'll stay at the Essex Inn upon our return!",N
4091,"Please do something about the protesting!  There have been many days that I've been awakened by the Hyatt Employee protests, and last night was an overnight protest - I don't appreciate being awakened in the middle of the night or early in the morning by whistles, drums, and people yelling, and I'm sure your guests don't appreciate this either!  PLEASE NEGOTIATE WITH YOUR EMPLOYEES AND END THESE PROTESTS ALREADY!!!",N
1966,"one word describes the w city center, ""issues"". not grandma drives me crazy issues, but i forgot to take my meds and dont know why this gun is in my hand issues. stayed at one their nicer rooms on the 20th floor for my girlfriend's birthday, so it wasn't a broom closet like the other reviews mentioned. on first glance it is a very nice room with widescreen lcd tv, california king bed with a stuffed plum, and a large bathroom. it all gets lost when you notice the details. the toilet was large to match the room size, but so big my girlfriends feet didnt touch the floor when sitting on it. the shower was very tall with bliss products, but the shower curtain looked like someone ran out to target and got one that wasn't long enough. there was only one robe and a few hangers for two people. i called the service desk  or ""style manager"" as they call them every day for four days before we finally got the extra robe and hangers. they were supposed to have a birthday surprise in the morning of my girlfriend's birthday. it never happened, i called the concierge and noone answered. i could stall no longer so we had to go down to the concierge and see what happened. they apologised saying that noone noticed it in the ""system"". with the surprise no longer there, they offered to have whatever my girlfriend wanted waiting for her later. they got it wrong and delivered at the wrong time so we ran into them setting it up, but it was there.. went to the lobby the next morning to see the real problem. rich high school kids decked in d&g trying to impress their white trash girlfriends. by making the W's patented whatever/whenever service do their ridiculous requests like fill the bathtub with m&m's, the rest of the guests received whatever they wanted whenever they could get around to it if possible. we left and i forgot a vanity bag on the batroom shelf. i call the ""style manager"" who was not available and left a message that was never returned. on the positive, the bed was extremely comfortable with great sheets so we slept well and bliss products were a nice way to wake up. the whiskey blue bartender was friendly and poured drinks so strong you were thankful that you only had to stumble to the elevator. i would have been floored if this was a super 8, but this is a 'W'...",N
4335,"This is a wonderful old hotel.  It is huge.  I got lost multiple times trying to find my room or the elevators, although I suspect this might have been affected by my intake of alcohol. It is a great location, right next to the L plus across the street from the millineum park.  Lots of restaurants within a short walk (try Exchecker!) My room was very nice and relatively spacious.  I say ""relatively"" because i saw some of my coworkers rooms and they did not get the HHonors upgrade like I did.  Everything worked well and the toiletries were not the standard Hilton stuff. The only negatives I experienced were the fact that they do not have wireless Internet in the rooms. Finally, the lobby is gorgeous, both in architecture and in the patrons who we filling every available seat happily drinking.  We took occasion to eat at the Lockwood Grill based on my Yelp research and I was not disappointed.  Plus I could charge it to my room and get even more HHonors points!",N
5384,We stayed at this hotel in April 2010. It's an excellent location with L train service a few steps from the entrance of the hotel. Staff here is very friendly and accommodating. The suite we had was on the small side and because it's an older building a little noisier but still very charming. Walgreens is a block away and plenty of places to grab a bite to eat. My favourite is the Pot Belly Sandwich shop across the street. Good soup and Sandwiches.,Y
1377,"This maybe the best hotel that I have ever visited, based on service.   First, we arrived about 3 hours before scheduled check-in and they let us into our room with no added fee.   Second, they had the most comfortable bed that I have ever slept in.   Third, they had a huge shower with the rainfall spout. The room was a little small, but we were only there to sleep. Fourth, they had a couple very helpful concierges.  They made some great restaurant recommendations and were able to get us tickets to a show and give us bus/train information. Fifth, on our check-out day, we were up late the night before and got a late check-out, at no extra cost. Sixth, after our late check-out, they kept our bags at the hotel for six hours until our flight left, at no extra charge.   When it seems like some places nickel and dime you for everything, this place was a welcome relief.     Also, it is a great location, about a block from the Hancock Tower and Michigan Avenue.  If you are in town to shop, this is ground zero for upscale shops.",N
408,"Had a small group meeting here. Hilton Garden Inns typically are great properties and really emphasize good service for a very moderately priced hotel. This location is ideal - the Hancock building was visible from my window, Nordstroms was across the street, the Weber Grill restaurant on site was quite good (and fun), and we were within walking distance of many other sights.",N
3806,"The 4 stars are for the hotel tranquility suite and lounge. The spa was horendous, 0 stars. SPA - MASSAGE:  The massage I asked for was a deep tissue massage.  She asked what I wanted the focus on, I said back.   The pressure was too weak.  She spent too much time on the legs and arms and not what I asked for which was my back.   Definitely a waste of money. SPA -FACIAL: I got the microdermabrasion facial. It was OK, But very poor on extractions. SPA facilities- poor, the lockers did not work, I had to switch two times before one worked to lock properly.  The lockers were way to small for winter wear.  There are not enough sink area in the women's spa.  There is not makeup seat area.  The sitting room was too small for the amount of people. The spa handlers did not care or notice that there was not enough room in the seating room. The SPA was very disappointing. However, the HOTEL and Club (Vertigo) were ok,pretty nice. HOTEL- TRANQUILITY SUITE - rm 901 Bathroom- The bathroom mirrors with the built in lights are great.  However, there was no makeup seat in there.  Don't they think what a lady would like? The Shower was very large with two benches.  It is a shower for two and it would have been wonderful if the side jets were working, but they were not.  The water pressure on the handheld jet was extreme and I loved it. Great bathrobe. Bed- too soft. Firm mattress with a euro top is the only way to go. Living room section- Nice flooring.  Nice wine selection. Movie selection was bad, I wanted to see the Facebook movie, but not available.  poor movie selection, needs more intellectual-type, based on true story, movies and more cerebral comedies. 2 balconies, nice views, cute, there was snow on the ledges, awww. I love the amount of light and the different window shading that is available to block out the light. LOUNGE (Vertigo)- very nice bartender. very nice host guys that gave us a blanket when we went outside to sit by the firepit in the external winter bar. kind of cool. Nice view, nice feel to the place. cool without trying too hard or being snobby.  Instead helpful as a place should be to its clientele.",N
2,"I have walked by the Tokyo Hotel countless times. It reminds me of the type place that Peter Parker lives in in the Spiderman movies, Or the sort of place Marla Singer might live in, or maybe it is a carbon copy of the Hotel Zamenhof. Basically it is scuzzy and sleazy, through and through it is a fleabag, and I love it. Yesterday I finally walked in. I don't know why. Maybe because I just told my roommates and my landlord that I wouldn't be signing another lease, essentially leaving me ""pre-homeless"". Maybe because earlier that day I told boss that I'm quitting my job at the end of July, leaving me ""pre-unemployed"". Maybe because after all this time teetering between living on the edge of salvation and the brink of self destruction, I'm finally choosing my path, I'm hitting bottom. I'm giving up. Shit maybe I'm Nick Cage in Leaving Las Vegas, but where is my Elizabeth Shue? Who will look after me, who will walk me gently into that good night? If I choose to stay in this city, the city I love, then I may just stay in the ""Hotel Tokyo"". Because if I choose to stay, and that is a big if, then I'm going to need to stay somewhere cheap, with like-minded vagabonds, vagrants and naredowells. I'll need help, I'll need guidance.",N
3822,"My girlfriend and I were on a get-away over the 4th of July.  We're in our 40's and it was during the week.  After extensive research we used Magellan Vacations to book our stay at The Dana Hotel (23rd floor/middle room).  Magellan got us a GREAT rate and had amazing customer service.  The Dana was outstanding on all levels.  The service was amazing...a shout out to Monette and Matt.  We ended up eating at Aja most of the time because it was good food and wonderful service with a fun sidewalk cafe feel.  The rooftop bar was fun  (although we were there during the week, so not the craziness we read about).  The rooms are very trendy and modern (on the small side, which doesn't bother me).  It's definitely the boutique side of W.   The beds were so comfortable with amazing bedding.  The wall to wall windows made it feel so cosmopolitan.  The decor is euro-asian.  LOVED IT!  When we needed help with the ipod dock in our room, they came right up and helped us.  I LOVED having the dock in our room!!!  Free paper in the morning.  Nice bathroom products. It was all just nice. I have to say that we did not get a chance to use the spa however, so I can't speak to that... I will definitely stay here again.",N
3004,"First time staying @ a W and if they are all like this one, probably the last. Booked a 2 night stay here over the holidays to take advantage of their indoor pool and take the family out to downtown restaurants for a change. The room was tiny and so was the bathroom.  Unlike the Renaissance on Wacker which has 2 queen size beds and plenty of room, this place can only squeeze in two doubles and barely leave enough room to move around.  It's so bad, that they do not even have a luggage rack: no place to put it.  So basically you put your suitcase on a shelf just below where all your clothes would hand in their wall mounted organizer. The bathroom also lacks a real door.  We had a sliding bamboo door and shutters. I shit you not!  There are wooden shutters in a wall separating the main room from the bathroom. Front desk service here is a hit or miss as well.  Checking in, I said I did not have my Starwood card with me.  In most places they volunteer to look it up or provide some guidance to earn points after the fact.  Not here, she just ignored me.  Not a big deal, as I seldom stay @ Starwood properties; prefer Marriott and Hilton brands. Parking here is $53 a night, which is steep even by downtown standards.  If you are heading to Navy Pier, the location is great.  If you want Michigan Ave or the many restaurants 100E-500W, then you have a nice hike ahead of you.",N
5398,"Plain horrible in my opinion. While the staff is extremenly friendly, helpful and professional, my room was clean but smelled like smoke. The lobby is crowed and old. Ice machine on my floor did not work. The restaurant in the lobby is not worth the prize and when I walked around to look for some place to eat near by, everything was closed by 6pm during the weekend. Place was noisy all time around and there is plain nothing to do within at least 6 blocks.  This hotel is NOT WORTH paying $$$ just so you can see the tip of the Willis (Sear Tower) antenna.",Y
809,"This review pertains to our wonderful wedding reception that we had at the Westin (Michigan Avenue) this fall.  Annie was our wedding coordinator and she was fabulous.  She worked closely with us and listened intently to all our visions and needs.  She promptly returned e-mails and returned phone calls and was never too busy to have an impromtu meeting with me.  As for the food--the food was seriously excellent--especially the buttermilk poached chicken with artichoke ravioli, spinach and mushroom confit.  It was not your typical ""wedding chicken.""  It was scrumptous--our guests raved about it!  Our room was awesome--the Consort Ballroom is a private room on the 16th floor with windows on three sides with views of Michigan Avenue, Water Tower, Lake Shore Drive and the Lake!  Overall, our wedding was wonderful and I couldn't imagine changing a thing.",N
3944,"Stayed in the south tower. Two double beds in a generous sized room which easily accommodated an extra cot. Would really have enjoyed Wifi in the room instead of only in the lobby. Exploring the hotel was a treat. Sneak into the Gold (?) Ballroom to experience the hotel's historic legacy. It's where the wildlife fundraiser scene was filmed in the David Duchovny/Minnie Driver classic ""Return to Me."" The room and hallways do feel a bit stuffy and old but remember, it's a hotel room, not an apartment.",N
3906,"The rooms are decidedly worn down, but the view is phenomenal. If they were to upgrade the rooms they would charge three times as much per night -- so bear that in mind if you decide to stay here. It comes down to what you care about more: staying in a very nice room or staying in a historic hotel with an amazing view for a very reasonable price. I would totally stay here again.",N
1418,"The hotel is under construction. The elevators were crowded. The door staff ogled me every time I entered and left. The inside staff could have been more friendly, more helpful, and much better and pretending to be enthused about working in customer service.",N

Highly recommended.",N
191,"My place is so tiny that when people come to visit, they have to stay in a hotel. My mom was coming into town on a busy weekend and I happened upon a great deal at this hotel. Just east of the Mag Mile and taxis aplenty were what was needed. My mom loves to window shop, so she could wander in familiar surroundings while I commuted up to her. The room was the perfect size suite with doors connecting the bathroom to both the living area and the bedroom. Genius! Plus, it had a seperate closet/vanity area for dressing and primping. The bed was soft and comfy and the tvs in both rooms was a plus. The lobby is just fine....I mean, you're not staying at the Palmer House. Anyhoo, my mom loved this place for the price, location and cleanliness. It was a bit out of my way, but whatever makes Mom happy!",N
285,This property is part hotel and part apartments. It has a great location just east of the John Hancock Center. Many of the hotel rooms are actually mini-suites with small kitchens.,N
4992,"I stayed here for business purposes in June of 2009, and again in April 2010. The hotel is an older one, the rooms are very small (especially the bathrooms - ridiculously tiny). The location is decent, but the rooms really could have used some updating. I was not pleased to notice that there was no mini-fridge in my room. This would have made a difference in my comfort level. Staff seemed pleasant enough.Basically, the place is just OK. Not great.",Y
5732,"For a business trip, I found the Crowne Plaza to be beyond adequate.  The rooms are decorated in a clean, modern manner.  It's within walking distance of some great restaurants (Meli, Greek Islands, the Paramount Room, etc.).  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The wireless Internet and workout facilities are free.  And, the restaurant/bar in the lobby is pretty darn good.   There is also a Dominick's grocery store, Walgreen's and Starbucks within 100 yards of the hotel's front door.",N
1405,"It's been two years now and slowly....I'm becoming an expert on downtown Chicago hotels. That didn't sound right. Of utmost importance to me is noise & cleanliness, so I give this place a thumbs-up. The A/C is rather loud, which forces me to hit three stars instead of four -- but I must also add that the AC works quite well even so.   The breakfast buffet is better than most, and if you just want to take a couple of items to go (as I find to be most useful), they charge you very reasonable a la carte prices (well, as reasonable a hotel fare goes). Staff is courteous & helpful; service is prompt, and they have good in-room coffee for brewing.  I always consider that a plus as it enables me to be civil once I'm ready to go downstairs & use the biz center or get breakfast. If you want to get nitpicky, the gym doesn't have any floor mats. So what? It's clean and the equipment is modern and clean. The comfort, convenience and service make this a great bargain. I would book my boss here and he is WAY fussy about hotels. Check it out!",N
5393,"My boyfriend and I just stayed in this hotel last weekend, and can I tell you what a pleasent surprise it was.Between the price I paid (very little considering location), the location, and the incrediably friendly staff, I could not have been happier. Some quick positive tidbits: felt very safe and secure, they had safes in each room, the kithcenette proved very helpful, the water was always hot, asked for some extra towels and pillows, and were delivered to me within 5 minutes, and the rooms were very cleanSome quick negative tidbits: bathroom was a tiny bit crowded (but the shower was very good size), free breakfast was not very good.I would recommend this hotel to anyone who was on a budget and wanting to be right in the action!",Y
1254,"Great location if you have a car.  Really easy to get on the 90 and/or lake Shore Drive. Front desk manager appeared genuinely insulted when she saw how great my  hotwire rate was (it was really great, less than half the price of valet parking at  the other Hyatt...) Room Window opened 5 inches-good by today's standards. Air conditioning was adequate through the night. (some hotels cut down on AC late at night) Only one front desk person was outstanding.  Two were rude. I rented two rooms, one for me, one for a friend.  In order to get to the room at night, if you have a rental car, you must pass your key card to get into the parking lot, pass it again to get into the elevator and again to get into your room. the key failed at one of the three key  points, on nearly every trip. At one point i had them make me three keys, and NONE worked.  my friend made through the three-key gauntlet only once without a front desk change of keys... other than that, the beds were great, room was clean. soaps were a little heavy--if  you want something unscented or not waxy bring your own.  All in all, a fine generic hotel experience with the usual chain store problems--no one in the hotel seemed to take responsibility for the issues.",N
2762,"got a really good deal for a 'staycation' - my friends and i are from Chicago but wanted a break. well decorated, swanky lounge. room was nice, really loved the nook with couch/desk, the robes, the Kiehl's products. felt out of place though, we are in our early 20's and the staff seemed confused by our presence or something.",N

1588,"My husband and I hosted our October 16, 2010 wedding ceremony and reception at Hotel 71.  This review is of the hotel as a wedding venue, although the rooms are also lovely.  The greatest asset to hosting our wedding at Hotel 71 was Rebecca, the Conference Services Manager.  She was prompt, professional and lots of fun to work with.  My husband and I weren't very knowledgeable about weddings prior to the planning process, and Rebecca was very quick to respond to inquiries and find answers for us.  She always had great suggestions and helped us structure the entire event so that everything went smoothly.   The venue itself is beautiful.  Weddings are hosted in the 39th floor ballroom.  The room has tons of windows with gorgeous views of the city.  My husband and I were looking for a venue that was modern, urban and quintessentially Chicago, and Hotel 71 definitely fits that description.  The location and views really can't be beat.  Our ceremony was held at sunset and the reception started later that evening.  The lighting and scenery really helped create a beautiful event.   Our guests loved the venue and we are still getting tons of compliments more than two months later.  Thank you so much to Rebecca and Hotel 71 for helping us put together such a memorable day!",N
1548,"This hotel is alright.  It's in a good location if you're looking for a place to crash on a girls night out.  It's clean, the service is friendly, and the rooms are large and nicely decorated, but there's nothing ""special"" about it, ya know?  In the trendy hotel market, I definitely prefer the W, although the prices are much, much lower at Hotel 71 (especially if you check the online hotel brokers). Also, I've stayed here twice and both times booked a ""city view"" room, but was able to switch to a ""river view"" room at check in, for no extra charge.",N
5731,"I stayed at the Crowne Plaza this past weekend and it far exceeded my expectations.  I had driven by the place a million times and it never seemed all that nice from the outside, but all of the renovations they did a few years ago have really done wonders for the interior.   The only downside is that they didn't have any rooms with king-sized beds available and I had to settle for 2 double beds.  Beyond that and a few burned out light bulbs, everything was great.  The decor was much more modern than other Crownes I've stayed at before.  They provide every room with what I guess you would call sleep accessories: eye mask, ear plugs, sleep CD, and aromatherapy linen spray.  I guess they really want to make sure you're knocked out.  I ended up not needing to use any of them because I was really tired and the beds are comfortable enough on their own, but it's nice to know they care.   The location isn't the greatest as far as things to do except for Greektown, but you're right off the expressway and close to the Loop so it's convenient to get pretty much anywhere in the city.",N
4470,"The place has a beautiful lobby, lounges, and restaurants. Problems...there's nothing specIal besides that. Some rooms are significantly smaller than others but are priced the same. So its luck of the draw when getting a room. I would have given 4 stars but I also asked for well drink at the bar and I was given top shelf. I don't mind paying for top shelf but if you don't have a well alcohol then the customer should be told because I would have rather had a 12 dollar specialty drink than a 15 dollar shot of tequila....",N
1055,I was only looking for a  cheap place to stay. That's what I got. I did not see any bugs. The place smelled clean and I constantly saw cleaning people. Staff were very friendly. The carpet has bleach spots on places and that gives off a bad first impression but after my first night I didn't notice them as much.,N
3855,"Overall, my wife and I were pretty pleased with Dana, the room, the spa and the restaurant downstairs.  Not to mention the friendly and helpful staff.  We stayed in the Tranquility Suite for two nights (Fri/Sat), parked our car with the valet, partook in a variety of spa treatments, ordered room service, used the in room honor bar, and also had dinner and breakfast at Aja, the restaurant downstairs. The Room (4 Stars): Price was reduced by 15% b/c we stayed two nights.  We also got 60 dollars credit toward breakfast in their restaurant when we arrived.  Nice surprise and bonus.  Decor is pretty cool and the rooms are unique and spacious. The Italian Rain Shower totally rocks and having the sitting room in the Tranquility Suite was really worth it. Plugged in our iPhones to the speaker dock and enjoyed our music.  Fair prices for the bottles of wine in the room and a decent selection from the small frig (though adding small bottles of some liquors would have been nice).  Having two balconies was pretty cool, especially to have some air flow through the room.  Window treatments block the sun really well, like really really well.  Downside  - Bed was too soft and we did not sleep as well both nights.  Balconies are good to have a smoke on and take some pictures but other than that there's not much room and you have to pull a small chair out there if you want to enjoy it. My guess is that liability and insurance dictated this...oh well. Just don't look forward to a real balcony.  Very limited cable television with Showtime that's not HD even though the room has two widescreen flat panel TVs.  Also, you can't order movies to watch in your room because they don't have the service. Aja (the restaurant) (5 stars) - Pretty chique decor, fairly priced (on the higher end) and good quality food.  For dinner I ordered some salmon sushi rolls and sashimi and they were both very good (and I'm reeeeeal picky 'bout my sushi).  My wife did the pork chop and mashed potatoes...and they were both delicious.  Pork chop was a large portion as were the mashed potatoes.  We also had a bottle of Silver Oaks' Merlot to celebrate ($108 and well worth it, great Merlot).  Then we had their apple desert that was both beautifully presented and nicely balanced in size, flavor and freshness.  Our server was great too.  Really personable, fun to joke around with and down to earth.  Some staff members/servers seemed a little uptight or anxious and I'm wondering if that might be a reflection of how they're managed...?  Breakfasts were a little high priced for me but having the 15 dollar credit, 1 for each of us, we were happy to go down.  Again, very fresh and good quality food.  Locks were flavorful, Eggs benedict had a fresher flavor as they increased the amount of lemon (which I welcomed) and their potatoes were very delicious.  Refrain from ordering the pancakes unless you want to feed 4-5 people.  For some reason they give you two that are two times the size of a large dining plate...no joke, it's friggin' ridiculous. Hope they change it. The Spa (3.5 Stars) - My wife and I had the couples message and pedicures together.  She also had a manicure and facial.  She really enjoyed her massage and I did as well although I have some hefty knots in my shoulders so I was sore and a little bruised the next day.  Overall, it was a good experience but speak up if they're doing it too hard and if their nails are scratching you.  The bed you lay on is heated, super comfy and dark lit room and the oils that they use are pretty nice.  You also sit in a relaxing room before and after to chill out.  Pedicures were pretty good though we felt a little misled because the woman recommended treatments but did not tell us that they weren't included and that we'd be charged extra so watch out for that.  Besides that it was pretty good.  Quality of the nail polish and durability was a little questionable.  Seemed to wear off pretty quickly and she rushed through it a bit.  Again, pretty good with room for improvement.  My wife really enjoyed the manicure (same rating and experience as the pedicure) and LOVED the facial (she got the Antioxidant/Nutrient facial). Parking, Concierge, Room Service and Bell Hop (4.5 Stars): the staff was really nice here.  Pleasant, helpful, talkative and personable.  When we pulled up to the hotel we did not have to do much. We were greeted immediately, given a ticket for our car for valet, they removed out luggage immediately, placed it on a cart and took it upstairs while we checked in.  A little delay on the checkout but that's because many people were doing so all at once.  Same great service.  Room service was easy and has food 24 hours, which really impressed us.  Prices are a bit high but that's no big surprise.  We were happy to pay considering their prices on other things were pretty reasonable.  Concierge was more than helpful in making reservations at Aja for us.",N
223,"Eh. I wasn't impressed during my recent stay at the Hotel Indigo. Oh sure- the location is great- just blocks from Old Town, and the lake. And the bed was comfortable. And the price was okay at $172 for a king room. But this place, while it calls itself a ""boutique hotel"" lacks the service and amenities of a true ""boutique hotel"". The front desk check in was a hassle, and the staff was unconcerned about the wait and as I stood there- I watched them deal with other guests in a nonchalant way that a true ""boutique hotel"" would not. Hotel Indigo looks it was decorated from Ikea with it's bright blue walls and green and white striped accents with simple wood furniture. I don't know if they were going for a beach theme but that's what it reminded me of. The room was tiny- so much so that the bed took up all the space and you bumped into the wall to get into the even tinier bathroom.  Maybe there are better rooms in the hotel so if you go- don't get room #514! But the real kicker here had to be the tiny bar in the front lobby. I went down to have a drink and the bartender told me that they didn't have much liquor. What? She then held up the vodka bottle and swished it around so I could see that there was barely a shot left in the bottom. When I asked her about it (knowing I was staying at the hotel with people who like to drink) she just shrugged and said an order must not have come in. Really? And there is no where in Chicago to buy some liquor to take care of your guests? Parking runs $36 per night at the garage next door (that's another review but the headline is- if you can find another place to park you should go there) All in all- I guess Hotel Indigo is fine for a basic hotel stay but I hate that they promote it as a ""boutique hotel"" for along with that label comes certain expectations. I won't be recommending it to any of my friends who come to town to stay. For the price- there are lots of better choices.",N
5087,"Jerry Kleiner is a restaurant god in Chicago- Gioco, Red Light, Opera, Marche, Sako (now closed).  He is part owner of this spot.  Don't be intimidated by the line out the door, dress code, or guest list.  We found ourselves sharing a drink with the owner by the end of the night.  Don't expect much in terms of music or dance, you're here for the ambiance.  A memorable step away from the usual, worth the cab ride.  Difficult to find if you aren't familiar with the area.",Y
2662,"Really enjoyed my stay at the James Hotel.  I don't usually stay at hip modern décor spots, but the beds were comfortable and the shower had a nice stream of hot water and the rooms were spacious enough and that's really what I care about.  I'd like to tell you about the cookies, but my roommate ate them all. It is right in the heart of tourist stuff, which might not be hip, but I was a tourist so it worked out for me.   Was able to walk to one of the many walking tours that Frommers has on their website.  Right there, did you read that, that was probably the most important part of the review.  Whenever you visit a city, check out Frommers' walking tours (or some similar travel site, most of 'em have them).  They're great.  And if you stay at the James, they don't charge you to use the business center, so if you go to Chicago and stay at the James, you don't even have to do any preplanning to arrive, unless you plan on doing the architecture boat tour, which sells out. Anyhoo, my only complaint is that the elevators are slow.  Too many floors and too many people.  Time to get one of those fancy elevators where you tell the elevator which floor you're going to before you enter into the elevator. I've only been on 2 of those types of elevators and now that I've been on them, I think any new building is flawed if they don't have them.  I'm getting tired of stopping at every floor, that I'll either stay on the lower floors or will act like the woman on the southwest commercial and hit the door close button as people approach. That's not actually true, but I've felt like doing that. The most important thing to know though is that the most important celebrity to Yelp fans stayed here.  Yes, I ran into Fabio in the lobby of the hotel.  Yes the same Fabio who sadly was stuck working with Michael Chiarello. If you're not a fan of Fabio than you're probably should not be reading yelp. And that is the most rambling review I've ever posted.  Time to quit.",N
2221,"A fabulous place for anyone to stay!  Its huge, super nice and right on the magnificant mile!  If its your first time to Chicago, staying here would be a good start!",N
3499,"Held our wedding here in November 2010 and could not have been happier.  Our coordinator, Julia, went above and beyond to make sure that everything went as perfectly as planned.  Fernando was fantastic too at making sure everything went smoothly.  Yes, the standard rooms are small so be prepared, but the suites are really nice.   The ballroom on the 23rd floor (Tip Top Tap) is fantastic.  Incredible view of Michigan Ave., which was perfect for all our out of town guests.  We had about 120 people, which was just about a perfect size.  The food was great as well.  We had so many compliments on the whole evening from all of our guests.  I would not have done anything differently.",N
3879,"Attended a small conference at the hotel and stayed there for three nights (extended for long weekend of sightseeing after the conference).  My colleague and I were in total agreement that this was a stellar hotel experience -- on the flight home we tried as hard as we could to find something to criticize and couldn't come up with a single thing!  The modern design of the building was wonderful (new construction) and the interior design very contemporary but classy -- just the style we both like.  My room was a huge suite with great decor, a huge bathroom with gigantic walk-in double shower and two balconies. The make or break with any hotel room really is the bed and this one was fantastically comfortable with beautiful fine linens. You know, so many hotels have a trendy design aesthetic and decent beds, but what really made this experience supreme was the staff -- they were all young but on their game. Everyone from the clerks at check-in to the room service attendee, to the waiters in the restaurant, to the concierge, to the doormen, to the manicurist, they all just had that special something: a friendly quiet confidence in their manner that made you feel comfortable and taken care of. Bravo to them and the manager who knows how to hire for keepers. Bravo to all! I would stay here again without a moment of hesitation.",N
1383,"As the venue for our Law School Prom (yes, I did indeed say ""PROM""), this hotel was very average. The ballroom was beautifully done and impressive with its high ceilings and flowery viney gilt doohickeys all over (I'm sure there's an architectural term for this of which I'm just wholly ignorant). Although the '80s-/'90s-/Miami-Vice-inspired light-up dance floor was slightly incongruous with these flowery viney ceiling and wall decorations, the light-up dance floor was definitely WAY awesome when the (horrifically outdated and spectacularly BAD) DJ played ""Billie Jean,"" the highlight of my evening. Was the DJ that bad? Yes, he really was THAT bad. If I knew who he was, his review would make my Barnes & Noble review look like a feather floating in the wind. I did find it a little odd that the ballroom was a two-story setup such that there were twelve tables or so on the second floor, too. This seems like poor planning, and while it makes for a pretty room and more space for the hotel to rent out, it also makes for an inefficient means for the people seated up there to access the dance floor. ANYway, while the decor was generally pretty beautiful and slightly eclectic, I was very disappointed with the quality of the food. Granted, it was hotel food. I understand that. Unfortunately, it was reeeeeally bad hotel food. A three course meal (salad, entree, and dessert), the salad was the best of the three and that's mainly because it's probably really hard to mess up a basic salad as long as the greens are fresh. The chicken was bland and the deceptively rich-and-creamy-looking sauce was just that -- DECEIVING! The cheesecake (not on my list of favorite desserts in the first place) was oddly-textured. So disappointing. In the end, although the Drake would have apparently cost ~40% more for our tickets, I would happily have paid that amount because my experience with their food was in the past much more satisfying and the single-story layout is more conducive to cohesive group identity (i.e. being able to stumble onto the dance floor together without having to navigate any stairs).",N
784,"Biggest plus here to me was location. It's right across the street from the Hancock building. You're right Millenium Mile so there is A LOT of shopping to be done. You're also right by one of the hop on hop off tour buses so how's that for convenience? The Lobby has been recently updated with nice seating areas and decorated with fresh orchids and other flowers. Wish the lobby was ""grander"" though - for a Westin, it's not a flashy or impressive first impression. Front desk staff was very friendly and efficient, as was the Belldesk. The rooms were clean and updated - granite countertops, curved curtainrods, comfy bedding. We had some issues with the wireless internet; 40% connectivity is pretty low when you're paying 12 dollars a day for internet! We had to call our own company IT as well as the Westin engineer to get up and running. Conference rooms were nice enough, no AV problems. Continental breakfast was so-so. They also did a boxed lunch which was OK. We had them cater a social event too but the food wasn't anything spectacular. Would stay here again.",N
305,"It's great for cost-effective, clean accommodations. A few annoyances though. We were right beside the elevator, so we'd hear the tone of the Elevator arriving at our Floor at all hours of the day/night. If I was ever doubtful of Obesity being a problem in America, I certainly don't now. There were 3 individuals with a combined weight (roughly) 900lbs staying directly above us. We could hear them waddling around quite frequently. Fortunately, they all couldn't move very quickly at the same time, so it wasn't that much of an annoyance. But I did hope the Building was up to Code, for fear of being crushed in our sleep. The Continental Breakfast was pretty shiete. Coffee terrible in the lobby. But, that's really not why you stay at a Hotel. For a Clean, relatively quiet, fairly cost-effective place to sleep; it's great. Next time in Chicago, I'd probably stay here again.",N
3155,"I've stayed here 4 times and my thoughts are: 2.5 stars because the rooms need to be updated, but 5 stars for the stellar staff (especially the guys at the bar downstairs). Good location, and good vibe. I'd stay here again -- plus, this one is much better than the City Center location.",N
1396,"The Millenium Knickerbocker seems to be about a millenium behind the times.  Which can be good and bad. Behind the times:  size of meeting rooms, decor, internet availability ( they charge for lobby wi-fi internet access). However, sometimes a history in Chicago is a plus and a selling point.  The Knickerbocker does have some character, thought the meeting rooms tend to be small and window-less. If I were to plan a big meeting in the city, I would not choose the Knickerbocker.  However, if I were to plan a wedding, I may consider the Knickerbocker for its character and charm.  The rooms tend to be small with low ceilings, whick makes for a intimate feel...so much better for social gatherings than business gatherings.",N
1080,"My stay at the Fairmont in April 2011 was nothing short of wonderful. I booked a King size room that had huge picture windows, a phenomenal bathroom, and a great dressing area. Room service was divine and I was grateful to be able to start my busy days with a healthy locally grown breakfast (smoothies and eggs among many other things). The bed was amazingly comfortable....the shower was heaven. I travel frequently to Chicago (at least 10 times a year) and I will be back again. I also just booked a trip to Bermuda and will be staying at the Fairmont there due to my excellent experience with their Chicago branch. The front desk staff were a little standoffish...I prefer more sucking up when I travel, but the room more than made up for it. The hotel bar had lovely ambiance but I found the drinks to be just so-so.",N
488,"You could do worse.   Through a very strange hotel mix-up, i.e., budget cuts, I got booked here instead of my regular hotel.  At first, I was a big old cranky bitch about that - I travel regularly, so I have certain expectations, and I have to be here for 5 nights.  Ordinarily, I don't want to be staying in an Embassy Suites for 5 nights in ANY city.  It's nothing personal - they're just great for a night or two, then that's it.  Any more than that, you need a little TLC.  And, when I first walked in, it reeked so badly of chlorine that I thought I was going to pass out.  Not a good first impression. But, the bed is comfortable, they are keeping it clean, I have a lot of room to spread out, I have a great view of the city, and there is a really nice Dominick's market across the street that is keeping me well stocked in the snacky-time  essentials (Pellegrino, almonds, and fruit!  OK, OK...and Twizzlers.  Lots of Twizzlers.)   So, I think it's a matter of keeping your expectations in line - and for that, it's fine.  Walking distance to Michigan, close to everything - not top of the line, but certainly not bad for the price, especially when you're travelling on business.   However, if you aren't paying the tab, and the economy's not in the crapper - it ain't The Peninsula!  Just sayin.",N
4841,"We wanted something in right in downtown Chicago that was luxurious. Well Hyatt proved that. On top of that we got the room for a steal of a price. The hotel lobby is soaring and has a large bar and restaurants with lots of windows. Check was a breeze and the staff friendly. The room had been renovated recently with a comfy bed, flat panel TV, nice big bathroom and had a great view of the Times building. The fitness center is open 24 hours and is well equipped. There is a Starbucks in the lobby along with a nice restaurant for breakfast. The bar serves some good food too. Concierge was very helpful in arranging a tour on the river run by the Architect's society. The boat is right across the street.   All in all it has everything you would want and if you use the right website to book the room you will pay a third of what the room typically goes for. Book it and enjoy!",Y
3137,"One star for the comfortable bed, one star for the Bliss bath products, but really, everything else about this place sucked.  It was super expensive - definitely not worth $400 a night, dark, dirty, and full of pretension.",N
1697,"Def not my 1st choice to stay here but it's 2 blks from my offices, ergo, no-brainer when walking in Chgo in the wintertime.  Valet, bellmen, servers = very cool group of guys.  Each night I came back, whether from office or via cab from dinner, they'd say ""welcome back!"", always calling me by name (love that). The sucky part of the hotel is the actual room (I've stayed here a number of times, it's consistent).  Old A/C wall units will dry you out to a crisp, and a 1 degree change on the thermostat equates to a 10 degree swing.  The bathroom is uncomfortably small, even for a boutique hotel.  It's small, even if you were in Europe at a boutique hotel.  Lilliputian.  The basin is a joke, but at least the shower is made for adult-sized people.  Carpet is old, walls are thin.  Beds are decent though, and if you're an In-Touch member you do get $10 mini bar credit. Fitness center is serviceable so at least you got that going for you.",N
1579,I used to live in Chicago a couple of blocks from this hotel and every time I come back to visit I try to stay at Hotel 71. Their amazing views of the Chicago river and the city bring back so many memories. And I love that they don't have mini bars -- this helps prevent accidents when this sugar cravings creep up.,N
4046,"This hotel has a pretty good downtown location and isn't too far from the metro stations. Also the staff was very friendly. Now for the negatives: no free wifi, the hotel is huge so the layout can be a bit confusing, there was an issue where the phone in my room didn't work, bed was just okay and the room furniture had this strange modern/uncomfortable vibe. Also, the rates can be pricey depending on what deal you get. I would consider staying here again if the price were right but i'd say the hotel is okay but nothing special.",N
311,"Boyfriend had some vacation time so we decided to head to the Windy City. My aunt, who lived in Chicago for a few years, suggested this place to us due to location. Right next to the Purple/Red/Brown lines at Belmont which was super convenient for us since we had some downtown/Loop business. There's tons of great shops, restaurants, and bars around. I'd recommend this place for any tourist. There's a Walgreens nearby as well as a liquor shop (since a lot of restaurants are BYOB). Tons of great stuff nearby! We got a standard queen which was real small. It was okay for us since we live together, but if you're looking for a little more room than just a bed, desk, and bathroom then get a suite. The bathrooms were updated and very nice, not to mention it was great to unwind in front of a flat screen after running around. Although the room smelled a little like hamster bedding for the first two nights. We didn't hear the El at all, but I did hear the elevator, people walking on the 4th floor, and the annoying, awful screeches of a child in the room next to ours. Quit beating your kid, you're on vacation! The staff was really friendly. I had an anxiety attack coming into Chicago and the boyfriend was kind of flustered with where he was at, so we called and John stayed on the line with us the whole time to make sure we got there ok. One of the guys working there could tell I was upset and he made sure to try and cheer me up which was nice. Free tea/coffee 24 hours, free breakfast (but Ann Sather's is a walk down the street... ;] ), and we always got buzzed in after 9pm since they remembered who we were. I'd definitely come back here again.",N
2758,"i was really annoyed that housekeeping kept knocking on my door the entire morning.  i put my ""do not disturb"" sign the night before because i didn't want anyone to knock on my door the next morning.   but when i opened my door to leave, someone removed my do not disturb tag thing!  no wonder housekeeping kept knocking on my door.  smh i love the room, the decor, the huge mirror, the soap w/a hole in it, the king size bed is so comfortable, and the lighting.   i love the decor in the lobby & how everything is just so modern.  i'll definitely come back to stay here.  stayed here 3 times already.",N
4928,"make sure that you have a wedding planner that knows what she is doing.  I know the grand ballroom is beautiful! but, the service is horrible! I would rather stay at the W or The Wit Hotel.  I had a bride who had her wedding here and when my assistant and I walked into the hotel with a huge wedding dress, no one cared to help, greet, or lead us in any direction.  When we finally got up to my brides room there wasn't a spot to hang her dress, so we found a door and hung it over that.  The hotel DOESN'T have a steamer so we had to use a small iron provided. As we were ironing, the hinge of the door touched the dress and grease smeared all over the side of the gown.  I called down to the front desk to ask for a safe spot to hang a gown and they said ""over a door or something"" I let them know that their vintage doors, yet beautiful and elegant have spread grease all over my clients wedding gown, they told me they could send housekeeping up to try and clean the dress, i told them no and figured out a quick spot cleaning.  I later found out that my bride had to carry her own bags up to her room, didn't have a welcome basket (like they do at the 4 seasons) and the catering manager still had the table settings screwed up, the wedding was in two days and the brides mother had flown in one week earlier to go over the seating, but still they had confusion.  I was really shocked, i had a bride here before but only for dropping off her dress and i also did a small fashion exhibit here and was expecting so much more, i love The Drake from an architectural stand point, the service was so disappointing, a place like this should be the best in town! i really hope that this review gives them a wake up call.",Y
2121,"Centrally located on the Magnificent Mile, this historic building is a nice convenient option.  Rooms can vary, however.  Initially we were put up in the historic tower in a room that was fine but nothing spectactular.  (What was spectacular, was how the hotel allowed us to check in super early 7am upon an early flight arrival). Later in the day, we moved to our originally assigned room, which was considerably larger (especially the bathroom, which was quite nice with separate bath and tub). One of my friends had Ambassador status, which apparently ... doesn't hold much weight here (or at least is quite confusing in terms of what one can expect).  After repeated requests for water, they brought up one small bottle for four of us.  Pretty disappointing service in general.   Also, we couldn't check out the historic pool as it was being renovated while we were there.  The gym was small and unimpressive. We were here because of a wedding held at the hotel but not sure if this is a place we would be dying to return to in future visits. Internet is $17/day (unless you have Ambassador status).",N
143,"3.5  I ended up at The Whitehall because they offered the best rate going for my last minute, end-of-week, one-night biz trip stay.  A happy chance meeting for me.  I'd stay here again. If you're looking for a shiny modern-contemporary boutique hotel experience, this isn't it.  Whitehall has a more comfortable, traditional vibe that wouldn't be hurt by a little updating -- perhaps an interior paint job, some more modern lighting.  But don't be put off by the lobby area (rather dark and fusty) as the rooms are much nicer. The staff I dealt with was friendly and helpful (walking maps, suggestions, taxi-hailing).  Although I'd reserved a king they offered to switch me to a larger corner room with two queens so I could enjoy a view.  Glad I agreed, for two reasons:  1) the view;  2)  with two beds in the room it meant I could do one of my favorite things to do when traveling & staying alone in a hotel - build a big downy bed-cocoon in one bed using the pillows and comforter from the second.   And honestly....The beds.  ROCKED.  Their matresses have some sort of brand name like 'Hypnose' or 'Hypnotic' or something like that, and they were.  The pillows were perfect, the comforter was light and downy, and the high-thread count sheets slid against my skin like, well, high-thread count sheets.  I don't usually sleep well in unfamiliar surroundings on the first night, but I did here -- thanks to my high-thread count bed cocoon and the perfectly quiet environment (I was on the 15th floor, which might account for the silence). The bathroom was dandy, the complimentary robes delightful, and the view charming.  After getting back around 10:30 or so from my biz-event on Friday night I did find myself wishing they had 24-7 room service of some sort.  I was hungry and tired but had to wander down to the attached restaurant, Fornetto Mei, to try and snag something to bring back to my room before the restaurant closed...and it was about to, so mine was the last order of the evening.  Ended up getting a room temp pizza that was just 'meh.' The Whitehall's location is superb, particularly if you're like me and you decide at the last minute that you don't want to wear what you brought to wear to the event you have to be at in three hours.  I just strolled across the street to the shopping plaza that houses Bloomies, Banana Republic, a freshly opened Karen Millen boutique, JCrew, etc. etc., and had a mini shopping spree.  Lots of other posh, high-end boutiques in the area too if you're staying at the Four Seasons and have the matching bank account. * Fun Factoid?  (I should probably look this up before spreading potential misinfo...too lazy)   Someone at my biz event told me the Whitehall was famous as the hotel the Rolling Stones used to stay in and, presumably, party in and otherwise generally act like the Rolling Stones in, back in the day.",N
475,"I couldn't believe the price when I booked a suite here for me and five others. The rooms are not the most spacious, but for the price, it's great. And the location was perfect. They were located a few blocks from everywhere we wanted to go. To your left is the Art Institute of Chicago, Aquarium, Grant Park, Buckingham Fountain, and more. To your right was the Magnificent Mile shopping area, tons of restaurants, Chicago Water Tower, and John Hancock Observatory. Although we weren't directly located next to anything, it worked out perfect to me in close to everything rather than closer to some places than other. Another perk was that we located right across from Dominic's Pharmacy. We walked there regularly for snacks. Saving the best for last, the absolute BEST thing about this hotel is: - Complimentary breakfast buffet every morning. (Time varies by the day) - Made to order omelets of your choice. - Complimentary happy hour w/ chips & salsa and other snacks. - The nicest bellperson(s). Greeted everyday entering and leaving. And were very helpful with any questions we had. Other perks that I didn't take advantage of: - Indoor pool. - Gym. - Lounging area in lobby. I highly recommend this hotel! My friends and I were very pleased with our experience.",N
1112,"I stayed here last year for the Chicago Gourmet festival in Millennium Park. Can't say enough about this place as far as service, location, and actual rooms.   I can't really speak to the amenities as I didn't do anything except eat, sleep, and walk while I was there. When I go back to Chicago, I'm staying here.  The price was just fine, I had a room with a view of the Lake, and the location was dead center in the heart of where you want to be.",N
2441,"Booking the Hilton was sort of a crapshoot for us.  The location ended up being perfect and all the amenities matched or exceded its 4-star rating.  The pool was pretty nice but overchlorinated and not quite big enough for the demand. As far as the style of the place goes, this wasn't my type of hotel.  First of all, it is MASSIVE, a conventioners hotel for sure, and stylistically took its dedication to swank a little too seriously.  Too gilded, elegant, old-school.  Nothing personal or particularly comfortable (except the bed - no complaints there.  In fact, we WAY overslept) about it.",N

This time it was all about dining in and enjoying some movies.The rooms are very clean and nice. The movie selections were immense so we were covered there. We also ordered dinner in the room on Friday night. Fantastic food. BUT, they did forget my wife's order...completely. And it took a while to get it up to us. Breakfast downstairs was great the next morning. Everything is a little expensive, but the service was nice and I had steak ka bobs and eggs, while my wife had the french toast. All in all, a nice trip.",N
976,"This place had some major downfalls, with a few good qualities that I will give them full credit for. Downfalls: NOISY! I booked through a show I go to 6 times a year and it was my first time at the Amalfi.  I got a room on the alley (lovely I know), and there was constant noise ALL NIGHT LONG! Glass breaking, loud party goers, blasted trash trucks at all hours! Maybe invest in better windows Amalfi? My favorite part was on the day I checked out the maids came to all the rooms on my floor knocking at 7:30 and when I said I was still using the room she shouted through the door ""When are you leaving!"", um... not the friendliest service! I also had an issue with my shower and called down and asked them to service it 2 days in a row and don't think anyone ever came to fix it because it still had issues. My company had to send me a box and they charged me a $5 recieving fee?  They never even brought the box to my room, I had to go down two days in a row and ask for it. Good qualities: Nice rooms for the price, Chicago is PRICEY! Within walking distance to my destination the Merchandise Mart.  Continental breakfast on every floor was a nice touch. Never got to the happy hour because I was working but I heard great thigns about it. They have umbrella's in the room you can use or purchase if you decide to keep, this came into great use as it rained most of my trip. If I chose to stay here again I would demand a room on a different side of the building and put out the do not disturb sign on my check out day!!!",N

293,"WATCH YOUR WALLET!!!! THEY OVERCHARGED ME 3 TIMES.. DO NOT GO HERE!!! I live on the west coast and only see my parents 2 times a year. I met them in Chicago for my Dad's birthday and wanted to be nice and pre-pay for one night of their 2-night stay. First, there were problems with billing over charging me and customer service BEFORE we even arrived for our stay. I called four times to the hotel to ask about the charges and no one ever got back to me until i had to go to the website and write a comment. I spoke with Director of Operations who really did nothing to apologize for the mistake or make any attempt to rectify the situation. When I asked for my parents to be compensated for one of their rooms for one night during their 2 night stay I was told that it was a ridiculous request and it was the equivalent of ""asking a mechanic making a car payment for you because you dinged your car"". Instead I was told he would think of some way to make it up to my parents when they checked out on Sunday (which never happened). They credited my credit card for the amount they overcharged me so I still paid for one night of the 2 night stay. When my parents checked out on Sunday, November 14th, not only were they charged for 2-nights, but for 2-nights worth of parking for 2-vehicles. My parents only had one vehicle. The Manager that was on staff spoke with my parents and told them that I was never there to sign for the charges to my card and therefore I was never paid-obviously a lie. By the time that everything got cleared up with the parking and a few other problems with the other rooms under my mother's name- the manager offered to take off the charge for one of the nights of their 2 night stay (exactly like I requested but was denied-again an unreasonable request). My father asked for a receipt and documentation which the Manager reluctantly gave him. So now for a THIRD TIME we are being overcharged. I already paid for one of the nights of their 2 night stay yet my parents paid for the same night since they were given the second night stay free. We will never be back to this hotel again it was a horrible experience even BEFORE we arrived and you had another chance to improve customer service during our stay and failed.The only genuine apology I received was from your accountant. You have a great facility and it is a shame that it is not run properly.",N
2813,"My go to hotel in downtown Chicago. It is a block from the CTA red line, so easy to get to & from ORD and is only 3 blocks Michigan Ave.  The rooms have been refurbished this year and I always get a great nights sleep here.",N
3048,"Really my rating is between a 3 and 4. Once again, we got lucky, and booked this hotel on Priceline for $82. So for the price that we got it for, I should rate them 5 stars. However, if I had to pay $300 for this room, the same price at Swissotel, I would probably give it 2.5 or 3 stars. The design of the hotel is cool and contemporary (browns/lavendars/grays), very West Elm-ish. We asked for a room on a higher floor, which they accommodated, but the view was not of the lake or Navy Pier. Night view was nice because during the holidays, Chicago decorates streets with lights, but during the day, the view is of  other people's condos and parking lot. We had 1 window instead of 5. I was most impressed with the shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and liquid facial soap from Bliss (famous brand for spa located in NY, Chicago and LA -- probably elsewhere too). Really liked the quality of shampoo and conditioner. But, we didn't get bar soap to wash hands (but they do have soap dish). I had to use facial liquid soap just to wash hands (slight inconvenience). No bathtub either (not that I wanted to take a bath or anything). Shower was nice, but Swissotel offered both. The bathroom shelf where Bliss products looked mildly dusty [ : \ ] The ""W"" experience was more about selling stuff. They had Bruce Mau book on spectators and a ""W"" book that sells brands and products. Cover was kind of cool (looks like fishnet), but book looked kind of old. I flipped through it anyways. I did like how they labelled the price for water ($6 for Fuji water). So if you are a hipster, this hotel might be for you, but I prefer to pay and extra $20 for Swissotel. This hotel experience was comparable to a knock-off of André Balazs' Standard Hotel chains, but not as hip. Maybe comparable to the newly renovated Flamingo Hotel in Vegas, but not as new and more expensive (and in different hue -- Flamingo: pink/red/fuchsia theme).",N
333,Look. A Travelodge is a Travelodge is a Travelodge is a Travelodge. If you booked a reservation at a Travelodge and when you got there were disappointed because you realized you were at a Travelodge then in the future you should not book a reservation at a Travelodge. Did my bath tub get clogged? Maybe. Did girls run up and down the hall drunk at 5am? Maybe. Did it meet my expectations? Absolutely. Worth the money for the location. Enough said. Boom.,N
4070,"What a huge hotel which has both its benefits and downfalls.  We had such a great deal on a hotel suite here and the rooms and beds are very comfortable.  Service is friendly but takes a while.  I understand that this is a large hotel but waiting an hour for a rollaway bed was frustrating. Also, parking is super expensive here and took us nearly 1.5 hours just to get our car out of the parking spot.  Look around for other public parking lots and park there for half the cost of parking at the Hyatt.",N
2209,"Definitely one of the best locations on Michigan Avenue.  While it's not the center of luxury, the prices certainly reflect the amenities.  Rooms are cozy and clean.  Elevators are relatively quick for a big city, boutique-style hotel.  The credit card authorization amount for checking in (per day) is ridiculous.  Management should really take note of that policy and re-think it.  I'll definitely be back, over and again!",N
3920,"There's not much to say about this place that hasn't been said already. It's just awful. I don't care how good the location might be, it's not worth it to stay in a dirty, stinky, scary-looking hotel. You can tell that it was once a fine establishment, but it's been let go for far too long and now just looks like something out of a horror film. We stayed here to save a few bucks, but we kicked ourselves for that. We'd rather have spent the extra money and stayed in a relatively nice place - AKA, anywhere else. I really don't understand how anyone could give this more than 2 stars (I guess one for location?), and certainly not 5 stars. Did we stay at the same place??",N
1827,"The hotel has quite the club feel on the first floor. Check in desk is in the back left hand corner and there is really no where to wait. A big mix of concierge desks, elevators and check in staff. I would also have liked to know in advance that they place a $200 hold on your credit card. Made for a surprise when I checked my accounts. Overall, too trendy, not practical, not even sexy. Whoever thought these particular bathroom sinks were cute was right -- but they should also consider function. No way to wash your hands, face or brush your teeth. It was preposterous actually. How you maneuver to accomplish those tasks was beyond me. Really bad water pressure too. The room was clean...but carpet just felt dirty. Please tell me that this building was once something else and re-purposed for a hotel. Otherwise, the layout just does not make sense. Bliss products were the best part.",N
3653,"Went for high tea here recently. Its definitely an experience to have at some point. You get to choose from a bunch of different teas, finger sandwhiches, scones, and pastries. At about $35 per person, its quite hefty for afternoon tea, but the entire experience is lovely. The atmosphere, service, and ambiance are really amazing and it makes for a very relaxing, yet elegant occassion. And of course the beautiful harp adds a very elegant touch.",N
5638,"Great location.  SUPER comfy beds.  It's the Heavenly Bed!

5238,One of the cheapest hotels in downtown Chicago.  If you need a place to sleep and not much else then this is for you.  The rooms are small and the walls paper thin.  You hear everything which forced me to explain some sounds coming from next door to my 6 year old.  Not the conversation I wanted.  The place was clean for the most part but the hotel shows its age and there are virtually no amenities.  There is free wifi but it is sooo slow.  The attached restaurant is so bad it's almost funny.  Avoid it at all costs.,Y

4691,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. It was a very nice modern hotel and the employees were nice. Overall, I was not impressed with this hotel. The standard room was one of the smallest rooms I have stayed in. They do not have mini refrigerator in the standard room, which would have been quite useful to bring home leftovers. We had to waste food because there was not a place to store the food. Also the maid service was not great. They knocked on our door at 8:30am one morning, which was a little too early after a night of going out. After using the washcloths, we were instructed to leave it on the floor if we wanted a new one for the next day. After that was done, they failed to pick them. They also did not replace the soap as well. Not a place I would return to in the future",N
347,"We got a room with a king size bed for $83 a night, great for college students and anyone else travelling on a budget. The bathroom was clean and updated, and the shower stays warm even though the water pressure is lower than I'm used to. The TV has a variety of channels, including HBO and MTV. What we loved was that the Harrison station (red line) is only a block away and close to many bus stops. There is even a Dunkin Donuts and Subway across the street, and a CVS and 7-Eleven nearby. Even though the track for several trains going into the loop is right out in front of the building, we were able to sleep through the night just fine. The only things that woke us up were people next door to us and outside our room due to the thin walls. Granted, we were right in front of the elevators. Other than that, we were very satisfied with how much we paid for the room.",N
1789,The hotel decor it to die for. The staff are helpful and polite. There is a complimentary wine hour nightly. The area outside is quiet on the weekends but its only a 3-4 block walk to the action. I would highly recommend.,N
4082,"The mark of a great business establishment, especially a place like a hotel, can be found in the staff's ability not just to deliver great service, but also in the display of their problem-solving skills when it comes to customer service. Based on the outcome of the following story, I would choose the Hyatt as my place to stay every time I come into Chicago from now on. I was working as a volunteer at an event on the Navy Pier, sponsored by the NPO I work for. Naturally, as a ""volunteer employee"", my hotel and travel accommodations were supposed to be taken care of once I followed the proper procedures for filling out paperwork and obtaining confirmation numbers. The flight was fine, the trip from O'Hare (mostly) uneventful. But imagine my shock and surprise, when my partner and I arrived at the hotel and we were informed that THE ROOMS WEREN'T PAID FOR. NOW was the time that the event coordinator chose to tell me that we were expected to pay for the rooms in advance OURSELVES, to be reimbursed at a later date. ""Mortified"" doesn't even begin to describe how I felt, especially since I didn't have a credit card that would cover the entire expense of the stay. At that moment, I was pretty much ready to haul it out of there and find the nearest Motel 6, Econolodge or Days Inn. But it was thanks to the quick and diplomatic thinking of Jennifer, the front desk rep, that the situation was made easier. She advised me and the event coordinator about what to do (obviously, this was not the first time she'd had to deal with a problem like this.) Plus, in the meantime, she made sure we still got a room at least for the night, (with a SPECTACULAR 27th floor view of ""The Loop"".) I won't bore you with the other details, but the situation was eventually resolved and we all lived (and slept and dined) happily ever after. Not only is the atrium of the Hyatt dazzling to behold (with probably the world's most interesting designer fountains), but the quality of the customer service didn't stop with Jennifer. I think everyone there did an outstanding job, but personally, I think Jennifer deserves a raise.  And the Hyatt deserves my future business, which they will most definitely have the next time we return to Chicago.",N
4035,"A+ for location.  The famous landmarks Millenium Park, Magnificent Mile and downtown are within walking distance only.   I liked the service.   Valet parking is $50/day.  You can go to Park Millenium to avail of a $30/day parking deal.",N

1830,"So this is the hotel closest to my Firm's Chicago office, so I've stayed there many times. This past weekend motivated me to Yelp. I was 96 miles short of renewing Gold Medallion status on Delta, so I decided to take my wife to Chicago for her birthday to top it off. The W is right in the heart of the loop, and only a few blocks from my wife's favorite attraction, the Art Institute of Chicago. Also this is where she stayed last time we had a ""couple"" visit, two months before our first child was born, so I knew she liked it. Upon check-in they were extremely courteous (in part due to my Gold Starwood status), and when my wife mentioned it was her birthday, they not only gave us a room upgrade (offering the west side with more ambient sunlight, or the east side facing the courtyard with more quiet; Ed note: the west side faces the El, which is why the ""darker"" courtyard is quieter), but also offered us a selection of wine/cheese/fruit options. She chose champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries. Upon returning from our touristing that day, the chilled champagne and fruit were waiting. I never like to write a review without some constructive notes. First the hotel building is old (although it's been fully modernized), so the outside walls tend to be very cold in the winter. Opening the closet door felt like opening a refrigerator. The should consider more insulation. Also, the water closet is a bit small relative to modern hotels. We will of course return. I haven't even mentioned the trendy, nightclub feel of the lobby.",N
2677,"Boutique-y feel with the big chain level service, the James was a dream. Having booking through a hotel club website, we got upgraded to a suite, and the syite had what we called ""a champagne room"" WITH A PROJECTOR! seriously.

It's bathroom was luxe and bright, lovely and spot-on (but no Ace Hotel clawfoot tub confection, alas).",N
524,"This Hampton Inn was great. The room was clean and comfortable, the free breakfast was good. Outstanding location !! It was a 2 block walk to the Grand red line stop and this made it very convenient for me to get to work each day (and it saved me $18 per day parking at my job site). Tons of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. My fav restaurant was Bandera. The only thing that I didn't like about this property was the $42 per day for valet parking. I think this is on par with other hotels in the downtown area, but that still doesn't make me like it. I parked at the public lot next door to the hotel for $30 per night (another steep price for parking) - this lot doesn't allow in/out. I walked everywhere or caught the train, so next time I probably wouldn't even rent a car. As mentioned in other posts for this hotel, the Fire Station is right next door and I heard the fire trucks every day. They were loud, but luckily they weren't going out frequently. I have to give a shout out to Andrew who was very helpful with getting an AAA room rate assigned to my reservation.",N

So romantic, and beautiful. The room was so nice, wonderful bed, huge TV, pillows to sink into. I loved it. Free wifi in the lounge, cozy seating areas that make it feel private, free workout gym. I love the gym. Every time we went, there were alway other people there. The machines had TV's and they had headphones for you to use. There was also face wipes, towels, water, and apples. I also love how it is part of NWA/delta's vacation packages and you can use your miles to pay for part of the hotel room. What a great deal!",N

I could walk over to Michigan avenue in a mere matter of minutes. I also had no problem getting a taxi or shuttle to the airport. When I came into town it seemed like this hotel was easier for friends to find than a couple of the others I booked rooms at. If you want a nice room at a fair price, the Sheraton is one place that won't let you down.",N
4493,Ummm..... entertainingly opulent.,N
4172,"Very nice hotel, the rooms are well laid out and the furnishings are nice. The lobby area is amazing, plenty of space to relax and walk around.

If you are looking for a comfortable place to stay in the loop, you simply can't beat this place. Do your self a favor, though, and only sleep there. The city awaits!",N
2315,"We came here to hang out in their lobby lounge after working the Piven Theatre benefit a few weekends ago for our staff/volunteer after party. First off...the ""Very Berry"" is maybe the best thing ever. It's a deliciously dangerous drink with real pieces of fruit. I'm not even sure what's in it (some acai vodka, some other random liquor, some juice or something), but it was to die for. I believe it was $13 (not sure...I didn't pick up the tab, fortunately)...not sure I would ever justify paying that much for a drink, but if I were going to this would be the drink to do it. We ordered a variety of food, and some of it was pretty decent (the BBQ chips topped with cheese and bacon) , but others not so much (flatbread pizza...not a fan of their sauce)...probably because it wasn't an actual restaurant (that I'm aware of), but mainly just a bar. The atmosphere was nice and relaxed, with some curtains between the long sofas for privacy between parties. We had like 20+ people with us, so that wasn't an issue. It was a pretty nice place to have an afterparty after a crazy busy day/night of fundraising for the arts. My feet were killing me and I would have been happy anywhere I could sit down, but I'm glad they chose the Marriott to host us. Aside from the lobby lounge area, I haven't seen any other parts of the hotel, so I can't comment on that, unfortunately.",N
1492,This hotel is incredible! We snagged a sweet deal to stay here and paid about $89 a night which is unheard of. The staff is on top of everything and the rooms are spectacular. No complaints at all staying here. They did make an error in charging me during check out but quickly fixed the problem with no problem. Would definitely stay here again.,N

Plus our room was very spacious and stylish, and we had an incredible view of the downtown skyline. They fix nice strong drinks in the bar downstairs, and the gym facilities were gorgeous. Yes it is a short hike to Millenium Park, etc. But they have a free shuttle for drop-offs, and I took the bus three times in two days and it was a breeze. Simple, straight shot-----you're on, you're off. The staff were also so sweet and helpful. We loved it here.",N
4764,"Horrible!!! Do not stay here!I got the hotel on priceline for a good price and had nothing but problems from the beginning. First of all, I called after getting the hotel on priceline to request a non-smoking, king sized bed room. She told me they did not have any king beds, but could give me a non smoking room and negatively refered to the fact i got the room off priceline several times.  When we got to the hotel, we asked the man who was helping us at the front desk if there were any king beds and he said he had plenty and switched us.  We got into the room, it was VERY small, there was a red stain on the wallpaper on one wall and on the other wall the wallpaper was coming off the wall.  The carpet was dirty and we both slipped on the very slippery bathroom floor.  I wanted to use the gym, but was told it was $18.00 a day to use it and the internet was another $ 14.00.  On top of that, you are charged for parking (either valet or in the garage) by the day (between $40 and $51 dollars a day)!!! They do not validate. This hotel is WAY, WAY overrated!! They nickle and dime you for everything and the rooms are NOT nice or clean.  We drove across cou try and stayed in several different hotels during our trip and I have to say this hotel was by far the WORST! My husband and I are both doctors who travel a lot and we will definately not be coming back to this hotel nor will we be recommending it to anyone.",Y
2535,"I'm not crazy about this hotel.  I'd describe it as ""not bad"".  Just had a stay over last weekend after getting it on travelocity top secret.  The staff was accommodating and the beds/pillows/sheets were very comfortable.  There are lots of options for getting a corner room for no up-charge or a room with two bathrooms which is unique.  However, the hotel is in need of renovation.  The carpeting looks and smells old.  From the moment we walked into our room it smelled strong of bad cleaner as if they were trying to cover something up.  The bathroom is in serious need of updating, you could tell the drywall above the shower was repaired a few times and a couple spots of mold were forming in this area.  The shower head was awful, it was clogged up/didn't spray water at all evenly and was in need of replacement.  Also when the room next to us used their shower the plumbing was extremely loud.  The gold fixtures in the bathroom and overall decor in the room is outdated.  If you are a huge fan of traditional outdated decor then maybe you'd fall in love with this place but I just think there are so many more contemporary recently updated hotels in Chicago that this one will be marked off my list.  Also wasn't crazy about staying south of the loop, a little more north of this area would've been preferable.  At least it's just 2 blocks from the Harrison red line.  Overall we had a nice time but I most likely would not stay here again.",N

Outside the elevator banks on each floor is a telescope so that you can peek across at Lake Michigan, the beach, Navy Pier, the afterwork booze cruises that go by around 5:30 PM...such an awesome touch. I also like how the room design is much more ""Midwestern chic"" than any of the Ws in New York, with the wood paneling and shutters and whatnot.  The lobby decor is much quirkier than I would have expected, too (the only Ws I'm really familiar with are the heavy-on-the-charcoal-gray Times Square and Union Square, after all). I checked in right after the Horrible Apocalyptic Tornado Thunderstorms of '07 that had evacuated O'Hare's control tower, brought flights to a standstill, etc. and there was a chance I wouldn't be able to get in to check into my room.  So I called the W in advance and asked about the situation, and they were remarkably pleasant and accommodating: ""We won't charge you if there are acts of God involved!""  Turns out I did get in, albeit around 1 AM, but the front desk team was still equally on top of things. There are only a few characteristically W-esque things that knock this down to four stars instead of five.

Luckily the other guy was super cool and since my girl had confirmation that she was to play in the main room he let her set up and go. Supposedly there is another room somewhere but maybe it wasn't open that night? I don't know, the logistics of the place were kinda confusing... Victor Hotel gets bonus points for a kinda sexy style, and free vodka drinks until 11pm the night we went.  It loses some points for nowhere to sit (unless you're bottleserviced up) and weird video screens on the walls showing naked women's shilouettes with bright psychedelic backgrounds, it just didn't really fit but maybe that was the night. I definitely agree with previous posts that someone's experience here can vary a lot depending on who is throwing the party. Some consistency wouldn't hurt, guys... Little bit of a weird/random crowd, but fairly friendly people. Now let's talk about the staff. Sean the bartender is not only smokin' hot but VERY ATTENTIVE. He took great care of both of us and looked good doing it. Thumbs up Sean. Big thumbs up. I wish I could comment on the price of drinks but we didn't pay for any..... sorry!

4633,"Stayed here for one night via http://Priceline.com for $59.  For the money, it was obviously a good deal.  The doormen are very polite and on the spot.  Bar is a cozy little place to escape the city on a cold night.  Decor has a very modern/upscale feel to it and is nicely done.  Front desk clerk was very helpful as well. The rooms, while nicely appointed, are a little on the small side.  The rooms come with flat screens, free wifi and a work desk.  Bed was very comfortable.  Outside noise from the hallways entered the room pretty easily, and my room was at the end of the hallway.  Can't imagine what staying across from the elevator sounds like. Showers are awesome, but the sink is very small with barely enough room to fit your hands under the faucet to wash them.  Also, there is no room around the sink to keep any of your stuff on. They have a spa, and I tried to set up a massage.  Was told they had 3 appointment for the next day in the late morning/noon area.  Got off the phone with them, called the front desk to arrange late checkout, called right back and supposedly they were all booked.  Talking about a 2 minute window here.  I don't think it was even physically possible to field that many calls that quickly.  Don't call yourself a full service spa if you can't fit in one massage in an 18 hour window. Overall, nice place that I wouldn't have a problem staying at again.",N

Excellent staff who make sure you're feeling welcome. Cookies at check in - delicious ones at that. The front desk people here are great. Really friendly and took care of my stupidity of placing my roomkey next to my credit cards and BlackBerry. Very clean, with cute rooms that are decorated nicely. Super comfy beds!

3765,"Do you feel vibe? Posh. No, not the Spice Girls. This swanky hotel felt like more of an apartment then a hotel... most of the time anyways. I mean except for the awesome shower, the chocolate covered fortune cookie from housekeeping, the welcome *insert name here* on the television upon checking in, and the breathtaking floor-to-ceiling windows it did feel like I was staying over at a friend's place that happened to live in the city. The room had a studio loft feel and I love the glass in the shower to help open the space up and connect the rooms more. Location is key. Dana has your key... maybe not to your heart but definitely to the heart of the city. The red line is 2 blocks away, yummy eats are all around, and Michigan Ave. is a short stroll down the street. The bar at the top of the building is really cozy and offers decent views of the city the best of which can be taken in at night. The big downfall is that the bar is closed to only hotel guests so you don't really get to talk to any locals and get to know the people that make the city what it is. Breakfast on the first floor however is a much different story. Awesome food to get your day going and on both days that we stayed got to talk to some really great people over morning coffee. I would have given 5 stars for the place alone but the people at the front desk just really irked me. They were the only people there that had a stick up their arse. Different shifts = different people with the same stick. I don't know what all their problems were but I didn't come across one friendly person working that position my whole stay. You are the frontline employee to the customer experience... act like it. *Overall Dana, if you were a person, I see you in stilettos. Like really fashionable ones but ones that you got on a super deal at DSW or something. You're that girl that is cool without trying and everyone hates you because they want to be you but they can't hate you because you're so likeable. Even with the horrible front desk staff, the rest of the people make up for their downfall. Very reasonably priced and very good location. Rating: 4",N

The hotel was within walking distance from Millennium Park, which was exactly what we were looking for.  The hotel staff was very friendly, accommodating, and helpful.

Valet and door men/bell men get 5 stars. Wedding block personnel 5 stars.  Area of hotel 5 stars. Room 5 stars (was a large business suite).  Housekeeping 5 stars.,N
2894,"This a review from someone who does NOT stay in hotels very often (read lots of reviews on this hotel from business people....my stay was leisure) I loved this hotel. Priceline did a great job giving me the 4 star hotel I requested. Sheraton was the nicest hotel I've ever stayed at, I'm used to staying at Hampton Inns. The pros: *Fast elevator service! Lightening speed! *Friendly helpful valet, got us a cab with literally the snap of a finger *Great views (we had a view of the city and some view of lake Michigan on the 19th floor) *walking distance to EVERYTHING. * the most comfortable beds ever!!!! (seriously!!!) *windows that open.. I loved hearing the ""city noise"" at night. * VERY clean!!! Cons..... Well they charge you for evvvvverything. I'm unable to comment on the wireless internet, pool or gym because we didn't pay for those services. The mini fridge was stocked .... But a $5 kit Kat wasn't appealing to me. Rooms are small, bathrooms are SUPER small and seem very our dated. But..... Once you swallow the $50 parking bill, you'll fall in love with this hotel. There are a few restaurants (Shula's is great!!!) and bars. Two thumbs up!! (and located across the street from AMC which was great for a late night movie after touring the city all day)",N
1334,"my church just had their benefit at the Ritz and i have to say - the Ritz staff was fantastic.  never had my wineglass been refilled so quickly nor so discreetly.  they handled late arrivals with calmness and alacrity; they navigated narrow spaces without a single spill and they switched out courses with a minimum of fuss and noise.  (hear that, hilton??  minimum of fuss and noise!) the dinner last night was really good; they had a potato gratin 'cake' that was so yummy, the folks at my table wanted to call for more.  the meal, and wine selection, was well above the standard rubbery chicken/steamed vegetable fare at other hotels in the city. (hear that, hilton?) i've also been here for the annual planned parenthood gala and it's a similar story - great staff, wonderful menu, nice wine and just really good event planning.  Ritz events really flow and their staff make an effort to make sure visitors have nothing to worry about.",N
88,"We booked a block of rooms for our wedding this July at the Carleton.  The hotel was very pretty and our room was spacious and had lots of character.  Dana, who I worked with to book the rooms, was very helpful and returned my calls promptly.  The best part was that by 10 of our guests booking their rooms at the Carleton, we got our room free!   The only reason I didn't rate this a five is because I felt that the rooms are overpriced for the service, location and what the hotel can offer.",N
5386,"Stayed here in May when I was checking out one of DePaul University's graduate programs.  Clean, but tiny.  Elevator pretty much only fits two people plus luggage.  We got a room that didn't face the El line, but my mom said that she could still hear it at night when she was trying to sleep (I didn't hear a thing, but I slept through Hurricane Wilma in FL four years ago, so that should tell you how heavy of a sleeper I am).Water pressure in the shower was fantastic, even if the bathroom itself was on the smallish side.  Beds were EXTREMELY comfortable.  Breakfast in the morning was ample, free cookies in the afternoon and right across from a Jamba Juice.  You really can't lose.",Y
1149,Awful customer service. They charged us twice for the room and we had to go through hell and high-water to get our money back.,N
5308,Classy hotel. Exxcellent service. Wonderful accommodations.,Y
682,"Stayed here for a convention and I walked away very impressed and pleased! The staff is very friendly and professional. The rooms are spacious with comfy beds. My room had two doubles with each bed decorated by five soft pillows each. Tenth floor has an indoor pool, gym room, guest laundry (1$ for each load. Front desk has free detergent and laundry sheets), & microwave. The restaurant, Le Viand, even offers Turducken as a special every once in a while! The hotel is centrally located and just a few blocks from Hancock Tower, Navy Pier, and lots of great food shrines!",N
2035,"We did our hotel room block here at the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza. Considering your not in the room a whole lot, they offered the best rate around! Rooms were great, everyone received a room with a view of the river which are great views! Room sizes were larger than the typical room too. We were given a corner room, very nice! Beds are comfortable, with your choice of pillow (soft or firm). There is an indoor pool too, which our nephews enjoyed. I walked in there once and it was nice, not overwhelming hot or chlorine smelling as most indoor pools tend to be. Large open lobby great for meeting up and taking wedding photo's. Lobby bar is nice too, which they had later hours. Pizza is good in there as well. Overall I would recommend the hotel for others, it's away from the mag mile and all the regular touristy area's however it's perfect for wedding room blocks for reasonable price!",N
149,"UPDATE: Stayed here again for the same conference.  Between 2 - 3 stars.  I did like that they were willing to call me when they had a room available since I checked in early. I thought I was supposed to be in a pinnacle king (which i booked on http://Hotels.com) and mentioned this to the lady who checked me in.  She told me ""yeah, you're in a superior king""  Only after I had unpacked all my stuff did I realize that there WAS a difference ( I thought maybe there were two names for the same room).  At that point, it wasn't worth calling to complain. Laid down to take a nap after I got into my room at 12:30.  Was woken up about an hour later by the lady who came to check the mini bar to see if the prior occupants had used anything.  Saw her doing the same two days later when I was leaving.  Why not do it when the room is being cleaned?    Still got charged for a Snickers i had to call and ask to be removed from my bill (I HATE snickers). At least twice when someone came to my room, I was in the bathroom, and heard them getting keys out to enter my room....had to hop off the toilet so they wouldn't find me in a compromising position. Last year thought the Whitehall was great.  This year....not so much.  These seem like system issues, not random issues that could happen to anyone. Stayed at the Whitehall a week for a conference. Pros:  Incredibly comfy beds and fine linens.  Large spacious room, considering it is an older hotel.  I had two queen beds, but there were also two sitting chairs with a table in between them.  Each bed had a bedside table.  Everything was well spread out, not cramped together.  Elevators were small, but fast (last year I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton and routinely waited 5 minutes for an elevator, which irritated me).  Beautiful tile work in the bathroom.  Friendly, accomodating staff.  Lighted makeup mirror in the bathroom.  Close to Michigan Ave. Cons:  Small bathroom, although this is not unexpected given it is an older hotel.  No ice machines on the floors.  I really hated this.  Every time you want ice, you have to call room service.  Then I wasn't sure if I should tip for something I'd rather do myself anyways?  TV was old and of poor quality, and the movie channels (pay per view) didn't come in well. As you can see, the pros outweigh the cons.",N
2192,"This is the first real hotel I've had the pleasure to stay in. I think I've been ruined for life. The room is really nice, and the bathroom is amazing. There is a tub and a glass shower.  In the bathroom there are Crabtree & Evelyn products, which is really nice. (If you got the shower with a curtain, its because you've been put in a handicap style room- kind of a plus because of the extra space) We ordered room service our first night in, and while it was expensive, it was the best room service we have had to date. Real flowers on our table? Real silver? Im not kidding. Our server who delivered it even wanted to serve us... but Im just not ready for that level of commitment yet. The pool area is amazing. Its a mosaic tyled junior olympic size swimming pool. They have a great fitness center as well, and offer reflexology and massages by appointment. I dont want to leave.",N
2644,"For a hotel this size and the location, the service and friendly staff far exceeded any expectations.  The house keeping staff deserves an extra special gold star.  Our room for some reason turned out a little messier than usual, so cheers to the nice team of people picking up the room service trays and cleaning up the stray crumbs and refreshing the room twice a day.   The king guest room was the second type of room I stayed in here.  Last trip it was the movie room which had a pretty cool pimped out king size ""futon"" with a projector and bose speakers.  These two types of rooms were both comfy and had great space.   The Kheil's products are always great as well.  The bed is super comfy and being a light sleeper, the curtains that black out 99.9% of the light were great.   Looking forward to many returns to this property.  And the David Burke Primehouse as the restaurant has great meat!",N
710,"Great location right off of the hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave! Friendly staff, clean rooms, affordable (for downtown Chicago), overall great value...My favorite part was the big comfy King beds. Probably the best night of sleep I ever had outside of my own home! Marriott always does a great job, and this location follows suit wonderfully.",N
4991,The Essex Inn is a great hotel and also affordable. I stayed there last June when I attended the Taste at Grant Park. The pool area is spacious and the beds are comfortable.,Y
4148,"Visited Chicago Independence Day/Taste of Chicago weekend. Stay at the Hyatt for 3 ladies. Pros- Great rates are always available on Hotwire, Room are fairly large, queen size beds, modern decor, lobby is gorgeous! The staff was friendly, they don't go out of the way to speak to you, but when you ask them a question they are nice/helpful. Concierge gave us good recommendations. We were out in the city pretty much all day, so we didnt ask for much at the hotel, just towels, towels, and more towels. They were quick to bring up more. The 3rd day they brought us a ton of towels so we didnt need to call for more... lol. Quick check-out, clean rooms/bathroom. CONVENIENCE is the #1 reason to choose the hotel. Walking distance to Mag Mile, Grant/Millenium Parks, navy pier, Giordano's, CVS, connected to the downtown tunnel for quick meals. It was a block over from Michigan so we were close enough to get to everything yet away from the large crowds on the main strip. Cons - There was a pair of dirty socks left in the closet in plain sight, that the cleaning crew obviously missed... however the rest of the room was clean.  There are NO refrigerators in the room. Only the mini-bar fridge and you're charged $$ for putting any items in it. I asked the front desk if they could bring a mini-fridge up to the room and she said ""Yes, but there is a $25 fee to do so""...",N
3068,"W Lakeshore is LOUD and OBNOXIOUS.  It is NOT hip and cool, although it tries to be.  Stay somewhere else, folks.  Not worth it. Just back from weekend trip to Chicago - although decor was nice/modern, bad management decisions made for a negative overall experience - loud music blaring in lobby/elevators, parties going on every night in the lobby, room service wakes you up at 8am.  Free Acura Experience is a joke - always constantly booked, never had the chance to try it. Hotel is perfect for 22 year old frat kids who want to get drunk, scream, run around all night picking up strippers.  For everyone else, an awful experience is sure to be had here.",N
891,"Loved it! Staff was accomodating and friendly.  Hotel was a beautiful renovation of the Reliance Building--rooms on the 8th floor retain the original frosted glass office doors, replicas of the original metal grillwork in the halls and elevators. Ask for a room on a higher floor--there's some serious construction going on across the street. Also--free wine between 5 and 6--hard to argue with that.",N
1735,"I just had my wedding at Hotel Allegro and it was perfect! I cannot say enough good things about Kerry Craig, their wedding coordinator.  Kerry was on top of things on day 1.  She is organized, professional and so nice to work with.  My husband and I could not have done this without her.   The food was really good (every guest said something about it) and I feel like their prices are comparable to others around town.  The rooms are a bit small but very nice and the room block rate was amazing.  It was a great venue that I would highly recommend to anyone.  I would not have changed a thing about my wedding and I definitely thought that the venue was beautifully done.",N
1102,"Stayed here on the night of July 4th even though I live in the South Loop.  The main reason was that I was being ""kicked"" out of my own apt because of a bachelorette party.   Got the Fairmont through PL as the ""luck of the draw."" Pictures: http://www.facebook.com/... Categorically: A) Star Rating: PL ranks Fairmont as a 4 star establishment.  I am not sure what qualifies them to be so, but I assume it has to do with the number of amenities that are in the actual complex, not by the shape of the amenities.  I thought that for a 3.5 star hotel, Embassy Suites in Lombard was much more well-maintained and spacious than Fairmont. B) Location: Fairly decent location in ""Millenium Park.""  Since it is located close to where I used to work, I had no problems navigating.  A word of caution: the physically address listed is 200 N. Columbus, but if you actually look up where 200 N. Columbus is, it's the lower part of the street.  The auto entrance is there, but the main pedestrian entrance is upstairs on S. Water St.   C) Public Spaces: I did not get to check all of these out, but these are the ones that I did see and go into, at least to look: the main Eno Bar area in the registration area, Aria restaurant, and Aria Bar.  The lighting in all these areas was fairly dim, to a fault I would say.  Even the escalators that went down from the main lobby level to the ballrooms and parking area weren't the brightest, but they were much better than the other.   I will post my review of Aria Bar where appropriate.  Also included at the complex were ballrooms, a spa, and business centers as well as meeting rooms. D) Room.  The room I got was a double bed on the 5th floor.  Not much to say about the view, but I didn't have high expectations about that.  Room came with: safe, ironing board, extra comforter, a little mirrored/vanity area, bathrobes, the usual English ""boutique"" toiletries, separate rain shower and tub, BMI scale (did not use this, ha), a phone in the toilet area, LCD TVs mounted very well on the wall, art mounted behind the headboard, couch, and working desk/table.  Walls were not very thick, and I could hear other guests walking about, as well as the people next door who were initially fighting when I got there.  Babies. E) Service.  Had 2 with the registration desk.  When I checked in, the person on duty seemed frazzled because of difficult clients right before me.  He checked me in quickly enough, but forgot to tell me where the elevators were.  He did mention the restaurants though.  Upon checking out, it was also quick, and the staff person was very friendly.  As mentioned before, I will include service at Aria Bar where appropriate. Overall, a very good experience.  A little pricey for what it was even with the PL bid, and some of the infrastructure seemed a little old (see my pictures).  Would stay again if I had to, but would prefer the Embassy Suites in proximity to this hotel.",N
3364,"I was in a crunch, needing to book a Chicago hotel room the night before I arrived without any idea where to go, and the Essex Inn came through for me.  Kind of. Located in the South Loop it's within walking distance to the Art Institute and Millennium Park (both a must). However, there is really nothing within the immediate area and you'll have to go at least a mile to get good food. The hotel itself is, well, dated. But, on the upside, you're in Chicago and shouldn't be spending that much time in your hotel anyways. The décor in the entry and lounge area is very, very, very 80s. Clearly their embracing it because the music was basically Raspberry Beret, Just Died in Your Arms and various Duran Duran songs on loop. Given that you basically have to wait 20 minutes for an elevator (which is already a tiny slice of hell) I think this may constitute a verbal assault. The overall feel of the place is that is maybe trendy at some point 20 to 30 years ago and is clutching to it in a fairly depressing way. Hallways are a bit dim. The breakfast was just sad and pathetic. Nothing can be salvaged; I suggest you go down the street to Yolk. The room itself was decently sized, borderline tight, but I could see it being just too small if you wanted to fit 3 or 4 people in. The bathroom was one of those small ones where opening and closing the door becomes a total production. The shower pressure was pretty abysmal and sometimes the water wouldn't heat up until the second shower (it wasn't winter either), but they had good shampoos and soaps (which I totally didn't take with me...). Wifi was so-so. The heater/AC was possibly from the 50s and was entirely dysfunctional.   The people were friendly in that Mid-Western sort of way. I paid around $160/night with taxes.  It was fine since I booked last minute, but you can absolutely find better hotels for better prices in Chicago.",N
4124,"I had some friends come visit me the weekend of my graduation. But I live in a box (more suitably known as a studio) so there merely wasn't enough room at my place. Enter the Hyatt. I cannot complain when I was able to get it so cheap using Priceline. My friends had never been to Chicago, so the location was ideal, close to the Mag Mile, Millenium Park, all that touristy stuff they like to do...and it has a bar, so that was saving on cover to get into an overrated night spot. All in all, it was a nice place. I think we'll look for another hotel next time, just to have experienced more than one.",N
3962,"Horrible hotel, there is nothing else to stay.",N
326,"Love this hotel, great staff, great location. The train is right by the hotel but it didn't wake me. There's lots of good food near by and it's just a short walk to Wrigley. What more could you want!",N
2064,"We was chillin at tha holidae innn.... Hell no. I guess if you wanted to smoke or whatever it would be a badass hotel to stay at. When I came here for my buddy's wedding, I booked a room through priceline.  They stuck me with a smoking room. Totally disgusting. The front desk lady said, ""on the bright side, we're giving you a really good room with a view."" The view was nice, but it was disgusting because the the smoke smell was suffocating. It smelled like a bar, and I think my clothes came out smelling like smoke too. I would rate the place higher if it wasn't for that.  I think they gave plenty of us nonsmokers in line smoking rooms.  I'm not sure if it was bc we used priceline or what. Usually most upscale hotels are nonsmoking anyway. Anyway, thank goodness it was only for one night.",N
4978,We stayed at the Allerton for 3 nights . Clean and neat and the staff was nice and gave directions to attractions....Short walk to Navy pier and shopping . we ate at the restaurant and food was really good for hotel food that sometimes can be bland .

129,"I like the style of Whitehall much better than Seneca, it's also an older hotel but the style is a little bit more modern than Seneca. It's definitely worth your money if you are to pay the same for the Whitehall or the Seneca. The only reason they are up for comparison is because they are both within steps of the Hancock center and they are both very historical buildings. However, Whitehall just renovated it to be a little more modern and a little less creaky than Seneca. The lobby still retains its old world flair but the rooms have been updated to have plush beds and nice bathrooms. This is the perfect spot for a secret weekend getaway because it makes you feel like you have been hidden away, yet are steps from Michigan ave!",N
4473,"Wonderful old hotel!  We have stayed many times at this historic hotel including on both Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays.  Over the last few years, guest rooms have been slowly renovated.  Renovated rooms are now a great mix of antique/traditional/modern decor.  Especially enjoy the black & white celebrity photos from the old Empire Room lining the halls of the Hilton Honors floors.   Great that pets are accepted--too bad that the are now charging $75....few years ago there was no pet fee.  Also regret that Trader Vics is no longer downstairs--now that was history!",N

5195,"WARNING -We stayed over a holiday weekend - the hotel was over run by ""gang bangers"" who literally were shouting, screaming, fighting in the hallways. People were falling down drunk in the halls. We stayed in our room literally fearing gunfire would erupt , I'm not making this up.  We will never go back to Hotel 71. Consider staying here for the excellent location and price IF, and only if,  you are staying midweek for business. There is little else to recommend this hotel. Boutique? This is a 36 floor tower with hundreds of rooms! There are few good things to say about Hotel 71 other then it's location, right on Wacker and close to everything including local transportation. Given that we spent little time at the hotel, it served our purposes. We booked a three night stay at appx. $130.00 a night and requested a top floor and river view, which was excellent.  The room was decorated but sparse - insufficient writing desk with poor lighting, no pad or pens provided, cheap do it yourself coffee service on desk. Nice settee and the king bed was comfy and clean, I inspected for signs of bedbugs and found none, thankfully, but always check any hotel room immediately. Blankets and pillows were slightly upscale. Bathroom was supplied with minimal soap and shampoo, and threadbare towels, barely meeting cheap motel standards. And your closet is in the bathroom!Hotel 71 has major problems.  First the lobby -- there is none. Think I'm kidding? - try finding a photo of the Hotel 71 lobby; well yes there is a smallish bare bones seating area in front of the front desk but that's it, frankly I've seen better lobbies at the cheapest Motel 6. This carries over to the ""bar - dining area"" bare floor with IKEA style seating that has all the comfort and charm of a bus station at night. Clearly there is a cultural disconnect between Hotel 71 ownership and the expectations of the clients.  However, we were not expecting to spend anytime at the hotel so for us, no problem but your expectations may not be met. But the problems went deeper. Only 2 elevators serve the upper floors and one was out and remained unrepaired over the entire time - making the trip up to the 36th floor more of a commute then an elevator ride. This is unacceptable. It's a shame that the friendly and caring staff are stuck in a physical building that is far from welcoming as possible. Stay here midweek if you need the central location and do not expect to spend anytime here. Do not even THINK about staying here if hotel accommodations and comfort are an important part of your travel plans.",Y
845,"I'm writing this review early-  I just checked in- because I'm so wowed by this hidden gem already! I posted photos-- such a homey feeling in the rooms!! VERY spacious for a downtown property, although I keep forgetting Chicago is not like NYC and San Fran in that respect. I'm a local- but I live in the burbs. I'm downtown for a conference and the hotel where the conference is was sold out, so I looked on TripAdvisor and Yelp to see about this hotel-- and wow! I've walked by here a million times probably and never noticed! How wrong I was! They have free Wi-Fi- which works like a charm - great speed. 24 hour Fitness Center (haven't checked out yet - will update later) and Biz Center. They have a restaurant in the building that opens at 6:30am- will report back later on that as well. This feels more like a very nice apartment than a hotel-- I'm so impressed and the rate we had was VERY REASONABLE.. Will update my review upon checkout but so far- I'm very impressed!!!!  Update: The bed, while roomy and with great sheets and pillows does NOT have a good mattress. Very old and stiff and creaky. Bummer. It was ok to sleep in but if they replaced the mattresses this would be perfecto! Now- I ordered breakfast this morning. I give it 2 stars. Mediocre-- not BAD mind you but nothing yummy. I only got 2 eggs scrambled with toast and coffee but Ho-Hum. For lunch I got a fruit plate- EXCELLENT EXCELLENT and with a fresh bran muffin and yogurt. They deliver FAST here in under 15 minutes which is remarkable. More later!",N
5817,"This place was not worth the money at ALL. If I would've known it was this bad, I would've spend twice the money and stayed downtown. The staff is rude and unprofessional. The whole place is in a bad area and it's dirty and run down. The 'free parking' is hilarious. The parking...uh.. 'structure' is totally unsafe and it was SO hard to even park! The elevator was shakey and felt like it was going to break down, the hallways are dark and the rooms are not welcoming at all. There was hair (from someone shaving) in the sink, a ponytail holder laying on the sink (geez, I felt like someone was already STAYING IN THAT ROOM!), the towel I used had makeup and what looked like spaghetti sauce on it, and when asked (two days in a row I might add) for more, they promised to bring them within 15 minutes and they never came. The shower was making a screeching noise and our room flooded!!! We had to move rooms ..wet luggage and all... in the middle of the night and we had to wake up early the next day. We also asked for the manager in the daytime and nighttime 4 days in a row and he was never available or they said ""he would call up to our room in a few minutes"" and he never did. I left my name and number when I checked out and they never called me. I'm in the middle of dealing with the corporate headquarters now. DON'T STAY HERE. It isn't worth it!!!",Y

The showers don't even have doors, just a strategically placed wall of glass that separates you and a view of the lake. This is the only place I have stayed where I feel they clean the duvet cover between each guest. Yes, I actually felt like I could lay my head on the bed without smelling the last 50 people that stayed in my room. I would definitely stay again.",N
5168,"***Had to come back and comment. I just called the hotel and simply asked that they refund just one night of the three due to no water. They graciously complied. So it's all good. However, I just read a lot of people's complaints and most of them repeat the same thing, about having no water. So it's not an isolated incident. Obviously the W wouldn't have a hotel with no water or un-reliable water supply, so it must be something connected with the loop area of Chicago where the water simply gets shut off periodically.. I bet if they'd known that they would not have even opened up a hotel there in the first place. Imagine, a hotel where you can never rely on having water!I just had an out of town guest who is our business partner stay here for 3 nights because it's close to our offices. We were searching for a new hotel to bring all of our business guests to, and that's about 5 guests a month, plus or minus a few and also our satellite employees who visit once a month.First morning, our business partner gets up and there is NO WATER AT ALL. There was no water until almost noon. And then it was cold water. He had to keep calling over and over. When I came to pick him up, they said a boiler had broken (no emergency back up apparantly) and by the time they fixed it etc. The woman said ""keep running the water and it will get warm"". It didn't. No shower.  At minimum they should have jumped and said ""oh my God, let us move you to a different room immediately, we'll get your things"". Instead they kept discussing the issue instead of alerting the guest since they knew about it, handling it with a room move, and refunding the night. Just the one night, more than that would have been unfair.This morning, before he checked out, the best they could do was luke-warm water.  They did send beautiful chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of middle of the road champagne and gave me 8000 starwoods points, odd since I don't have a Starwood account. But frankly, they should have refunded that one night. You go to a hotel with the expectation that you will be able to shower and clean up after your travels. I am recommending to our company to strike them off the list for the way this issue was handled. It should have been a no-brainer ""we are refunding the one night""  but I guess strawberries and a 5 dollar bottle of champagne are easier.",Y

The food sucked, got a 14$USD cheeseburger that tasted like crap, drinks were pricey too - I think I paid 11 bucks (many times over) for a kettleone + tonic.  Overall it was a nice place though - I am sure I will stay there again, I just won't eat there.",N
4805,"I decided to take my mother to the rooftop bar at the wit on mother's day for a few cocktails. i wanted her to see a trendy boutique hotel such as the wit. we first sat down in the middle of the rooftop area. there were some stool-level gas heat lamp-type things. a server approached us but we weren't ready. we then decided the smell of the gas was uncomfortable, so we took a seat at the bar on the far end. it wasn't open but there were plenty of available stools and there was already 1 other gentleman there. upon switching seats, i notified our cocktail waitress and she said something like 'that's fine. someone should be w you shortly'... after 10 mins, no one came. we proceeded to move indoors because of nobody coming and it got cold. another 10 mins went by and it wasn't until i made eye contact w the manager on duty that i then saw him asking 'are those 2 being taken care of?' to a waitress... 1st round of drinks was fine. we had the prosecco w grenadine... too much grenadine at the bottom of the glass but it was ok. i had a glass of prosecco as my second and it was FLAT. there were barely any bubbles. i was completely dissatisfied, however i didn't complain. i'm now writing this review on here to share my unpleasant experience. the space was cute. the over-head lighting in the indoor portion of the rooftop was kind of tacky. i think a more glamorous, edgy chandelier would be more appropriate than those LED lights. i don't recommend going to the rooftop... may i sugguest the terrace at trump? cocktails are $12 at the wit versus $14 at the trump, a whopping $2 difference. also, the view of the river, navy pier, and various skyscrapers is stunning. there really is no comparing. the wit is edgy and the trump is a little more sophisticated... however, the terrace isn't a suit & tie environment. when considering everything (drinks, prices, views, facility), the wit can't compare to the terrace at trump",Y
2688,"Loved it, every little bit of it. The best location and really the best service. Honestly I am no hotel aficionado and cant compare it to much so I guess I speak from a disadvantaged position. The design was minimalist by nature and I liked it, the bed was uber comfortable and really the service was excellent. Not a darn reason to not go back again!",N
1010,"Weekend trip to Chicago to drop off students at the School of the Arts Institute Chicago. Positives: - Excellent location - The Loop - Walking distance to most everything - Millenium Park a few blocks away - The ""El"" nearby - Many great restaurants - Boutique style hotel - similar to Kimpton - Very nice decor - Snack bar with fee - DVDs available for viewing - Decent view - Friendly and helpful staff - Breakfast available in the elevator lobby of each floor - Donuts, pastries, bagels, yogurt, juice, coffee - all of a higher quality Negatives: - Pricing - I was able to get a corporate rate thru my employer @ $239.00/nite - Bottled water available for a fee - Our room was close to the elevator lobby, so a little noisy - very bearable Not many negatives, really. We had great weather and good temperatures. Loved Chicago.",N
2480,On the negative side: I was not impressed by the $8 for an hour of internet or $18 for a day.  So many other places offer this as a complimentary feature.  Rather put off by this cash grab. Tthe rooms were ok (probably due to when it was built in the 1920s) neither good nor bad.   On the positive side: Beautiful and historic place with a good location.   Well maintained. The common areas were positively beautiful. The biggest plus is the service - superb.  Very friendly and efficient.,N
3722,"We had a romantic weekend here once we were trying to get some stress off.Our experience was so good.You feel like you are walking into a piece of history, with its decadent and richly decorated interior,the pictures of a few famous people on the walls on the way up to the Lobby.We spent the saturday looking around this hotel and grabbing lunch on Michigan avenue and then on sunday we went to the hotel restaurant for the Sunday buffet and that was excellent.Best location,being near the Lake and next to shopping.Overall, it was well worth it! We left stress-relieved!",N

5464,"I was in Chicago in September with my mother for a mother/daughter Oprah weekend.  Once I was 'Oprahed' out, which didn't take long I had the chance to enjoy this quiet and contemporary hotel.  I don't know if we obtained a killer deal but the rooms were not all that expensive, the bathroom was huge with a gigantic tub and a separate shower, I love a separate shower.  I believe this hotel used to be the La Meridian, but I could be wrong.   The rooms were large and the beds were comfortable, the sheets were a little scratchy I don't know if I have become spoiled but I was expecting nicer bedding.  The staff was wonderful and very friendly.  The hotel is located off of Rush Street in the Gold Coast area, which I have heard awful things about.  It really wasn't that bad, I was there during the week so the weekends may be different.  The shopping in the area is very high end along with most of the restaurants in the general vicinity.  All in all I enjoyed my stay at the Davenport even with my crazy Oprah loving mother and her friends, I would stay here again.",N

1936,"This is not a great W hotel. I stay at many around the country, and here,  the rooms are grimy and small, and the bathroom is barely adequate. not luxury. My flight home was cancelled and I had to stay an extra night in Chicago, so I moved to the Lakeshore - HUGE difference.",N
3232,"I...wanna rock n roll all niiiight...and party every day!!  Come here if you want to pretend you're a rock and roll star!  Don't worry, the dark hues and gold trim will hide any evidence of partying too hard into the wee hours.  In fact, if hookers in the lobby at 1am is any indication, this kind of behavior is encouraged!  Seriously.  I saw two of them. Overall, great hotel.  It's like the Sheraton's cooler, funkier, more colorful cousin.  All the hospitality and amenities are there, just rock and roll!  I think my favorite part had to be the bathroom.  No sliding shower door or curtains.  Just a slab of glass covering the shower part with a side entry.  Totally something this mod girl would love having in her house.  Beds are pretty comfy.  What they lack in comfort is made up for in size.  I could spread out without worrying about kicking the bf off the bed (which I am prone to doing on a standard queen)! Request a high floor because the views are stellar.  I could see the Bean from our window!  Oh, and that spiders note by the windows during warm weather is totally true (those of you who have been know what I'm talking about), so keep the windows closed! If there is one reason to stay here, it's the location.  You can't beat it.  Plus it's way affordable if you ""rock"" Hotwire or http://Hotels.com.  I hope I see someone famous next time!",N

4535,"The Palmer House is wonderful, majestic, and historical. From the moment you enter through the doors, you almost feel as if you walked into a different era. It is beautifully decorated and even the smallest details in the decor, show what an elegant hotel it is. It is one of the oldest hotels in the city, but it truely captures Old Chicago essence.",N
3089,"Hotel has a pretty nice lobby/bar area and the room was nice, great view of the lake and navy pier.   Problems:  Parking is $52.00 a day which is outrageous, lots right next door charge nearly half that.  Internet connection costs 14.95/day per device.  So if I wanted to connect my laptop and my phone to the wireless in my room that would be almost $30.00 a day!  When a standard room is $175.00 gotta make these other amenities cheaper.  Even if I just used one device, $14.95 a day?  The connection wasn't even that fast. If these things wouldn't bug you however, I would still recommend the hotel if you're looking for a great lakeshore view with modern decor",N
1401,"I loved this hotel.  Stayed a total of three nights in May of 2009.  We had a one-bedroom suite, which was very clean and well-decorated.   One of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept in.  The bathroom was amazing!  It had a rainfall spout shower and a tub next to it, all encased in glass.  I was very impressed by the bathroom.   They didn't have much in terms of food options, and so I'm giving it four stars.",N
376,The only thing this hotel has going for it is its location on Michigan Avenue.,N
2897,"Just absolutely love this hotel, it's staff, and everything about it.  Great location if you are visiting Chicago, want to be within walking distance of the great sites (i.e. Michigan avenue, Navy Pier, downtown, etc.), but do not want to be caught up in the tourist histeria of Michigan avenue hotels. The views of the river, lake, and city are outstanding if you get a city view that includes all.   Having traveled for years nearly 100% of the time earlier in my career, and staying downtown quite a bit, I think I have stayed at most of the great places in Chicago and in most big cities that I have been to. So I think I have seen it nearly all, both good and bad. This place is the most consistent that I have stayed at in Chicago outside of the Union League Club and the team here always exceeds my expectations, bar none. Traveling with the family?  I really recommend their mini-suites that are along the river, with an adjoining room for the kids.  Nice large room with lots of space to unwind, and with the adjoining room, you end up with two full bathrooms, three TV's, 3 phones, and 2 entry ways for everyone to fight over, plus a very large dining table if your order in, or need some extra space beyond the two desk areas to do work or have the kids play games. They really have kept the place up and it is very nicely appointed.  As far as the earlier comments about knobs or dials instead of digital readouts, these don't bother me.  I would hate for them to upgrade the units just to get more advanced readout displays, and our space was really well ventilated and comfortable. Pool and workout space is great, very clean, and well monitored. If you arrive early and your room is not available, or if you need a place to hang after checkout, I really recommend the club or concierge room on the 33rd floor.   Great complimentary snacks (great hors'vrs in the evening), fruit, coffee, tea, and bottled water, plus on the second level, great business center with computers for your use. Also, nice entertainment area for watching tv and relaxing.  My real favorite is the leather massage chair.  Really a nice perk! Oh, and if you are a starwood member (http://spg.com) you get express check in and check out, and you can use your points to get free rooms or discounted rooms that are an absolute steal. Be nice, and depending on availability, they will upgrade you for free.  They are really happy to do it, and you'll be happy too!",N
4974,"Can't beat the location of this Hotel.  Our room was very spacious (King) and had a great view of N Michicgan Avenue, the Water Tower, etc.  We did happen to score a room on the 22nd floor.  I don't know how anyone else encountered issues with this hotel, from the other reviews.  The flat screen TV had Cable TV (of course, if you know how to work a remote, it was very easy to navigate through the menu and screen and cable channels.  It was a holiday weekend, a fully booked hotel, and a very large wedding party was staying at the hotel. No issues with chekc-in, service, front desk or TV. Staff was respectful and helpful when needed.   Checking bags after check-out and the car valet service were each very convenient.  I recommend this hotel to anyone looking to spend some time on the Magnificent Mile.  Only gripe:  no complimentary WiFi service in the hotel rooms.",Y

The staff was friendly and helpful, and the hotel clean.  Each employee that we encountered seemed to enjoy their work and performed in top form. I believe this also reflects on the management - happy work environments create happy workers! The view from the Sky Lounge on the 40th floor is breathtaking, and we enjoyed our breakfast there each morning before venturing out for the day, even the young ones thought it was cool.  This hotel is in the heart of it all and within walking distance to great shopping, site seeing, and restaurants.  I could go on and on but you really need to see it for yourself.  If you go to Chicago stay at the Avenue Hotel!  The Jones family will definitely be back.",Y

1707,"There's a certain ridiculousness about this place.  The decor is absurd.  It's like some sort of satanic Eyes Wide Shut wannabe mixed with Ikea mixed with some Ansel Adams/Norman Rockwell musical-note visual art (no nod to actual MUSIC however, unless you count the date-rape disco being piped into the lobby area).   THE ROOMS ARE TINY!!!  I reserved the room online and wondered why it was so cheap for the area, but the web photos looked so nice.  Well, because it's like a 10 x 7 ft. room with a dinky washbasin in lieu of a sink, cruise-ship style.  FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT STAY IN ONE OF THE REGULAR ROOMS WITH MORE THAN ONE PERSON FOR ANY EXTENDED PERIOD!  You could go nuts enough to write in a bunch of ALLCAPs at the memory. I did appreciate the power strip embedded in the side of the desk.. They have a drink at their bar called the ""Crimson Cooler"" -- it's made with organic hibiscus infused vodka, muddled organic strawberries, organic agave nectar, and thai basil.  It's my perfect drink.  The bar was closed to the public though for private parties half the time we were there, which was rather disappointing and annoying. I'll be trying another hotel next time I visit the windy city. (I feel like such a honkey writing this review.)",N
1408,"This is a great hotel to stay in but beware, if you leave something behind you most likely won't see it again! I stayed here for a wok trip and had a blast. The hotel is very nice, concierge is extremely helpful, beds were comfy and the martini bar was delicious. However....and I know it's partly my fault but... I left a very expensive hair curler in the room to the left of the sink and 24 hours later when I called and realized I hadn't packed it, housekeeping said it was no where to be found! I swear to you I left it there, right in that spot, would bet my life on it and STILL, it's no where to be found by the staff. So I definitely recommend this place but don't leave anything behind!",N
4446,"If you want a nice time warp feeling and to feel as if you were a high roller in the 50s, then head to the Palmer House.  This sprawling huge monstrosity of a hotel has housed many many important people...and unfortunately many many cigarettes.   The rooms do have a reminiscent smell of ""old"" which can either be charming or disgusting, depending on your frame of mind.  Bathrooms are small and relatively basic, but the ambiance of the Palmer House is really what you stay there for, not the modern amenities.",N

5774,"We had an OK stay at this Marriott location.  The room was beautiful and clean, bathroom was large and accommodating for me and my daughter to get ready for our night at Lollapolooza.  When we checked in the housekeeper was just finishing up our room which was fine.  But once we returned from a long night of partying we realized there was no hand soap and only 1set of face and bath towels was left.  As a frequent guest I would have thought my 'profile of preferences' might have made a difference, but it turns out they treat us all same even with the customized customer data available. This may seem a little particular to some, but having a full curtain to block the blazing summer morning and the UIC medical center's ongoing ambulance sirens would have been a nice touch as well.  Instead there was only a full sheer curtain that made certain you didn't miss the 11am checkout.                               Service was decent.  Drive up valet was haphazard and the driveway was extremely narrow with no one regulating check-in.  When a bellman did come out he asked our last name and verified valet service, but they did not offer to carry luggage to the room or supply a cart for us to manage on our own.  There was typical poor service when you hand the attendant your card and they place your card on the counter.  Lastly, after a night of Lollapalooza, the front desk didn't seem too happy to receive my request for towels at midnight...although it could have been avoided by reading my 'preference for extra towels' on my profile.   I appreciated the housekeeper NOT ignoring the 'do not disturb' door sign and rapping on my door prior to the checkout time this time.  I also appreciated the FREE shuttle service up to 1 mile away from the hotel.  There's plenty city you have access to within a mile and a minimal taxi ride fee.  However, if you don't ask for it, they will NOT offer.  Anyway, we had an AWESOME late night dinner at Hackney's (I'll save that review for their page).   In all at the hotel was nice, but for the $270 price tag you might be able to find a more service focused hotel to accommodate your needs.",N
1687,"The design and over-all look to the place is fun and refreshing from your standard generic hotel fare -- sure to attract many a hipster.  But it seemed like it was mostly old ladies in town to see Tommy Tune in Dr. Dolittle or some other show, as this place is smack dab in the theater district. The price is right, and the staff are actually pretty helpful.  We had a tub that wouldn't drain and by the time we got back from breakfast it was fixed.  Not bad. The TV is the sadly the same 2001 fakey flat screen Toshiba that I have at home -- and it had a bad hissing problem until I figured out the volume settings were all wonky.  But still, not bad.  The wifi was working and the Chivas in the wet bar was only 5 bucks so I was happy. Then came Monday morning.  9 am.  It sounded like a guy was having a wrestling match with his vacuum cleaner outside our door.  Tried as a might to sleep through it, I just couldn't.  The guy was yelling, banging around, vacuuming up a storm, seemingly in the same square foot of carpet right next to our door for at least a half hour.  And right as I'd given up all hope of not having to get out of bed and calling someone -- he moved on.  Not the way you'd want to be woken up after a long night. But aside from that incident and the small nit-picky things, it was a good place to stay.  It was too bad we weren't around for the free wine services -- that seemed like a nice bonus.  I can't say anything about the restaurant or the bar that are next door, they looked a bit over-priced and well, not the kind of places I'd go to.  But those places probably have their own yelp pages.",N
1300,"This hotel has the most beautiful lobby in all of Chicago.  Guaranteed.  I know because we visited every darn hotel in downtown Chicago looking for the best lobby to take wedding photos in.  This idea was the perfect solution to a middle of July wedding where outside pictures would equal one sweaty bride, groom, and wedding party. The lobby has a beautiful fountain with lots of open windows that lets in lots of natural sunlight.  Past the fountain, there is a whole wing that leads to the ballroom areas and it is beautifully decorated with damask carpeting, beautiful chandeliers, and furniture that is equally modern and classic. The moment we saw it, thoughts of the Drake and the Peninsula were out the window. Of course, we didn't just sneak in with 15 people to take pictures in this beautiful space, we stayed here too!  We had an amazing suite with breathtaking views of the city.  It was probably the nicest hotel room I have ever seen, and was also the perfect space for the getting ready wedding photos....  And of course, the perfect space for our wedding night. I also got to experience the spa and I had an awesome massage and a fabulously relaxing experience in the steam room. It was the perfect stress reliever the morning before the wedding! If I was a total baller and could have a platinum wedding at any hotel in Chicago, this would absolutely be the one. We were lucky enough to be able to take advantage of this hotel's amazing space for photos and experience the luxury of this hotel for our wedding night.  I am hoping we can make another visit on our anniversary.",N
2685,"This place is amazing! I decided to get a room when a group of my friends came to visit. I'd paid for a regular room that was designed to accommodate three people in separate beds (two doubles and a rollaway). When I arrived to check in, they told me that my room would not accommodate three people in three bed, but no problem -- they'd upgrade me to an apartment room. Woo hoo! I was even given a complimentary drink from the Primehouse menu while I waited for them to make up the new room. The ""apartment"" was perfect. We had a dining area, a separate lounge area, a large bar with an iPod dock and speakers and a great sleeping area. The decor is ultra modern, but it manages to still feel warm, luxurious and comfortable. The staff was generous and worked hard to make us feel welcome. The concierge was very helpful and managed to get us on the guest list at Reserve on extremely short notice. We were also given special passes to skip the line at J Bar, but we didn't have time to use those. We were generally made to feel like royalty the entire time we were there. I was actually kinda sad when it was time to go home :) All in all, the experience cost me a small fortune, but for our once-a-year girls' weekend barhopping extravaganza, it was definitely worth it.",N
2649,"Loved this hotel! Stayed here with Vanessa N and Kristin C on our Chicago adventures. A chearming botique hotel, they feature Kiehl's bath products and turndown service twice a day. At the second turndown service, they even lay bathrobes on the bed and provide you with little cookies bked fresh from David Burke Primehouse downstairs. Lovely. it's also conveient - two blocks from the Red Line, close to Pizzaria Uno, Pizzaria Due and Petrillos. Trader joe's is directly across the street, if you don't want to spend the extra money on the room's bar/snack service. It's also a couple blocks away from the shopping on Michigan Ave.",N
723,"Motel 6 quality at Hyatt prices. This Westin has the worst rooms I've ever experienced in a Westin.  The bedding hasn't been replaced in 5 years and is beat to heck, the rooms are Tokyo-tiny, and half the rooms in the hotel seem to be located behind the elevator.  Sound insulation is also nonexistant.  I don't think I got more than 4 hours of sleep any of the 3 nights I was there. Overall, I get the sense that this Westin is around a decade past a need for a general upgrade. The only reasons they get two stars are: the staff was extremely nice and personable, and the conference facilities and catering are quite good.   Overall: attend a conference at the Westin, just don't sleep there.",N
1095,"It was a nice hotel, great location, great gym that was connected and everyone there was very accommodating.  I can't say much for the rooms though.  The rooms weren't too big, it smelled, the beds seemed smaller than a full but bigger than a twin and the bathrooms in the lobby were better looking.   And it was weird how we had to take an escalator down a floor to take an elevator up to our rooms.  And the carts that held all the towels, toilet paper and everything else they used to clean each room stayed parked outside our room all weekend.  I mean it was convenient when we needed towels and all but just an eyesore.   The location is great though, there's a gym you can use for free if you join the presidential club on-line, small grocery store right around the corner, Millennium Park down the street and a short walk to Michigan where you can find almost anything you need.",N

Reservation made for conference, couldn't get out with other hotels booked.  Got bit like crazy, bed bugs all up in here!  Checked them out on the internet and it turns out that they have had lawsuits at this hotel for bed bug attacks!  Just put it into google and see for yourself.  I'd avoid this place.",N

I should mention that the service was great and there was good coffee.",N

3022,"-Good size room -One side of the hotel has really nice views (I did not get that side unfortunately, but we know that view is gorgeous from waiting for the elevators) -Convenient to the beach, navy pier, bike riding up and down the shore. -NOT convenient to the subway, 7 block walk.  It gets tiring if you are running back and forth from the hotel. -Walking distance to N. Michigan Ave, like 4 blocks. -The Acura Experience is ONLY available from 12pm-7pm - a lot more limiting than you think. Spots also fill up fast, so make sure to book at least a few hours ahead.  To use it, you have to go by their schedule.  We only got to use it once.  The entire ""experience"" is a sales pitch.

I have never really had a bad experience (do not order a bloody mary though). The sandwiches are the best by far of any of the places to have tea in Chicago....the pastries are also equally as wonder. The hotel is not actually a Ritz-Carlton which is why it comes up a bit short....service has always been kind and attentive. They do not pour your tea for you or wait on you hand and foot but it is enough. I cannot wait until they re-open in May",N
271,"Rate, location, security and staff were better than the vast majority of hotels I've stayed - which is bunches - I travel for business A LOT. For those that base their vacations on room decor, we may not see eye to eye. I couldn't care less about it, but to describe the room best I'd say  the decor was far from cutting edge (just shy of tacky yet nondescript), the room itself was big and comfortable. It could use new carpet and updated bedding but it had a nice desk, couch, king bed, 3 closets (seemed odd, but whatever) and a kitchenette that was really cutely tucked away within the room. I was very surprised to find a full size fridge, small sized stovetop oven (not that I needed it, but if I were coming over from Europe or anywhere else I'd be very psyched for that as a bonus). We did hear about other people with air conditioning issues with their room; we were totally uneffected. Just in case the room influences that, #1012 is a safe bet. At 129/night, I felt it was a bit of a gamble given this hotel's prime location literally behind the Hancock and kitty corner from Water Tower. You could practically throw a rock at either. I'm originally from Chicago and recently moved out east and was back on business for a week. Trust me, hotels in that location cost at least double. People who live on that block spend more money on their dogs than I will make in my lifetime. This hotel is easily 100/night less than counterparts in this neighborhood. Shopping is pinnacle Michigan Ave, and Oak Street beach is easily walked (a couple blocks). A few things you might not know (if you aren't from there): A neat place to grab a drink is the Hancock. Instead of the observation deck, go up for a cocktail and have the same view while having a nip. Also, on the 600 N. block of St. Clair (about 3 blocks South) is a great little italian place called Coco Pazzo Cafe. Reasonable prices, outdoor seating and outstanding food. If you ask the concierge about it, be sure they direct you to the St. Clair location and not Hubbard (though I'm sure it's just as good, it's not within walking distance). Two more things! Something that really caught me was the security. Nowhere that I've stayed in Chicago has had key entrances near the elevator bank. I thought this feature was a cupcake. Something all the downtown hotels should have everywhere! It gave me an extra bonus sense of security. Lastly, the staff was super friendly and efficient. We left the ""do not disturb"" sign on our room when we went out for the day and when we got back to the room we had a message on our phone from the head of the cleaning staff letting us know, in the most pleasant tone ever, that they had not cleaned our room so as not to disturb us and to call them if we needed anything(!). In fact, from arrival at the valet, through checkin and at checkout, all staff members were just that - super friendly, and most importantly, efficient. I agree with another reviewer that said this hotel was neither romantic nor trendy, but if you're looking for an attentive, quality hotel experience while adventuring into Chicago (especially if you're interested in the ""mag mile""), don't hesitate.",N
2210,"This is probably one of the best hotels in Chicago.  The Intercontinental has a fabulous location on Michigan Avenue, and it has excellent service and is very nice.

I haven't seen the pool but I heard it is gorgeous, and it is directly connected to Zest Restaurant which I've heard is fab.",N
4389,"Shhhhwanky. As I type this review, I am sitting in my room at the Palmer House Hilton.  I am in Chicago on business, and found this hotel after checking hhonors because the W (the preferred hotel in Chicago) was sold out.   Overall, the room is very nice, albeit very small (on the 13th floor).  The lobby is huge, and reminds me a lot of the Westin St. Francis or the Sir Francis Drake back in SF.  It has that ""blue hair appeal"" that makes a 28 year old feel a bit out of place.  If you're into flirting with GILF's or something, this place is a goldmine.  The hotel staff are polite and helpful.  The bathroom is the size of an iphone, at least the one in my room is.  If you stay here, ask for the state/adams side rather than the monroe/wabash side so you don't have to listen to the L trains every few mins.  This side is much quieter. I'd stay here again (especially with the double points hhonors promo), but this definitely isn't my favorite hotel on earth.  Its a clean, nice, and moderately opulent hotel suitable for its 250/night price.",N
2283,"Spent a week here for a work conference and extended for a girls' trip for a couple days.  Very convenient location. Shops, bars, restaurants are all within walking distance.  Taxis came quickly.  Service was friendly and helpful.   The rooms were decent; bathroooms were a little smaller than I would have liked (hey, I was sharing with another woman!).   The fact that they had a real, full-on Starbucks in the lobby was a HUGE plus.  To me, nothing is worse than having to attend day after day of a grueling national sales meeting with bad coffee.  Every day started off right here!!!  A bar being in the center of the lobby meant you were never far away from a cocktail the second work was done, either.   I haven't stayed anywhere else in downtown Chicago so I don't have much to compare it to in the city but it was a great location at a decent price for a big city.",N
4739,"Newer hotel, cosmopolitan decorum. Nice rooms (little small), good staff, good locations. Short walk to public transportation that will take you to most city sites and shopping. Did not notice any Hotel bar or restaurant, lobby is kind of small but comfortable. Short walk (4-6 blocks) to some of Chicago's popular restaurants and clubs. Only con, as usual in Chicago, is parking. Parking in downtown Chicago is a B***h, thanks to Mayor Dayle. Parking is tight and expensive. Closes parking I could find was 4 blocks away (this is why valet parking is so expense at all of the downtown hotel). Unless you really need a car its best to leave it at home and use what public transportation is available (bus, taxi, shuttle, etc)",Y
230,"We stayed at the Hotel Indigo during our first visit to Chicago (7/6-7/10/09). The location was very close to the upscale shopping of Michigan Ave and the John Hancock Observatory. And much to my surprise, it was a short walk to the beach area located near the Drake Hotel. I enjoyed the neighborhood feel of this hotel. I didn't feel like I was really in the city. The rooms were very spacious and had lots of natural light. The hotel decor gives it a beachy feel.  The beds were very comfortable and the common areas were kept clean. I believe this hotel accepts pets as the room next to us had a dog. My only gripe is the lack of ""cheap eats"" in the area. I used yelp a couple of times and found a great breakfast spot not too far from the hotel you have to check out: http://www.yelp.com/biz/.... Other than that, you won't really find any ethnic foods, especially the kind I'm used to living in the SF area. I would definitely recommend staying at the Hotel Indigo for your first visit to Chicago!",N
4391,"Like many http://tripadvisor.com reviewers said, the walls at the Palmer House are paper-thin. I was awakened by my neighbors' coital activity. Not my idea of a morning call.  And I stayed in the renovated room. Aren't things suppose to improve with renovations? I'm with Jenelle. While the lobby is gorgeous, I'm not resting my head there. I love gawking at hotels, but ultimately, what rates the hotel is its comfort and location. The Palmer House merits its 3 stars with its comfortable bed, tightly-drawn curtains and location. A short walk to Michigan Avenue, Millenium Park, Art Institute and the Theater District. What more could one ask for, except a little more quiet, unless that wink-wink-nudge-nudge sound system is your kind of thing.",N
2767,"the james is now the hotel that i compare all others to when i'm booking my vacation. as someone who likes to go to chain hotels for their reliability, i was a bit apprehensive about my visit to the james.  but let me stop there because from the moment i walked into the lobby, the james was an oasis. from the pictures, you can see that it's a very modern hotel, but it was the little touches that made my stay the 5 stars that i gave this establishment.  i was sold the moment i walked into my room and there was soothing music playing in the background and seconds later found the keihl's products in the bathroom with a sliding door!  (i might even consider this for my future small condo!)  the hotel is also within walking distance to the pier, mag mile shopping, sears tower, john hancock building, dunkin donuts, trader joe's and pretty much everywhere else in the city, if you don't mind doing a bit of walking (greek town, little italy, etc.) i would definitely return here the next time i'm in chicago or find the next place that can compete with the james.",N
2139,"Went to Chicago and decided to try out the Intercontinental hotel in Chicago. We were updated to the Vice-Presidential Suite (nice!). The room was dated but impressive. The room was probably  setup 15 years ago, and had minimum maintenance since then. The floor tiling was clearly worn. The suite is on the 35th floor. The wind at that level can be severe and there was clear wind noise from the windows, to a level where we had to close the door to the bed-room to be able to fall asleep at night. Maybe time for an upgrade. The room has two bedrooms and a nice living room. No less than 3 restrooms, 2 showers, so quite nice. The beds are very comfortable. The daily internet rate is $19, which is a bit steep, for mediocre speed. The room has an internet terminal and there is wireless access through iBahn. The hotel elevators were good and well maintained. The lobby is attractive and the bell stand quite effective. The front desk was slow in processing but very courteous once they serviced us. There is a Starbucks just off the lobby. Nice! They have flight information available in the lobby, very convenient. The restaurant on the mezzanine level is OK but not great. Great place to stay if you want more of a historic visit to Chicago. Great location, but this is a hotel that has not seem much updates / maintenance since 1980. Some people like that style and others are allergic to it. At the price charged I am disappointed that we did not have free internet and the rooms are dated with noise, ...",N
2642,"I can't make enough positive comments about the James Hotel.  It's an upscale hotel in a great location.  The rooms were comfortable and very clean.   But there's more.  This hotel separates itself from the others in two ways: 1.  They don't 'nickel and dime you' to death.  Everything's included in the price, even the internet. 2.  The staff is incredibly personable.  While the hotel is upscale, it's not snooty.  Everyone is so nice.  All the staff talks to you.  I'm not one who stays at the Ritz because they have great service, but lack personality.  The James isn't like that.  They combine quality with amazing, personable service. Stay at this hotel.  And tell the front desk staff that Ken sent you...   ;)",N
2187,"My husband and I needed to vacate our apartment for a night and we utilized Hotwire to get a hotel room. We ended up at the Intercontinental and I am pleased that we did. Now, I had been to the bar numerous times for high-end cocktails (delicious, incidentally) but had never been in a room.  The rooms are decorated tastefully, if not a bit boring. But the bathroom was big, the bed was comfy and the small window-thick drape combo made our room look like 2 am when it was 8 in the morning. Oh, Glorious Darkness! I will definitely recommend the Intercontinental to friends when they come to town. Could they stay with me? Sure. But with the street lamps outside our place, it looks like 8am at 2 in the morning. Sadness.",N
4565,"This review is for Potters, the bar/lounge at Palmer. On balance this place is not bad, however; the service has been inconsistent on the last couple of visits. I came here with a friend on Saturday a couple months ago and found the place to be a perfect sanctuary: dark with plentiful bar snacks, non-hovering service, and an inventive cocktail menu. On my most recent visit, a rainy Friday after catching a preview exhibition at the Art Institute, the female server apparently couldn't be bothered. After ordering, it took a long time to get my drink (given that the crowd was moving more into dinner hour than happy hour), then again to get another round, and finally, the check, which another server, male this time, finally took care of. I would like to think that this lapse in service was not due to the fact that I was flying solo on this visit. There were also no snacks in evidence. Not certain if this is a new cost-cutting measure here or a sign of things to come. That day, the space also seemed to be filled with several young kids (think 9-13 year olds) as part of a family or other traveling group. Now, I am not anti-kid by any means, but these ankle-biters and their parents apparently didn't get the memo that children are to be seen and not heard.",N

4378,"-1 star for no mini bar or mini fridge in the room. The BEST part about staying in a hotel room (other than having your bed made for you) is raping the mini bar!! -1 star for no wireless internet in the room. I will not be subjected to sitting stationary at a desk when there is a perfectly good bed from which to surf the net from. A lot of business people stay here and it is 2010...get with it Hilton! -1 star for no airport shuttle! Total bummer, and less expensive establishments general provide this service! Other than those major complaints, this hotel is GORGEOUS! The reception/bar area is decorated classically. The rooms were large, clean, and didn't make you feel like you were sleeping in a hotel straight out of the 80s and the hotel is in a great location very close to Millennium Park! For some reason it was hard to get a hold of the concierge and I was put on hold more than once for longer than I deem appropriate at such a hotel. Twice I even hung up and called back and got an answering machine rather than a real person! Me thinks they need to hire more staff! I also requested that a wireless internet bridge be delivered to my room when one became available; a request that was ignored and never followed up on to explain whether there was availability or not. Boo for customer service. On the plus side there is a full service Starbucks on the ground floor which saved my life - twice! However, next time I'm in town, I'll most likely be staying elsewhere...",N
5824,"My boss booked two rooms here because the price was so attractive for Chicago.  Big mistake!  I'm not too much of a snob to stay somewhere that looks a little seedy but when the first thing you see is a hooker walk out with her ""john"" behind her putting his belt back on I have to wonder if this is the place I want to stay for two days.  We walked into the lobby and the first thing that hits you is the sour moth ball taste.  The second thing that hits you is the ""concierge"" who said without word from me or my boss ""you know you have to pay even if you don't stay here.""  What topped it all off was the steel gate over the windows, the barb wire fence around the building, the view of the gravel lot, and the tethered remote on the side table.  I just felt like I was going to raped, jacked, or knifed.  I in fact did not get refunded so I definitely got ripped off.",Y
3247,"Stayed overnight here last week and out of the two hotels I stayed at in my trip, this was def. the better of the two. I was able to check in at 1pm (even tho check is at 3pm) - very cool since I had been traveling since 5am and was pretty damn tired. Front lobby was nothing spectacular - a couple of couches and concierge but they do have some cool music playing there. There are also 2 computers in the lobby area that you can use for free! The room itself is very sleek and modern. Lots of mirrors in this room! The bed was really comfortable - pillow-top mattress and down pillows! Aveda products to use in the bathroom - very nice! There is a sensored mini-bar - so while you can look, the moment you move the item, you will get charged. Whats great is that there is a 24 hr fitness and business center free of use age! Which is great because I love to check my email everyday. Overall, very convenient location - 2 blocks away from Millennium park, Chicago River, near a lot of their subway lines, and many shops and stores. The comforter was a little thin though - but then maybe its because I'm always cold, and thought that even in July, Chicago was cold! Wish there was a complimentary continental breakfast like the Amalfi hotel had that I stayed in earlier in the month, but that's okay. Def. would love to stay here again when I come back to Chicago!",N
1307,"This is not are review for hosting an event at the Ritz., or traveling on business at the Ritz. This is a ""my husband and I decided to treat ourselves to a night downtown"" type of review. As such, our stay was a little underwhelming. The location, staff, and room service were all at a five star level but, sadly other aspects of our stay made us feel like this hotel is just not worth the price tag. Our room was a bit shabby, the mini bar looked to be on it's last leg and the carpet was coming up all along the edges of the room. While I was waiting for my husb to arrive, I tried to watch some TV. The cable service was terrible. Half the channels were out and it took about 3-5 seconds for the picture to appear when changing channels. There was also a slight error in our room service order (received decaf coffee instead of regular). We would have thought nothing of these small inconveniences had we been paying about $200 less for the room.  Next time we stay downtown we'll be doing  just that by booking a room somewhere else.",N
3866,"We enjoyed the Dana. Very nice staff and comfortable rooms. The beds are pretty plush with 300-count fabrics, but not quite the quality of the Westin. A little squishy for sleeping. Great shower and room features. We had a view of Holy Name Cathedral. A few negatives: the air conditioner was loud and would wake us up at night. Also, the continental breakfast was subpar. I think with some tweaking, I could give Dana a 5. Also, great location!",N

1630,"This hotel is like Joan Rivers. It looks okay on the outside, but everything inside is falling apart. The wallpaper in the hotel room was peeling off, the hot water handle ""on"" the sink in the bathroom fell off, and the shower faucet sprayed water so strong and aggressively it almost knocked me out of the shower a few times. The towels in the bathroom were cheap and overly linty. There was also no mini-fridge (which is always greatly needed) and the TV was a piece of junk (not a newer flat-screen as their web site indicated)--the reception was also horrific. Great location (despite filming at the time) and the staff were pleasant enough. I later noticed in the lobby cobwebs hanging from the crookedly positioned valances and lights. That should've been our first clue. Anyway, we also ate at the restaurant in the hotel. Very mediocre. There was even a piece of hair or thread on my hamburger bun. Gross.",N
4910,"We spent a huge amount of money getting a big suite.  When I called and booked it, they gave me one price.  When we showed up, they tried to charge me several hundred more.   I ended up getting the quoted price, but what a pain. Our main room was too dark, so we asked for a few lamps to be delivered to when we were going out for the evening. When we returned, there was just one more table lamp, and placed on the floor!  Then we discovered the TV didn't work.  When we called to report it, the first question was, ""Is it plugged in?""  Did they think we were idiots?  Even if they thought we were, when your guest pays that kind of money, you just say you will send someone right up.  As it turned out, the TV was broken.  There were some loose hardware pieces in one of our bathrooms, too.  Granted, it's an old building and that is part of its charm, but they should make sure all the screws are tight.  It went down after a national chain hotel bought it, that is for sure.",Y
3796,"Oy, this was a hard one to rate. The abridged version is that this is a 4 star review for solo travelers and exhibitionists.  2 stars if you want to keep a little bit of mystery alive in your marriage. First the good... Beautiful hotel for a good price in a super convenient location.  If I were travelling solo, I would definitely go back.  The staff was very pleasant.  The chocolate covered fortune cookies with turn down service were a nice touch. Service at the restaurant was a little slow - but courteous and the food was good.  The fitness center equipment was more than adequate.  Others have noted the small locker rooms for the spa, but I had a decent massage and enjoyed my time there. If I were staying by myself, this would have been a 4 star review.  I'm still docking one star because I could hear traffic noise on the 18th floor and the elevators were a bit annoying, but generally - great hotel. Which brings us to the not so good... For travelers with companions, this should really be a 2 star review.  Because despite all of the nice amenities, for the love of God, what is up with the pooper? The bathroom shower has a clear glass wall looking out into the room which then looks out onto the lovely views of Chicago.  There is a curtain outside the bathroom to block the view out - or more critically, the view in - if you want a bit of privacy. I can almost give them the clear shower stall.  I can see the appeal of catching your partner washing their hair (I was travelling with my cousin, so the magic was really lost on me - but I see what they were going for). But just past the clear shower, is the clear divider to the toilet.  And there ain't nothing sexy about that.  To add insult to injury, the sliding barn door that doubles as a closet door doesn't close all of the way or stay put. And even if you close the curtain for privacy, in the middle of the night, the entire bedroom will be aglow when you flip on the bathroom light.  So your traveling companion can wake up when you flip on the light in the bathroom, and then lay in bed and listen to you pee because the frackin' door won't close? Who the heck thought that one up?",N
5595,I love Westin hotels. They r some of my favs due to the Heavenly bedding & modern design. This one did not disappoint. The location is wonderful. I recommend splurging for the waterfront room.

I'd highly recommend this hotel for great location & beautiful room!,N
1629,"So for our 2.5 year anniversary I left all the planning up to my boyfriend. I was pleasantly surprised at the hotel he picked for us to stay...admittingly I am sort of a ""hotel snob"", & from walking in the door to checking out had a very good experience. My boyfriend surprised me with having chocolates covered strawberries ready and waiting in our room as a romantic surprise. They also delivered a bottle of White wine on our first night (our official anniversary date). The decor of the hotel was pretty modern & our room was huge! We had an amazing view of the city from our room, I couldnt stop looking out the window & actually slept with the windows open. The only reason I couldnt rate this hotel a 5star hotel. We encountered 2 problems. One of the 2 elevators stopped working so guests had to use either the 1 working elevator or the service elevator, which made length deliveries & things much longer. Also I have really sensitive skin & dont use the soaps provided by the hotel management, so I usually travel with my own soap, not thinking anyone would throw it away i left it in the shower, for the next time i use it. When we got back to our room after being out all day, I noticed our room was cleaned & my soap was gone & replaced with a brand new HOTEL BAR OF SOAP. Luckily we were close enough to everything, from downtown, millenium park & shopping..I was able to replace what they had thrown away...needless to say I didnt leave my soap in the shower in the next morning.",N
2406,"Location. Location. Location. This hotel sits on the ever famous Michigan Mile, and is within blocks of  the red line and other trains. It's within walking distance of Grant Park, Dunkin Donuts, restaurants, shopping, banks, museums...do I keep going?   Size. Size.Size. Be warned, this is not your mom and pop hotel. It's massive. Conventions are held here year round.  I stayed during some kind of a real estate banking gig, and I was almost swallowed by the seat of suits...not that I am complaining. Bigger is better, and in this case you can bet the farm on it. My room was spacious. 2 beds, and 2 matching bathrooms. Yup, 2 matching bathrooms! Girls need not worry about having to share sink space. The Extra's: Customer service was stellar. The housekeeping staff, the room service, the front desk, the bell hop, and even the guy opening my door and getting my cab. I was impressed. Originally, I checked into the 12th floor but was not too thrilled about the smoke smell in room.  Not sure if the past guest was smoking or the 10th floor was creeping through my vent.  I called the front desk and was moved promptly to the 17th floor. I appreciated the immediate attention to my concern.   The Filler: -1 star for $50 dollar for late check out fee to 1PM and $75 to 3PM. Yeah...wait what? I also didn't appreciate having to pay a $2 fee for each bag I stowed.  It helped, but shouldn't this service be free? Nonetheless, this hotel is historic. It's spacious. It's old school. It's friendly.  Respect the game, and enjoy the craziness. If you got the cash, stay here.",N

She upgraded my room on the spot and advised that she would do her best to upgrade (at check-in) to a lakeview room - which she did! Once we were there, the beauty of the hotel just knocked me out! From the lobby to the gold elevators to the room itself (with a lakeview and of course the view of The Taste) were fantastic!! Location was the biggest plus - it was just perfect!! Yes it's an older hotel but I think that adds to the beauty. Yes, they say it's haunted but we didn't experience any of that - too bad, might have been cool. And yes, there were picketers but they didn't bother me in the least. The only warning I would have is that parking in the garage behind the hotel can cost you $28 - $33 per day.

4050,"This hotel is HUGE.  Stayed 3 nights for a convention and there must have been at least 7 other ones going on at the same time.   PROS: - room decor is decent - beautiful atrium in the main lobby - great staff: professional and courteous. Most notably, Tamika Y. from the catering group who really went above and beyond to help me when I was in a bind, and Eric from the business center who was just great and also went above and beyond in helping me take care of my shipments. - very centrally located in DT Chicago - room service food was pretty damn good  AND quick; 20 minutes tops and I ordered twice. CONS: - there was a union strike with the housekeeping staff which made the atmosphere generally uncomfortable and ps I hope what I read abt the Hyatt's treatment of their staff was untrue! - I echo another Yelper's review here: my room was right next to the elevators too and wow...the best way I can think of describing the noise is to think of planes flying overhead ... It woke me up a couple of times ... - the bathroom smelled ... Like ... Mildew ... YUCK. The tub had black stains in it, super yuck. - the water pressure in the bathroom sink was annoyingly low. - the bed was neither here nor there, not the most comfy but not terrible - the wifi in room is a friken joke. Connection is intermittent and slow.  You receive a code every 24 hrs and if you lost that code you're screwed. Oh and it ain't cheap either. OVERALL: - it wouldn't be my first pick for a hotel but it's a decent place and I would stay there again...sans elevator noise and pick lines.",N
3127,"My stay at the W Lakeshore was my first W experience, and overall it was really good. I liked the minimalist decor in the room, and thought the wood paneled wall was a nice touch. The bathroom was definitely nice, and the bath products were better than most hotel chains. The lobby bar seemed pretty cool, although I didn't get a chance to check it out. And the location was pretty good for where I needed to be in the River North area. The only area where the W Lakeshore fell short was the frat boy clientele that invaded the place on Friday night. In San Francisco we would call them the Bridge and Tunnel crowd, but in Chicago they were just a bunch of loud fuckin idiots who think a hotel is their personal playground at 4 in the morning. Kind of ruined the whole ""urban sophisticate"" vibe the W is trying to go for.",N
2726,"OK so to start things off, we stayed there during ""Leprechaun Season"" which was a mistake on it's own.

Bed was nice, and big enough for 2 or three ;o The only other complaint I had was, our room didn't have a comfy foot rest for the ""red leather deco-chair""... I really could have used that to prop our feet up- guess we should have gotten the room next door!",N

I love the mini bar with great selections at decent sizes and prices too. Don't forget the travel sex toys! The alarm clock has an ipod dock that pops out that most people don't notice.

All the staff were nice and helpful. The location is right next to Greektown and UIC so it was optimally situated for my purposes. I'd stay there again for sure. Even room service was extra special. P.S. they have a free late checkout which was awesome.",N
4180,"stayed here during my first trip to Chicago, based on friend's recommendation. when you first see this place from the outside, it looks impressive! the largest hotel in Chi, it makes you feel as you were in the airport, when come in. i was told that Chi hotels were known for its luxury, so my bar might have been set a little too hight. our room felt kind of old and dark. but it had a large tv, iHome, and the beds were pretty comfortable. the bathroom was nice :) the food inside the hotel is pricey. but that is expected. the staff were friendly. they agreed to hold our suitcases after we checked out and wanted to see the cite before our flight. one of the valet guys there recommended us a great restaurant  not to far away (Emerald  Loop) and even gave us a coupon for a free appetizer. we got a good deal on the room, so can't really complain. however I will try a different hotel next time.",N
3804,"Pretty Please...More..more..more!!! I decided to take my cousin and a friend from out of state for a little R&R as a bridal gift...A massage was my mission. The prices are unbelievable! A 50 minute massage for $90.00 in a ""Spa"" like atmosphere. This wasn't a place with a room and you're in and out. We felt like queens for a few hours. We had comfy slippers, fluffy robes, a great steam before and after the massage. The most relaxing ""Relaxation Room"" with calming music and water. Even shampoo and blow-dyers to get all pretty afterwards. The best part: we bought online gift certificates for $100.00 and got $25.00 Free! So actually 3 massages was only $78.00 each. Even Better!!! You can get the certificates on their web site. Now, details of the most amazing massage. First off, the Bed was heated. Nothing better than that in my opinion. My therapist was amazing. She hit all the right spots, massaged my hand and head too. After each body part was massaged, she would lay hot towels on my skin!! I was in HEAVEN. I've been to the the four seasons and top end spas, but had a hefty price tag and paid $150.00 per massage..Now, I have the secret. Great Deal, Great Spa and Relaxed all for $90 plus tip!",N
231,"My wife and I live in Chicago and we were looking for a 'get-away' in the city for a night for her birthday.  After playing roulette with Hotwire and receiving Hotel Indigo as the inexpensive boutique hotel in the Gold Coast area, I have to be honest and say that I was little disappointed based on the photos.  It seemed like it was a little out-dated/tacky for our taste, but we made it do. When we arrived at the hotel, everyone was extremely friendly and they even went above and beyond by adding a little romantic touch to our room when we arrived late at night.   If you're looking for a good/clean inexpensive place to stay and you can look past some of the 'disney-esque' decor, then I would definitely recommend this place for you...Just don't use the parking garage next door- it's valet only, overpriced and they only have two men working on weekend so we waited over half an hour for our car.",N
1489,"My boyfriend and I stayed here last summer, before I moved to Chicago.  We were attending a wedding and this was where the wedding party was staying and close to the reception. Our suite was amazing! Two flat screen TVs, giant bathroom and a really cozy bed.  It was very difficult to get myself out of that bed and onto an early flight at O'hare the next day. Because of the wedding we did not get to spend as much time as I would have liked enjoying the expensive and beautiful room. I did enjoy the little time I did spend in the room though!",N
5408,"I recently had the worst consumer experience I've had in years with this hotel. Although the hotel looks beautiful, I would avoid staying here, no matter what, because what happened to us was not an aberration, but a result of hotel policy. They called us just after midnight, when we were about 10 minutes from arriving and told us the hotel was oversold and that our room was not available. Their solution was for us to come in and get our ""walk slip"" and then take it to another hotel in the suburbs near the airport. We were to pay full price and the other hotel was not a suite, but a room with one bed. So $250 bucks for a room comparable to what we could have booked for 75 bucks. I told them that staying in a room on Michigan Ave, in a suite with a pool and spa on the 30th floor is a bit different from a roadside motel in the suburbs. The person calling told me, ""since the city is oversold, that is all we can offer."" I explained that we had booked weeks in advance, that we were following each other in 2 cars in a city we didn't know well after midnight and that we had already driven over 600 miles that day and we were quite tired, so trying to find another hotel and then having some of us sleep on the floor was a real inconvenience. I asked for a second room, or to be booked in a downtown hotel and they simply repeatedly said, ""Sir, I am only authorized to put you in this room."" We were moving from California to Virginia and we were very excited to stay at this hotel, because the suite allowed my college age son and his finace the pull out sofa in the living room, while our 5 year old could just sleep in the king with us. The location is great and we had lived there when oldest son was a toddler, so we were going to show them the area and to go to the Cubs game the following day at noon. So we were very bummed about not staying downtown.I began to feel very sorry for the employee who had called us because she let slip that she had done this several nights in a row and that she was very embarrassed about this hotel's policy about over booking. She clearly understood that we were not going to be able to find another downtown hotel at this late hour. When I went on the hotel website to make a complaint to the central office, I was surprised to see that the Hilton site has a tab for complaints about overbooking of their hotels, so this is clearly an ongoing problem for this chain and in particular this hotel. Fortunately, we usually stay at Marriott's and since we have ""gold status"" from business travel, they were able to find us a hotel in the suburbs with 2 rooms for 75 bucks per room. We finally got to our room at 2:20am.  I stay about 75 nights a year in hotels, which is not usually fun, but if you book in a nice hotel, the service is usually great and in the 21st century, you can certainly expect a room to be held for you when you arrive if you've made a reservation with a credit card, after all if you don't show for any reason, they will certainly charge you for the night. I was really amazed that these jerks would carry out this kind of policy on an ongoing basis. I hope others refuse to patronize them and if you do stay, CHECK IN EARLY.",Y

5051,"My family and I stayed at the Embassy Downtown for a mini-vaca and we were glad we chose this hotel. I contacted the concierge before arrival to let them know we would be arriving early and to verify that we could store our luggage before we checked in to the room. To my surprise, our room was available upon arrival because of my earlier inquiry. The hotel is located a short walk from the Michigan Ave and State Street shopping districts and is right next to a grocery store that provides any toiletries you may have forgotten. The staff greeted us throughout our stay and were quite helpful navigating the streets. The free breakfast helped us keep our costs down and had many options from muffins to made to order omelets. We swam in the pool a few times and although it is small, it is perfect for young kids and doing laps. The bed was really comfortable and the suite gave us room to spread out and enjoy ourselves. We'll definitely return to the Embassy in the future.",Y

1398,"I stayed here for a couple of nights during a business trip to Chicago.  Actually our work meetings were held on premises as well.  First, I have to say that I really loved the location.  Even though downtown/miracle mile Chicago isn't my end-all and be-all of city destinations, I still appreciated that I was close to Michigan ave...especially when I had a night off to relax and enjoy some time meeting up with my transplanted Detroit friend.   (And I loved the proximity to Jamba Juice...I'm a freak, I know! but we don't have it at home, so I savor it when I encounter one!)   As for the hotel, the staff were super nice.  The rooms were great, with beautiful, modern bathrooms (I loved the rainfall shower!) and big TVs.  The decor was clean and modern but the beds did leave something to be desired...maybe it was the pillows but I definitely remember not being super comfortable.   Our work meetings were mainly held in the Crystal Ballroom, which is a beautiful space.  I can imagine how pretty it would look for an special evening event.  However, since I was in there all day for up to eight hours, I did have plenty of time how there were numerous coats of paint and plenty of wear on the carpets.... Oh, the cold, cruel light of day!   When I return to Chicago, I probably will not have this place as my first choice, more like 2nd or 3rd choice if I will be staying close to the Miracle Mile area.",N
5024,"Normally I'm not a fan of places with über-trendy, über-clubby vibes, but I have a soft spot for the W Lakeshore. I've stayed here a few times in the past few years and each time I've been impressed. I've even been impressed when I wasn't a guest here. Everyone-- from the doormen to the front desk to the cleaning ladies to the fitness room attendants to the concierge-- have been always been accommodating and professional.  It was here where I first learned what concierges did. I used to walk by hotel concierges and wonder what the heck they did all day. At the W Lakeshore, they do everything! They make rental car reservations if you want to drive out to the 'burbs, mail letters even if you don't have a stamp, reserve tables at popular restaurants--the whole shebang! Once I wandered into the W when I wasn't staying there, all lost and wind-shocked, and the concierge looked up the restaurant I was trying to get to and gave me directions. Now that's service.  The rooms are a little on the small side, but the view of the lake more than makes up for it. At a lot of hotels with supposed lake views, you can only see the lake way, way off in the distance. At the W, however, you can take a shower, open the divider between the bathroom and bedroom, and all you see is water when you look out the window. Now that's priceless. As a much-appreciated security precaution, you have to insert your room card to use the elevators. The hotel exercise room has nice equipment, but I usually just run along the lakeshore path because it's right across the street. The complimentary Bliss products are a little too citrusy-smelling for my liking, but that's just a preference thing. I can't comment on the restaurant or bars because I've never tried them, but the bar/lounge/restaurant area on the first floor is full of people in stylish clothes at night so I'm assuming it'd be a good place to pick up people if that's your thing. Tip: If you're part of the Starwood Preferred Guest program, you get early check-in and late check-out (4PM!!!!), even if you didn't book the room through the Starwood website. Also, most hotel programs don't give you reward points if book through an outside party, but I've gotten about 50-60 SPG points per stay in the past (which, admittedly, is basically nothing but still appreciated).",Y

Can't beat the location - easy walk to catch a movie, do a little bowling, grab a bite to eat. The downside? The afternoon complimentary cocktail hour is always just a long line of waiting. Breakfast is always great - though the gal getting the omelets ready to cook needs to lighten up a bit. overall great value!

3470,"Just got back from an almost week stay at the Allerton, and although I knew what we were getting into after reading all the reviews, I wasn't prepared for it!   Lots to say, both good and bad! The room was beyond small...my daughter and I could barely squeeze by one another in the bathroom and it was laid out very odd, didn't allow for much movement at all. The beds however, were divine!  Sank into down pillows every night that were just heavenly...perfect when you've been running all over Chicagoland all day and night! Great location, right down the street from Water Tower, although the ER at Northwestern and the sirens got a bit old after a while. Elevators were definitely a challenge, but my daughter and I in good fun enjoyed chatting up people and trying to figure out which one went where.  The elevators, like the rooms, were totally small and cramped, made for some interesting drunken conversations! Avoid the restaurant!  We had their $19 brunch and pretty much every item was stone cold The Bell Staff, in a word, astounding...hilarious...helpful...sarcastic...­since we were there for so long, we got to know many of them and we'd head out into the night hearing them warn us about no calls from the police to come pick us up or for us to behave.  Always friendly, got cabs for us immediately, great suggestions for places to hang out...they made the stay fun...even if they couldn't believe we walked all over downtown, from Navy Pier to Huron 'on purpose'. All in all, a nice stay, but I will stay some place different next time I think.  For the money, I am not sure its worth the cons...its almost a tie with the pros.",N

4441,"The Palmer House Hilton is an incredibly gorgeous hotel in the Loop. Its architecture is classy, refined, and very old-school Chicago. (As a history major, I like old-fashioned things. Thus, the Palmer House Hilton gets an A in my book.) I was there recently for a sorority formal. The event space (Empire Room) did not seem to be outdated/falling apart at all, and the room was very charming. The lighting was soft and the gold/black ornamentation was beautiful. If you have severe allergies, I'm not sure this is a place that will listen 100%, and this is an important caveat. One of my good friends is severely allergic to dairy. She called weeks in advance and was assured that there were no problems with her request. But what happened? She had a severe allergic reaction and had to be carried out by paramedics, spending time in the hospital. The hotel could've done a better job not only apologizing, but also honoring her request. Another small error was made in that a few random people wandered into the Empire Room. This isn't a huge deal, but from a security standpoint, it should be treated as one. A Keith Urban lookalike, who was obviously not a guest at a sorority formal (I can understand older dates, but he looked at least 35...), entered the room when I was outside with my friend. He walked in a bit more, and then finally left. The manager said ""Oh, I would've escorted him out anyway"" or something, but I think they could've been a bit more proactive. There are serious concerns for allergies and security, but overall, the Palmer House space is lovely. They should work out a few kinks, though!",N

5501,"Here is a genuine find for a semi-tight-fisted tourist like me... I've never stayed in the Lakeview neighborhood area before, and I liked it. There are lots of fun places to eat and shop but still close enough to the Red Line for all the other Chicago attractions. This Best Western hotel was a terrific find for me since I was less than enthralled with their more generic and congested River North hotel closer to the Loop. That was full of college kids with hefty backpacks on weekend benders. This one attracts more of the middle-aged set who roll their suitcases from the cab. Oh wait, that would be me. It's a Georgian-style boutique hotel with a very friendly staff. I paid $150 per night for a nice-sized room with a king. It was very well maintained, and the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign actually seems to work in the morning. I never went in for their continental breakfast because hell, I was just across the street from Ann Sather. Besides, those early-rising Europeans beat me to it anyway. It takes about twenty minutes to walk to the Belmont station, which is on the main artery of the CTA since the Red Line goes up and down almost the full length of the visitable city. I'd definitely come back here in the summer months when the stroll is a bit more bearable.",N

3952,"There was a time when I would have given the Congress Plaza an affectionate two-star review, but those days are long gone. My last stay was one of the most horrible hotel stays I've ever had, and I've stayed in the Ramada Inn in Inglewood, CA! The problem with Congress Plaza is, they have two seperate wings. The original wing is mostly okay. The rooms are really old, but most are roomy and the dilapidated nature is part of the charm. The ""Buckingham Wing"", which was apparently a value hotel next door bought out by the Congress some years ago, and never renovated, is a f-cking NIGHTMARE, however, and you have no say about which wing/room you stay in. In my four stays at Congress, one was in a decent room, the other three were hellish. One of the rooms I stayed in had a broken air conditioner (this was in the dead of summer, mind you) with STANDING WATER inside where the temp control knob was! I also saw tiny worms crawling on the bathroom floor of that room. Another room had a hole burned into the carpet in the shape of an iron and what looked to be arterial spray from a murder across the box spring. There are also regularly yellowish cum stains on the white bedding. Honestly, I'm surprised that I haven't contracted something or come down with a case of crabs after sleeping in their disgusting beds. Staff is rude, you have to cross a picket line to get in the door (the strike has been going on for almost five years, now, too--with no end in sight), the in-house restaurant is a TOTAL joke (they misspelled ""toasted bagel"" on their menu--it read ""tasted bagel"" instead...maybe it wasn't a misspelling...I wouldn't put pre-tasting the food past their crack kitchen staff) and they also offer an option to pay extra for a ""room with a view"". DON'T DO IT! The time I did that was when they stuck me in a reeking, disgusting room in the Buckingham Wing that had duct tape on the walls, a door that adjoined to someone elses' room through which you could hear talking and other noises, and burn marks on the carpeting. Nice location, but they need to sell this place to someone who cares and renovate the ENTIRE hotel. I've stayed in Super 8's that were much nicer. Adding insult to injury--IT'S TOTALLY EXPENSIVE! You can get better hotels for the same price. Just avoid, avoid, avoid.",N
4039,"Stayed at the Hyatt Regency as a result of Hotwire roulette. Not knowing what to expect, we rolled in around 8:00 AM the day of our checkin, not expecting to be able to check in yet. The front desk clerk was very friendly and offered us a Queen room available then, or we could wait for a King room and they would call us when our room was ready. We decided to wait for a King and went downstairs for breakfast. Also, I have medication that needs to be refrigerated and they were able to keep it behind the front desk (I assume in a staff fridge) with no issues. Yay! This allowed us to be a little more free in our plans. Bonus, our room ready right as we were finishing breakfast! We also signed up for the ""Gold Passport"" which gave us free internet access and a late checkout (Tiphani at the front desk was extremely helpful and friendly in letting us know about these perks!). Even when a snafu with the rental car company was going to make us even later than the already late checkout, they accommodated us with no hassle. The beds were heavenly, the complimentary toiletries were awesome (and that's saying something! They smelled fantastic!), and our view was exceptional (clear view of the fireworks from the Navy Pier, Room 1523).

I enjoyed his slightly antagonistic approach to the suits venturing forth for a glass o' merlot n' some fried pickles (very authentic, according to David)-- an actual quote we enjoyed ""Naw, we GOT Memphis here in Chicago!!!"" in response to some fool trying to say that Chicago was NOT the best midwestern city.   pps: we saw David making something that looked like a Frappuccino with a kick.  Vanilla ice cream plus some other fun stuff-- you might want to get this...",N
4558,"When we got engaged, we planned our wedding almost exactly a year out.  Being a perfectionist and very organized, I started searching through bridal magazines and websites to plan our wedding.  I saw the Palmer House on the first day of looking at venues and knew that was where we would have our wedding.  Looking into the Grand & State Ballrooms just took my breath away.  We got married on Saturday, June 5th, 2010 at the Palmer House Hilton Chicago. We signed our contract with Mark Coy, a sales & catering coordinator at the Palmer House.  While he was pleasant in our meetings and would explain what we would need to do, I never really felt confident in his ability to make our day special.  I always needed to initiate questions to get answers and every meeting felt rushed because he had to be out the door by 6pm.  He always said ""no problem"" to everything but then there was a huge problem that finally had me in a  bridezilla moment.  In our initial room block we asked Mark to substitute two regular rooms for two suites.  Well, he put five suites on our block.  I had numerous phone calls from my guests that our block was full.  I didn't know until after the fact that each suite was taking 2 regular rooms out of our block.  In our meetings we always discussed increasing the number of rooms on our block as well.  Of course, he said ""no problem"" based on availability.  Well, a good coordinator would have told his client that the weekend of their wedding was also the largest convention in the city of Chicago.  So when we needed the additional rooms we heard ""sorry we're booked"".  Never once did he put the fear in our mind that we wouldn't have rooms for our guests.  At that moment I definitely knew that I could not work with someone who obviously could care less about our wedding.  We also had issues with charging of rooms as well.  I think that the rooms manager/department definitely needs some work in this location.  Our parents were charged the suite rate of $329, when they were supposed to be charged $289.  My mother-in-law was paying for her sister's room, but then they charged her sister's credit card.  Being an upscale hotel these issues shouldn't happen. I immediately asked for Jane Himmel to replace our coordinator as I heard she was the best coordinator there.  She is AMAZING and was our wedding angel.  We had set up a meeting for the next week as this was a Friday.  We were actually meeting with our florist on that evening at 6:30pm and she came to this meeting to meet us & go over a few details.  I was astonished that she would meet us on a Friday evening and she stayed until the end which concluded at 9:30pm.  She had to pretty much start from scratch and had two months to put it together.  The next day (Saturday) she emailed us a rough draft of our timeline & had forwarded some spreadsheets to fill out for her which included our parents info & our other vendors.  (The only thing Mark ever emailed me was a sample timeline of an early evening wedding and I am assuming I was to put it together)  She made us feel like she was going to make our wedding special and not just another cookie cutter wedding that our other coordinator was going to put together.  She could tell I was feeling stressed from everything going on and she suggested Claudia Antony, a day of coordinator.  Now, I was feeling great and actually enjoying the final months of wedding planning.         Jane got us back on track with our reception and did more in two weeks than our first coordinator did in almost 10 months.  We are so appreciative for the amount of time and effort on her part to make all of the details of our wedding reception seamlessly play through the night.  She was patient, organized, professional and easily accessible.  She stayed through the majority of our wedding and was relentless in her effort to make us happy.  We couldn't think of favors and she provided us an idea for what we should do.  She guided us through our meal choices, wine choices (as we were not happy with the others offered to us) and came up with a cake option that was magnificent.  She surprised us at our reception with keys to the penthouse for our two day stay, our wedding night & the night after.  She ""WOWED"" us time after time.  Her job didn't end there as the next day we set up a brunch for 60 people.  She had everything set up beautifully in the Honore Ballroom for the conclusion of our wedding weekend.  Let's just say Jane went above & beyond in all matters pertaining to our wedding.  I am sure there are so many more details that Jane attended to that I couldn't even begin to think about.  I couldn't imagine a more beautiful start to our new life together! Thank you Jane!",N
5034,"with a reputation that raised the bar, the W hotel were popping up all over the country with sophisticated, modern hotels and i so wanted to stay at one! well, i finally stayed at these hotels once on a business trip in san francisco, and another time on vacation in south beach. both times i was impressed with their unstuffy professionalism and contemporary decor. when it was time to choose a location for our wedding, we knew right where to go. i told our wedding planner to get to work. for our wedding ceremony and reception, the pricing was average for downtown chicago and the reception package was pretty inclusive. guests couldn't stop talking about how nice our wedding was, and the views from the altitude room were as good as all the little details the W put together. the drapery complimented our chuppah perfectly and it was a great space for dancing. fun signature martinis too. funny little fact about this hotel: i found out it used to be a days inn. complete transformation overhaul! some of our guests stayed in the room block and said it was a nice touch to their weekend in chicago. if you are getting ready for your own wedding at the hotel, a suite is a MUST!",Y
1617,Very attentive and polite service. Room is a good size. Free business center (nice for printing out boarding passes). Overall a quite pleasant stay.,N
5180,"Beautiful interior decorating,  located downtown only a few blocks away from millennium park and TONS of shopping and eating. walking distance to an all-stops train stop, so it's super convenient if you need to get somewhere else in the city. the staff was fairly friendly and helpful and there is a nice bar/restaurant downstairs.fair warning (as with most semi-expensive hotels), nothing is free. Valets are waiting for you as soon as you pull up to the hotel, but the parking is about 50 dollars a day.overall it's a nice hotel, but the last 2 days of our trip my friends and i stayed at a travelodge which was actually closer to the park, to the train stops, about twice as large and much much much cheaper.",Y
2828,"Hello.  I'm only writing this review for the pool and the lobby, since that's the only part of the hotel I really visited. This was due to the fact that my own pool at the Hilton Garden Inn (just around the corner) had a broken pool and they let us use the one at the Embassy Suites. Now, the lobby of this place is cool.  It's one of those open atrium hotels where all of the rooms look out on the central atrium, so it's really nice and open. However, just an FYI, the pool sucks. Sorry, Embassy Suites.  It smells like a stinking cesspool of chemicals in the pool room.  The water in the pool has detritus floating around in it.  The hot tub is so dirty that it is foaming out of control and the water is yellow-ish.  The floor was soaking wet and kind of dirty, so you felt nervous about putting your bare feet on it.  All in all, I was so grossed out by the pool and the hot tub, the the most exposure I would give myself to it was putting my feet into the hot tub and watching the foam stick to my calves and imaging microorganisms burrowing into my skin. So, don't come here for the pool.   Otherwise, rely on everyone else's comments regarding the rooms. That is all I have to say.",N
1923,"This was my first stay at a W Hotel, and I will definitely stay at one again.  The rooms are fun, fresh and modern, the staff is extremely customer focused and friendly, and they have great lotions/soaps/shampoos etc.  I'm only giving it four stars because this particular W hotel was a bit lacking in some ways.  You could tell they had built into an ancient building and hadn't updated the HVAC system the ac/heat centers in the room were ancient and kind of ugly, the bathroom had this enormous counter and only one tiny sink I would have preferred two or even a larger one, they didn't offer as many amenities here as they do at the LakeSide W which is kind of dissapointing, and lastly I asked for all the down products to be removed from the room since my boyfriend is allergic and the second night there we found out (after lots of watery eyes and sneezing) that the foot pillow they had left in the room was down if you are supposed to be a top calls hotel you have to pay attention tot he details.   however, I will leave you with the positives I saw: Cookies and Fresh OJ in the afternoons in the lobby Lovely bedding/towels, etc I loved the bathroom (besides the sink) They have free water in the gym that you can just go grab at anytime I will definitely stay at a W again if I have the chance/good deal to do so- but if I was going back to Chicago I may look into other hotels, as the downtown area isn't really happening at night and it might be fun to be in a hotel near some night life.",N
5548,"USE PROMO CODE ATT! It will save you around $30/night here. The first time I came to Chicago before I ended up relocating, I stayed here. My boyfriend worked across the street in a high rise as security and he suggested I stay here, so I did. I paid $159 after using my ATT corporate code which saved me about $30 a night. The stay was great. They don't just let anyone roll up in here and go to your room. They have to check with the front desk which will call your room and ask if it's okay for whoever it is to come up. They offer free breakfast from 6am-9am on the weekdays and 7-9 or 10 on the weekends. They serve juice, waffles, oatmeal, fruit, yogurt, bagels, toast, cereal, sausage, bacon, muffins, and eggs (just and FYI - On the weekends they don't have bacon or eggs). The front desk let me pay for my stay in cash. They also offer conference rooms, vending machines, a swimming pool, internet access with a printer, and an exercise room. I stayed an additional two times after the first visit and my ATT code always worked. The staff was always friendly and they always accomodated me in any way they could or I needed. I would suggest this place to anyone. A great location for the price. **EDIT** There is also a mini fridge, a flat screen tv in the room with cable channels, and a microwave. They do offer room service as well from a local restaurant and the food is great from there as well.",N
5750,"So I ended up here after my apartment flooded this summer (anyone else remember that wonderful random downpour??)  Anywho, back to the story... so I walked in to the front desk (after much pleading with the valet guy to let me just leave my car in a parking space just so I could inquire about a room, but Ill talk about that later)... so the ppl at the front desk were pretty understanding of my situation and willing to negotiate - a bit... so long as I was checked out by friday morning so that they could charge the next guest full weekend price (but, hey, I cant hate - it is a business after all) sooooooo, I decided to drive my car back to my apartment and take the el back in, cuz it was 30-something dollars a day to park my car... and they wont even let you park there for 5 minutes to unload your suitcases without a fight!! URG ppl, should i leave my car in the street or what!!?? Needless to say, they dont go out of there way to help you with bags either (I guess it saves me on tipping, but still... a lil help would have been nice!!) The rooms themselves are VERY nice... my king bed was HUUUUUUUGE with plenty of pillows and the entire room was VERY clean... my only complaint about the room - no microwave or fridge.  Which 99% of the time i dont need, but in this case, where I was stuck there for the better part of the week, it would have been nice to keep some juice and yogurt in a fridge rather than running to starbucks or walgreens every time i wanted a quick snack. Now, on to location.... this place is perfect (save for the fact that is RIGHT next to the highway - but you wont hear traffic noise with the balcony doors closed anyway... Oh, did i mention yet that this place is smack-dab in the middle of greektown!?!?! YUUUUUUUUM!! Overall, the place was nice, but a bit pricey, and a fridge/microwave would have been nice :)",N
1124,"I really like the decor of this place.  The rooms are comfortable and a decent size compared to other hotels at this price I've stayed at in Chicago.  The view from my room was of Millennium Park, which looked really great at night.  There were a few problems.  We had paid extra for a package that included a late check out time of 5PM, when we got back at 4PM to get ready to leave we had been locked out of the room, and had to wait quite a while for them to get it fixed.  Also, the rain shower shower head thing, looks good, but not really functional.  I like water pressure.  Other than those complaints, it was an overall good experience and we would come back again.",N
3437,"Pros: - Great location in the center of Michigan Ave - Decent rates ($150-$200/night) - Friendly staff Best of all, they have this special 'sleep system' in your room where you are equipped with a sleep CD, eye mask, ear plugs, and lavander linen spray to ensure the best sleep possible! Cons: - No grandeous entrance into the hotel. Door is on Huron, not Mich Ave. - Crazy elevator system. You have to first go to the 3rd floor, which is the real entrance/lobby. Then you have to transfer to another elevator to get up to your room. - Restaurant Taps on Two is sub-par. Do not trust their ""Express Lunch""! It takes at least an hour!",N
3708,"This review is on their New Years Eve party, put on by Scene Chicago. Had a great time with the group we went with. Plenty of food at the buffet tables, along with people coming around with trays. The drinks were excellent and strong, with not so bad lines. Maybe about a 5 min wait. Tops. They had 4 rooms with a range of music from hip hop to 80s. 2 of the rooms being large, 2 being not much more than a lounge type of area. My biggest complaint was the bathrooms. The lines were horrendous! About 20-25 min wait, only to find out there was no toilet paper. Really? I send almost two hundred a ticket (not including the dinner) and you can't supply me with some soft TP for my bum? What made me mad, was that I was standing in line from 1230am to 1255am and when I went up to the bar, they had already stopped serving booze. (Even though it was supposed to go until 1am). The crowd was a twenty something and was a great time. Until around 1am. Two girls puking in the bathroom (hold your liquor ladies!) and one guy laying on the floor with a black eye (as the cops were trying to pull him up and take him out). Oh! And they also came around about 1145pm with TONS of NYE flair. Hats, noise makers, streamers, etc. Even though people were going nuts with it all, there was plenty to go around. I must say that they have great staff there. All in all: Fun, but not worth the $$.",N
5791,Disclaimer -- I never personally stayed there but my in-laws stayed there twice.-- With that out of the way I have visited the room and the pool. Not really excited about either.  Their room overlooked the pool on the first floor. First the room- It for real looked like Motel 6! I am not kidding. Like when you are on a  road trip and you just need a place to sleep where you don't have to worry about getting hit by a semi truck. Yeah one of those places. It did have the standard cable and the really fake I am a quilt but light enough to be a sheet thing going on. Of course in red! Second the pool-- One word Dirty! Leaves all over the place.  And the tiles were turning black from grime and dirt. But hey it was cheap and about 2 minutes from our apt. It was also close to the Jackson Park Express # 6. And the saving grace of this place is it had parking!!,N
2959,"sheraton chicago is a bit generic, but what can you expect from a hotel with 1000 rooms? staff seems very polished and its obvious this is one of sheraton's better properties. the lobby has a modern decor, but falls flat as anything more than a area to pass through. still, it seemed very active-- couldn't imagine how crowded it would be if the hotel was ever really busy. location is meh. it's across the street from an amc + lucky strike which is good/bad depending on how you look at things. it IS a good location for public transit connections, however, is a couple block's walk to any of the subway/l trains. rooms are fine. they're not anything special, but i probably wouldn't pay top dollar for them. the rooms do have nice views of the chicago river. all in all a nice hotel in an almost sleepy corner of downtown chicago. i would say this hotel fits the bill if you're looking for something big, clean, and comfortable with good access to michigan ave and the river north areas.",N
1912,"This W staff here is 100x more approachable and friendlier than the W on Lakeshore.  The lounge/lobby is beautiful and inviting.  Concierge very helpful and accessible.  Even though the rooms were small, the bed and shower were very comfortable and made our hotel stay very enjoyable.  The fitness center is very well maintained, they provide water, towels, cold wet towels, apples, headphones, aerobic  machines with tvs on them, free weights, mats to stretch.  I would highly recommend checking it out.  The individual rooms did not have their own coffee pots, but they provide complimentary coffee til 10am every morning in the lobby. Yes the walls are very thin but I've noticed this in most hotels (i.e. The James, and the W on Lakeshore).  I would recommend rooms far from the elevators.  I would have preferred to stay at a more prime location, but its very close to the mag mile and millenium park.",N
3058,"I've stayed at aLoft hotels in the past, and always wanted a chance to stay at the chain on which the aLoft concept is based. Lots of glitz and glamor, lots of hip and trendy-looking architecture and amenities (showers without doors, flat-screen TV's, etc.); but overall the service was no better than comparable hotel chains. The best feature of this hotel is its location. The views of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier are spectacular. W Hotels seem to attract a certain clientele. Young, ""hip,"" narcissistic, club-hopping Gen Y alcoholics. To be fair, it may have been this location, but I felt like I was at a meat market. Plus, I was awakened at 3:00am one night by a large and loud group of people looking to ""continue the party"" in someone's room next door to me. So if you just need a place to stay during business meetings, this W isn't worth all the pretentiousness. Any of the Kimpton hotels in the area offer much better value (and much better personal service) for the price. But if hip and trendy is important, if you want to see and be seen, W could be for you. But I won't be back... at least voluntarily.",N
4476,"What a beautiful hotel.  Girls night out, and we chose this hotel for many reasons but convience is main one.  While checking in, we got ice cream!  Our rooms were spacious and roomy.  Bathroom a bit small, but what did you want for an old hotel.  On the executive floor on 23, lots of tables to mill about, we liked that we could spread out.  We brougth caviar and spread with our own wines and enjoyed pre dinner festivities.  I guess we didnt need get all that we did because the appetizers would have been fine iwth our caviar!!!",N
5803,"I once found a key on the sidewalk near here, and thinking that it might belong to the Milshire, took it inside to turn it in. The lobby reeked of cigarette smoke (and this was after the indoor smoking ban took effect) and the guy behind the counter could barely understand what I was talking about. Not that there was a language barrier; there was more of a cognition barrier. Genuinely frightening. For the voyeuristic among you, try a Flickr search for ""milshire hotel chicago"" and you'll find a series of shots taken in one of the rooms. I think they were going for the so-called ""heroin chic"" look, and yeah, they nailed it. If you wanted to live the down-and-out drug-addled dream, this would be the place to do it.",N

686,"Stayed here for a work trip recently. Pros: Friendly employees, great location (one block off of Michigan St.), clean, simple and spacious rooms. Also free WiFi and ethernet cable internet access in the room. One other bonus nice gym and an indoor pool. Cons: I thought it was a little pricey $189 for the quality of the room, but it might have been high because it was a large convention. And their currently under remodel, so weekdays from 9:30 AM on, it's a little noisy. Hopefully you're out and about by then. Overall: If you want a Marriott Hotel close to the Magnificent Mile this place is great.",N
5540,"Nice! Clean! Friendly!  Rooms are modernly decorated. Wood flooring in entryway and bath (yay).  Great full mirrors directly across from glassed in shower. (so THATS what I look like with shampoo in my hair!) Krups individual cup coffee makers, free WiFi, great continental breakfast offerings with sunshiny attendants. This is only 4 stars because the shwanky  coffee maker didn't function and even after they said it was fixed, it didn't work. Sorry, but you can't mess with a Dolls coffee at 530am.  Even so, i would not hesitate to stay here again.",N

252,"My husband surprised me with a stay at Hotel Indigo for the weekend. First, I have to say that this is a good hotel for a weekend getaway but I would not reccomend it for a long extended stay, since there is no closet space. I loved the lobby, it had a modern pallete and is scented based on the season. The scent was pineapple for the summer and it was just so refreshing. The front desk staff always remembered us and always said hello to us, which is a nice change from large chain hotels. The room itself is cozy, but I loved the king size bed and the great comforter that was on it. Also Aveda bath products were a plus. The few cons I have are the shower curtain never seemed to keep the water out. They really should just put a shower door. The air conditioner was either really cold or not cold enough and it was a bit noisy. The ice machine is on the 2nd floor and when I went, it was out of ice. I called and they brought me a HUGE bag of ice (way more than any one person could consume, so I had to put it in my sink), but they were quick in bringing it. Last, we said we were staying for our anniversary and they really didn't do anything for us. I don't expect anything, but always give props to hotels that go the one up. Also, since it is a boutique hotel, I would have thought that they would have done something special for us. I would definitely go back for a weekend getaway.",N
3445,"The Allerton had a great staff and everything that you would want in a Hotel.  The location was also handy and the bar and restaurant on the second floor were pretty swanky.   I had read that the rooms were old and small.  It is an old hotel - but recently refurbished.  So all the furnishings and paint are bright and shiny, but yeah, they are small old-school rooms and bathrooms.   Because I suspected this was the case after reading reviews - we stayed in a Jr. Suite.  Still not a huge room - but it really gave us all the space we needed.  The bed was great, room service was prompt.  Front desk and bellmen were helpful.   One Note:  For those of you coming to Chicago and don't realize it - parking is expensive.  We paid $48 a night to park at the Allerton.  The cheapest overnight parking in the area was $36 and a couple blocks away.",N
5677,"A HIDDEN GEM! We stayed here over the summer and it was the best hotel experience I've had in a long time....maybe ever! Blows away the Drake which was the last Chicago hotel I visited.  Largest basic king rooms in the city.  Modern, upscale feel, yet also warm and inviting. Hotel staff went above and beyond to make you feel welcome.  They all truly cared about the business and their guests. The location is also amazing. It's right in the heart of the city - shopping, Oak Street beach, restaurants, bars, spas...but just off the Michigan Ave so you have some peace and quiet for relaxation.  A must try if you're looking for an escape to the city or are visiting from out of town. You won't be disappointed!",N
5364,"I just read the review below and I couldn't disagree more. It's really a shame that this woman had such a horrible experience because my husband and I had a WONDERFUL time. I usually don't spend my time writing reviews but I had to get on my soapbox with this one...This hotel is a dream! I can't even comprehend how much detail and effort went into renovating this place. The neighborhood has some of Chicago's oldest and marvelous mansions and if you are a fan of architecture, the Glessner House is right around the corner. We stayed because my husband was attending a convention at McCormick center, but this hotel goes beyond convenience. The service was  A+ and then some. The nice lady at the front desk went above and beyond suggesting some great activities and even a golf course in the suburbs for my husband and his business partner. The city's subway is about a 20 minute walk, but it was a great opportunity to marvel at some of the neighborhood's historic buildings. Chinatown is very close too and we had a great experience at Tony Hu's Lao Sze Chuan. Also a recommendation by the lady at the hotel. (I'm so sorry I can't remember her name! Sorry!) The room we stayed in on the third floor was a-mazing. Sophisticated and very clean, amazing artwork and decor and a super modern, state of the art bathroom.  Well worth it! We will definitely be back next year!!",Y
735,"This hotel has a great location but the rooms have a subpar ambiance.  Clean (despite the mold in the shower), worn out furniture, terrible view, but conveniently located. Good if you don't spend a lot of time in your room and you get a deal on Hotwire. Also very close walking distance to Oak Street Beach. We were allowed to check in early (9:00 am) on a Friday, so that's a definite plus. Call the night before to see if that's possible. 3 stars because of its location and price, despite its flaws.",N

5628,I stayed here while on a business trip and I can say it's exceeded my expectations as always. Starwood always does.   Thumbs Up: 1) Staff is courteous. 2) Rooms are clean and large : heavenly bed = orgasm. 3) Gym was clean and well equipped. 4) Great location. Thumbs Down: 1) Parking here is terribly expensive. 2) Pedro at the restaurant was temperamental at first but warmed up to me. 3) They ran out of Arugula and took some time to explain how I wanted the same salad but with spring greens.,N
4168,"Huge huge hotel. I love the hyatt beds... so soft and comfy!  Coming from a smaller city, I forget how much walking around you have to do in a big city.  Vegas hotels are worst! So much walking just to get to your room. Anyways, the check in process was smooth and easy.  Great service.  Valet was expensive but that was expected so no surprise there. The day we left there was protesting done outside the hotel area so we had to go get our car from the valet garage... not really valet service.  On nicer days, it's  a good walk to the shops on Michigan Ave.  In the cold winter days, I would recommend bundling up or getting a taxi.  Overall, good hotel and location.  We always get a deal on priceline!",N
4886,"I would not recommed this hotel.  The staff was very rude.  A hotel security in a suit stopped me from taking photos inside the hotel.  He was extremely aggressive with me, got really close to me, and seemed to have issues other than keeping the hotel safe.  He and other staff left me with a bad taste in my mouth.   They didn't seem to appreciate my business. There are so many awesome hotels in the area, so I will stay at another hotel next time.",Y

I recommend the jamesn Hotel,  dining as a perfect destination for either an in-town getaway or overnight business stay.  I travel frequently, and stay in a lot of nice hotels, but the experience we had here is near or at the top of our ""Best of"" list.My wife and I recently celebrated our anniversary with a little in-town getaway, which doubled as a babymoon.  The hotel is simply beautiful -- elegant yet open and comfortable.  The staff are incredibly nice, and the policy of not accepting gratuity was surprising and graceful.  They are there to help you, simple as that.  The rooms are comfortable and spacious, quiet and well appointed.  A terrific experience, which I highly recommend.",Y
2077,This place is at the tail end of a two year renovation and is now swanky and nice. The location is impossibly good... I disagree with a review that states you are deserted here. You can walk 5-10 blocks to anything you could possibly want to eat. You are a 10-15 ride to Wrigley. Location is super!  The service is a slight step up for an HI as well. And the cityscape views are in every room on every floor.,N

4516,"I've stayed at this hotel in two occasions. The rooms are just ok, not bad. For some reason I never get a nice view here. The lobby is what is really gorgeous, I've seen people take their wedding pictures at the lobby. Very pretty. But since you're not sleeping in the lobby, I'm giving it 3 stars. What I don't like about the Palmer House is that so many people stay here that it gets really hectic, so it doesn't feel very cosy or relaxed for a hotel. The lower level of the hotel that leads to the streets, makes me feel like I'm at a mall, with the Starbucks and the crowd in the halls... Location it's awesome though, oh and the restaurant by the lobby is pretty good too. I stay here only when I find a great deal.",N
3828,"My wife and I stayed for a couple of nights while in town for some meetings in the Near Northside area. I can agree with much of what's been said by other reviewers both good and bad: comfy beds, great location, very friendly staff, cool modern rooms, etc.; lack of windows in rooms with basically useless ""balconies"", issues with room temperature, frustrations with the keys and the various elevators, etc. That said, the biggest reason I have to mark this place down is, again as others have mentioned, the paper thin doors and walls. We stayed on a Friday and Saturday night when people were out enjoying themselves and coming back fairly late. No big deal. But even at normal talking volumes, not yelling, it sounded like anyone in the hall was actually in our room. It was impossible to sleep. Even the sirens outside sounded much louder than seemed normal. I actually tried shoving pillows at the bottom of the door to dampen the sound. It helped a little, but didn't really help us sleep (since it was still pretty loud and we were now short a couple pillows). It's a fun and interesting place at first, but clearly function (the function of sleeping, which is primarily what a hotel is for in my opinion) lags far behind form in this place. I would not stay here again.",N
2934,"It's tough to distinguish between the many 3 1/2 - 4 star hotels in Chicago, but I really enjoyed the Sheraton and think it compares favorably with all the others in its class.   The lobby and room decor is contemporary and very inviting.  The valet and front desk staff were appropriately friendly and attentive.  The bedding was exceptionally comfortably although it was the softest mattress I've experienced in a long time.  It's really too soft if you need a firmer mattress.  The biggest advantage is the location.  Our view from the 30th floor on the river side was outstanding.  We could see up and down the river and could see the lake and much of the loop.  While the hotel is several blocks off of Michigan Avenue, it's an easy walk to all of the Mag Mile, Millenium Park, Navy Pier and State Street. I've noticed that the Sheraton's room rates are normally at the higher end of comparable properties, but we got a great rate with parking included.  This made it an especially good experience.  Unfortunately, they got our bill wrong, but a visit to the front desk got it easily corrected.  Overall, I'd say the Sheraton is worth a visit, and if you can get it for a deal, it's definitely a worthwhile place to stay.",N
4421,"I'm staying at the Palmer House because I have to. And I wish I didn't have to. This hotel is fine, corporate America fine. But it is a big barn with Fraternity and Sorority conferences, business meetings, and all sorts of madness. The rooms are inconsistent, some being really, really cozy for two adults. Even tiny adults like me and my beloved. I highly recommend the upgrade to the ""executive floor"" where the rooms are huge and you are afforded the luxury of express elevators, free breakfast and round the clock snacks and drinks. What really irks me about this place (aside from the scripted corporate speak of the employees [that irks me everywhere]) is all the ridiculous surcharges. $25 to check in early. $20 per day for internet. $18 to use the pool. $20 to use the gym. Really? So what exactly are the amenities of the hotel? Clearly, this place has a lot of rooms to fill in order to pay the wintertime heating bill. It makes me feel like I'm being swindled, and I'm not even paying for my room! For a little more money, there are better options, and better locations in Chi-town.",N
2430,"I've never stayed at this Hilton before.  Usually I'm close to the river, but I was in town for a conference at the Hilton and the conference rate was good, so I got to check the place out. It's a big, old hotel.  It's well maintained, but there are things about big, old hotels that aren't great.  It's a long walk from your room to the elevators.  If you want a hot shower, you'll have to let the water run for a while.  If you want a great view, you probably won't have it.  Check in was efficient, housekeeping usually gets it right, and the catering was decent enough that we didn't go out to dinner after eating the snacks at our conference reception.  The rooms are ready for a refresh, but the public spaces were impressive. John McCain and his entourage were in the hotel for a while in the afternoon and evening.  Security was there, and they did a good job of not inconveniencing people who were there for other reasons.  Supposedly when this hotel was built, it was the biggest in the world.  That's not hard to believe and the staff manages things well but if I could pick a hotel for next time, I'd pick a newer one that was maybe a mile further north.",N
2345,"An upscale hotel with nice rooms, very comfortable beds, good concierge, and the best location possible.  The Michigan Ave. location is as good as it gets, and it was nice to be able to step out in the middle of the shopping district.  I'll definitely stay here in the future.",N
3692,"I had Thanksgiving dinner here a few years ago and it was simply amazing! Wonderful choices and services. The Drake Hotel is so famous and should be visited by anyone who goes to Chicago. The hotel was shown in ""My Best Friend's Wedding.""",N
4178,"Location, location, location.  My honey and I went there Mother's Day weekend (for the Beer Fest) ... if we did decide to stay there again, it WOULD NOT be on a popular/holiday weekend or for 39.00 parking charge ~ which you had to do valet (bullpoo!)  Check in is 3:00 and check out it 12:00 and the 39.00 dollar charge is for a 24 hr period, yet you have to have your car out by 12:00 or you pay for an additional day.  I don't get that?!?!  The room was nice and clean but the cleaning people knocking on our door at 7:30 in the morning, then at 9:00 a.m. was NOT cool.   But then again, we did have the pleasure of hearing this obnoxious family at all hours.  The only reason that I would recommend the place is for it's location.",N
5794,"I stayed at this place (Nov. 10-13) and I initially had to change rooms twice before finally settling on the last room.  The first two only provided heating and the wireless internet did not work at all, both located in their main building.  The receptionist said she would try and reset the router the first couple of times, but that never worked and I also noticed that the refrigerator did not work in the second room. The room I did stay in was located in a separate bldg across the way overlooking the pool, which was emptied, full of leaves and I'm assuming because it was off-season and temperatures were close to freezing at night.  The room wasn't as dated as the rooms in the main building, but the exterior walls were a bit worn and a chipped.  With that said, I decided to give it a try anyways because the room had wireless internet that worked, the fridge worked and it had both a.c. and heating available. I should point out, that the refrigerator in the room worked well for beverages only.  The walls were extremely thin, but I did not notice that until my 2nd night there, since it was practically empty when I initially arrived here, but you will hear door slams from the other rooms next door if it is fully booked.  On the plus side: Access to the #6 bus into downtown Chicago was easily accessible (about 3 blocks away).   Overall, I received a fair rate on Priceline and would only recommend staying here if you are a deep sleeper, on a budget and don't need a fast internet connection(as I mentioned, it's spotty).  FYI, There is however a small computer room with a printer in the lobby guests can use.",N
2310,"Yes, it's late morning and I should be working on contract issues and rifling through heaps of paper but I'm entitled to a break!  Besides, I'm basing this review on my stay at the Marriott Downtown for a couple of business meetings last week so it's completely work related.  Ugh, yeah, that's it... In any case, as other Yelpers have already noted, the Marriott Downtown costs as much as it does due to its location!  Two nights and you're looking at throwing down half of that rent check if not all of it.  Yes, the Marriott certainly is on Michigan Avenue (aka the Magnificent Mile, which isn't so magnificent when you don't have any ducketts to spend) and it's in the middle of a lot of goings-ons but the interior is quite a labyrinth of amenities.  I felt like a Hobbitt looking for a gold ring!   Upon arriving, it took me a good 20 minutes to find my room.  I asked about 4 other people and they were lost too.  Well, I found it, finally!  I have to say that I LOVED the view.  However, it was considered a Club Room upgrade and I didn't see how.  The room was rather small.  I mean, I can't complain but then again when I'm paying a couple limbs my last two nights there, I would have loved something a bit more grand than what was received. So, why did we pick this place for such a large business meeting (approximately 300 attendees!)?  It is one of the only hotels in Downtown Chicago that can accommodate parties of that size.  Oh, to top it off, let's confuse guests even more by having an escalator from the 7th floor spit you right out onto the 5th floor!?!  Wow, really?  I have to cut them some slack though because the staff was really nice and helpful.  However, along with check-in, they should give hotel guests a Tom Tom GPS navigation system to find their way around.",N
36,"Great location for a good price. Book it directly on their website and get the AAA price for the best deal. Hotel has that old Chicago charm. Bed was comfortable and the room was clean. Bathroom appeared to have been updated in the past few years. 32"" flat screen in the lowest cost room. (single queen) Was able to connect my laptop to it and watch videos. Could tell that the woodwork in the rooms was old, probably the original. But it was still in good condition and fit the building. They have some kind of incense/oil going in the lobby and it might be on the strong side for some people, but it didn't bother me. Continental breakfast is available at the Mike Ditkas next door for $5 a person. It isn't anything special but what's there is decent. Overall it's a very nice hotel. I dont need much for amenities above a clean room and comfy bed and this hotel fit that perfect. Free wi-fi is an excellent bonus. For the money, it was the best deal in town if you dont need 5 star accomodations. One quick note, during my stay in March 2011 the building next door was being torn down so the construction crews were working early weekday mornings. I'd expect that a new hotel is being built and would take some time once the demo is complete.",N
1953,"I only stayed a night  but it was a lovely hotel.  The staff was very nice and prompt.  It's very swanky and the decor is very hip.  Overnight parking is what you'd expect in Chicago. I felt like I was in a nightclub in the elevator, I guess they really cater to a young crowd.  The concierge however gave us incorrect information about reservations at a restaurant so that was annoying but I'd still come back.",N
4122,"Don't judge it by the exterior... Today was my first time staying at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago and when the taxi pulled up to the entrance, I must say I was unimpressed....it looks very old and dated.  Once I walked through the doors however, I was so pleased!  It's very modern and updated inside.  There's a beautiful fountain in the entrance that a bistro/bar overlooks.  There's also a 2nd floor bar that overlooks this same fountain.  I make my way up the escalators to the 2nd floor check in and was greeted by Jason Dennard at the check in counter.  He was so pleasant and accomodating.  He took the time to ask where I was coming in from, how was my day, etc.  He asked my prefernce for a room, ie; king or 2 queens...I respond by saying 'king'....he looks for the room options and informs me that the only available king room is by the elevator - in which he suggested I don't take that room.  I really appreciated him telling me this, particularly after reading some of the other reviews regarding noise.   I make my way to the west tower to go to my room.  There's a west and east tower - this place is huge, but everything is well marked and easily walkable.  I decide to forgo a night on the town and order room service - the menu offers all the basics - nothing too fancy unless you choose to order from Stetson's (their in-house Steak House) but expect to pay $34 for a filet or $30 for the salmon.  Instead, I opt for the vegetarian wrap, tomato soup, and a glass of Oregon pinot gris.  Either I was really hungry, or this was the best 'room service' meal I've ever had.  It was so fresh - the wrap had asparagus, red pepper, eggplant, zuchini, and a white bean puree to hold it all together.  I honestly wasn't expecting much, and this far exceeded my expectations.   The rooms are comfortable with modern decor.  I would definitely stay here again.",N
1781,"We arrived at 6am and they had a room ready for us which was great. Its a boutique style hotel with cool decor. Rooms are cute, but a bit small. Its almost like they are trying to hard to make it a really nice hotel. The location is great, right in the theater district and walking distance to Millenium Park. Overall good hotel for the price.",N
1956,"wi-fi sucks, and the front desk will promise to bring up a new cord to plug into the high speed internet directly, but they never deliver, and won't answer the phone. lame wi-fi and mediocre customer service? i think the W can do better than that. :o(",N

1732,"I stayed here on a recent business trip. Typically I just stay at a Starwood to rack up the points, but my company has a new partnership with Kimpton Hotels so I thought I would try it. What a great alternative to the standard hotel. The service was amazing, even checking ahead of time to see what type of pillow I would like in my room and how many. I was plesantly greeted when I arrived, and went up to a nice sized, clean (although a little brightly colored) room. The beds were unbelievable comfortable and even though I typically have a very difficult time sleeping when traveling- I got a great night sleep. The best part about my stay was meeting a friend down in the hotel bar. We were going to go out, but due to cold weather we just decided to get a drink at the hotel. The brightly colored lounge played great music and had the feel of taking you to another era. The staff was friendly and martinis tasty and the whole atmosphere had the feel that you could walk up and sit with anyone in the bar and strike up a conversation. ADDITION Jan. 12, 2007: I just stayed again at this hotel... and here are some more things I love... the hotel is pet friendly (I didn't bring a pet) but I have recently learned that all Kimpton hotels seem to be pet friendly even the really upscale, expensive ones. They have a power strip next to the mirror so you don't have to climb under things and unplug lights to plug in your curling iron, they ask you what type of pillow you would like (it's the little things), and did I mention they have a complimentary wine hour after work... ADDITION: July 19, 2007- Just got back from my fourth trip to Chicago in the past 7 months and another stay at Allegro. Hotel was still great and remains one of my favorites, but this time I happened to be there on a weekend when it was 100% booked. I had never noticed the hotel being noisy before- but this time I had to call down to quiet down the room next to me (the hotel sent someone up right away and then they were quiet so it wasn't a big deal), but then on my fourth morning at the hotel a baby was crying at 5AM in the room next to me. There was not muffling of the sound between my room and theirs- the baby sounded like it was literally in a crib two feet from my bed. Still a great hotel- but noise is definitey a concern if the hotel is crowded.",N
5682,"Very friendly, clean and classic rooms that have an old town feel.  The doormen and front desk were very polite and courteous, and offered me assistance with everything from luggage to taxi's.  Returning at night, the maid service even left chocolates on the pillow.  Little details are very important to me and the Talbott Hotel paid attention to all of them.",N
18,"Great location, terribly outdated. Feels like my grandmother decorated it, complete with overwhelming smell of cranberry potpourri in the lobby. Nothing extra, no frills, no service, no greeting when you walk ing. You can pay $5 for muffins and coffee in the morning, no eggs, no room service. If you're on a budget, at least it's clean, maybe not comfortable.",N

Thank you!!! I highly recommend this hotel to everyone !!!",N
3652,"This place is obviously trying to live off its name, location, and reputation.  But this should be rated based on what you get today, and thats not much. Went to a wedding here and while it sounded so nice to go to a wedding at the Drake, there are far superior hotels in chicago.  I am not even talking about decor because that is everyones personal taste.  But, when it comes to service, theres either good service or bad service.  This was bad service.  I even saw the concierge recommend an italian restaurant to a lady asking for a good japanese food.  I guess they just have their list of what they like and stick with it without thinking about what you really want. DONT EVER LOSE ANYTHING HERE!  SECURITY DOES NOT LIKE TO PICK UP THEIR PHONE!  AND IF YOU EVER TRY GOING THROUGH THE OPERATOR TO TALK TO SECURITY, THEY WILL DROP YOUR CALL. I won't go into specifics, but its sad to see one of the finer and more reputable hotels in chicago go so far downhill.  Whatever your choice in decor is, thats fine.  But a hotel with this price point should have better service.",N
1622,"We got this hotel for a stay cation in the city, there were 4 of us girls. The lobby is really small but decorated in a boutique style, very cute. The guy behind the counter was super friendly and he even upgraded us to a river-view room even though we just got the city-view room (which was just basically view of buildings). When we got up to the room the view was amazing and the room was very spacious, great for a group of people, for a pre-game or something. We got 2 double queens. It was pretty entertaining to watch the view down to the river. You could tell that this hotel was revamped, meaning you could tell this was a hotel that was prob very crappy before and attempting to be something nicer than it is. Everything looks really nice but there are some things if you really want to be nitpicky, like the size of the shower, small, the water pressure did not change at all. The carpet looked dirty, there was even a stain, and they had haphazardly covered the chaise (leopard print) with a navy blue cover. But hey, it is a pretty nice hotel in a very good location, close to everything and at a decent price. I could find myself staying here again.",N
1515,"Love, love, LOVE this hotel. When traveling to large cities for tradeshows, I'm pretty much expecting higher hotel prices. Still $230/night for what I got was a great deal. Plus, it was on the shuttle route to McCormick Place. The regular rooms were booked and since it was getting close to show time, I upgraded to the junior executive suite for only $20 more a night than the regular room. Couple that with a 20% discount for pre-paying and it was a pretty good deal. Posh interior, working elevators with low wait times and generally really nice looking. The suite had a wet bar and fridge, very nice lounge/desk area, huge sleeping area with chaise lounge and a phenomenal bathroom. Garden tub + seperate shower with rain head - LOVED it. Hotel 71 is close to EVERYTHING. Seriously, the best location. The river is across the street, the Tribune building just to the right and fantastic architecture all around. Nice little restaurant/bar extended off the lobby and an array of food/drink choices all around. The staff was super friendly and my room was fantastic. I will say I can see how others reviewers may be irritated with the thermostat - I had it set on cool for the most part but I'm pretty sure it stayed the same temperature the entire time. It was comfortable for me, but I can how others might find it a bit stuffy. The business center was a little on the small side, but had everything I needed and everything worked.   I'd definitely recommend this place for business or pleasure and will for stay again the next time I'm downtown.",N
1949,"The location of this W is great- it's downtown, so very accessible to Loop areas. The rooms are very nice, with white cabinets/shelves in the room and plenty of space. The big issue I have with this property is the layout of the lobby area.  There's not a lot of space, and the path to the check-in desk and elevators is not very intuitive. Note: I am on a personal mission to stay at every W Hotel in the USA (and then hopefully branch out to worldwide!)",N
4471,"A throw back to a better time in America when people were not so obsessed with lower prices and costs.  Fantastic atmosphere and lobby.  Very good service throughout and I loved the bar in the lobby, which seems to jump during the evening.  The room was newly decorated but kept the older walk in closet, which i appreciated.  Make sure you do not get a room by the service elevator as it is quite noisy during the day. The restaurant was pricy for breakfast, but very nice for dinner.  I suggest booking around the corner for breakfast as there are plenty of places on the same block.  Also check out the Berghoff down the street, which has a great bar.",N
390,"For it's location and it's price, the Hilton Garden Inn is not a bad place to stay. Located a few blocks from Chicago's Magnificent Mile, and also walking distance to other shops and dining options, where can you go wrong, right? Well, for one...because of all the above, I am sure lots of families like to stay there as was apparent by my neighbors and the sounds of their kids, the cartoons, and the occasional loud conversations either on the phone or just generally to each other.  I am sure the hotel can't do anything about this, but I'm just saying. Also, I am usually an easy going traveler with no specific requests for my room other than a queen/king-size bed.  But, I would appreciate that if I did not request for a handicapable room, you do not put me in a handicapable room.  I am sure it could have been put to better use.  And although I am aware that I could have asked for another room, I had already unpacked my items before I had realized this.  And to be fair and honest (and NOT mean), I just was not very comfortable in the bathroom as it was made for the handicapable (the toilet seats where rather high....I am particularly short), and the shower just a shower (like gym showers) to make it more accomodating for wheelchairs and such. And one more odd thing....what hotel still has a ""13th"" floor?  I know it's just superstition, but that still creeped me out a bit....cause that was my floor. Aside from that, the staff (front desk and bell men) were extremely friendly and helpful, and I loved how the moment you checked in you had an option to get 2 small bottles of water or 1 large one....complimentary.  I always hated those $4 bottle of waters other hotels try to force on you cause they know you'll be thirsty by the time you get to your room.",N
988,"Lovely boutique hotel in River North, just blocks from  Wacker and Mich ave, and a quick walk to the L, countless restaurants, bars and the hub bub of the river. If given the option, I will always go boutique over chain, and will sacrifice a bit of room space for personal service and friendly touches. I thoroughly enjoy the breakfast spread on each floor by the elevators: no better way to start your day than with a complimentary orange juice, coffee and bagel while still in your plushy robe and slippers. The manager's cocktail and cheese reception each evening is a nice touch, although I am usually at a proper bar during this time frame. The property is immaculate with modern styling and chic touches that are simultaneously impressive and subtle, the service is wonderful and the location is great.  A+ on the ever important issue of bed comfort. - 1 star because, well it is a nice hotel, but it isnt a 5 star hotel. The internet was spotty, the TV could have been bigger and the room was on the smaller side. Still, extremely nice. Great value, ill see you next spring!",N
4556,"The hotel interior was beautiful and the staff was friendly.  The walls are very thin since it is an old building and you can hear everything next door and in the hallway, which is a problem if your neighbors get in late and make noise, or if they watch a movie with the volume on.  Beds were comfy and the front desk was friendly.",N
2290,"While I have not stayed in the hotel, I recently attended a conference here and was amazed by the level of service. These people do it right and are extremely helpful and friendly.  The conference was on floors 6 and 7 and it seemed that there was a member of staff to help navigate at every turn.  The breakfast spread looked yummy and the coffee stayed on all day.  The boxed lunch was more than enough food and done very efficiently. After the conference, I was even able to get some work done in the lobby, using their free wi-fi. I would gladly recommend this hotel for any corporate event.",N
3878,"After having an amazing stay at the Dana last year, I was looking forward to another stay. When we got to our room, I could tell things had changed. The gorgeous room a year ago was looking a little thread bare. The floor was filthy. I took my bath towel and cleaned so much dirt, hair and grime off the floor, the towel turned black. I actually brought the towel to the front desk manager to show him and all he said was ""I'm sorry, I will tell housekeeping."" Our blackout shade curtain was broken and stuck in the up position and our bed sank in the middle so we literally rolled towards the middle. Walls were scratched and dirty. They actually forgot to give us a wake up call... something that hotels just never do. It's always something you can rely on. Well, not here. It made us late for an appointment. After all that trouble, they only gave us $30 off a 3 night stay. The Dana Hotel has gone way downhill... fast.",N

It is very conveniently located near michigan ave, bus stops, and el stations... which is a BIG BIG plus. The only bad thing about this hotel is the INTERNET. Ugh. They charge like $13 for it and it SUCKS. It works fine for a good 10 minutes and then lags. I mean really LAGGING...to the point of turning off my airport on and off a few times. I'm gonna complain about this tomorrow when I check out because it's not even free like most hotels. Other than that, I would definitely come back to this hotel....if I can get deal like I did this time.",N

A worker showed us a 'completed' floor and it looked very nice. Beds are soft, tv has a great picture. Only thing is the sink area, at least in our room, was tiny. Had no extra room to lay out my makeup. But no big deal. We completely enjoyed our stay. My husband loved the sauna/hot tub up in the exercise/swimming area.",Y
2477,"This is an event posting didn't actually stay at Hotel. I  had the best time at the hotel when Bitbull was performing live at the NYE 2010. The minute I walked into this place the lobby is nice. I saw all these beautiful people this was the place to be NYE this year. The playboy bunnies were there I talked to two of them nice girls. The had live gambling for a charity at the hotel in the basement. The International ballroom had over 3,000 people in it and I was one of them. This was a paid event. I would say if I paid for the ticket I wouldn't have been so excited to be there. Bitbull came on at the last minute after NYE right when I couldn't hold it in anymore (pee pee alert). I was in the front row the jump-smokers are great ! Took some video of them dancing on stage. The drinkers were unlimited and so was the food. The food was not that great mostly pasta and pizza. I would say the bartenders were doing a great job keeping up with the orders even though  the line was a mile long. The  confetti drop was nice but they could have spent a little more money and had ballons too. What was nice is that  my boyfriend and I found his friends after an hour of searching in the crowd. We were begining to think that we wouldn't be able to  find them but finally we did! Amazing  night !",N

To start our stay, the lady didnt have our res. but still gave us a room and assured it would get straighted up no problem. We didnt care so we headed up to the room in a teeny weeny elevator.Opened the door and tripped and fell onto the bed. It was about 2 feet from the door and the room was super tiny.I know its an old hotel and everything was smaller back then but damn it was tiny.Everything from the walking space around the bed to the closet to the shower. After I got over the ential tiny shock I saw the room was really clean and well decorated. The staff was really friendly the cleaning lady would pretty much jog down the hall just to press the elevator button for us everytime we were leaving the room,I loved that so sweet! So when we went to check out they still had no record of us even staying with them.? Weird but kind of scary I didnt get a chance to eat in the restaurant but it looks really swanky.I bet they have good food.",N

Really, is there anything more strangely comforting than staying at a hotel in your own city? The Intercontinental is a fabulous find for right around $200 a night. Pillow-top beds (good sleep is the priority), well-appointed rooms, a super convenient location, and a luxe lobby. And the lobby bar is great fun! We stopped by around midnight on a Tuesday night and the bar was jumping. A black tie-clad group was in full effect and their drunken ringleader treated the entire bar to a round (or two) of shots! This morning, while helping my friend search for her crackberry, I found a used Trojan Magnum wrapper under the bed... details, housekeeping, details!",N
1193,"I have never been so disappointed in a hotel before until I stayed here. First of all I was staying here for the Chicago 1/2 marathon this past August. I stayed here last year and didn't have this many problems until this stay. First of all, they let you check in early online which is nice and then print out this barcode that you can scan at their kiosk near the front counter to get your room keys.  When I got there NONE of the 4 kiosks were working.  When I went to stand in the LONG line (which is why I checked in online to avoid this) the front desk attendant told me that i should check all the kiosks. I said NONE of them are working, shouldn't you know this?  They didn't have a clue what was going on. Second, right near the breakfast/starbucks area to get coffee smelled of BO! It was horrendous. It smelled like that last year and it was worse this time. How can they NOT do something about that. It was just disgusting. You felt like you wanted to throw up Thirdly, at around 4am we heard drunk guys outside our hallway screaming obscenities at either other for about a half hour. It woke us all up and we were trying to get a good night sleep for our race the next day.   Finally, you have to pay for parking, which we get. BUT it was a hassle leaving b/c they were so congested and the scanner thing wasn't working on the way out so we had to wait for assistance. I received  a survey from the Hyatt asking how my stay was. Well I filled it out and let them know I wasn't happy with things and will not be staying there ever again due to all the issues we had. Guess what? I NEVER heard back from their management. Disappointed that they do not care to better their services and keep customers coming back. I will NOT be staying there again!",N
5511,"I miss this hotel. My wife and I will never forget our stay here from September 22-25. I just hope that we've been forgotten already (I explain later). +Great location. As Joel A. mentions, the hotel is near Lincoln Park, the red ""L"" line, and some nice restaurants (I reviewed Chili Mac's recently), bars, and shops. My wife and I went to Chicago to see the Cubs play (we love Bay Area teams more, but have been fans of the Cubs for years), and Wrigley Field is only a 15-minute walk from the hotel (after you exit and head left, you simply turn left on W. Addison St.- Wrigley is about 12 blocks away total). +The front desk employees are helpful and friendly. The guys especially made me feel comfortable (they're a bit more casual and approachable). +Some supplies are available per request. I stupidly brought shaving cream, but no razor. I knew that the hotel was going to provide me with a cheap one (oh yeah), but at least I was bailed out (we met up with an old friend of mine on the 24th, and I think his cute little girls would have been scared if I looked like Bigfoot). +There's a nice computer by the front desk. Guests are only asked to use it for no more than 15 minutes (in general, the computer should be available). +Continental breakfast is served from 7-10 am (I can't comment on it further, as my wife and I always slept in). +The area outside is very nice, and the hotel as a whole is pretty elegant. +The soda and snack machines. Most of the snacks I bought were only $.90 each, and my cans of soda were only $1 (you'll be charged more at most hotels in CA). +Their English is limited, but the housekeepers work hard and are friendly. +The ones at Embassy Suites are bigger, but my wife and I liked our suite. It featured 2 flat screen TV's, a nice desk (we both loved the office chair), a comfortable couch (I'm surprised that I didn't find myself sleeping on it), and 2 beds (we slept on separate beds, but cuddled and watched TV from mine). +Check-In is at 2 pm, and Check-Out is at 12 (I view this as a positive because some hotels want you to check-in at 3 or 4 and check-out at 10 or 11 am). +The air conditioning unit in our suite was loud, but easy to operate (my wife saw the panel on the wall before I did- prior to this, I was unplugging the unit, pressing all these buttons, and getting ready to kick it).     +/-The lobby is a little small, but nice. The chairs are large and comfortable, and there's a painting that looks like it should be part of Disneyland's Haunted Mansion (the tree and body of water look dark and spooky). My wife kept telling me which one was ""right,"" but there are 2 doors to enter and exit. -Our suite was a bit pricey. We were basically charged $206 a night. -There are no hotel shuttles. Taking a taxi to and from Midway International Airport cost us $80 total. -The bathroom in the lobby is locked (this impacted my wife and I to some degree). I understand, as it's only meant for guests (as Michael S. mentions, the hotel ""is the BEST and ONLY place to use the bathroom in this part of Lakeview before 7 am""). Still, I hate asking for bathroom keys.   -The hotel is tucked away. It's easy to pass it up if you're driving there and not familiar with the area. It's also right next to a brownstone (I quickly got used to it, but the view from our windows was less than stellar). -There are only 4 floors and 83 rooms (the hotel is long, but not wide), and pets aren't allowed. I advise booking your room months in advance, at least during baseball season. -It's nice and somewhat spacious, but my wife and I only noticed 1 elevator. -There's a fitness center that includes a Whirlpool spa tub. There's no swimming pool, though, and room service is limited (I didn't even know that there was any until now). -The toilet in our suite was weak (we had to report this twice). I had an accident on the night of the 22nd, and it took awhile to clean up the toilet bowl, floor, back wall, and tub (the towel on the tub was beyond saving- no, just a tiny speck landed on it). Anyway, the toilet wouldn't flush right from the night of the 23rd on (this really didn't have to do with me). On the 24th, a guy named Manuel worked on it (I felt sorry for him and the housekeeper when they came in- they quietly talked to each other a little in Spanish), but the plunger he had was inadequate (he needed a Snake). On the 25th, I left a nice mound behind, and my wife made her imprint felt too (we weren't descriptive at all, but the looks we got from the front desk employees we talked to were priceless). All in all, it was a real crappy situation.     Needless to say, my wife and I had an eventful stay (if we ever book a room here again, we'll arrive with plungers in hand). The hotel has a lot of charm and some friendly and understanding employees.",N
1709,"Stayed here Valentines Night and was very pleased. The rooms are very modern and hip--as is the whole Hotel. We thought the size was just right for a nights stay, or even for a weekend. We loved having the iHome and the huge TV. The bathroom is a bit small, but you aren't sleeping in there, are ya? One of the best accommodations about this hotel was the complimentary breakfast--it is one of a kind. It is not the typical doughnuts and coffee table. It is a little bar area that a woman controls. Each person gets a juice, coffee or tea, a piece of fruit, and some kind of bakery good. Each item was fresh and delicious. And we loved the spunky seating area.",N
1495,"Excellent hotel centrally located, with an incredibly professional staff. We stayed here while in Chicago for a convention, and were very happy we did! Our friends stayed at another hotel down the street and were very jealous of our huge quiet room! Why only 4 stars? First night we were awaken by the burning stench of ammonia. The cleaning person and engineer quickly found the cause, the refrigerator had a leak and fixed it! They charge $10 a day for wifi! Really makes no sense to charge for wifi in this day and age! however sign up for their rewards program and its free. Finally we decided that we were going to return to Chicago a few days after we checked out and thought we might as well stay at the omni, however even though we stayed there five nights and paid well over $1,000 they still would only give us the rack rate of $285 on a Saturday night. Oh and when we recieved our bill i saw they charged me to call reservations! Granted it was a mistake and only $.75 but its the principle .",N
514,"Stayed here a couple days to see the city before going to MI for a wedding.  A suite that sleeps 6 (but 4 comfortably) for $149 was great. Very convenient downtown location, close to many things, including public transit (we took the bus, train and free trolley - which was sadly discontinued by the city yesterday).  There was a fridge and microwave in the room, which came in handy after visiting Chicago restaurants, which served Chicago portions.  (Also to keep the beer cold - buy that across the street at Dominick's/Safeway.) We stayed over the X-mas/New Year's holiday and the place was swarming with kids.  It made the manager's reception (free select drinks and bar snacks for a couple hours) a little difficult since half the bar line was ordering ""kiddie cocktails"" aka Shirley Temples.  A staff member commented that the place was always like that when school's out.  The breakfast was also a little chaotic, but worth the wait.  Cooked to order omelets and biscuits & gravy were hits with us.  The pool and hot tub are open until midnight, which was nice.  Parking at the hotel was expensive, so we used cabs, public transit and walked as much as the cold allowed. Surprisingly, the hotel charges $10/day for WiFi, so go across the street to the Starbucks inside Dominck's where WiFi is FREE.  Also, you don't get to opt out of housekeeping, which was a little weird.  And the ceiling fan was disgustingly caked with dust, which was also a little weird.",N
4444,"The front desk hostess: Michelle is HORRIBLE. I'd probably never come back to this place. When I was checking in, she says the only room available was a TWIN size bed and I looked at her dumbfounded. I obviously had another person with me, but she insisted that it's fine. I complained, and I instantly get a King size bed. Either she was lazy, or too dumb to operate a computer.",N
3753,"My company put me up in this hotel for Lollapalooza this year and I really enjoyed my stay at the Dana Hotel. Aside from the obvious positive attributes, such as the central location, modern decor, and amenities, the friendly staff really stood out. I am from Los Angeles, so I was not used to the Midwest hospitality that I heard so many good things about. Rooms were clean and spacious, maids were attentive, Whole Foods around the corner, nightclub at the top floor, 7-11 across the street... All these things help in making a hotel feel like home. Loved the restaurant at this place, Aja, and the waitress was so cool. I can't remember the exact details, but I remember being comped one of the sushi entrees during dinner, solely out of good will from the staff and me being indecisive about whether to order more food. It was a really warm gesture. Who doesn't like free food?! Breakfast at Aja was another highlight, with plenty of healthy, hearty options. The front desk seemed overwhelmed at times and I had to wait quite a long time to check-in, but all very minor, considering the overall pleasant stay.",N
4557,This hotel is OK.  Stayed on a Friday in September for $75+tax and fees (priceline).  Drain was clogged but they fixed it promptly.  The concierge was not at the desk most of the time I looked for information.  My one big complaint: $61 per day valet parking fee.  Way too high.,N
3913,"Can I write a review if I've only been to the hotel bar? I appreciated a lot of things in the bar at the Congress Plaza Hotel, named {something} Tap, like the mahogany wood, the copper bar, and the pillars surrounding the windows which made it look like at one time this area was completely open and airy. This place must have really been something, circa 1910, and it saddens me to see what it has become. The Red Bull cooler behind the bar and the neon beer signs in the window clash with the ambiance. Wait...actually, the ambiance clashes with the ambiance. There are no cocktail waitresses and the few people they have delivering the food look super ornery. The clientele is kind of a mixed bag of ""what the hell"" and ""aww, you poor thing from Idaho that accidentally booked a room here."" Still, my friends and I were in need of a little girl chat and wine so we ordered what has come to be known as The Worst Bottle of Wine Ever. It was a 2008 pinot noir, it was $44 (highway robbery!), and it tasted like it had turned. Still - and I'm unsure how this happened - we choked it down, alternating sip of wine with sip of water.  Today I feel like I'm going to vom.",N
3132,Great Hotel Rooms for Couples!  Really amazing service from the front desk.,N
2232,"NOTE: This review is for their meeting and event services only. I was responsible for meeting with approx. 60 attendees and was not impressed at all by the meeting services.  Every request we made was either denied or finally fulfilled, after an eternity of discussions.  When reviewing rooms for our upcoming session, we voiced our concern that they are not big enough.  Finally, the event coordinator had facilities place tables in the room, so we could visualize whether or not we could fit our people.  We determined that we couldn't which resulted in the manager stopping by and telling us that we could easily fit them and since he doesn't share our concerns with us, he will not make another room available for us.  Now that's what I call customer service...NOT.  Accommodating is not a word in this man's vocabulary.  Apparently it didn't matter that we had already spent a pretty penny there and were going to do the same at the upcoming meeting.  Needless to say, we pulled our upcoming meeting from the Intercontinental and instead had it at the Four Seasons (hallelujah!!!).",N
2311,"Stayed here this weekend with some friends. Cannot beat the location for Magnificent Mile shopping and dining!   Beautiful large lobby with a bar and a Starbucks.  Rooms are small (the usual for this area at an affordable price point of $145 per night) but very clean, beds plush.  Great flat screen TV.  Bathroom is TINY though, door opens and is within inches of the toilet which is awkward but again, clean with is important.  Bath and Body Works ammenities are nice too!",N
3241,"This hotel is okay for what it is, but it lacks basic amenities, like a hairdryer, which I found strange. The location is great, the prices are reasonable I guess, and the people working here are friendly. The beds were comfortable, but the sheets were stiff. And just a tip - don't eat breakfast here through room service. It's not very good, but it is very expensive. A bonus is that they do have free wireless Internet if you are traveling on business. You simply have to agree to the terms ever 24 hours. I believe they also have free wi-fi in the lobby if you're looking for a place to work in the area.",N
5650,"Probably not a hotel I would have picked for myself, but we were there for a business trip and it was booked for us.  It seems like everything, currently, is an ikea quality boutique hotel or run down.  It was nice to stay in a just really nice hotel with more attention to comfort than the elevator club music.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  The door was always held open for you by someone that seemed genuinely happy to be doing it.  The lobby bar was great and more active than most hotel bars.  Really great experience all around.",N
5781,"It's a bit far. I did priceline, so it was okay. It was a 10 minute walk to Pink Line, and 0.5mile walk to blue line. They do have shuttles but they run only on the hour and half. Great if you have people at the hospital. My sister liked how big the room was. Love that it was a non-smoking building. They provide Bath and Body Works shampoo. Downside: no free wi-fi. There is a computer you can use downstairs to check email, and another computer to print your boarding pass. I think past midnight, they lock the sliding doors so you have to show the receptionist your key card before she'll open it. That was a bit annoying. Rooms are clean, neat, white. Lots of lights available. We had a fridge in our room which was nice. The hair dryer was ionic and ceramic :) And they do have coffee/ tea in the room. No complementary breakfast. The walls are thin which may just be all of Chicago, but anytime someone leaves the room you can hear it shut. For the price, which was less than 180/ night, not bad. Which I could find a place closer though to other amenties, but it gave me a chance to explore that side of Chicago. I give it a four based on the neatness of the room, the fridge, and all. Receptionist did not seem that welcoming or friendly, they just were doing the job. not very helpful in getting to places but it's okay I asked other people. That's it.",N
636,"I had moderate to high expectations from this place. But I was very unimpressed. We checked in pretty late at night, the person at the front desk was a lady, she was ok but either did not understand my question or did not want to answer it. I asked the lady for a room with a view, and she said, ""here are your keys, your room faces south."" I asked again, ""does it have a nice view."" Her response: ""it faces south."" UM OK? By the way, it did not have a nice view. All I saw was the building in front of me, which was all glass. I thought maybe our window was the kind of glass where we could look out, but no one could look in. No, I was wrong. I could see myself in the glass window of the building across from us. The bed was comfortable and the room was pretty clean. The next morning, I had to print something for a conference, so I went to the business center, and the internet was (I think) about $6 for 15 minutes. They REALLY should NOT be charging to use internet in the business center. I understand if you charge for internet in the rooms, but really?? The internet was SO SLOW. It took 15 minutes to load http://gmail.com and open a one-page word document. I called the guy in-charge of this, his name was ""Eddie."" He was unapologetic and said ""people use this all the time."" Then he swiped his card on the other computer and asked me to use it, again same thing. It was SO SLOW and did not load. Eddie still did not apologize or anything. I looked for a fedex closeby and found one in the Marriott. It worked flawlessly. The next thing to happen was that my room key did not work. The REALLY RUDE woman at the front desk said, ""if you keep the key near your phone, it deactivates."" Well, I did not keep it near the phone, so I don't know why it deactivated. Also, there were two other people in line whose keys also were deactivated. Third bad thing: the showers are difficult to figure out. Seriously? You need instructions for the showers. All in all, not worth the price and I am definitely not going back and not recommending it to anyone else. You can get better service and experience in another hotel for sure.",N
5698,"After lodging in a somewhat uppity hotel for a few days, I stayed at the Chicago River Hotel my last night in town. As with any hotel, this one had its pros and cons. Pro: -free wifi. -modern decor in the bathroom. -free bottled water stations by the elevators. Cons: -the floor I was on (11th) smelled like smoke. -bed was cheap. -sheets and bedspread were dollar store quality. So, it wasn't a perfect stay but the free wifi made up for the crappy bed/sheet situation. I'd stay here again, only because it was very close to everything I want to see/do in Chicago.",N
1714,"It is funny, I did not appriciate this hotel as much until I stayed at a few other places.  I originally thought it was small rooms and that was about it... but read on. The more times I stayed here, the more I enjoyed it.  First off, I have always found the service to be great.  I feel welcomed when I check in, and feel like they appriciated my stay when I check out.  That is big... hotels are a service industry and many lose sight of that!  Overall, I would say the service here is top notch (and I have stayed at many of the more pricey places in the area too). The rooms could be hit or miss... but are always clean and everything is working order.  The closets can be small or not there, so when checking in be sure to make sure you get a room with a decent closet if you are staying a few days!  I have had tiny rooms, regular rooms and suites.  The suites are very large BTW. Here are the downsides or things to watch for (and again, I am giving it 4 stars so you could see it does not matter too much): No coffee makers in the room... I have coffee 24/7 so that is a bit of a challenge.  There is a Dunkin Donuts next door though, no biggie. The elevators could be SLOW during peak times.  If you need a speedy exit, choose a low floor or something close to the stairs. If you like it uber quiet, be sure to ask for something away from the trains. Upsides: Aveda bath soaps.  Sure it is a small thing, but they are nice products and not cheap. iHome alarm clocks (I forget if all rooms have them or just the suites).  Charge your iPod and wake up to your music.  Good stuff! Nice TV's.  I never turn mine on, but if you are a TV nut they are good. Eco-Friendly:  I'm not a tree hugger... but if you are the non-leg-shaving type you might admire their efforts! Free wine hour/happy hour:  Usually have some good apps and wine plus some seasonal drinks (spiked hot toddy the last time) Helpful staff:  Always a plus! Well done Kimpton and Allegro.  I'm sitting in your room as I type this, back for maybe my 15th stay here.  For 1/2 the price of some of the other spots, I'm glad I stay with you!",N
5558,"A friend and I took a roadtrip to see our Philadelphia Phillies take on the Cubs in Chicago in July and had a hard time finding a place to stay until we found this gem. Good location (near trains and walking distance to a lot of stuff), good price and awesome free breakfast! Liked this place so much, it's made me a firm believer in the LaQuinta chain and I've looked at staying at them in other cities.",N
4382,"The front desk staff saved this review from dropping to a one star.   So for this latest trip we arrived later in the evening, and the first notable occurrence was the doorman yelling at the cab driver for not opening the trunk fast enough.  Then when he did get it open one of my camera bags fell flat on to the ground, directly on to my laptop. Luckily it survived unscathed, but it wasn't the best beginning to the trip.  The lobby at the Palmer is always packed like the MGM Grand or something, and with all of the hotels in downtown Chicago I can't really figure out what the draw is.  There was no line at the check in desk despite the crowd, so we were able to get up to our room really quick.  Then we opened the door. Now when you book a room on Hotwire technically you aren't supposed to get many options, but we did book for two adults... and it's a big assumption on the part of the hotel that these two adults are married or a couple as only one person's name gets entered in.  So we were a bit shocked to see that inside our very tiny room was a single double bed.  I mean this the U S of A people... double beds should be legislated out of existence by now.  My wife calls down to the front desk asking to switch to a different room and is told we can't be moved until Sunday.  Then I call and we can magically get moved that very night.  Definitely happy about the move, not sure why the voice of a male was needed to make it happen. The rest of the experience continued to be pretty lackluster.  Every single morning we were there at around 8:30am the cleaning staff would gather outside the door to our room and from the sounds of it were conducting their staff meeting. Well, I'm not being serious about the meeting part, but they were seriously LOUD.  Want to sleep in at the Palmer?  You can forget about it. Also be prepared for all sorts of typical downtown Chicago hotel nickel and diming.  We didn't want to pay for the internet, so we decided we'd go down to hang out at the Starbucks inside the Palmer because all Starbucks have free wifi now.  Not this one.  Palmer shuts it down. Eh, I could say more but you probably get the point.",N
5600,"full disclosure:  i did not stay overnight here, i was here as a day visitor for a conference last week. moving on. so i ride my bike any time i need to get around this fine city, commute to work, what have you.  i didn't really think twice when i hopped on my bike to get here on monday morning.  well, about halfway there, i was like ""hmm.  where to lock up, where to lock up...""  i wandered around the area trying to find a proper rack to no avail.  i started to panic because i knew rahm was speaking and i make it a point to be as involved in this crazy political machine as possible.  nothing.  no racks! so, i rolled up, all sweaty and disheveled, to the bellhop and said, sir, please, i need help, where can i put this stupid thing?! do you have any bike racks!?  he kindly responded ""are you here for the conference?  i can go ahead and take that for you!"" and he valeted it.  he valeted my bike in a jacket with epaulets.  it was the greatest.  and i even caught the rahm speech.   also, space was nice, soap in the bathrooms smelled nice, its a nice place, real first class establishment. mm mm mm.",N

2034,"Hmm Where to begin.. I like the positives so I'll go that way.. The Good - The room was comfortable.. There is a good amount of space inside the rooms, the shower/bathroom were pretty good.  All in all the room was ok.. The Bad.. and it begins. Staff - I didn't encounter one person that I would say did a stellar job.  The problems started with the shitty attitude of the bell hop and went from there.. The Pillows - Painful. Seriously horrible. The Location - It's really confusing to try and find the actual hotel inside the merchandise mart.. there isn't enough signage. The location is also pretty shitty in terms of access/things you would want to do.  Sure it's on the brown line.. but that's the problem, I NEVER use the brown line.",N

We had a suite, and thought it was amazing for the price we paid. The staff was incredibly friendly, the free breakfast was more than we expected, and the amenities in the room were top notch. If you're looking for a place to stay on the north side, look no further. Best value out there, no doubt.",Y

2438,"There is no doubt that the Hilton Chicago sits in an ideal location of Chicago. It is in walking distance from the Art Institute, Grant & Millennium Parks, the L, and likely the best coffee in Chicago,  Intelligentsia Coffee & Tea. However, the hotel itself leaves a lot to be desired. While historic and magnificent in its own right, it's functionality leaves little to be desired. I found the plumbing to be poor (low water pressure), fixtures gaudy (gold and tarnished), and sadly, the overall cleanliness questionable. I'd rather spend a bit more for the W or perhaps even settle for the hostel around the corner. Love you, Chicago. Don't love you, Hilton Chicago :(.",N

4488,"at the time of my stay, they were doing some major renovation to the place. so i felt a little cheated for not having able to experience what it had to offer. although  both the restaurant and the bar were open, i was not able to take advantage of it. the stay was very nice, i had a double bed room. the room has a very old, antique-ish feel to it. the bathroom was nice and clean but it was not fully stocked with all the bath essentials (shampoo, conditioner and lotion). i might also note that the bathroom had a ""mildew"" smell....ya.....pretty gross.  the room came with all the normal amenities that you would expect from a hotel EXCEPT a coffee maker! i am a dedicated morning coffee drinker and not having a coffee maker in the room really ruins my stay. =( i like the location of the hotel because its a short walk to any fast restaurant or a mini mart if you want to go grab a snack or something. its in the theater district so if you're in town for a show, this would be a good spot to stay. its also VERY close to the Art Museum (just one block) which also means a short walk to Grant and Millennium Park.   just a note, since they dont have coffee makers in their room, it does appear that they are opening a starbucks in the lobby area. there's also a cornery bakery right next door. overall my stay was pleasant and a descent experience at a historical chicago hotel.",N

235,"Ok but can it be better in the Gold Coast!  I love the cute decor in the place.  The theme runs true throughout the hotel.  The room was definitely cozy and reminded me more of a bed and breakfast than a hotel.   The place is nestled right off the lake.  I was thinking it should be a bit more opulent but its okay.  One thing that I appreciate is free wifi in the rooms.  It makes a heck of a difference when you are trying to get work done.   The price was okay but make sure you check out http://hotels.com for great discounts on them before paying a hefty price. The service was moderate.  At times, you could miss them.

2497,"i often like to stay at ""chain"" hotels, but on occasion, i like to try the chic and hip ones as well as old historical ones. this one is one of the historical chicago hotels that was worth the stay. its in the south loop area, a bit of a walk to get to all the shopping but if you're staying downtown, you're gonna be walking alot anyways. the lobby was absolutely gorgeous!!! very very friendly staff. i was taking photos of the lobby and was asked by a hotel staff if i would like a picture taken. very generous =) the room was very nice and clean. i love that the room came with two bathrooms! its perfect especially if you have multiple guests in one room.    the rooms came with one tv and coffee maker. the coffee maker was pretty cool. it makes cups, not pots. perfect so that you can control how many cups you want. the only thing i can complain about is that the picture was a bit wirey on the tv. nothing major, but it probably about time for them to upgrade their tv's. btw, i love that they stock crabtree & evelyn bath products! they smell wonderful!",N

3824,"I've stayed at the Dana Hotel several times before; it's one of my favorites in Chicago.  This review, however, is for my spa day I recently had here.  I was treated to one of their 3  1/2 hour packages which included Swedish massage, facial and classic mani/pedi.  The receptionist greeted me when I got there and showed me to the shower/locker room.  It was decent, but I was surprised to see those generic brown paper towels at the sink--the ones that smell when you dry your hands with them.  Totally not a big deal, but this is a spa, after all...  I'll forgive them for that one, though, since the robes were so comfy. Before my first treatment, they took me to the relaxation room, which is kind of an oxymoron because you're stuck in a very very dimly lit room with other people in robes, and it's anything but relaxing.  Worries like, ""am I exposing any bits & pieces,"" etc.  There are some magazines but it's so dark I'm not sure how you're expected to read them. My first treatment was a massage.  It was heavenly...  The pressure was just right and I really liked whatever lotion/oil that was used, because I didn't feel slimy and gross at the end like you sometimes do after a massage.  From there, I had a facial.  I'd never had one before, and I have to say it was my favorite part of the package.  I didn't do anything special, just a regular ""refresher"" since I have relatively sensitive skin.  The woman who did my facial was really good about asking about skin allergies and whatnot.  The facial was very relaxing, too (minus the extraction part).   After my facial, I had a mani/pedi.  Unfortunately, this was my least favorite part of the treatment.  Maybe because I get them regularly and my experience was just standard at the Dana?  Honestly, I prefer my regular neighborhood salon to my experience at the Dana.  The woman went a little overboard with the bubbles; it actually felt like my feet were soaking in Dawn.  Also, the scrub was done really quickly--kind of felt like I got ripped off on that part.  The manicure was just okay, too.   One other thing to note, I'm not sure where, but I somehow got jipped in terms of time.  It was supposed to be a 3.5 hour package, and I was out of there in just 3 hours (maybe even a little less).  The massage and facial felt like they took ample time, so I have a feeling it was the mani/pedi that were a little shorter than advertised.",N
1589,"I just returned to LA from Chicago and stayed at hotel 71.  The service was outstanding and the feel of the hotel is energetic and loungy without being pretentious. I highly recommend it I you are looking to stay downtown-the views, restaurant and gym are fantastic too!",N
1836,"Overall, the W City Center meets, but does not exceed expectations. I stayed here for 5 nights and didn't have one issue with the service or amenities. The hotel does offer Acura complimentary car service which is nice.",N
164,"I love old fashioned hotels, but love my comfort too!  The Whitehall has both!  It has a wonderful history since 1920s, and a charming atmosphere.  Our room was a bit on the small side compared to more modern hotels, but otherwise very comfortable.  The hotel is connected to an italian restaurant Fornetto Mei which also includes a bar and a connecting lounge area between the hotel and restaurant with comfy sofas and seating  to relax with friends.  The hotel is just off Michigan Avenue near the Water Tower Place - a great area with lots of great restaurants, sights and shopping.  If you have a car, the valet parking is very convenient.  It was $39 in May 2007 with unlimited in-out privleges.  I did notice a public parking across the street on Delaware Ave. that might be cheaper, but sometimes it's just so nice to let the valet handle it!",N
2928,"4-stars for view and location and some staff, 3 for amenities, service, and overall vibe. Stayed here since it's essentially a conference center hotel, and I was attending one.  It's just a standard Sheraton.  Nothing that sets it apart from others.  It's located on what's essentially a dead end, which is nice that you don't have to deal with traffic directly in front of your room. I didn't receive any recognition for being an SPG Gold member, but was ""upgraded"" to a ""corner"" king room.  By that I mean I was lucky to have a view of the western part of the river and the Trump tower.  I asked for a high elevation floor (22 isn't too bad) on a corner since we aren't entitled to a suite, and did get one, altho a co-worker with no status got 26th floor and a better corner room.  oh well.   NO WIFI at this hotel.  Really??? It's a Sheraton, so you get the comfy bed.  That's a plus.  Bathroom was not designed very well.  It seems like you're a mile away from the tv when in bed.  Doors around your area close VERY loudly. There are better options in the area if you're going to be spending the usual rate of roughly $200.  My advice, if here on vacation and your own dime, is to priceline a hotel around the mag mile or loop. The two VERY nice things I have to compliment them on is the desk clerks being very helpful with my questions, and the ability to go to the locker room outside of the gym to change clothes before my room was ready.  It's a nice locker room with soap, shaving cream, q-tips, lockers, and showers.  It does take a fortnight to get to from the lobby, however.",N
83,"Deciding to have my wedding at the Carleton was one of the first decisions I made after getting engaged, and it turned out to be one of the best decisions I made over a year and a half of planning! We held our ceremony and reception at the hotel, since we had a decent number of out-of-town guests and I didn't want them to have to deal with driving.  (And how awesome is it to be able to party all night and then just be a short elevator ride away from your room?)  I know I'm a little bit biased, but my wedding was BEAUTIFUL.  Everything turned out better than I ever could have hoped for.  My vision for my wedding day was executed exactly; how many brides can say that? Annie Mammoser is the wedding coordinator at the hotel, and whatever they're paying her, I'm sure it's not enough, because she is amazing.  Anything I wanted or needed, she was on it.  She made sure all the little details were seen to........ I did not spend a single second worrying about anything on my wedding day.  Even everything leading up to that (the tasting, meeting with linen rental vendor, multiple walk-throughs with my florist) was stress-free. The space is really beautiful (love the chandelier and the bar area), and it's nice to have it all to yourself (rather than being one of several weddings at a larger hotel or banquet hall).  We took some beautiful pictures in front of the Marion Street entrance, and all the extra seating area made for a really fabulous cocktail hour.  (The only thing I'm kind of bummed out about now is that I didn't get to have any of the awesome hors d'oeuvres we selected since I was so busy taking pictures and saying hi to everyone.) As far as cost goes - totally a bargain!  102 people for dinner, copious amounts of alcohol and hours of dancing cost us less than $10,000.  Try doing that in downtown Chicago.  (Not to mention the two complimentary nights in a suite that we were given.  The room was amazing, and it was really nice to be comped like that.) I've now been married for a month, and my friends and family are still talking about the food (really, really delicious!), the candy buffet (set up by Annie, perfectly!), and how much fun they had (possibly due to 5 hours of open bar).  A perfect setting for one of the best days of my life (so far).",N
4654,"The hotel has a beautiful decor, makes one feel cozy and yet sophisticated. Very modern! The service is excellent! The front desk guest services are absolutely helpful and attentive at anything a guest wants or needs! location is perfect! so close to many restaurants and shipping!",N
315,"we were upgraded to a suite so I can't comment on how small the rooms were. ours was definitely comfortable. Pros: - LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. seriously walk to wrigley, southport, tons of food, bars, theaters and the El. - comfy bed. relatively quiet room - decent linens - friendly service Cons: - squeaky floors can be loud (but actually comical) - room decor is ""quaint"" and might be considered dated - tv is also quaint Would stay here again in a hearbeat. So much to walk around to and so much energy in the neighborhood.",N
1661,"Stayed here over a 3-day weekend.  Interior is very modern, trendy, and has an upscale feel for Gen X & Y-types.  This place reminds me a bit of the W-Hotel chain, but not as trendy. The Bad:   The room was fairly small. Disappointing.  The desk and bathroom tops were not very clean - they were full of stains.  The biggest annoyance during my stay was how thin the walls were.  I could literally hear the girls next door complaining about how some guy wasn't giving them any attention at the club - word for word.  I dont wanna hear any conversations from next door when I want to fall asleep (after 1am?) especially when the going rate is  $160+ a night.  Oh, and I could clearly hear a couple having sex on another side of the room.  Nice. (not really)   Advice to management: install more sound insulation between rooms. The Good: Service is friendly and attentive.  The hotel provides free wine (to guests) in the lobby at 5pm.  Nice.   There is a lounge called Encore on the first floor (didnt go, but it looks like a nice place to hangout for a drink).  Hotel provides a nice breakfast every morning, including plenty ice water (with lemon) in the lobby and freshly-popped popcorn in the afternoons. Location is next to the Chicago theater district and is fairly close to all the tourist spots. For $160+ a night, I expected a little more.  Not sure I will come back here, unless I get a great deal.  For the most part, the hotel is fine, but dont expect a quiet space in your room.  If you are looking for peace and tranquility, you may want to look elsewhere.",N
1126,"i may be getting a bit elitist but this fairmont wasn't all i expected. i originally booked here for one thing: the hd tv that was in every room in the newport beach fairmont. but alas, no LCD in this place. a nice overpriced minibar though. my room was pretty sweet - view of navy pier, king bed, decent sized bathroom with the porn star shower (the clear glass door, classy yet shady), and overall the room was a/a- (a great room). this is all probably because they thought i was my dad who is a fairmont god (thanks pops). so absolutely no complaints there. the lobby is very lacking, and the food is even more lacking, so i have to drop this to 3 stars (the tv hurt my feelings, what can i say).",N
3144,"Was here last night for some drinks. This was a terrible experience. It was cold and drafty because you're basically in a hotel lobby. The drinks are overpriced. The decor was scary! The clientele was interesting to watch but was full of tourist, douche bags and odd balls. I would not stay here if I was visiting the city or go here to have an overpriced vodka rocks again!",N
2888,"Not a fan.  I was back in town for a conference, and I have to say, the Sheraton did not impress me.   First off, the bed was uncomfortable.  I felt like I was sinking, and my back hurt everytime I woke up in the bed.  I had a better time sleeping on the loveseat (which I did one night).   Second, the gym is not included in your hotel fee.  $12 for one time and $20 for the duration of your stay.  Really?  I have never been to a hotel where the gym was NOT included in the hotel fee.   Third, the 'complimentary' breakfast on the 33rd floor will actually cost you about $20 unless you're on floors 31-38, something you don't find out until AFTER you've gotten some food and sat down and the little hostess-lady comes out without saying a word to slip a tray with a ticket on it onto your table charging your room.  There should've been signage or something by the food or upon entering the lounge cuz had I known I was going to pay $20 for a crappy bagel and some fruit, I would've gone out for breakfast at a real breakfast joint.  Maybe that was the point.   Fourth, not one single person who worked at the hotel told us about the gym fees or breakfast or even offered these things were available in the first place.  I feel things could've been better explained to us. Fifth, as the girls and I were getting ready to check out, we get a knock on the door from housekeeping asking us if she could come in to check our mini-fridge to see if we had taken anything.  Um...no.  That's unprofessional.  Come back when we've checked out.  While I'm on the topic of the mini-fridge, let me just say that it's waaayyyy too stocked with stuff.  If you had gone out to eat and brought some leftovers (like we did), you'd have NO room to put it in the fridge to keep it fresh.  Nevermind the fact that I could've taken some stuff out.  There should've been at least SOME room in the fridge for stuff not already in there.   Sixth, the internet isn't free unless you go to the 33rd floor.  This last one is just an extra complaint to add to the others that made the Sheraton less than an ideal place for me to stay.  I mean, for all that we're paying, we could've gotten more amenities included and better service.  I just didn't have the best time there, so I think the next time I'm in town and need to stay in a hotel, I'm gonna stay somewhere else.",N
1201,"I should preface this review that this hotel is very far from all of the touristy things in Chicago.  While it's not too far from the museum campus, you'll have to cab it, especailly with little ones. The room was very large, bed was SUPER comfy, and had a great view of the lake and Soldiers Field (how cool!!)  Everything was spotless, and service was spot on.",N
2951,The staff was friendly and professional.  I booked mulitple reservations with Wanda the Food & Beverage point person at Shula's and the Riverside Cafe. The concierges were excellent at recommending steak houses and other dinning options in the area.,N
1312,I love the Ritz..  Service is by far second to none. This my 2nd time back and it was we enjoyed relaxing in our comfortable bed after a LONG day shopping with my wife.  (And I mean long)  We enjoy the helpful staff and all around great service.  Our linens were replenished and fresh when we returned to our room. We will be back again next year and can't wait!  A bit pricey but worth it!,N
4115,"Parking is terrible if you self park. Valet service is over $40 a night plus tips. The rooms very confortable but what would you expect from the Hyatt family in the heart of Chicago. You pay high dollars and you will sleep well. I only stay here now when I must, it's too busy to relax like I can at the airport Hyatts. The area is great if you have business downtown, I would rather commute in the summer.",N
4675,"Hotel Felix is a quaint little hotel with very friendly staff. My girlfriends and I had booked a one night stay for our annual girls christmas extravaganza.There was 4 of us and we came with enough crap for about 10 people.When we pulled up the lovely valet man informed us that we could park across the street for a cheaper rate than valet! I thought that was really nice of him. After that 2 bell boys unloaded all our stuff and sent it up to our room where he insisted on unloading everything himself. A long story short we had many a request that night and all were taken care of promptly. The only issue we had the whole time was the lack of a lamp in the room so it was a little dark, other then that it was a great stay!",N
4920,"great location, nice and clean room and the view is also beautiful from this hotel. they got the nice cozy live jazz bar on the weekend and i really enjoyed it!",Y
1663,"Stayed here for a girls weekend because we got a great rate.  Location was very good.  We could walk to most of the Chicago tourist attractions.  The decor is modern and cool.  The rooms are tiny - I'd guess because it's a historic building - and there's no ventilation in the bathroom so everything stays wet all day.  There's also no coffee maker in the room, because they have coffee service in the lobby every morning.  They could use to update the elevator systems.  They're extremely slow and everyone lines up to cram into a car because they'd rather be up against someone else than wait another 10 minutes for the next one to come along.  A plus is the complimentary wine in the lobby every afternoon.  Overall we had a good stay, but I do think the quality doesn't quite live up to the price. Oh, and sign up for Kimpton preferred guest program (free) to access free wifi.",N
5802,"Don't. Just don't. If you're seriously considering this, you have bigger problems than finding a cheap hotel room.",N
1421,"Stayed here courtesy of Hotwire and a $110/night room. I think it was worth it. The front desk and staff were polite. The hotel does seem a little outdated but it was still clean. The room itself was small with a minimal design. The bed was very comfortable. The walls were thin. The location of this hotel is good for tourists, that is if you're a tourist that likes to shop which wasn't really a priority for me. It was about 7-10 minutes from a Loop stop.",N
480,"Positives: close to many attractions, free breakfast and managers reception, very nice staff Negatives: $41/day parking, needs a little TLC Stayed for the long weekend with family. If we had to get somewhere and feed breakfast for the nine of us, would have been time consuming and expensive. You could have cooked to order omelets or buffet style scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, biscuits and gravy. Also had a managers reception with free drinks and snacks. Was nice to unwind after being out in the city all day. Some minor issues with soap rack in shower loose, toilet seat loose etc. I know that it is expensive to park in the city but at least cut something off for staying at the hotel vs. just parking there. Easy walk to shopping, site seeing or dining.",N
4682,This place is amazing. I stayed here for a week and I didnt want to ever leave. I had to go for work and luckily had the freedom to choose my own hotel. I read about this place on the Chicago Visitor website and it got great reviews. I love little boutique hotels and this really exceeded all of my expectations. The beds are the most comfortable thing I have ever slept on in my entire life!! My view was pretty great too. It is walking distance (6 blocks) from Michigan Ave. The lounge is perfect and I spent probably every night here. Every night I would think of going down for just a night cap but ended up staying until they closed. They have quite the intimate setting with the fireplace and the cozy bar corner. The bar tenders are all charming and were a pleasure to be around. Housekeeping even went the extra mile to hang up all of the clothes that I had scattered all over my room after leaving for work and leaven them everywhere as if a tornado had just ripped through lol. I would definitely go back here and will recommend this place to anyone.,N
3541,"We got a great deal through expedia for the Avenue hotel on Huron St. The lobby was sort of cheap looking with rental car office type kiosks to check in. Our check-in process also took a little longer than it should have. However that's where the negativity ends. The lady at the check-in counter was pleasant and gave us a corner one bedroom suite on the 27th floor (which I'm pretty sure wasn't what we had reserved for just $95). The room was great. Leather couch, flat screen TV, i-home and a comfy 'zebra' chair - and that's just the living room area. The bedroom was like any other hotel room except with better decor, a nice view of Michigan ave and the best bed ever. The goose down pillows were heavenly and I think we had the best sleep in years on that bed. It was insanely comfortable and cozy. The bathroom was small but efficient with a nice wide shower head and soft towels. We did not have to call or request anything. Everything was provided. We did not try the sky lounge or their room service so can't comment on that. (I am not one to pay $15 + tax + $3 room service charge + 18% gratuity just so I can eat 2 eggs and toast!) The check out was fast and easy and the concierge kept our bags after we checked out so we could roam the city without dragging a suitcase. A great hotel stay for a great price! Wish I was there in that bed right now...damn!",N
3840,"We were instantaneously greeted the moment we walked in and went up the elevator to get to the hotel reception area, where we met a very friendly Romeo who told us much about the hotel.  I love how environmentally constructed the place is!  The modern decor is warm yet modern.  The interiors makes me feel like I'm at my friend's really nice condo.  The room offers bathrobes and slippers.  They also carry exfoliating body soap.  They have a simple fitness center with very nice machines.  The spa tiles are supposedly made out of glass pop bottles.  It looks gorgeous.  Also, Housekeeping was also really nice.  My friend and I felt like we were on vacation, and I live only 10 minutes away!",N
5809,"This is obviously a place for junkies and hookers, you fucking morons.",Y
2572,"I'll have to start off by saying that my friend knew a person working there, so I may be a little biased. My initial impression of this place was definitely ""where the heck am I going."" It is located in a fairly desolate area in the west loop and we entered in through the back door. Mix the signage on the front and I thought to myself that it should be called ""Victor Motel"" instead... Inside the place exponentially raises the bar on style and has a definite club/lounge feel. The area itself is very open and had a nice feeling of not being crowded even though we packed it in. The crowd itself was about 50+ of people I knew, so I can't comment on that as everyone was friendly. I did have a few complaints. The first was the requirement that we be stamped for free drinks. This forced me to fight my way back through the crowd even though I had already had a couple rounds without being asked to show anything. Also, they stopped the free drink promo 10 mins early, which ticked off alot of people. (myself included) Otherwise, we did end up getting bottle service and it was by far better than I've been treated elsewhere. We were told upfront that it was $200 and the service was great.",N
4456,"Small rooms. My wife and I had a room with two beds and it was still criminally small , AND both beds were less than a footfrom each other. The bathrooms are barely bigger than the laundry closet in my condo. Elevators are slower than Paul Konerko(we were here for Soxfest, hence the slow ballplayer reference), and hotel staff was clueless overall. Overpriced rooms, overpriced parking, overpriced room service, overpriced....well you get the picture. Dont bother. While it's 'pretty"" inside the lobby, it's a dump when you go to your room.",N
4166,"There was trash in the room when we came in...a bunch of paper and bags stuffed behind the chair in the corner.  When we first called down to tell the front desk, we were put on hold for several minutes and had to call back.  Finally did get a hold of someone.  We went for a walk and when we returned, some of the trash had been cleaned up, but there was still paper stuffed behind the chair (even though we had told the front desk that that was where the trash was).   On top of this, the room we were given was the ADA-compliant room, which we were told was our only option if we wanted a king bed.  It was very clear that this hotel 'phoned-in' conversion of this room for ADA-compliance; many of the fixtures were poorly converted or useless, regardless of one's ability status.   For example, the bathroom sink was incredibly small and shallow.  More the size of a sink in an RV than a full bathroom.   Instead of installing ADA-compliant towel racks, there were simply no towels in the bathroom.  It really was unpleasant to step out of the shower and realize that you have to walk out into the bedroom and into the closet to get a bath towel.   Annoyingly, the room's security latch was installed at the same height as the main light switch.  When the latch was unlocked, it covered the light switch.  The was very frustrating when coming into a dark room for the evening and having to fumble behind the latch to get to the switch. The overall ambiance of the hotel lobby felt more like a mall food court than a relaxing hotel.  Parking was shockingly expensive, and increased the cost of our stay by 50%. Only pro:  Good location.",N
4869,"It's just a historic and old building, probably it's not well maintained like others said, but minor renovation was going on. I like old style hotel so that was OK to me. The picket was still going on at the entrance (4/2006) and it's very noisy and annoying. It seems they were in the private property. I think the hotel should have removed them. Also, what bothered me was staff was racists and not helpful at all. That was because I was an Asian? Anyway, there are plenty of other nice, well trained hotel staff out there so don't stay there if you are an Asian descendant.",Y
1575,"The views from this hotel are phenomenal. I took a lot of pics that I want to get blown up now. The hotel is located right in front of the Riverwalk near the water. You can see all the bridges at night it's so beautiful. The room was good. Flat screen TV, nice bathroom and very large windows. I did have trouble with the TV. It seems that it wasn't plugged in properly and we went without it for a day. Who needs TV when you are on a vacation? They don't have a pool so leave your trunks and bathing suit at home. Bring a laptop cause each room has FREE WI-FI.... That is not a typo!",N
4704,"I cannot stress how great the service is at Hotel Felix.  I spent a girls weekend here for my friend's bachelorette party, and the staff was helpful, friendly and very accomodating.  The staff greet you with a smile everytime.  Everything we asked them (extend check out, time, chill champagne bottles, hold our bags, bring more towels, etc) they did without hesitation. The lobby is very relaxing.  I loved the atmosphere right when you walk in the door.  The rooms are a bit tight, but they are very nice and clean.  The beds are very comfortable!  The location is great as well.",N
2545,"Victor Hotel can blow me - that is, if I had the right parts.  Came here with a group of 8 people - celebrating 3 birthdays in one night.  Wanted to find a cool place to hang out and have some cocktails. We get to the door. It's only 10pm.  Not really late considering this is a lounge and the party doesn't get started until after midnight.  The asshole manning the door said ""there is no room for your group in there - it's packed.  BUT - you can get table service in there"" FINE - it was early March - Freezing - ok - so we went in with the table service, only to find that upon entering - the place was empty. The decor is BARE with the exception of their bars being lit up and a few plants.  The space is divided into several sections and like I said - Empty.  The music is so loud - even if you do have table service and squeezed into a small space - you can't hear your friends talk.   This place cheated us  / coerced us into getting table service -  That is just DAMNED bad service.  I do not recommend this place to anyone.",N
5546,"I was really pleasantly surprised by this hotel!  My husband and I live in Chicago, but decided to stay downtown the night we saw Conan O'Briens Tour and chose this place based on price and the fact that we could walk easily to the Chicago Theatre, not expecting much more than a basic room to sleep. It was very well decorated, very modern and comfortable, free wi-fi, a great flat screen tv and a rather large mini fridge.  The front desk was very friendly.  Really enjoyed our stay, and it certainly exceeded our expectations.",N

5260,"Stayed here earlier this month for the 4th long weekend (I'm from Toronto, friends drove from Indiana). I should mention that I'm not one who cares for a super-fancy room. Besides, how much time are you going to spend in it for anything other than sleeping? But there were some big problems. I'll break it down this way:The Good:-free parking-free internet (we had no issues with the connection)-decent central location-the amazing bellhop (?) whose name I cannot remember. He was a sweetheart and super helpfulThe Bad:-old, old building with THE SLOWEST, tiniest elevators, ever-front desk stuff that were, well, not so bright (best example of this is when I had to get the manager to call my credit card company and reverse the room charge after I told them explicitly I wanted to pay cash. This could have very well ruined my entire weekend, not to mention my ability to shop/eat, if the charge hadn't been dropped)-stairwells smelled like piss-puny, old bathrooms with barely enough room to turn around in(sink is actually located outside the bathroom itself)-very noisy in the halls, and in the room above us (elephants?) and little will on the part of hotel staff to do anything about itMaybe some of my beefs are a little circumstantial, but I still don't think it was worth the price I paid. If I return to Chicago I'll be staying somewhere else.",Y
2222,"I stayed one night at this hotel and I really wasn't there that much during that time.  Our room was really small, it had one king size bed and a couch that was big enough to sleep on but the cushions were very hard and not very comfortable.  The view was nice but it's far enough from the lake that even if you have a lake view, there are lots of buildings and construction in the way of the view.  The location is great, right on MI Ave and somewhat in the middle of Water Tower, Navy Pier and State St if you are walking.  The bathroom had 2 different levels of lights and the shower was pretty was nice.  The Crabtree & Evelyn bath products came home with me.",N
4559,"Tiny rooms, an impersonal and rude staff, extremely slow service among other flawed characteristics of this hotel make it almost entirely avoidable. The only plus was that it was two blocks from the office from which I was working when I was traveling to Chicago. This hotel is so massive that one could lose ones way in its cramped and labyrinthine halls that span across three wings. The bathrooms were claustrophobic, the TVs had poor reception and the room service food was less than mediocre, thanks to the average 1-1.5 hour delivery time, I'm sure. Oh, and the air conditioning was so affective that I had to wear a sweatshirt in my room in the middle of the summer. They seem to cater well to their conventions and conferences than individual guests, probably because these conferences/conventions bring in a lot of money, but it is not a legitimate justification for the lack of appropriate attention towards the rest of their clientele. It is the hospitality industry after all, one has to have some basic standards and principles, which this hotel certainly lacks. STAY AWAY if you can help it.",N
68,"i was skeptical staying at this hotel but I thought I should give it a shot... BIG.. no .. HUGE mistake.. the room was ok but the paint at the wall was peeling.. the bathroom has ""curly"" hair.. someone had used the bathroom b4 i checked in and forgot to flush.. I had to inspect the bed for bed bugs ... too expensive and definitely not worth it.. the management was very nice, accomodating and placed a wake up call for me.. nice people .. the place appeared to be nice but turned out to be a disappointment.",N
2510,I love the Chicago Hilton.,N
2449,"The Hilton is one of those Grand Old Ladies that has been preserved with love and attention. I booked with Priceline for $79 (Name Your Own Price) as opposed to paying $225 per night. At $225, I'd be annoyed. At $79, I'm delighted. The staff is marginal. The front desk clerk was mildly snotty. The concierge didn't answer on my first two calls and on the third was less than helpful. Parking is $55 per night valet, and a deal (hahahahaha) for self park at $42. Drive down Wabash or park on Harrison for $19 to to $25 for 24 hours. I CANNOT STAND PARKING IN CHICAGO!!! That said, the room was surprisingly nice. I'm""m a Diamond HHonors member and the snotty desk clerk upgraded us even though she let me know that HHonors benefits did not apply to us lowly Priceline guests. We had an incredible view of the Shedd Aquarium and the Planetarium as well as Lake Michigan. I like the Hilton toiletries - they smell like rosemary. There were plenty of towels and washcloths in the bathroom. The marble sink, tub and floor were nice. The wallpaper seemed dated. The furniture was decent - it looked like a knock off of the original. The bedspread seemed kind of cheap but the pillows, chairs and sheets were decent quality. I was surprised at the OLD television. No flat screens here! The air conditioning system seemed arcacic but - WOW - it did the job.   The windows actually open! The fitness center and pool were state of the art. This is the nicest pool I have seen at a Hilton property and the fitness center is huge. The lobby is a a bit of a maze and finding the reception desk required some navigation. That said, be prepared for a loooooonnnnnnngggg walk to your room. The hotel takes up an entire city block. Add the zigs and zags of and old hotel and, well, you don't have to go to the fitness center to get your exercise.  There are plenty of elevators but be sure to get on the right one.  Some go to the lower floors, some to the upper 'Executive' floors.  BTW my 'upgrade' didn't get me Executive status. Forget dining at the Hilton. Walk 3 blocks to Panera Bread or even 2 blocks to Subway for breakfast. Walk out the backdoor to the Liquor Warehouse for beer, wine or booze. This hotel is a bit too south for many dining options but if you are a walker or don't mind paying to cab it, the location is okay. For under $100 a night, I'd stay here again.",N
2075,The room was clean and large! The bar was lovely! The view was amazing!,N
2550,"You know how you always wanted to wear your hair in an excessive poofadore, or find a reason to try that super intense peacock liquid eye shadow that leaves you looking like a sad mess when you end up crying about your gay best friend who you couldn't turn straight? Well, this is the place for that noise. I went head first into this posh warehouse district club and when I took the dance floor to impersonate the tackiest new wave house moves I could imagine, no one was laughing....BECAUSE THEY TOOK ME SERIOUSLY! In fact, everyone here seems to take themselves seriously...from the $10 valet parking in a completely deserted street parking area, to the bouncer complete with list and velvet ropes, to the $100 Jack Daniel bottles with a price markup simply because you're enjoying it VIP styley. Best bet: show up for one of the million open bar parties they have, get there real early because this place gets crazy packed, and bring dirty friends to deter the smooth walkin' illiterate man action that is bound to come your way.",N
3797,"Let me start by saying that I wish I would have reviewed this place the two times I've been there for drinks before because they would have been 4 star experiences.  But last night was ridiculous!  Inexcusable! It was 7 PM on a Tuesday night.  My friend and I met there after work,. We sat in the comfy chairs like we always do and 2 other people were sitting at the bar. We waited 25 minutes and no one acknowledged our existence. We tried to catch someone's eye.  Servers walked back and forth, the  bartender mindlessly wiped the bar and started into space.   And for the prices they charge I should not have to flag down a waiter and beg him to get me a drink. ""Excuse me, sir? Can you please get me an overpriced drink. Pretty please? I'll be your best friend.""  Um, no way. You should be Johnny on the freakin' spot at an upscale hotel. Especially with a whopping 4 PEOPLE to serve. Not that it matters probably, but my friend and I were dressed appropriately.  Jeans and a cute top.   After 30 min. of waiting.  We walked over to Bijan's across the street.  The waitress remembered me as I used to go there for lunch quite a bit last year.  The drinks, food, and service were fantastic, as always. After I finish this review, I am going to write a STELLAR review for Bijan's.   Dana... you have a lot of making up to do.",N
5453,"This was the hotel where we had our wedding guests and bridal party stay and everyone absolutely loved it!  The rooms are new, clean, and extremely comfortable.  They have great views in any direction.  If you do book a party there try to get the penthouses!  They are out of this world.  Imagine a multilevel suite with a gigantic bathroom on the top floor and an amazing lounge area on the first level.  We stayed in the penthouse the night of the wedding and I have to say it was the best room that I have ever stayed in.  The hotel staff was also top notch!  I really wouldn't recommend anywhere else!",N
5609,"Wow never realized this was right next door and so nice! Stayed here one night a few months ago and enjoyed the stay quite a bit. The room was spacious and clean and we had a lovely view of the river! I really liked this Westin compared to most others! One thing the Westin does is leave their lights very dim - so if you're a bright lights and shiny atmosphere person, this might not turn up so well.",N
2978,"Big impersonal chain hotel, marginal to poor customer service.  Rooms a bit beat up but mattresses and linens have been updated recently.   Everything is ala carte....internet is $13/day, parking is $39 - 50/day, gouge on food and drink.   Location is okay but not great.  kinda halfway btw Michigan Ave and lakeshore Dr.",N
2603,"I seriously had higher expectations of this lounge. I had been hearing the buzz for a couple of years and I was actually VERY excited when I finally had the excuse to go there (by the request of an out of town friend). I have to say, I was pretty disappointed. Another Yelp! review was right on when they said that they want to like the place - I did, too. HOWEVER, there was no line outside when my friend and I arrived and despite how hot we looked (hehe), it was so annoying to have to stand in the cold while the dorks at the door stared at us for a couple of minutes to make it seem FAR more choosey than it actually is or deserves to be. The cover was ridiculous and the drinks were definitely nothing special (no Red Bull). I ran into a friend there who said the place is usually frequented by ""D-Bags and the women who love them."" Very true. I have never seen so many visible panty-lines and faux-ny tails in my life. There was only ONE very attractive boy that, of course, ALL of the VPL's were hovering around (and blocking my view - hehe), so I was pretty bummed. All in all, it was a night to tell stories about, but definitely not a night to make any attempt to experience a second time. Maybe I'm just not as cool as I thought. hehehehehe.",N
3484,"Man oh man.  Where do I start? First of all, I had pre-paid in FULL for a king room.  When we checked in, we were placed in a tiny queen.  I'd understand the change in reservation given the circumstance that I had only placed a reservation to be paid at check-out.  However, if I pay for something in full ahead of time, I expect that reservation to be honored as promised.  The room we were placed in was in front of the service elevator, and there were meaty spiders inside the room all along the window sill (windows were closed, by the way).  At this point I was annoyed.  I called front desk and the agent I spoke to apologized and promised to move us into an available suite for the remainder of our stay the next morning and would also send us breakfast on the house.  He told us to just come down in the morning after we eat and that everything would be taken care of without any extra trouble or cost.  My boyfriend and I figured that we could tolerate our tiny closet full of spiders for a night. We went to bed, figuring that all was well and that things would be rectified in the morning. Wrong. So I go down the next morning, and the agent who ""helped"" me, Kevin, was a total douchenozzle.  I kindly explained what had happened the night prior and he said he couldn't place me in a new room, sneering as he said ""I don't know what you're talking about.""  Mind you, he spoke before even looking up my guest information and checking notes that had been left by the agent previously.  I told him that if there was a problem, I would not mind speaking to his manager.  At which point he snapped ""I AM the manager.""  He then pulled my information up on the screen and said,""Ohhhh I see"" and rolled his eyes at me. Long story short: after more sneering ensued and talking to me like I was stupid, Kevin rudely sent me away and told me to come back ""whenever"" instead of giving us an estimated time when our room would be ready.  THEN he called our room and curtly demanded that we pack our stuff and it would be stowed in storage because he needed our current room NOW.  It was 11 AM and check out was not until noon.  Check in isn't even until 3.  First of all, our reservation was goofed.  Then our alternate room wasn't ready.  And now you're rushing us out of our current room with no where else to go?  Nice. By the time the bellhop arrived at our door, I had decided that I no longer wanted to stay at the hotel and wanted my money back.  I went to the front desk and asked the gentleman helping us, Carlos, if there was another manager I could speak to besides Kevin since the service was terrible.  Carlos then said,""Hmmm...I'm the front desk manager.  I oversee him.""  Interesting.  I ultimately got my money back and will never return to this hotel.  There's a right way and a wrong way to rectify mistakes.  Had Kevin been apologetic, truthful, and courteous from the get-go, there would have been no problem.  I work in customer service also and I understand that mistakes happen.  However, I did not pay good money to be given sub-par service and a terrible attitude when I can get treated like sh*t for free on the street.  I left a voicemail for the general manager, who was not in office that day.  The director of operations did follow up with me, and I appreciated his efforts in earnest.  He apologized, stated that the service given by Kevin was not the kind of service the Allerton strives to provide, and offered to take care of any future accomodations the next time I plan on being in town.  I kindly declined, stating that my experience was colored in a really negative way.  Unfortunately, a bad apple did spoil the bunch and I would rather spend my money elsewhere.   Not to mention that you can find a much nicer, roomier hotel with much more pleasant staff in the city for less money.   Do not stay at the Allerton unless you WANT to have a bad night.",N
185,"This hotel is in a great location near Lake Michigan. shopping and restaurants. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and clean. Taxi cabs are very accessible at this location. I had a great stay and looking forward to a return trip.",N
290,"For the price, this place gets five stars! I was blown away by the quality of this hotel and would easily stay here again. PROS -The size of the room was enormous. Giant queen bed, great desk (fantastic, because I had a ton of work to do), enormous closet, bathroom, fully stocked kitchenette with stove, sink, dishes, pans, even a colander, fridge and freezer. Where else can you find that? -The bathtub had a whirlpool!!!! There was also a hairdryer and working heater in the bathroom. I experienced no problems with having tons of hot water for baths and showers. -Two free continental breakfasts. They weren't amazing, but they weren't Costco danishes either. Ham, two eggs, toast, hash browns and coffee. -FREE WIRELESS! And the wireless customer service was great. -Fantastic service all around. They helped me when I lost my key card, remembered me when I came back in and opened the security door for me without my having to swipe my card, gave me a wine bottle opener, let me chill in the lobby, use the internet and do work for two hours after my checkout and were just very helpful and polite. -Quiet room. I had to record several interviews out of my room and each time the audio came out great. CONS -The shampoo and conditioner wasn't great (but then again, is it ever?) A light burned out and so the room wasn't well lit (but I didn't call down to notify them, which is just my laziness.) I also can't judge how good the gym or sundeck were because I was too busy the whole time.",N
1038,"My husband and I read the reviews before we arrived and so our expectations were high to start with... and yet.... the hotel and the super friendly staff completely surpassed our expectations.  The hotel is sleek and stylishly designed and you cannot get a more helpful and friendly staff than they have.  Aside from the free Wi-Fi, their business center has 4 computers (one of them is a Mac) and a printer and they don't nickle and dime you.  The breakfast is good but their complimentary happy hour at their lounge totally blow your socks off -- full bar, they have signature cocktails and real food like antipasta buffet.  We definitely will stay there next time we are in town.",N
1212,"Overall, my experience here was decent - the hotel room was pretty spacious and since it was comped - not too sure on the price of it.  It also has massive underground conference facilities that can cope well with 5,000 people. Yes, it is connected to an underground shopping mall so you don''t really need to leave the building at all. Unfortunately the whole complex is massively confusing and I got lost a handful of times. edit: I just attended a beautiful wedding ceremony and reception here - the catering was done really well and the entire setup of an ethnic wedding went very well.",N
481,"Stayed at this hotel at the end of the year to check out the fireworks at the Navy Pier. The hotel valet enterance is easily missed (on a one way street), but made it in the 2nd loop. Also the valet area is very crowded with people checking in and out, as well as cabbies. We waited for a few minutes before we could pull in. (Our car blocked the drive during check out, but we were prepared to load up and go. So only about a 3 minute hold up...) Upon checking in, the car was moved safely into a heated garage space by the valet (yes we snuck out and checked later). The hotel registration is up the elevators to the right. After we cheked in, we went up to our floor, and was welcomed by a grand view (see posted picures to see what I am talking about.) Already mentioned in a lot of other reviews, but... 1) Cooked-To-Order Breakfast (6:30am - 9:00am) is basically a tailored omlette your choices of spinach, chedder cheese, ham, bacon, jalapenos, peppers, onions, sausage, mushrooms and tomatoes. I just went for everything! 2) Managers reception (from 5:30 till 7:30pm) is basically free drinks and appetizers (chips and fries). A nice perk. 3) The room has a bedroom with either two full or one king (we stayed at the one king room suite) and a door that separates into the living room with a pull out sofa bed. (I heard that it was on the stiff side, but hey I didn't have to sleep in it.) 4) Pool, gym and sauna (6:00am till midnight) are available for people who want to work out. I went for couple laps at the pool, and used the sauna. Very refreshing in the morning. 5) Walking distance to main shopping area of town (i.e. Michigan Ave.). 6) Navy pier is two blocks from this place. A great place for a family visit Definitely a great family hotel, and if the rates meet my budget, definitely will stay again.",N
5270,"One of the first hotel I ever stayed at in Chicago.....many many many  years ago, smaller room than I had expected, but clean.  I would definately go back again.......",Y
1103,"I stayed here for four nights this fall for work. Hands down the best thing about my room were its size and the fact I could see the sun rising over Lake Michigan between the buildings every morning. The location was convenient, the king sized bed comfy, and all the finishes ultra plush. The bathroom featured a shower stall AND a tub. And the toilet was in its own closet. The TV was huge. one strange thing - i could hear EVERY time my neighbor showered or flushed the toilet. Very weird. And annoying. The lobby is ginourmous, with a small bar in the center with a nice selection of wines. I did like the revolving door that activated when you approached it. So yeah, the hotel is nice. But over the weekend, when I was footing the bill, I moved across the river to the Courtyard Marriott on E Hubbard street. The location was equally convenient, though we did have to walk 2 more blocks to Millenium Park. The rooms were smaller, the finishes less nice, but the service was superior. Everyone was so nice! The security guard got me ice when he was passing me in the hall and noticed the ice maker wasn't working for me. And they had a pool/jaccuzzi complimentary to guests, AND I didn't have to pay $14.95 for internet. BTW, the $14.95 for internet is for a 24 hour period that starts at midnight and goes until the next midnight. If you, for example, went out to a work dinner as soon as you got in and then wanted to check your email when you got back to the room at 11 PM, you'd pay $14.95 for the one hour until midnight, and then have to pay for it again at midnight. Apparently the internet is complimentary for gold club special people, which I was not one of. Either way, it was spotty, which is annoying especially if you're paying for it. Next time I visit Chicago, I'll probably stay elsewhere. Unless you're a rich person who doesn't mind being nickel and dimed, or you're here for work on a conference, I'd recommend you do the same.",N
207,"Overall clean, great price, and location.  Great views from the workout areas and swimming pool.  Very nice having a separate living room.  However the parking is crazy for $52/day (park in one of the nearby garages for $26-33 instead) and the hot tub needs cleaning/renovation - lots of black grout.  The drop-off area is very congested with taxis.",N
787,"I really liked this hotel until they messed up my reservation and I was looked out of my room.   I was there for a conference and paid the conference room rate, but I extended one extra day, and had to pay a different rate.  I discussed this with the staff at the front desk when I checked in and they said it would not be a problem. Unfortunately, it was a problem.  I got locked out of my room the last day of the conference, and to top it all off, I left my ID in the room.  I had to wait one whole hour for security to come by and open the door for me.  Then I had to run back down to the front desk and wait another thirty minutes in line to take care of my room cards. I was all set to go out for a night on the town before leaving, and it was interrupted by a problem that should have not happened. Other than that, I really liked the hotel, the staff, exercise facilities, and especially the location.",N
4990,"I stayed here while in Chicago for a business trip and would not do so again.  The rooms are extremely tiny, there is no air conditioner or heater and the walls are paper thin.  The bathroom was filthy and the shower didn't work properly so maintenance had to fix it every day.  Keep in mind when booking there is also no bar or room service so if you want to unwind after a long day, you can't do it here. I also did not have maid service every day, and not by choice.   This place was also way overpriced.",Y
1715,"If you are youngish and want to have a little fun, DO NOT STAY HERE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!  I knew it was trendy and seemed like a cool place, so I didn't eat for weeks to be able to afford one of their stupid $400 suites so I could throw a small after-party on new years eve.  But when we checked in, they gave us a little list of absurd rules, the two most absurd being (1) no outside food or drink, and (2) only registered guests after midnight would be allowed - ID would be checked at the door!  We managed to sneak in food alcohol and people anyway, but that involved quite a bit of effort and additional debauchery, and it wouldn't necessarily work again.  They kept blaming the ridiculous rules on ""security"" and ""fire hazard"" but no other hotel in the city was so strangely paternalistic.   Also, I ate $9 worth of food from the minibar, but they charged me $20!  When I called about it, they just asked what I ate and said, OK, we'll change it.  It sounds like they just try that and see how often they can get away with it. Another con is the location - it's not really close to anything but the theaters - for the price, you'd be better off staying in a much more central location.   One more con - our suite was supposed to have a ""two-person jacuzzi"" - it was just a bathtub with some extra spray-jet things.  Bogus!  Only two very small children could fit in there comfortably. I will say though that the suites are pretty awesome - they have this crazy rock'n'roll'coke vibe with a big portrait of a guitar and 80s patterned wallpaper.  And two nice flat-screen TVs.  And these trippy animal-print robes.",N
5208,"We recently stayed at your hotel for the Travel Goods Show 2011, in Chicago. I was extremely impressed of your entire hotel staff from the Bell Service to the Front Desk, and Security. Bell Service personnel,Jacob, he was amazing at how quickly he can load up my full size vehicle and unload my many boxes and luggages onto the cart was impressive. Your Front Desk Staff was extremely smart and understanding of our many complicated request. We have many packages deliver to the hotel prior to our arrivals, and they were all there with 1 phone call from the Front Desk, with no missing packages at all. The morning drinks for us as selected guest was more than enough.",Y
1220,"I travel to Chicago frequently for work (sometimes as often as once a month) and I always stay here. The staff is always friendly and I often get upgraded to nicer rooms. The location is prime because I hop on the public bus (stop is right in front of the hotel) and I am downtown in 10-15 minutes for a few bucks without having to pay for a cab. I have stayed here to attend a conference and it was well orchestrated with ample meeting space for the events. During non-conference trips I have enjoyed their great gym and sauna (seriously, quite nice) for some healthy relaxation. The gym is not huge but it is well equipped with everything you need (all top of the line). I haven't checked out the pool yet, but it seems serviceable. Some have complained about non-comfy beds, but mine have always been great. Once or twice I was stuck on a lower floor on the ""bad"" side of the tower, but usually I get a room with sweeping views of downtown Chicago or the lake. Regarding cleanliness -- I have yet to have a single bedbug scare and I have been staying here on and off for two years now. Most rooms are well kept, occasionally you get stuck in one with some old or uncared furniture but usually not. Soundproofing sometimes leaves a bit to be desired and depending on where you are you can hear hallway noise or noise from adjacent rooms, but it usually is nothing overwhelming and typical of what you would find at any hotel. Price-wise, I often get a good deal staying here (usually around $120-145 a night) which I think is great for a place with so many amenities and good service. Room service can be hit or miss, but I do make sure to always order breakfast as it's consistently delicious. You have to pay for internet which sucks but it's not too pricey. Once when I was there, I had a work emergency and needed to print and fax asap. I used their facilities on sight and got everything I needed in a timely way -- the downside was it was pricey -- I think it cost me $50+ to print maybe 10 pages and fax 10 pages. Staff is always courteous and attentive. Plus if you come at the right time you can pick up whatever cute business men are in town for the conference....the orthopedic surgeons tend to be the most fun!",N
1897,"I get the appeal of a trendy boutique hotel, but there are definitely better places to stay downtown and not feel cramped in your room or alienated by the thumping music in the lobby or the staff looking down their nose at you. The bath products are the only ones I've ever sought out after using them in a hotel. Also, this is another place that you pay handomely for a night's stay, and they STILL charge you for internet.  That's like how places used to charge like $2 for long distance calls; It's just tacky.",N
792,"I haven't stayed at this property in a while so it was time for a checkup.   Located at the north end of Michigan Avenue this property is all about location, location, location.  In the shadow of the Hancock center, a stones throw from Watertower Place and abundant, restaurants, nightlife and shopping. The last time I stayed here the management was totally inept and I ripped off a seething letter.  I was happy to be informed that the individual, who made my previous stay hell, has been relieved of his duties. Other than a long line at check in this property this property has improved by leaps and bounds. Long line at check in as staff was changing shifts. There is a dedicated Starwood Gold/Platinum line.  The G/P line was unoccupied as I waited in line and opened, alone with another check in, when I was second in line. The lobby and common areas are very clean, bright, well lit and maintained.  In the lobby they have a refreshment center right next to check in line. The room I was assigned comprised of a nice sized bedroom and corner parlor to make up a pretty large suite. The suite was large enough to accommodate several people. Overall First Impression, renovated and on par with the DC and Philly Westin's I've recently visited.  This Westin's Heavenly bed wasn't as firm as I like, but all the accoutrements of the Heavenly Bed was there.  The room is decorated in a casual modern decor and in good condition.  Décor is appropriate for Downtown urban hotel.  The closet was a bit on the tiny side, for a room it's size the closet seemed out of proportion.  The 27"" TV is a disappoint, but I understand that they will be upgraded to 40"" sets soon. There is ample lighting in the room and the room has large windows so there is a ton of natural light.  The workspace desk shares the ice chest and other items and could be a problem for some.  There were extra electric outlets in the room for those with lots of devices.  The room has a nice  view since it is a corner room.  You can see up and down Michigan Avenue.  No iPod docking station and a dated radio.  Starwood has to up it's game in this area. Very long narrow bathroom, but no separate shower.  I found that odd for a bathroom of this size.  While in the bathroom I could vaguely hear people in the hallway.  The bathroom has dual sinks with lots of counter space and great lighting. A heavenly bath but no separate shower. The parlor connected from the bedroom.  Walking out of the bedroom into the parlor there was a nice sized bathroom.  With amenities that matched the bedroom bathroom.   There was a large desk with lots of outlets and a great view looking south on Michigan Avenue.  The room is a nice size and has a sofa, two club chairs and few ottomans.  The is a Murphy bed and a huge closet.  In addition, the parlor has a Bose radio.   The housekeeping staff was adequate. I had the DND sign on the door and was never interrupted.  They replaced all items and toiletries on each night of my stay.  Received turndown service every evening. This Westin features a nice sized Fitness Center with up to date cardio machines & ellipticals, a smaller room with free weights off to the side. There is no pool or club lounge at this property. Free Internet in the lobby, $13 a night in rooms.  Signal was strong throughout the suite and suffered no interruptions. Did not use valet, as there is no car for a car in Chicago.  The hotel is convenient to public transportation, cabs are plenty and always ready right out the front door. FINAL IMPRESSION Overall hotel cleanliness: On par with other Westin properties and cleaner than the W's Staff attitude, conduct & support: Staff has greatly improved, over my last stay.  The staff has had a complete overhaul for the better.  Everyone was prompt and attentive. Location: Great location. Can walk to your office (if on business), restaurants, attractions, parks, and shopping. Would I return? Yes. Would I recommend this as family friendly? No. Good for business travelers? Yes. Good for a romantic get away?  Yes, nice rooms and spa services. Would I recommend for someone looking for Dining/Nightlife? Yes Would I recommend restaurant? NA Value for price paid? Good Overall property rating on a scale from 1 to 5 = 4.5 since there is no pool or lounge.",N
2155,"I enjoyed my stay at the InterContinental, which is where my work chose to host a huge meeting. Pros: - Modern, comfy King bed with 5 large, plush pillows - Decent 2-story fitness center; more extensive than other fitness centers I have been too -Downtown location; perfect for people who want to be blocks away from major shopping and running along the river Cons: - Water problems with my shower- my water would go in and out - It's REALLY big- two different ""towers"" and it can be a little overwhelming for people who just want to have a relaxing stay in Chicago - The ongoing drilling that occur ed during our meeting; completely unprofessional and disturbing (we should have been warned) Overall, it's a decent venue to hold a work event at, however, I would not recommend the InterContinental for a personal stay in Chicago (go to the Affinia!).",N
3115,"OK I am actually reviewing W Hotels in general--to date I've stayed at one in Montreal, New Orleans, Istanbul, and NYC. The rooms are always mod and interesting, the hotels are always done up in a theme that is somehow regional and each hotel has a bar or club that is good for hitting when heading out or coming back. Sometimes the hotel can be ""too mod""--it takes a minute for your eyes to adjust when you walk in the lobby...at the hotel in Istanbul you had to walk in and out of a series of curtains. The last night in Istanbul all the mood lighting in the room malfunctioned and started coming on anf off. And this might just be me..but it usually takes me a minute to figure out the modern light switches and faucets. But the best part is the more you stay with them they will upgrade you and once you do a suite at the W it's very hard to go to other hotels!",N
5816,"I would give it -100 stars if Yelp would let us, but this hotel is absolutely filthy and in need of MAJOR repairs.  We had significant water damage to the bathroom ceiling, gum stuck inside the air conditioner, a front door that wouldn't close all the way, spiders, bugs, and cobwebs inside and out, and brown dirt coming out of the sink and bathtub faucets.  But here's the best part - we made a reservation two months before staying here for a non-smoking room, but we instead were given a room that REEKED of cigarette smoke, with THREE ashtrays in it, in a hallway that REEKED of cigarette smoke.  To our sheer amusement, there was a sign on the room's front door that said, ""non-smoking room.""  What a joke.  Oh, and the maids even rearranged our ashtrays for us upon our first day's maid service.  How thoughtful.  When we complained to the front desk less than 15 minutes after checking in, we were told that the hotel was sold out and there was no possibility of being moved to a REAL non-smoking room.  WTF was the point of making a reservation?!?!?  And then, upon checkout two days later, a different woman at the front desk said, ""oh yeah, that entire hallway is all smoking rooms.""  Gee thanks, might want to change your signage!  Needless to say, we'll be initiating a complaint and a request for full refund with both http://priceline.com and http://ramada.com.  DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!",Y
3867,"Just got back from a few day stay @ the Dana.  Very Modern, chic, and alive.  The music, the staff, the visual of the great North River view from your room.  This Hotel is lovely.  The breakfast at the restaraunt in the morning is five star.   The rooms are intimate, and made for lovers, and singles...Don't go here with your family.....the shower has a window, and is just not right with ma or pa in the room.  The staff is amazing. A special thanks to TJ and the other bellhops who will help you with anything!  The other big positive to this hotel..is location.  seconds away from the magnificent mile, rush st, the rock and roll mcdonalds...and my personal fav ..portillos! HA!",N
3111,"Sure, the W is a little out there sometimes (e.g. see-through mirrors in women's/men's bathrooms), but overall it was a clean room, courteous staff, and convenient location.  What else can you want?",N
33,"Realy small hotel but it's in a great location in downtown chicago. The rooms itself are pretty well maintained. The lobby is fairly nice. Elevators are small, I don't know if that's the theme they are going for, cozy.... The price isn't that expensive considering you are in downtown chicago. A decent room with an okay view ran me up about a little over a hundred a night, though It's all about location location location. I almost never saw the staff other than check in and check out, maybe that's a good thing... I'd come back again if I'm ever in chicago.",N

3121,"On a recent trip to Chicago, I stopped and asked a guy who looked surprisingly like Clark Kent what a fun place to go to was. He said the W and, naturally, we trust Superman. Off we were on our adventure. In the cab, my cohorts and I are throwing out some mojo to the cab driver. He laughs and is in love with us. He says, in a creepy tone, ""You guys like to have fun?"" We reluctantly answer, ""yes."" He pulls over and starts rummaging around. ""Great,"" I think to myself, ""we're gonna get offered coke."" Imagine my surprise when he busts out a card with an address underneath a silhouette of a topless girl. ""This is a great club,"" he says, ""a very PRIVATE and EXOTIC club. You will have fun here."" Uhh... We finally stumble upon the W. We mingle, we talk, we have fun. It's a great looking, very sleek bar. Like out of the Jetson's or something. Upstairs there's another small club. The drinks are weak and expensive (just like the rest of Chicago, what the fuck), but that's what you get at a hotel bar where you have absolutely no juice. Later on in the night, I meet some German dode and he explains, ""jaah, the gurrlz weell bee coming in soon, jaah."" I am a little exasperated, ""Girls?"" ""Jaah, zee gurrls, you pay, kroners."" Great, just great. The W: fun bar, just watch out for hookers!",N
3654,"Beautiful hotel. I went here a while ago and i loved it. I was actually trying to reserve a regular room but i was bumped up to the Princess Diana suite. The suite was amazing. This hotel is not cheap but if you are looking for a place to relax with your spouse, this is the place to come.",N
3958,"I travel quite frequently for business and I have to say this is one of ht eworst hotels I have ever stayed in.  The rumor is Al Capne stayed there and apparetnly they have not renovated it since he was there.  The carpet was stained, the plumbing ran all night & the bed was lumpy and uncomfortable.  The wireless internet did not work.  There was also a really long line to chekc in.  The gym was somewhere in the basement, but I never got to see it because you had to go down some creepy stairs.  I guess that is what you get for $180 a night in Chicago during the week.  On the upside, it is close to Millenium Park & THe Art Institute if you are there for fun.",N
2925,"I was not impressed by this place. the location is decent, but that's about it. It is a hike to get to an el-stop, to transfer on busses would be easier said than done as well. The things that stood out to me were the lobby, which was welcoming though it was a bit dirty for me, and the Chicago Burger Company. Ken M wrote that CBC was disgusting but I think I'm going to have to disagree as my bleu cheese burger was cooked great and the fries were awesome at the time. I would have to visit back for another assessment but from what I've experienced so far, it wouldn't stop me from trying out again. As for the rooms...standard room.",N
646,"My sorority hosted our convention in beautiful summery Chicago and booked all of us here. 200+ women all in one hotel ...yep, a lotta ladies and googly-eyed men. I arrived in the late afternoon to hundreds of sisters as well as another company's convention and regular guests. I thought, ""oh man, this is gonna suck."" I was surprised because check-in was fast and sweet. We got warm cookies with our room keys (yum!) My room on the 25th floor had an amazing view. Our rooms were so clean and well decorated. The bed was very comfortable and made those 15 hours of meetings and walking in heels wash away. We had plenty of towels, which were also replaced everyday and we always came back to a tidy room. I really liked the staff here. Every single person I spoke to was very, very friendly and helpful and never appeared annoyed with us. The gym exceeded my expectations with their up-to-date equipment and clean workout area. The gym is essential to me because grease and fat in those Chicago style pizzas aren't gonna run themselves off my thighs. There's also a nice outdoor pool on the 5th floor. This is a great venue to host events because the rooms we met in were huge and the staff was very accommodating with everything we needed from setup to food. Great location, cheery staff, and clean rooms. All I really ask for. Note: No fridge/microwave and AC doesn't go below 78 degrees. Trade off: there's a bar in the lobby :)",N
3023,"The service at the w is the worst. Checking in no porter or bell man. Checked in at the front desk and told the lady. She said would you like help with your bags. I said absolutely and told her no one was out front to help. Waited. No one shows up. I take them myself. Concierge is totally unhelpful and completely overwhelmed. The front desk, they live here but don't know where anything is. I just travel advisor it or google map it. Unreal. The wave restaurant is opposite. Food is delicious and service is excellent!!! Checking out, waited 25 minutes for luggage assistance and guess what no one shows up and again I take it downstairs myself. I tell the front desk again. They say they'll send someone up and again I bring the luggage down myself. Worst service in this hotel.",N
1864,"Maybe Im just not a W person. I arrived at about 11pm since my flight was delayed, and when I entered the hotel, I thought I must have come through the wrong door, seeing only couches and people sipping trendy martinis. I walked back outside and asked the bellman where the main entrance was, and he informed me that the ""lounge"" in front of me was actually the main lobby, and that the front desk is back in the corner (FACT: if a front desk is back in a corner....its not a front desk!) Anyways, we navigated out way (with our suitcases) through a maze of couches and cosmo-sippers to the ""corner desk"" and finally made it to our room. I guess I'm just an old fart, but I thought it was a little too trendy. Like, why do I need lights eminating from under the bed? And why do I need inspirational phrases on the pillows & walls? Just give me a comfortable bed and a clean bathroom. Bathroom was TINY, and the toilet was wedged between the sink and the wall with very little room to sit comfortably while you do your business. Also, can someone please tell me WHY hotel TVs are so weird? Why cant you just change the channel without having to press the button 5 times? and why does it go back to the stupid hotel channel that nobody watches every time you turn it off & on again? So frustrating! Minus 1 star! I will say that the service we experienced was good, all the staff we encountered from the desk clerks, to the bellmen, etc were very nice and accomodating. Unfortunately, that wasnt enough to save the hotel. I loved Chicago and will return, but not to this hotel.",N
1554,Hotel 71 is on the river within close proximity to the Miracle Mile and Millennium Park. I liked the modern contemporary style of the hotel and staff are very friendly and helpful. I had a river view room which provided a magnificent view of the river and skyscrapers of downtown Chicago. The room itself was large with an amazing bathroom. The shower had one of those giant shower heads directly overhead. Also the bath is separate which was perfect after a long day at the conference. I ate a couple of time in the cafe and had the Cesar Salad. It was very fresh with full slices of Parmesan cheese over the top. I would recommend staying at Hotel 71 if you are looking for a place in downtown Chicago.,N
466,"My review from http://yelp.com: I don't get to vacation too often. I think the last one I went on was 5 years ago. Earlier this week, I stayed here for my very first grown-up-all-by-myself-vacation. I booked a room for 4 nights two months ahead of time so I could get a really good rate. I only spent $89 a night. I booked through the Embassy Suites Hilton website, not through Orbitz. For a Downtown hotel, I wasn't expecting too much. And I was a bit frightened that it would be a bit gross. Apparently, that was NOT the case here! This is one of the best hotels that I've ever stayed at! I know it's not super-fancy, but it exceeded my expectations! I stayed in a 2-room suite with a flat screen tv in the living area and one more flat screen in the bedroom, a sofa-bed in the living room, Crabtree & Evelyn shampoos and soaps, plentiful towels, 2 additional sinks (one in the bedroom and another near the microwave and fridge), self-fluffing pillows, a very clean bed with clean, soft sheets, free cooked to order breakfast and a free 2-hour evening reception at the hotel bar! The free breakfast and the evening reception isn't over the top, but it's free! I'm so happy they at least offer it! The breakfast was very good; you can choose what kind of eggs you want or get an omelet, and they also sausages, bacon, pancakes, biscuits and gravy, cereal, english muffins, donuts and other baked goods, fresh fruit (melons, bananas), yogurt. They had an awesome selection in case you don't want what they are cooking. I personally thought the omelets were pretty good. And there is a swimming pool, jacuzzi, and sauna. The kitchen staff, bartenders, and housekeeping staff were all very nice and they made sure I was taken care of. Seriously, who could ask for more?!?!?! There is only 1 downside, wifi isn't free. It's $14.95 a day. It is free if you are an HH member. But it is worth it if you pay in advance for a lower room rate. I would definitely come back again and again for a quiet weekend. Or maybe a week. I love that Fox & Obel is around the corner too in case you want gourmet eats without spending too much $$$. But that's for another review....",N
429,"I'm out of northern Ca along with a couple of other friends visiting a friend being a former Stocktonian and chosed this place based on the reviews on http://hotels.com and various other sites.. I would give this place a 4-5 star review, if they had their internet working AND that they do not have any technical restrictions using a wired/wireless router based on the MAC address of the device (mainly linksys and netgear, and tried all the tricks such as cloning the Mac address or spoofing it or forcing the router to act as a bridge), and that their staff (or this one tall clerk) was helpful and committing. Unfortunately it wasn't in this case. I'm just pissed that I brought a router for nothing as I'm finding out later that this hotels ISP have restrictions against bringing your own router and sharing the hardline with other computers, and that you can only go wired thru the hardwire connection. So we were going to connect thru the hardwire by plugging and unplugging the ridiculously hard to connect ethernet cable, then all of a sudden it went down too. But still I wanted to use the wireless linkys off the hardwire to use my iPhone 4s facetime capability to FaceTime with my family thru my dads iPhone 4 while out of state.... but didn't.. However, several other desk clerks told me the internet was through ATT, so I think they need to end their relationship with ATT and get another high speed ISP that will not go down, no matter how many tenants and what holiday. However, we can use their ""conference"" rooms internet wire connection. We'd have to have someone unlock it every now and then. OR there's the business center with 3 computers and its only those computers you can use and not plug in your own, but 1 out of 3 terminals As far as the room (double double queen), it's good enough for our stay. Had cable TV (no premium HBO or anything) and a nice small type of dining area with a loveseat and two chairs, and a small round table.. Bathroom was in good order, and had a 5th floor room with a good view. A couple of desk lamps have an outlet so you can plug in small things to charge like your phone or mp3 player. Speaking of outlets, there's probably more than enough and wasted some luggage space bringing my own power strip. An ironing board, dryer, and iron were all provided and all worked. Everything was clean, and no wrinkles or loose rolls in the rug, housekeeping does come by once in a while, though it's a Vietnamese lady so you're just going to have to point what you want or just say no thank you waving your hand shaking your head. Downstairs there's restaurants and a bar area. The bar area is fine, though we mainly went out to eat than going to the restaurants downstairs. This place is near walking distance of the CTA (red line, cermak/Chinatown). Anyhow, all I can say is don't rely on an internet connection at all if you decide to come here. Just stick with mobile web browsing on your smartphone using your 3/4g network or tether it to your laptop, use a 3/4PCI laptop card, etc. That's this hotels main concern. And we're probably not going to visit Chicago, IL for a while or never. I give this a three, at least its not run down hard like the Chicago Ohare Garden (which we mainly chose at first due to cheap pricing, but the reviews and content we passed; we took a brief tour on our last day, but didn't stay)",N

200,"great hotel, really enjoyed the stay. we exhibited here also, and the concierge was so nice - i needed a vase or fish bowl or something for our drawing, and the lady found me a flower vase from some one's desk, and cleaned it out and let me use it! i mean that is nice! also the restaurant here in the lobby is decent, even though we ate pizza the WHOLE time we were there. bell hops were great and very nice, remembered me and my co-worker the whole weekend and helped with suggestions of places to eat, shop, etc. the room and bed was great also.  they are exactly as pictured.",N
4548,"The main lobby is beautiful and like a museum. It is a must see for anyone who appreciates architecture. I've eaten at Lockwood and the food was OK but not great and never stayed in the rooms. However, I highly recommend a drink in the main lobby bar. They don't make 'em like this anymore.",N
1744,"The 5-6pm free wine happy hour is getting to be the standard at hotels the world wide.  Hotel Allegro has a gorgeous multi-room lobby space where they offer their version of happy hour and it's definitely what stood out most about my stay.  There's a Wii, which is a great conversation starter and a fun idea in general. After checking in and seeing the lobby I was a bit disappointed by the room.  The decor was nice, but the room was quite small and unfortunately the view, even from the 18th floor, was an eyesore.  But I've come to learn that's pretty much par for the course in Chicago.  Otherwise, the snack bar offered some healthy, organic treats and the toiletries weren't tested on animals which is important to me. The gym is impressive for a hotel and I was able to get a decent workout.  I didn't eat in the attached restaurants in part because the breakfast was outrageously expensive.  A coupon for dinner is provided for the attached restaurant, but I didn't have an opportunity to eat there.  The menu looked decent. I would stay here again and recommend it for sure.  I found a great deal on http://hotels.com, it's in a great location near an L stop and the shopping district on State Street, and I looked forward to coming back to Allegro after work each day.  The only qualm I have is the surcharge to use the internet.  In this day in age, most travelers bring their laptops everywhere they go and it's a common courtesy for any hotel to provide free internet access.",N
5067,"My first trip to Chicago and I wanted a boutique hotel.  I wasn't disappointed what so ever.  I stayed in the apt king suite and was impressed with the cleanliness and when I wanted a DVD to watch a movie they came and hooked it up.  I booked on-line and had listed my preferences such as high room level, extra pillows and all those were taken care of upon my arrival.  Friendly staff!  The location is perfect as Trader Joe's and Starbucks are across the street.  There is a steakhouse a block up, and magnificent mile is two blocks away.  There is a grocery store a couple of clocks away as well.  I tried two other hotels and nothing compares to the James which is why I am returning in two weeks...love this hotel!",Y
1877,"A lot of W hotels seem to be old Sheratons remodeled into a W hotel skin.  This W definitely felt like that - especially when you went upstairs with the low ceiling hallways and tiny rooms.  The overall decor, furnishings, and look of the hotel was probably a 3 - it wasn't the most creative W hotel lobby I've seen or rooms I've been in.   My Wonderful room was tinyyyy - if I sat at the desk to do work, I couldn't scoot my chair out all the way without hitting the bed - Anyone larger than me probably would have had trouble getting into the seat to begin with and I'm a 5 foot 2 small asian girl.  The bathroom was also very tiny with a very tiny sink.  It was pretty much impossible to wash my face in the sink without splashing water all over the tiny counter. That being said, for the week that I spent here I definitely started feeling at home and none of the above mattered to me.  The W hotel bed is HEAVENLY.  The room was well appointed and everything was placed in an space efficient way and I had enough room to function comfortably.  Flat screen TV and cable available.  Pretty fast wireless internet (it came free with my room - not sure if it applies to everyone), and I had a radio in my room so I was jammin out to music most of the time I was in the room.  I was having an awesome time in my room. What put the icing on the cake for this hotel was that the service was AMAZING.  Like possibly one of the best staff I've ever encountered at a hotel in my life.  And not the white glove butler type service you get at the Four Seasons where they HAVE to be at your beck and call, but everyone I encountered was sooo genuinely friendly - from the security guard who let me back into my room when I locked myself out of my room with no shoes on at 2 am, the concierge and the front desk, the cleaning ladies actually remembered my name, what room I was in, gave me extra bliss products.  I called down once for a toothbrush and they came instantaneously fast.  The guy who brought me room service was also extremely extremely cheerful and nice.  Every interaction with a staff here literally wowed me and left me with a smile on my face.   Now for some objective notes: Location is awesome.... if you're in Chicago for work.  It's in the heart of the financial district and within walking distance of most large companies as well as near two L train stops.  That being said.... everything in Chicago's financial district (food-wise) shuts down at like 8 pm.. no joke and the streets in general were pretty deserted.  So.. because I work insane hours, room service was my best friend. Room service... argh.. despite their service being so amazing.. as can be expected from a hotel, it takes like 30 to 45 mins for them to bring you food - Comes on time though if you order breakfast.",N
5487,"I'm not the type to stay in nice hotels. In fact Motel 6 will generally suffice; after all vacationing isn't for sleep. However, having been here for only 2 days I can already see why this place is as expensive as it lists. With a Internet ready business center, gym and a very attentive staff, you'd think you didn't need anything else. Well they have a swanky bar attached for some good night life.  I was thoroughly impressed with the entire stay and would recommend this to anyone in the Chicago area.",N
2044,This place did exceed my expectations. Good location. Its a huge and upscale hotel yet affordable. Its much more impressive than other Holiday Inns and added perk of lots of shops in the same building. Well-dressed people everywhere. The skyscraper city aerial view is indeed breathtaking! The food in the hotel is also impressive and has a good organic selection.,N
1581,"I would very highly recommend weddings at Hotel 71.  Rebecca will handle everything.  We had an unbelievable amount of people tell us it was the best wedding food they'd ever had.  The views are amazing.  The room is smaller so it has a less capacity than most places but if you're having a wedding of 100 people or so, it is the best venue in the city.  I could not be happier with how our wedding turned out and the service was wonderful.",N
4703,"Once again I have to ask if the more negative reviews are really about this hotel.  Or have people confused Hotel Felix with Hotel Fleabag down a little further on Clark?  I honestly cannot say anything negative about this hotel, except that the noise from the late night rowdies on Clark Street made it all the way up to my eighth floor room.  The hotel has little control over that.  The hotel is eco-friendly, so there are all kinds of nice touches (a small recycling container in the bathroom, eco-friendly bath products, and so on).  In keeping with this motif, the hotel decor is simple and elegant with muted eath colors throughout--my room was one of the more restful looking rooms I've ever stayed in.  Everyone on the staff from the doormen to the desk clerk to the maids was friendly and helpful, and this friendliness seems to influence even the guests: everyone with whom I shared elevators and hallways was pleasant and chatty.  Yes, most rooms are smaller than usual, and the closet is very very tiny--so if you're looking for wide open spaces, move to Utah (as the song goes).  Otherwise, Hotel Felix is a very pleasant way to enjoy a weekend in the city.  And of course Hotel Felix is home to the wonderful restaurant,  Elate--but that's another review . . . . . .",N
3428,"Not a big fan. We got it for a decent rate on New Year's Eve ($179), but in comparison to some of the other deals we could have got, it doesn't seem like that great of a deal.  (Hindsight is 20/20.)  We obviously were paying more for the location than anything else. It's clean and in a great location.  However, my biggest beef lies in their customer service.  We checked in around 3pm with another couple, and got our keys.  I then heard the other clerk asking my friends if they minded a full size bed, which they of course did.  When I checked with the clerk who had already checked us in, I discovered that the room also contained a full size bed.  Since I had paid for a queen size on http://hotels.com, I was miffed that they tried to sneak a full size bed on us.  And who has full sized beds anymore? We were told that we'd have to wait till around 5pm, along with many other people, to get a room with a queen sized bed because they were ""fully committed"".  I'm normally very easy going, but come on - it's New years eve and we've got plans.  So now instead of getting to workout and nap before our dinner resos, we're hurrying. The rooms are tiny and the doors are thin.  We got back around 3am, and our next door neighbors kept throwing things at our door all night.   All in all, I'd only stay here again if I got a great rate, as you can find better deals at better hotels in the area.",N
862,"The Crowne Plaza Silversmith is a classy hotel in the Loop, across from the Jewelers Row area. The comfortable interiors are reminiscent of the Prairie Style of architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Its main facade does face the ""L"" tracks, so you may get a good view but also an earful in the evening. Ada's is a decent downtown deli.",N
364,"We were seeing a concert at the Auditorium Theater which right across the street.  We paid roughly about 90 bucks for this room for one night, and we were very dissapointed.  The pictures are very misleading. I read some of the previous reviews about being 'harsh' and 'you get what you paid for' etc...That's understandable with cosmetic issues and outdated upholstry and stuff.  But this was no excuse why our TV had one blurry channel, our toilet was leaking the whole time so there was constantly a trail of water, both lights above both beds did not work (yes they were plugged in), our couch was covered in stains and hair, and our view was of a hideous run down building that looked like a murder scene out of 'Saw'.  Oh and the beds--oh my God, those BEDS! SOOO uncomfortable!!  I woke up feeling like I got beat up from the rock hard mattress, the pillows were about as comfortable as sleeping on a balled up paper towel (and are unusually small for hotel pillows, they looked like decorative throw pillows), and you may as well slept on the floor, it would have felt the same, but you would have had more room to stretch out.  The beds are clearly not made for couples. It's an old building, we get it, but some of these things were unexcuseable.  The whole hotel needs a serious facelift, and TV's that aren't from 1987 and still need to have the antennas adjusted to get a semi-clear channel.",N
1290,"Great customer service always wins my loyalty. I found my stay at the Ritz-Carlton (technically a Four Seasons hotel) consistent with other Four Seasons experiences. Mostly the Austin Four Seasons, since I haven't stayed at tons of these hotels. From now on, any time I can afford it, this hotel brand is my number one pick. We were traveling to Chicago with a little one in tow, so a child friendly hotel was our number one priority. We arrived a few hours before it was time us to check-in, so the staff checked our bags for us, and we were able to go out to lunch and explore the city. Upon check-in, the reception gave our little nugget a stuffed dog to play with. When we got into our room (the lake view is great!) our bags arrived minutes later, then they brought us a crib complete with a care package of diapers, wipes, baby wash, etc. The location was perfect, and when the downpour hit on our first morning, we were able to relax with an amazing breakfast  at Deca and make our way to the stores attached to the lobby for some shopping until the sun broke through the clouds.",N
4440,"I wanted to stay in this hotel after hearing about its history and majestic lobby.  And damn, this is a gorgeous hotel!  It was built (actually re-built) in 1925 and definitely has an amazing vintage style.  The lobby is a few stories tall, with frescoed ceilings and lovely lighting.  They've added a modern touch with a bar/restaurant and hip music playing everywhere.   The rooms have an overstuffed antique style.  They're more ornate than the usual Hilton room, fairly small but decently appointed.  My windows overlooked a courtyard and more buildings, so no grand Chicago skyline view.  But everything was quiet!  My bathroom was very pretty but the lighting was so low, it was impossible to put on makeup or really see much beyond the basics.   Internet access was expensive and only available through a wired connection.  I opted to use my cellphone for internet instead.  It really annoys me when hotels treat internet access as a luxury, not an amenity - the cheap hotels all offer free wifi, and these pricey hotels charge you $15 per day to plug your computer into the wall like it's 1997.   I found the front desk staff a little patronizing and brisk, but the bell desk and its staff were fantastic about checking luggage and calling cabs.  I'm glad I stayed here for a night, and I might grab a drink in the bar the next time I'm in Chicago, but otherwise I'll pass on staying here again.",N
1701,"I loved this hotel- it was worthy of dancin on the bed once I plugged my ipod into the docking station/alarm clock. I gotta get me one of those! Upon arrival, my first impressions were of the good location, only a few blocks from the river and Millennium Park. Next, the lobby was decorated very chic and modern. The complimentary wine happy hour in the early evening was perfect. We took a few glasses up to our room after checking in with no problems and were pleasantly surprised with the hip decor of the rooms. The bed looked super cozy and proved later to be just that. The room and bathroom were a little on the smallish side but normal for Chicago standards. The concierge later recommended a great pizzeria for dinner and printed out a map for us to give the cab driver. He also suggested a few tourist things for us to do and reserved tickets for us on the Architectural Boat Tour. Very helpful! Be forewarned, the movies are expensive to rent and watch on the big screen LCD TVs in the room. That's my only complaint!",N
2664,"I booked this hotel through Hotwire. This is my very first boutique hotel and quite honestly I don't know what to expect since I usually book hotels that are more well known or is part of a big hotel chain company.   Stayed only overnight but all I can say is.. WOWZERS. The James Hotel doesn't look that enticing from the outside; The hotel lobby isn't even that big or expensive looking..but don't let that fool you because what makes this hotel top notch is the quality of their service. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were instantly greeted by 2 staff. We came a bit early (about 9:20 am) hoping that we can leave some of our items since we had to go to Wrigley field to watch a game around 1pm. We didnt checked in yet but they accomodated our needs without any problems. While watching  batting practice, I received a call ( around 11-12pm) from one of their staff letting us know that our room is ready. (Checked in time is at 2:00 pm) So nice of them to contact us even if its not necessary, very caring and professional indeed. We got a double bed room. Love the sleek-ness and simplicity of the room, very modern and clean looking. The bed is just heaven... one of the best hotel beds ever. LOVE the bathroom products.. Kiehls products? YES PLEASE! Very lavish! Love the grapefruit lotion.. I don't usually hoard hotel items but I am this time! We also got 2 bathrobes with slippers.. not every big time hotels offer this, not even 5 star hotels will have this ready for you unless you asked for it. That night, my sister and I wanted to go out to eat but the weather didnt want to cooperate with us anymore, so we have no choice but to stay at the hotel and just try room service. I've had several room service at 5 star hotels but I got to say, this is possibly the best one I've ever had no joke. The food is absolutely delicious! Food is served from David Burke's Primehouse. I got a Classic filet mignon with mushrooms and basil whipped potatos... sooo freakin good. I forgot what my sister got but all I can remember is that her asiago truffled fries is ridiculous! I never thought room service dining would be this good. I wished our food came with a rolling tray instead, but I can't complain much about it. After our dinner someone knocked on our door and saw it was one of the housekeeping ladies. She was probably there for a turn down service but nonetheless, she still gave us cookies! Yay! :D Another thing that I absolutely like about this hotel, and this may not be matter for most people, is that the check-out time is around 2 p.m. YES, same time as check in and out.. FINALLY a hotel that have you stay for a full 24 hours! I just don't like hotels tryna get rid of you by 12 noon.. seriously.. I'm not a morning person, so that was an issue for me lol. One downside to this hotel though and I hate to say it is that the view is just horrible. We have a view of a old building with a scary looking dark alley on street view, feel like zombies are going to come out at night or something. Other than that everything is faboulous! I would love to go back here again, very pleased that I got this hotel!",N
308,"The location is great as it's just a skip downstairs to grab some grub at Ann Sathers & it's in the middle of a fun shopping area.  Also close to the eL, which is sweet. The rooms, while clean, are rather small, though ... it was hard to manuever my parents, brother, & myself, so the kid stayed with me instead. Pricy for the room size, about right for the location.",N
3969,"After all the negative aspects and experiences that I heard about the Congress prior to my stay, I have to admit that it exceeded expectations. Sadly, that's not saying much. The room itself was fine - nothing spectacular, I had no issues with plumbing and a lovely view of the lake. The carpeting and tiles obviously have not been update in quite some time, so it almost has the look of a motel. The room was probably the best part of my brief stay. The front-desk service was very rude to me during my check in. The former employees that are still on strike make for an awkward entrance into the hotel during the afternoon. Not recommended.",N
728,"stayed at the Westin on N. Michigan Avenue during Memorial Day Weekend. First off, we landed in O'Hare and took the subway to the hotel. After switching trains in downtown Chicago and walking 6 blocks we finally arrived at the hotel. There are only two things going for the Westin on Michigan Ave, it's location to shopping and the Westin Heavenly Bed. One of which you could get at another Westin or Starwoods property and the other via taxi. Check in was quick and since I am a ""preferred Starwoods Member"" I was told I was upgraded to a higher floor reserved for ""preferred members"". The room did not appear to be ""preferred"". It was directly behind the service elevators and I could hear the elevators operating all day and night. Luckily I brought ear plugs to wear while sleeping otherwise I would have gotten no sleep. Additionally, the rooms themselves are not quiet. You could hear anyone and everyone in the hallways (and there were lots of unruly screaming children running down the halls too). The room itself was on the smaller side, a king size bed, two night stands, a bureau with TV on top, desk and soft chair with ottoman. My one complaint about the furniture, which I don't usually comment on, was that there were not drawers on the nightstands only doors that opened to the space below. Additionally, there were no drawers in the desk either. The only drawers in the room were the 4 small drawers in the bureau under the TV. The other part of the bureau housed the refrigerator with stocked overpriced items. The bathroom was standard for a hotel room and appeared clean although the housekeeping staff never gave us an extra towel or soap or shampoo. Being a preferred member I also got free Wi-fi access, however, the wi-fi here was pathetic. I had faster service on my 3G phone than the wifi, it was a worthless benefit. A big beef I have with hotels is that the beds are not completely made. After sleeping in the bed once I once again found that the sheets did not reach the bottom of the bed and the mattress and the small mattress pad were exposed. I had to pull off all the sheets and covers so that the staff would correct it. Additionally, the Westin usually gives you extra pillows in the room, this Westin did not, however, housekeeping did provide us with a few extra pillows. Westin offers a workout facility in each of their hotels. I've been to some really nice hotel facilities and some not-so nice ones, this hotel ranks in the middle. They did provide dumbbells but had no cable machine and 4 plate type machines. There were also a couple of aerobic machines (treadmill/ellipticals) but not many. Our room did not have a view either. We overlooked another building across the way. As I stated in the beginning, the Westin Heavenly bed was the only plus to our visit. Would be stay here again? No, while we like Starwood properties, we would try another first. When you pay more money for a Starwood property, you expect higher service and quality. This property did not deliver.",N
93,"I had my wedding here, have had my family stay here on several occasions. Best value. Best Location. Trains to the city are a block a way. (but why would you leave Oak Park?) everything in walking distance... even the motel rooms are MOD, and fab, (recently updated) Restaurants are wonderful too. You will enjoy the locals at Poor Phils, Ask for the beer of the day.  I would totally recommend this hotel for weddings. Easy access, walk around abilty, and top notch everything. John Mahoney from Frasier even came to my reception- well, he was in the bar for the after party!",N
4074,"You can't get a room cheaper than at the Hyatt in Chicago. The location was pretty convenient- pretty much a block away from Michigan Ave. This place is huge. Everyone has conventions here, so it's always packed. It's an older hotel, too, so it feels kind of grungy. There are two buildings. The rooms are fine. It's got what you need and relatively comfortable. The shampoo/conditioner is pretty terrible though- no surprise there. One thing I found really weird was that they have machines for quick check-in/check-out. I thought hotels were supposed to be all about service, so it was strange that they purposely set it up so that we didn't talk to an employee during our entire stay.",N
978,"Stayed with a group for a bachelorette party, and was disappointed.  The hotel is beautiful, the staff was all rather friendly.  The main problem was the room/sleeping situation.   We had booked rooms with 2 queen beds several weeks before, but received an email a few days before our visit stating they were sold out (how that happens I don't know!!) so they ""upgraded"" us to two ""suites"" with a king and a pull out.   First, this meant our party was split up and on different floors.  Second, that meant two of us were stuck on a pull out couch.  :(  I'm not a picky, unreasonable person, but that was the WORST ""bed"" I've ever slept on!  It was sunken in the middle so we literally rolled into each other unless we balanced ourselves on the very edge of the bed.  Then there were the springs poking into our backs ALL night!  Just awful!  For the amount of money we spent I expected to be comfortable!   I would not stay here again after this experience.",N
4231,this is a pretty nice place to stay when u just wanna sleep in and relax. the maid service is great and the complimetary breakfast is aiight. comfy pillows,N
1299,"I haven't stayed at the hotel, but came by for drinks in the lobby recently. I have to say, it is breathtaking.  I absolutely love hotel lobbies, and the Ritz Carlton may be my new favorite. The area is grand, very large with a huge fountain right in the center of the room. Classic moldings, gorgeous floral arrangements (although I am pretty sure the orchids are fake), and picture perfect seating arrangements makes the lobby a great place for a drink, a date or afternoon tea with friends. I had a dirty vodka martini and my friend had the toasted almond martini... both were delicious.  Service was excellent, very attentive :)  I like that. What I love most about this place is that it's not a place to be seen. Just an elegant setting with great ambiance and service. I'll update the review when I stay at the hotel.",N
4462,"The hotel lobby is beautiful, and very historic.  We really enjoyed hanging out here after hours.  The staff is generally helpful.  The location is great, and with the shops and the starbucks just down the elevator on street level, it's very convenient.  Oh, and the bathroom was also very beautiful. However, we found our room to be too small - there was really no space at all to even walk around.  The bed was so soft my husband opted to sleep on the floor one night.  The concierge helped us out a lot, but you can't reach them by phone - it just keeps ringing.  And for some weird reason, the stores cannot give you any change - they are not allowed and you HAVE to ask the hotel staff for change.  Weird.  I think the price is too high considering the cons.",N
4761,"Went here last summer with a group of friends.  We got a great deal on our room rate... $99!!!  Our friend is a travel agent so she hooked us up.The hotel inside is very nice, but the rooms sucked.  They were small and quanit and felt old.  I hope they do some remodeling soon, it needs it.  If you don't mind the old cozy room feel, you will be just fine.Location wise, great spot to Millienium Park and walking distance to most other places.  We went during the taste of chicago and worked out perfect, because it wasn't too far from Grant Park.",Y
4970,"The Allerton hotel is so beautiful, a mixed of contemporary and modern altogether.  The staff was nice and respectful, the rooms are small but it is not that bad as some portrait them to be. The view is beautiful if you get a room overlooking Michigan Avenue. I loved the Hotel, it was next to everything! I am coming back next year and will book the same room again.",Y
1386,"Went to the lobby bar with my cousin last night, around 1amish.  I was dressed up, and she was in her pajamas.  Was unimpressed with the round bar just sitting in the lobby, and very unimpressed with the menu that had $14 drinks.   That is when the very character-y bartender (stout black guy who has a lot to say and I approve) told me that his drinks were certainly worth it, and I'd be buzzed after one.  I have alcoholic genes, so I can drink most men under the table and never catch a buzz, but I digress. The one tasty, fruity martini got me beyond buzzed.  I was drunk.  So this yelp's to you, Mr. Bartender. I am only taking one star away because I still am unimpressed with the vibe.  But the bartender himself, gets 5 stars.  He even flirted with my shy cousin. AS FAR AS THE HOTEL ITSELF: I don't know what to say about it.  There was a swingers ball going on, and that was pretty exciting.  What kind of establishment is this?  Added to my ""hotel bar"" experience, in a cool kind of way.",N
5554,"OK for a few days, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to stay here again.  There are plenty of other hotels nearby.  Cost is certainly less than some others nearby, but I might be willing to pay a little extra for a better experience Highlights -Convenient location -Argo Tea located right downstairs, with an entrance from the hotel.  Plus additional restaurants & coffee shops nearby (Note:  Many of restaurant close early since they mostly cater to the business lunch crowd) -Modern style -Continental breakfast -Free wifi Negatives -I'm certainly not a clean freak by any means, but the room wasn't nearly as clean as I expected. The housekeeping team would stop by at 8:30 to ask if I wanted my room cleaned.  I would say yes, in hopes that it would actually be cleaned, but not so much... Some of the towels were stained which was pretty gross. -Like another person mentioned, the Keurig coffee maker didn't work.  It was covered in dust, so that probably should have been my first inclination that it probably hasn't been working for awhile.",N
4666,"This is a lovely hotel! The location was excellent for walking to destinations. I never had more than a $5 cab ride to anywhere, save the airport. There is a Walgreens across the street for the dental floss you forgot to pack and a whole foods across the other way for room snacks or a quick familiar bite. The roomservice/restaurant Elate was very good. I opted for breakfast in bed one day: french omlet (chervil is my new favorite herb), potatoes, toast, fresh squeezed OJ and coffee. It was about $25 for this luxury, but well worth it! The food was large in porportion, delicious, delivered, and you'd pay the same or more if you went out for breakfast anyways. The room was a bit small, but I wasn't planning on doing pilates or a dance routines in it or anything. The beds were beyond comfortable, and between the free wi-fi and TV programming(They even had HBO), floor to ceiling windows with great views and black-out curtains for those lazy hung-over vacation mornings-- I was more than content. There was a room safe, iron w/board, and hair dryer. I would suggest bringing your own hair dryer if you're a ""hair"" person, a lighter and a fan might dry your hair better than that little sucker did. And they take a ding in my book on the water pressure. It was one of those ""tickle"" showers. I think it's due to the overall  conservation theme of the place. The provided mini products (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, bar soap, body butter)  from the spa were definately thieving worthy-- I took home all the body butter I could get (they replenish them daily, whether you empty them out or not). The staff was nice--front desk people were a little stuffy, bartender was really sweet and made some fine beverages, but the valet/taxi guys were the best. They were all very knowledgeable in regards to what/where/when to do, just about anything you could come up with while in Chicago and are more than happy to get you a ride there or direct you by foot. They were cheerful and friendly every day, even in the rain.",N
1711,"It's been a long arse day of traveling and all you wanna do is get into that hotel room for a minute and decompress. I had originally reserved at Hotel Burnham but due to a snafu on their part, they had to send me over to Hotel Allegro. So, into a cab I go for yet another leg of my journey (it was so close I could have walked easily but I didn't argue when cab fare was shoved in my hand.) I was a little annoyed at the change but all that was gone when I walked into the lobby. Hell-o there, gorgeous! If you've ever stayed in a Kimpton, you can expect business as usual here. Free wine in the evenings, ultra cool, plush, and fashionable digs, the best in technology (iHome, free wireless, HD flat screens), mostly helpful and pleasant staff, and room service orders you regret in the morning. I also really like their pens. They rank up there with Yelpstick as being an all time favorite tschotske. Highlights: - lucked out with a crazy huge room, super clean, very comfortable, and quiet - one bell hop in particular was a ray of sunshine and was supremely helpful with bags and directions - animal print robes for sassy relaxation times (see photo ;) Lowlights: - the other hotel sent over a bottle of wine for their mistake (how'd they know I'm easily placated with alcohol?) and I didn't have the minibar key to access a corkscrew. I called down to have it brought up and it never showed so I eventually had to go down myself. - valet parking is exorbitant (no self park) and other options in the area are nearly as bad. Best to leave the car out of it or plan for paying that much. - front desk staff can be a leeetle bit snooty. I paid $100 (with a lil help from my friend Mr. Shatner) and with taxes it was around $128 for a Friday night stay. I would definitely recommend if you have business in this area of the Loop or just want to stay somewhere with a fair amount of personality and pretty high standards.",N
2411,Thanks to Jenny Z. I got to stay in one of the four rooms she got from her Hilton Diamonds Reward Program and just the fact that they pulled four rooms for her the night or two before the rally makes me like them even more. The room was nice. I thought it was larger than other rooms I've been in but can't say how it compares to other Hilton locations. Also the beds were unbelievably comfortable and the bathroom was huge. They had a well stocked mini bar but the key was hidden from me and I was not allowed in. How well I guess we did have a tub of booze anyway! The hotel staff was very nice and tried to be as accommodating as possible. They were so busy but everyone was very nice and took things in stride. I arrived via cab and as soon as I got out I had four different men wanting to help me with one bag. They opened the doors and directed me to check in all with smiles on their faces and a ton of people with more luggage than I walking around everywhere. If I can expect this kind of service at every Hilton I will be a very happy girl!,N
2465,"Stayed here twice, once on business and once while sight-seeing. As others have said, it's a big, older hotel. Big means staff occasionally gets overwhelmed when everyone's arriving at the same time. Older means the rooms have dated (though nice) furniture and decor. Rooms are sizeable by downtown standards. Didn't try the fancy restaurants, but as for the others: The Irish pub was pretty good. The lobby bar was sloooow for table service. The executive lounge was patient with our group of 4 when we stayed there for 2 hours while meeting friends. Breakfast buffet was good and had huge selection but at an eye-watering price of around $30. For the price there are more modern hotels nearby. For similar old school charm I prefer the Palmer House Hilton several blocks north-- it's more conveniently located in the loop 1-2 blocks from all El lines.",N
1899,"I attended their NYE 2009 party and I had a fabulous time.  I really loved the way the hotel looked when you walked in and the fact that its in the middle of the city--a lot different then Naperville!  The decor is very nice and makes you feel good when you walk in.   The rooms were very nicely decorated; however, were kind of small (negative 1 star).  We didn't get a view from our room so that was another downfall.   Also, being NYE, we could totally hear our neighbors until 6 am in the morning partying.   I would def love to come back here for NYE 2010 just because I had so much fun with friends and our neighbors.  BUT, I would not stay here any other time just because the rooms were so small and the walls are thin!",N
2689,"Thinking about having your wedding here? Well, look at the conference schedule for Chicago first before looking into booking this hotel! I really wish I would have done this - I think it would have made our wedding experience at The James so much better My overall impression of The James, after hosting our October wedding (which mind you was on a Sunday) here is that they are out to make money. Conferences obviously bring a larger profit for a hotel than a wedding does. The American Association of Opthamalogy's annual conference was in town over our wedding weekend, and The James did its best to accomodate conference goers with rooms before our out-of-town guests. And they were more concerned with the set-up of their events in the hotel over our wedding weekend than they were with ours. Our rehearsal was dreadful! They wouldn't let us use the room where we were hosting our ceremony/reception for our rehearsal because the conference was hosting a meeting! Obviously a conference meeting is so much more important than someone's wedding day?! We had to hold our rehearsal in this tiny side-room, and it really made the next day stressful and awkward because no one knew where to stand during the ceremony! The wedding coordinator also insisted on showing us how to cut the cake at our reception, so many of our pictures of this moment from our wedding have this person in them. Seriously, we can figure out how to cute our down cake, we didn't need this person micromanaging. They also screwed up my gift to  my parents. I called them and emailed them ahead of time about having them put my parent's hotel rooms for the weekend on our bill, and they couldn't even do this right! They ended up charging my parents instead of me, and to make things worse they charged their wrong credit card and it caused a huge mess with the bank on their end. Seriously, what kind of people do they have working at the front desk? My final rant about The James was how slow communciation was during the entire planning process. They would take weeks to get back to our emails and sometimes we had to stalk them to answer our questions by calling them! And we couldn't book our band until the last minute because they took forever to get back to us regarding our sound equipment questions. The whole experience wasn't all bad though - the James did surprise us by letting us use one of their penthouse rooms for the weekend. It is a gorgeous space! It was really fun for my bridesmaids and I to use this to get ready the morning and it made for great photos! Our guests did love the food and the space - we received nothing but compliments on how great the day was and how much fun they had! I just wish everything wasn't so stressful leading up to the actually wedding!",N
413,"I am staying here while my condo floor is being fixed.  I got a good rate through AAA ($186, not bad for Chicago).  The room is nicely sized, and has a refrigerator and microwave, which is one reason I chose the hotel--makes it much more affordable to stay here the week, I don't have to eat out for every meal (and there is a Jewel across the street and a Trader Joe's a couple of blocks away).  There is free internet access, perfect to feed my yelp addiction.   Business center is open 24 hours, and printing and computers are free.  I came here late last nite after the yelp event, and they let me check in by phone, which definitely scored bonus points.  They have a fitness center (3 treadmills, 3 ellipticals, 2 bikes, free weights, and a multiuse weight machine for lat pulldowns, shoulder work, etc) and offer access to Crunch a couple of doors down.  They also have an indoor pool and hot tub.  Adjacent to Weber Grill, their room service is from there or Buca di Beppo.  Location is right at the red line, in the heart of or accessible to most everything.  Housekeeping was great this morning--I popped over to Trader Joe's for literally 15 minutes at most and they had come in and cleaned while I was gone.  Awesome.  Nutragena shampoo, conditioner, soaps, etc are a nice extra.",N
1731,Beautiful hotel. I walk dogs and have had the pleasure of walking in this hotel The staff is nice.  the rooms are a little small..but i guess if your going to be in a hotel you dont need a HUGE room. But they are Aokay!,N
3135,"Got drunk and could not drive so got into a cab and had the cab driver take me to a hotel that he recommends.  My Gf and I went through a hotel phase where we loved exploring.  I did not think that this guy would take me to a place that would cost me close to $500, but oh well, I enjoyed it very much.  The rooms were quite trendy and the entire ambience was great.  The room amenities were nice and the next morning I got up and went to the spa for a nice little morning.  The only thing I did not like that had nothing to do with the hotel, really, was this drunk idiot thinking he was some type of rapper walking in hammered and proclaiming he spent a lot of money at the clubs...umm, you are not alone, idiot, it's Chicago and everyone spends a quite a few dollars on the weekends.  I recommend this place to anyone.  This is the favorite of my GF and I!",N
2203,"My company hosted a 3-day seminar here so I had a room in the newer wing of the hotel for 4 nights on my boss's dime. The three stars represent my persepective as a paying customer, not as someone with an expense account (I would give them four stars from that perspective). First of all, the staff here are fabulous. My room was spotless every night when I returned to it. The banquet staff who catered our seminar were cheerful and seemed to honestly care that we were getting good service. Food was kept hot and replenished regularly, and the service was seemless. In that respect we were well taken care of. The service itself was definitely 5 stars. I do feel, for this caliber of hotel, that the management nickles and dimes its customers, however. My room was almost three hundred a night, and along with that cost, I had to pay $17.99 for wi-fi access, a bottle of Evian in my room was priced at $7, a 375ml bottle of Clos de Bois in the mini bar was priced at $24 (come on man! this stuff is just two steps up from jug wine), and they wanted $5 for a toothbrush, which most hotels give away for free as a courtesy to harried travelers who forgot theirs. We didn't bring enough power strips for the seminar and was charged $25 per day to use one of thiers. Had I the time, I would have just run to Office Depot to buy one instead of spending $100 of my company's money that could have gone into my bonus check. Lame. The location is very convenient, with lots of stores and restaurants nearby, but the area is a bit to hoity toity for my tastes over the span of 4 days. Michigan Ave. was off the hook last night with the Blackhawks Stanley Cup win - every sports bar in the area was spilling Chi-towners into the streets to hoot and holler about it. Just know you will be in the thick of things here. Also know that the hotel bar is quite popular. I actually could not get a seat at the bar one night, it was so crowded, but I ended up taking a cab to a less-toney part of town to drink anyway and be with my ""people."" Worth staying here if you aren't footing the bill for sure. Maybe a bit much if you are.",N
4939,"My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is located right off of Michigan Avenue, which is really convenient for touring downtown Chicago. During the day we just roamed the city and were within walking distance of everything we needed. The room was extremely clean and spacious. The decor was up-to-date and modern. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. The main problem I had with this hotel was the parking. I know it is Chicago, and that I should expect it, but it was over $50 a day!! Totally outrageous when you're spending a decent amount of money on the room. If we stay here again, we will obviously plan accordingly and find different transportation.",Y
4651,"I bought this deal on Hotwire for $68 plus taxes.  A great deal for what I got.  But  as you can see I didn't pay a lot and didn't get a lot.  So with that said, I was pleased for a quick business trip.  Located reasonably to where I needed to be and comfortable rooms. I was a bit taken aback bit how SMALL the rooms were.  I'm glad that is was only ME in the room.  I did like the free WiFi and TV was very close to face...did I mention that the rooms were small? All-n-all, I'd actually stay here again...",N
5062,"I used to live in the city, now the burbs, but have to stay overnight in the city sometimes for business. I recently stayed in a standard king room at the James, at a rate of $170. Pros: - Great location for shopping and restaurants/food. You're within easy walking distance to the Oak Street area as well as regular Magnificent Mile shopping. Plus a short walk to the river. David Burke is the hotel restaurant, Grahamwich is around the corner, and across the street are Trader Joe's, Starbucks, and a gourmetish deli.- Overall decor is fresh, modern, clean.- Quiet rooms.- Friendly staff- Parking is expensive but if you go north just a couple of blocks on Rush there's $30/day parking (however it is not easy in/out).Cons:- At 3 pm my room wasn't ready and the staff person tried to upsell me another room at a higher rate. On the plus side, they took my number and called me when the room was ready.- The carpet in the room is odd: it has a higher pile than you see in most hotel rooms, and it's brown, so it appears to be dirty and dingy.- The bathroom was small but easy, modern and convenient. Kiehl's soaps and lotions. The bathroom lacked a fan (or else it was so oddly placed that it couldn't be found), which meant that there was a slightly damp or dank smell to the room. Not a huge deal by any means, but something I noticed.- This one is kind of weird but there's a huge, fluorescent light fixture directly above the bed, placed right above where one's head rests on the pillows. I thought this was so strange! It kind of made me paranoid that the fixture would fall on me. Not that it looked loose or anything. Just the placement - right over the head - was a little unnerving. Your own paranoia may vary.Finally, be aware that the hotel is not completely non-smoking; a few of the floors are for smokers. As a non-smoker, I did not detect the smell of smoke anywhere.Of course every hotel has its quirks and overall I'd definitely stay at the James again.",Y
1037,"I stayed here one night with my girlfriend. First, the good: The location is great and the River North area is blowing up so there are good bars and restaurants within walking distance. The bed was really comfy. The breakfast bar was nice. Quiet room. Now the bad: I expected the rooms to be nicer, but they had a spiced up Holiday Inn quality and came across as a bit dingy. The view was awful. The happy hour is nice, but way too crowded and not really worth it unless you're a huge cheapskate (not judging). But all in all, a nice place, especially if you can find a good deal online.",N

5258,"This place is terrible. the front desk people are completely rude and need more experience when dealing with tousirts. The girls checking us in were slow, rude and did not seem to care that people are paying to stay there, which means, we are their business. The room was small and dingy. The workers were terrible and the only that seemed to empathize was a Supervisor. Never again!",Y
1536,"The staff was very pleasant and the location was nice; however our room was very cramped and somewhat awkward.  This could perhaps be because I requested a corner room, but the view was just ok and it was very clausterphobic.  The bathroom was very clean and modern with the stand up shower and rainhead attachment, but it did not overwhelm me.  Don't expect to think you got a great deal with the lower room rate because the cost to valet your car.............$43 dollars/night.  The final complaint is that I am pretty sure I got bed bugs from our bed.  I have what looks like a rash along the upper part of my arm that is driving me crazy.   I do not recommend this hotel at all.",N

Expensive drinks, and you have to wade through a clot of self-important people to get to the bar, but that wouldn't have been a problem if I'd seen the nicely-tattooed waitress earlier. My room was tiny (my traveling partner said his was huge), but super-stylish and comfortable. Nice TV, DVD player included, space-age design to the desk and all the electronics. Cheesy-yet-fun strip of disco lights under-lighting the bed. Cheesy-yet-fun inspirational saying on the wall instead of a generic abstract painting or seascape. Sadly, the walls are so thin that I could clearly hear the movie my neighbor had going -- though he/she probably had it too loud, it wouldn't have been so bad with real insulation. I'm surprised in the refurb they didn't fix that. It took 2 calls to the front desk to get it quiet enough to sleep. You can't beat the in-the-Loop location -- at least not by much. Overall, I'd stay again if the price is right, which it was on this trip.",N
5326,"I loved this hotel, it was very clean and the staff was very kind.  The only thing I would have hoped for was a little firmer mattress.  The mattress we had felt like it was all foam and not memory foam.  It was way too soft.  Other than that the city view out of our room window was unforgettable.",Y
3670,"I went on a Thursday afternoon at 1:00pm. The server was nice enough to take my picture and was friendly. The Palm court was lovely and well The Drake is just one of those classic hotels. However I've done tea at some four/five  star hotels and The Drake failed in meeting up to a high standard that one would expect from an establishment like The Drake. The bread was very dry on all of the sandwiches, the scones were cold, and the cream was lukewarm.",N
1022,"Overview: --Overrated hotel in a premium location. The Great: --Location - walking distance or cheap cab ride to a ton of great restaurants, bars, and sights. The Good: --Inviting lobby, pleasant staff though a few were a bit snobby, in particular the night deskman. --Nice bathroom, comfortable bed and desk chair. The Mediocre: --Room (excluding bathroom) was underwhelming in design. --No kitchen or bar though they have limited room service from Harry Caray's across the street. --Free cocktails 5-7pm in ""lounge"" is right idea with wrong execution; tiny little room packed with people and a line extending out the door. --Hot water (or lack thereof) - almost every morning my shower water temperature would waver between comfortably hot to lukewarm. Pressure is pretty low. --View - mine wasn't great but apparently some of the rooms are horrible. The Bad: --Free wi-fi / ethernet has inconstant speeds and required multiple logins every day, even when my computer wasn't moved - really aggravating. Same deal for my iPhone. I also got numerous vulnerability threat warnings from my Norton Anti-virus that makes me wonder how secure it is. --No blackout curtains! I had a corner room with a huge wrap-around window and awoke to bright sunlight every morning (not to mention a near total lack of privacy at night). Never had this issue in any hotel or motel I've ever stayed at. --Noise! - the hotel is sandwiched between a few different bars and the late night cacophony of yelling, bar music, trucks, car horns, and sirens is hugely distracting well into the early hours of the morning. I had to wear ear plugs despite being on the 5th floor. --TV had crappy HD signal with out of sync audio on every channel. And the remote was useless. --In room bar had standard inflated prices but the $7 bottle of Fiji water bedside was insulting. Don't even think of opening it; there's a 7-Eleven around the corner that sells exact same bottle for a fraction of the cost. Summary: --Not recommended. Looks much nicer in the website photos than it is. Rating on Yelp is bloated by at a least a star.",N
1151,"Stayed here for a 3-night stay for an annual conference. MAJOR problems with reservations.I booked a room 3 months in advance and was displaced to another hotel bc they ""overbooked""- I assume we were targeted bc our room was at military rates.  After a long flight & trudging through snow w/luggage I was NOT satisfied with this initial impression.  After many words were exchanged, we were shipped off to a sister hotel, brought back in the morning and rewarded with a suite on the 36th floor. Other than this initial migraine, staff was polite, facilities were beautiful, and conference was well-run.",N
5379,"It is expensive and spiritless. Our room was so expensive and had no windows. Ugly furniture, unhappy workers. It has a great location very close to Grant Park. Other than that there is nothing good at all. TRy to avoid if you can.",Y
2295,"There is one word to describe this hotel.  Functional, at best.   As a business traveler who stays at Marriot's all over the world- this hotel is just okay in my book.  Now granted- they are in the process of remodeling and they will have another chance to impress me when I stay here again in July, but for now?  Functional is the best I can say. From the time you pull up to the entrance- and you wait and wait and wait for the valet to come and get your car- to the mess in the lobby from the remodeling (bang, bang, bang!) to the front desk staff who acted like they were bothered that I was there, this place needs a major overhaul. The guest rooms are small and the one I was in had not yet been remodeled so it felt tired and old.  Room service for simple items took forever and no one ever did show up with the extra blanket that I requested. I also attended a banquet here and although the space was large and remodeled, there are certainly better banquet facilities in this city.  The banquet food was cold and tasteless and we couldn't get a refill of our water or wine glasses throughout the entire evening.  When we asked for additional rolls because there were not enough for everyone at our table- the server told us that it was ""planned that way"".  What?  They planned to have 5 rolls for a table of 8? On the positive side- this hotel is in a great location at Rush and Ohio close to all that a tourist may want to do in our fine city.   But as for me?  I think I'll let them finish their remodeling and give it another shot this summer to see if the ""facelift"" that they are doing goes deeper than just the surface.",N
742,"This place was awful and I do not intend to go back even if the company is paying for it. If you sign up for a package and misread the fine print and don't ask a question and they stick you with a charge, that's your fault. However I called down to the front desk and asked them specifically if my room (rate schedule in hotel speak) covered Internet charges. They said yes on Friday, but when I checked out on Monday I was pleasantly surprised with several internet charges that they're not taking off. Also - if you're expecting to sleep soundly til say 9, you'll be awakened by the sounds of their maintenance and renovation crews drilling things into the wall or dropping things on the ground. Which is something they don't tell you about when you check in.   Yes the beds are comfortable but there's another Westin on River North that's really easily accessible. Or there's about a dozen other hotels that you can pick from along the Magnificent Mile. Don't stay here. If you have a reservation, cancel it. Tell them I told you to. You'll end up paying way too much to be disappointed.",N
1251,"First--I did not stay at this Hyatt, I am basing this review on the customer service I experienced regarding clients that were staying at this hotel for a conference. Trying to contact a helpful person at this hotel is like pulling teeth.  I called to see what needed to be done to get welcome gifts placed in each guests room (about 10 guests).  I was transferred around on the phone a total of 6 times and still no one could answer my question.  I was told a manager would call me about it later---never got that call. Once I finally did get answers to my questions, I dropped the gifts off on a Friday to be placed in guests rooms over the weekend (I gave clear instructions to the manager with a list of full names)  She assured me that they would get these gifts in the room (mind you its $3 per drop off). I called on Monday to confirm the drop offs.  First time I called and asked I was placed on hold for 15 minutes.  I ended up hanging up, calling back and spoke to the same manager I left instructions with on friday---nope, no drop offs---and no explanation. So I had to go into bitch mode, to make sure these gifts were delivered ASAP (she actually asked me ""when would you like me to get them to their rooms?"" I wanted to scream: YESTERDAY!) Is it just me or shouldn't a hotel have exceptional customer service--atleast a hotel at the Hyatt level?  Very disappointing.",N
268,"Sorry but I feel I have to update this review.... I've now been staying here nearly two weeks and I have had precisely one shower that was hot. No more, no fewer. I don't know how the heat distribution works here but I would've thought that they could channel some of that energy expended on making the corridors into saunas (seriously I have to wait until I'm in the lobby to put my coat on or I'd boil in the lift) into heating some frickin' water. Secondly, my TV does not work. I only discovered this tonight as I had previously been too embarrassed to ask how to turn it on (it wasn't plugged in, but there were two wires and I followed the wrong one and... it's embarrassing, I confess). I was right to not ask because the front desk man was rude and unhelpful and told me there was a switch and there wasn't. The TV sounds like it's got some doppler effect going on, but I'm sitting still. Sometimes there is no sound. SOMETIMES THERE'S LOADS. I don't even particularly want to watch some strange show about tim roth reading the body language of psychotic criminals (can someone tell me what that is??) but at least if I turn it on I'd like to hear all of it or none of it, not half of it. If you open the fridge just once, it hums all night. I think it's to keep the dripping tap company. Again, rant over. I'm still giving it three stars because I understand it's bloody good value and having just got out of the cold shower, talked to a rude man and turned on the broken tv, i'm not in a very objective mood. but really. no.",N
2754,"We really enjoyed staying at the James.  The decor is very sleek & minimal, like a ""W"" Hotel but with better lighting.  The room was well designed and had lots of nice little features, including two comfortable spots for reading and an iPod dock that my husband was glad to see.  Despite its downtown location the room was relatively quiet and it's certainly close to lots of hot spots.  We found the staff to be very helpful and pleasant.  We took advantage of the free wifi in the room and it was hassle-free, and we also used the free PC's downstairs to print our boarding passes--all very convenient.  We also loved the library of interesting books, plus the assortment of available guidebooks, WHERE Magazines, etc.  All in all we had a great time and have already recommended the hotel to our friends at home in San Francisco.",N
2882,"This entry is for the FOOD at the Sheraton as prepared by the hotel kitchens, not the separate restaurants in the hotel.  There is so much discrepancies between the facilities and the food, that I felt each needed to be reviewed independently.   I ate at the Sheraton for 3 days: 2 breakfasts, 2 lunches, 3  pre dinner appetizer affairs, and one sit down dinner. Continental breakfasts were a 2 stars ho hum...The bagels, pasteries, juices, etc are things you find in any hotel lobby.   Coffee was very dark roast.   Why people associate quality coffee with dark roast is beyond me.   I roast my own coffee beans, and roasting beyond the second crack of the beans destroys all the subtle flavors. Lunches were 4 stars and much better:   We had pork tenderloins, pot roasts, mac and cheese, numerous green salads, cooked veggies, tomato bisque, and a wide selection of desserts.   The apple pie here is one of the best I have tasted.  Not too sweet but the apple flavor dominated, not the sugar.   The pot roast was excellent.   Yes a comfort food, but they nailed it here.    Food was prepared well in nearly all cases, a couple of times there was a miss but there  was enough variety.   The misses?...surprisingly, the soups here are weak. The pre dinner appetizers were also 4 stars.   The entrees included shrimp scampi (with the very large cocktail shrimp, not the Red Lobster shrimp McMiniNuggets size), filet mignon medallions (quality of their beef is 5 stars...very tender even when rare),     Had roast lamb (it was tender and seasoned great), roast turkey breast, two types of risottos, a brie pastry ..a foot and a half in diameter, an assortment of grilled veggies, several types of finger food desserts, calimari, and on and on.     It started to come close to Wolfgang Pucks catering down the street, but no cigar. Dinner was also 4 star quality overall.   Salad was good not especially memorable.   The soup was a spicy scallop Asian fusion thing that was tepid.   Is that a new direction in Asian fusion or was it just sitting too long?   We had surf and turf, a white fish...that was overcooked and dry, but the beef filet about 1.5 inches thick was superbly cooked.  It was a cumin based, southwestern oriental flavor.   Again Asian fusion influence in the kitchen, and it was excellent.   It obviously was grilled correctly, charred and singed on the outside....uniformly medium rare on the inside....deep red but not raw....really well done.   The desserts were a mixture of different things...fruit compote, a tart, a scoop of ice cream coated with toasted coconut, almond mixture. Although the Sheraton kinda misses on the soups and fish, they do buy high quality beef here and it shows.  The pork and lamb were also prepared with expertise.    This is a real meatlovers place to go.",N
2948,"My Boyfriend and I spend our NYE here. The pictures on their website are deceiving. They told us that we could get an upgrade if there was one available, well we got the upgrade but the room was not what one would expect for a $200/day stay. They don't give you a shower cap or bath soap you have to call and request it. It took 45 minutes to arrive. The maid who brought it up looked like she just woke up and was sleeping in the linens or something. She looked at me like she was so pissed when I asked her if she could bring me an extra bath towel. The 1st thing I noticed when I walked into our room was a stain on the bed covers, that is not cool. Some one did come up and change it. Yes she brought new linen and everything but as she was putting that new linen on I noticed a blue ink stain on it, and I didn't care but about it, at least it wasn't a bodily fluid stain like the previous one. But in front of my face she just flipped the covers over, so that the side with the stain wouldn't show...disgusting. I have put some pictures up of the bathroom, why was there mold in the bathroom of a supposedly 4 star hotel room. The concierge's desk, what a B****. She told me the night we checked in that I could pick up some breakfast coupons from her, and when I went to pick them up the next day the B**** was like I don't even know what you are talking about we don't have such a thing as a breakfast coupon. I was so pissed. This place needs to seriously upgrade their rooms and get new maids that aren't so crabby.",N
4804,"This is in regards to Rooftop @ the Wit. Wow! Go there! Such a cool place to party, have drinks and socialize. I've been there a number of times with friends, and they're always blown away by its awesomeness. It feels like you're in LA or Miami when you're in there (unfortunately the drink prices make you feel that way too). It gets crowded on weekends, so go early and have a ball!",Y
2332,"Definitely not my favorite hotel to stay if I expect to find peace and quiet.  The lobby area and outside the rooms is very busy all the time and therefore, quite noisy.  The location is convenient though.",N
2312,"So I guess I was definitely paying for location since the website made the rooms look majestic - plush beds and gorgeous views of the Chicago skyline at night. Unfortunately, for $199 a night internet deal (back in 2003), my room I rented for 4 of my friends to celebrate my birthday was super tiny. Also, when I set up reservations, they asked an odd question where I had to put another person down for the credit card hold.  So when I checked in they requested my card and my friend's card which didn't make any sense since I was the person who was paying the whole bill. Anyway, it didn't really matter since we only needed a place to crash. Afterwards, the billing was screwed up and I noticed on my bank statement that I was double charged for the room so I had to call my bank for them to withhold the charge and speak to  a Marriot resident regarding the billing error. Marriot didn't give me much of a hassle regarding the fees but a little attention to detail would be nice.",N
2080,"Spent 5 days in this hotel and loved it. They did an excellent job catering my son's wedding reception, in their lovely reception room overlooking the downtown and river. The staff were always polite and helpful. The location was excellent and convenient to downtown. Room prices, for the wedding guests, were very reasonable. Many rooms have been re-done nicely. Some still need fixing up. Ask for one of the new ones. If you're doing a downtown wedding in Chicago, look into this place!",N
5542,"Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Room was clean and well decorated. Bathroom was more unique then most hotels and where there was not carpet there were hard wood floors! very unexpected. Very Quiet, Definitely Located in the business part of Chicago. Got a Shedd Aquarium VIP package with room and the overall price was fantastic I almost felt like I was robbing them. Hot Tub and Pool were small but no one was using them anyway so there were no complaints. Breakfast Buffet was I have to say the best I've ever had in a hotel before (and free). Wide variety and the wait staff took very good care of everyone. I had a good time.",N
339,"My first impression of this place was that it was very basic, which was fine for about $70 a night in downtown Chicago. And that would have been fine, except that I woke up the next morning with a COCKROACH on my FACE. Possibly the biggest cockroach I have ever seen, and the laziest. I think it may have just wanted a good night's sleep. It waited for the front desk attendant I called, crawling from my pillow to the middle of the bed. The attendant cheerfully informed my boyfriend and I that it ""must have come from the restaurant below."" Needless to say, our vouchers for free breakfast were returned with the key.   I'm pretty sure the elevators are broken. Or just really slow. I waited more than ten minutes for a ride down and ended up having to lug my stuff down the stairs. We got a small discount on the hotel rate, $18 off for ""customer dissatisfaction"" because of the cockroach incident. Sorry guys, $18 off doesn't cover it. There's a decent looking hostel down the street. There's a bunch of nicer hotels within a block or two of this place. My recommendation is: anywhere but here.",N
5014,"Needs help.. The first room did not have a bath tub, the second room reeked of smoke (and we were on a nonsmoking floor) and desperately needed some touch up (paint chipped, dirty carpet)  finally we were upgraded to ""the tower"", in a very nice room with a soaker tub. Problem here was that there were no curtains and the only window treatment was a see-through shade, so at 7am we were wide awake... The television signal (although in HD) was breaking up every 30-45 seconds, the shower water pressure was very low.Katie at the front desk was lovely and because of her help made our stay.Having worked in the hotel business for over 12 years, this is a property that has fallen in disrepair, the elevators have cracked or missing mirrors, scratches and paint chips are patched lazily, leaving marks. The details are not being tended to and if this is not addressed I wish them good luck in this competitive hotel market. Would not recommend this hotel, there are better hotels in Chicago.",Y
1452,"It may not have the same celebrity rep as the ""Peninz"" down the street but this hotel is fantabulastic!  It's clean, trendy (but not TOO trendy)and the rooms are a cute suite-style with a separate ""sitting/pullout couch"" area.  A major star for location - right on Michigan Ave in the Magnificent Mile Zone. My favorite part of the Omni is it's lounge - it's a swank but comfy bar on the 4th level.  The lounge looks over Michigan Ave so you can check out all that hustle and bustle while you cocktail!  Totally reminds me of why I like drinking in hotel bars - guess I will have to go on a new party circuit ASAP.",N
3168,"solid place again, the service was outstanding. The crowd is getting a little more vegasy but what can you do.",N
1460,"I love the Omni. Staff is really friendly and they make sure you have a great stay. Before you go there definitely sign up for their Select Guest Program. (It's like one of those mileage program or hotel loyalty program. No fee) Once you sign up without doing anything your already a Gold member which means  you get complimentary Wi-Fi (really, all hotels should have free Wi-Fi), pressing service, shoe shine, morning beverage delivery, bottled water on the day of arrival. And the morning beverages are great, you get 2 beverages of your choice including coffee, tea, orange, grapefruit, tomato, apple juice, bottled water or hot chocolate. The gym isn't huge but it has lots of elliptical machines and treadmills. It's only open from 6am till 11pm though. There's also a pool and hot tub but according to my friend there's a high level of chlorine. It's on MIchigan Avenue which is like 5th Avenue in New York so it's close to everything. I especially liked going to get breakfast at the Pierrot Gourmet  (http://www.yelp.com/biz/... ) The rooms are all suites so you will have a living room with 2 arm chairs, desk and a sink with flat screen tv, bedroom with a tv and bathroom. I also got a mini fridge and a microwave because my stay was a little long. (no fee)  There was a waiting list but it became available in like 2 days. There are no charge for the fridge but you need to request it.",N
3685,It's not the intercontinental but it is okay. I saw a program on tv about people dying in the hotel in the past. That's the reason I never wanted to stay there and check out the service. It's creepy looking which I like but the murders and the whole ghost thing freaked me out.,N
4383,"I Pricelined a hotel in the loop and ended up with the Palmer House for a last minute trip to Chicago on June 2 - June 6. Thanks to reviews I read on TripAdvisor I knew to request a room with 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms - I was able to get one on the 20th floor at no extra charge. The room was huge and very comfortable. We didn't have a view but that didn't matter much to me. What a great location!  Walkable to Millennium Park and The Art Institute of Chicago. The hotel is also right by major bus lines and the CTA red and blue lines. We took the blue line from O'Hare and only had to walk about 2 blocks to get to the hotel (trip was about 45 minutes). There are 3 hotel entrances so you can enter/exit on Monroe, Wabash, or State streets - very convenient. Just be aware that the Wabash and State street entrances close after a certain time in the evening, probably around 11pm.  Also be advised that lots of eating establishments in the area close early - you'll be out of luck if you're hungry at 9 or 10pm! The hotel has about 12 elevators but they only service certain floors so we only had access to 3 and they were VERY slow. On a side note, I have Cingular and I had very spotty reception in the room. Lots of dropped calls. All in all we had a great experience at the Palmer House. I would definitely recommend it if you are able to get a good price on Priceline.",N
2921,Cold shower 2 mornings in a row?  Need I say more?  This is a Sheraton ... hot water should not be an issue. ------------------- UPDATE: Added a star for the gym that I recently visited and really liked.  Might warn up to this hotel if I can get over the cold showers.,N

The staff was very friendly, great drinks at 5 pm; we had dinner and breakfast at the Atwood Cafe - both were terrific! Elizabeth was our server for dinner - she was the best! It was our wedding anniversary and the staff gave us an extra bottle of wine with a nice card. We only stay at historic sites - this was special and worth the extra $$. The location cannot be beat. Paying for parking sucked, but hey, this is the Loop. Even Sasha the doorman was a hoot and holler (Go Lakers). I would certainly recommend a night here, our room gave her a slice of the Lake and being opposite the former (sigh) Marshall Fields was so classy!",N

The breakfast is outstanding. I am amazed at the efficiency of the breakfast staff. In the PM, the bar staff that run the manger's special take the time to get to know you and always remember your order (remember to tip them well) even if the snacks are kind of costcoesque. It was a great opportunity to touch base with my colleagues and see them well liquored. Overall, a great stay in a well-run and well-located hotel. Shatangi told you...",N
3426,"Oh, Allerton, you disappointed me. We booked the Allerton off of a deal we saw on travelocity. Our flight+hotel only for 300 dollars for the weekend? Omg, why not?? Allerton has great location. 701 N. Michigan Ave, right across from the Zara. A girl's best dream ever. But man, that hotel is small and old. The second floor is nice- they have a nice ""M"" lounge, complete with drinks and food. The tiny elevators took us up to our room and we entered. The room was okay. Came with a tv, desk, fridge, full size bed, and bathroom. It was just.... not that great. I mean, I've stayed (and lived) in much much worse, but the pictures are sure deceiving. It was a pretty old- the doors to the closet, the carpet, the windows, and the BATHROOM. The toilet had one of those flush handles you see in public bathrooms. You know, the ones where you use your foot to step on it to flush? The heavy duty ones? Omg. And there was no counterspace! I also wished they have provided amenities besides the shampoo and conditioner and soap. Like...some lotion? I was ready to give Allerton three stars until I saw what housekeeping did. Okay, they did not give us any washcloths. Big deal (not really). But OUR TOOTHBRUSHES. We had put our toothbrushes in the cups (as we usually do). We come back to the room Saturday night, to find our toothbrushes not in their cup but LYING in the bathroom. They were behind the bathroom faucet. EWWWWWWWW!! I'm not a germaphobe, but REALLY?!! Who KNOWS where those toothbrushes have been or where they have touched!! Disgusting. BLEH. I rinsed my in hot water for about a minute before sticking it in my mouth. Overall, good location, and it's fine. But if you're looking to pamper yourself? No way. Bad housekeeping will keep me far away from this place again.",N
766,"I arrived 10:30pm last night to the Westin.  The beds were super comfortable and indeed heavenly.

For $80 (1 steak + drinks) I expected a much better experience.",N
5010,"I used to live in the city, now the burbs, but have to stay overnight in the city sometimes for business. I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel recently due to the recommendation of a friend, an unexpectedly good rate, and because the location happened to be perfect for what I was after. The hotel is located just south of the river at the corner of Michigan and Wacker. Millennium Park and the Art Institute are within easy walking distance as you head south, and some Magnificent Mile shopping (Nordstrom and such) is within easy walking distance to the north. (Note that if you're more into the Barneys / Oak Street area of shopping then the location would not be ideal - too far of a hike.)The hotel definitely seems to be geared toward a younger, drunker set. Not to be too harsh, but there were a lot of douchebaggish and wannabe douchebaggish types. I saw a few families here but can't imagine that the place is ideal for small kids, given the noise level, and the fact that the bathrooms (at least in the standard room I was in) only have showers and not bathtubs. By the way, the shower was awful. Very inconsistent water pressure and temperature, and one of those eco, or is it Euro, type of unmovable partitions instead of a shower curtain or door, so that you basically have to get in the shower completely to turn on the water. On the plus side, the bathroom and the room in general seemed clean, modern and fresh.Overall I felt the hotel was ok for a night or two but as a thirty-something I just felt too old for the place. Next time I need to be in that location in Chicago I will opt for the Hotel Monaco which is just a few doors down.",Y
4201,"We were just here the weekend of Dec 10. Check in was fast and simple, take advantage of the check in kiosk if you can. My husband gets a corp discount so the price was perfect for us.

It's a great location and we'll be staying there again in Feb.",N
4157,"Where do I start??? So bad I couldn't even give it a star!! But forced to in order to complete this review! Check in was fine, they did allow us to check in early. I requested a non-smoking room.   I had gone online to use their concierge service which is supposed to be an easier way to request amenities.  We went to Chicago to celebrate my mom's 67th birthday so it as supposed to be an amazing experience! I ordered my mom a fruit basket for one of her surprises which she never got even after ordering it twice.  However, concierge did send her wine with chocolates for her birthday. And after the 2nd non receipt of my amenity for my mom they sent us three apples with a card congratulating me for my birthday! (rolls eyes) Before arriving to Chicago, I sent a request for dinner reservations at a great Mexican restaurant I got a phone call that their restaurants would be closed!! What the hell kind of shit is that? You are a hotel you don't close shit down when you have hotel guests in your hotel!! Ok fine the concierge was supposed to book me a reservation for 2 on my mom's birthday which was on the 24th of December, so I get a phone call from Dwayne saying that a lot of places were closed but he would try to find a place that was open.   I had checked with the concierge and that is when I found out that their restaurant was closed and that they had gotten us a reservation at Mexx. So we settled in and got ready for dinner.  We had a great dinner. However they had us down for dinner on Christmas day??!! Hmm...  Someone messed that up! Go figure! As with any information obtained from the concierge it was misinformation after misinformation! From where to find free Wi-Fi to where I could find some soul food!!  I was also told that I could not find food after midnight and that my only option was room service or the deli down in the lobby.  I didn't want either of those options! Pissed I called the front desk and told her that I wanted to transfer the room to my mom because I wanted to check out, she tried to counter act the misinformation about food access by telling me that there was definitely places that deliver to the hotel up until 5am but didn't seem phased that I wanted to leave.  Made me feel swell!!!!! Thank god I know people who live there and from there or I would have been stuck. The Room... We booked through Priceline. So I didn't pay that much per night, had I paid more I would have demanded a refund!!  It reeked of cigarette smoke and it took 2 days to go away.  The room had dust that covered some parts of the room was so thick I could write in it! The bathroom had chipped tile, a broken tub drain, and a loose screw that held the curtain rod to its hinges.   A little advice read all hotel reviews; call the hotel in advance to make sure they are 100% before booking!! And if you are unhappy with your room no matter how much you pay for it speak to a manger. I just don't understand why this hotel received 4 stars!!! It so does not deserve it.  The whole staff had no way to compensate for their lack of customer service skills and or their screw ups.  I didn't cause a scene because of my mom. Rest assured we won't ever stay in a Hyatt.  Priceline should know when a hotel is not 100% operational or is undergoing construction which is one of the excuses I heard from the front desk as to why there were putting us in a tower across the street.",N
2815,"I like to get loud and party probably more than most other people. However, when I'm trying to sleep in my hotel room and I can hear people screaming across the atrium and pounding on doors at 3 am., that's just bullshit. Seriously, there was this dude pounding on a hotel room door across the atrium for at least 20 minutes. I'm sure the rest of the hotel guests were awakened just as I was. It took the security guard 20 minutes to get up there and confront the jackass. On the brightside, the staff at the hotel was really friendly and helpful. The valet parking crew really shined. My room was clean and comfortable. The free buffet breakfast is a very nice plus. I'm a fan of the Embassy Suites concept but I don't think I'll stay at one again if something isnt done to soundproof the rooms more sufficiently. That is unless I'm there to party all night and to be the one to make all that noise! The Embassy Suites needs to make their rooms a little more soundproof however with all of the insanity that goes on all through the night in the atrium.",N
4078,"We paid 250 a night for a 2 double bed room. Pros: 1. The pillows rule 2. Concierge is fast and they treat you like a rock start 3. Flat screen TV, tons of AC 4. Clean sheet, downy comforters, softest pillows Cons: 1. No free WIFI 2. No roll away beds 3. Shampoo kinda sucks 4. They charge for everything along the way All in all, Hotels rule, but it's not really my style. I prefer the couch or the floor. I actually slept on the floor at the Hyatt. You don't have to tip the bell boy, the taxi man, the cleaning lady....blah blah blah.",N
2670,"Sunday evening, one room, two adults, King size bed ON the positive - quiet and modern lobby - great location in the city for walking - Kiehls products Room for Improvement - very small room - the room was very musty and old smelling - the toilet seat had a cut out of it that scratched our legs - we were privy to the afternoon's vacuuming when we arrived (loud, cords all over the hall) - too much $$$ for what you get It is just ""ok"".",N
2737,My parents were in town and they loved this hotel.  It is very trendy and minimalist.  The rooms are average size but have a really nice flat screen tv.  Another plus is that all the products that they give you are kiel's. The gym is also great. Its got all brand new equipment and is pretty big. The only problem my parents had was that there was a little mix up with their  reservation and its a little pricey.,N
2247,"I attended a wedding here this past Saturday night.  I had never been inside this hotel and I have to say that I thought it was beautiful.  The wedding reception was held in the Grand Ballroom, which was a round room.  There was a stairway leading above the room which was open so you could see the second floor.  They had candles all the way around the stairway and the second landing.  It was just gorgeous with the low lit room.  The tables were beautiful and they had festive red wine goblets since it is so close to Christmastime.  The food was absolutely delectable.  Spicy Pumpkin Curried Soup, next came Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato towers with fresh Basil and Balsamic.  They then served a Raspberry Sorbet and then for the main course, Filet Mignon with Baby Carrots and Asparagus and a side of Risotto.  Being that I am a vegetarian I got a whole plate of that Yummy Risotto.  The wine was delicious and was flowing all night long.  That is why I had to rent a room that night.  No driving for me.  Anyway, I got sticker shock the next morning when I had to pay $50.00 to get my car out of the lot.  I know we are on Michigan Ave. and all, but geez the room had already set me back $300.00.  Anyway, aside from that, what a nice event.  I would recommend for anyone to have a wedding reception there.  Classy, elegant and just a wonderful time!",N
5437,I want to overdose in this hotel and go out full blown rock n roll style,Y
951,"No complaints here and a great location.  Located one block from Michigan Ave. and near the Grant 'L' it felt like we were right in the middle of things.  Service was friendly and room, while not luxurious, was quite comfortable.  For $129.99, I'd definitely stay again.",N
96,"Classic location for smaller wedding/event with multiple rooms for different activities if you like to sit and talk away from main action.  The neighborhood is quiet and a nice choice if you want to be a little out of the city, but still close enough.   The staff is always courteous and helpful. A classic gem in Oak Park.",N
1113,"The good: The hotel was exceptionally clean and nicely appointed, linens were very soft and comfortable, the mattresses were excellent quality too. The room was very large and spacious for the price. There were bathrobes and quality bath products as well as fresh, thick white cotton towels. It was easy to get internet. The housekeeping staff was very nice and did a great job. The doorman and bellhops were very courteous and helpful. The bad: The room service was very slow (est 1 hour for bkfst) although they did accommodate us and speed it up when I switched to uncooked menu items and said we had to get the food within 30 minutes. My main complaint is the hotel's featured restaurant on the first floor - Aria. The service was terrible, although the many waiters were sweet and good-natured they rarely came to our table and took forever to remove finished dishes. The food was mediocre, more confusion than fusion, and very expensive. We had 2 appetizers and split a main dish, 2 glasses of wine and one dessert. the bill was about $100 without the tip. For this price I expect superb food and service.",N
1890,"So many ups, so many downs. I've been here a few times for drinks in the lobby and parties in their ballrooms.  I love the space and always have had a good time.  My 30th birthday was held here.  It was good but there were a few glitches.  I was pleased that they let me bring in cupcakes from Sarah's. Most recently, I was in a suite.  The rooms are very nice.  The customer service was outstanding.  I would definitely head back!",N
5167,"Nice hotel. Pretty good service, not great but good. BUT, if you need Wifi go elsewhere...their Wifi is horrible! The beds are comfy, but the rooms are teeny tiny. Overall, worth the $ for the scene and the ""coolness"" - but the amenities are average (gym, room service, etc.). Very modern. Very cool, but not sure it's worth the $? Reminds me of a Vegas hotel...which is weird when the elevator is blasting techno at 8a on a Monday.",Y
3243,"HI HO HI HO, off to Chicago we go. Here's the skinny, if you're hoping to run into a washed up rock star (CeCe Deville for us, and no the teenagers had no idea who he was) you may want to spend your hard earned money here. I took my younger sister and a couple of her friends (teenagers) for an overnighter in Chicago on our way to Wisconsin. I chose the Hard Rock for the ambiance. I mean come on it is supposed to be ""COOL"". Well it wasn't. The Positives: *It is in the Carbon & Carbide Building, which is beautiful. *The location: it sits in the middle of everything *The lobby has two computers for guest use. *The fitness center is very nice. Cardio machines have  individual TV's and there are head phones in case you forgot yours. They have protein bars for those that like them for a post workout snack. *Check-in and out was quick and Valet was very courteous. The Negatives: *The rooms were small and ours wasn't clean (pistachio shells on the floor). The rooms were painted purplish gray (we were on the Prince floor) with a picture of Bob Marley hanging on one of the walls. The girls thought the coolest part about the hotel was the fuzzy throw pillows. *Bathroom had only a shower and not a full tub. *The cable reception was poor; I kept looking for the bunny ears to fix the picture. *It isn't anywhere near the Hard Rock Café. *There was very little memorabilia. *There is no pool, and yes I knew this when I made the reservation. To wrap it up, I won't be staying here again.  If I am going to drop almost 4 Benjamins on a hotel room, I will stay at the Palmer House Hilton. But that is a whole different review.",N
1797,"Very nice and got a great deal. You can't beat $125 (including taxes) for a weekend night in Chicago. The staff was very friendly and accommodating (the outside street attendant let us leave our car parked there for 45 minutes so we could check in and run up to our room without having to pay for parking). The rooms were slightly small, but the hotel is located in a perfect place. We'd definitely stay again.",N
2950,"convenient location, SUPER COMFY beds (better than the W Lakeshore), and nice river/city views. a little old and bathrooms need work. unfortunately it was really expensive when i stayed here in late october - about $210 before tax even with my corp discount. strangely, i stayed here in march a year and a half ago, and i got a much huger room for only $79 on priceline!",N
1241,Very nice beds and a good bar. The bartender was very kind a courteous. I've stayed at many hotels that charge more than they deliver but his is a great hotel. You get what you pay for and this is a great bang for the buck.,N
366,"I've put off writing this review, only because I didn't want to admit that I actually stayed here, but I have, and I agree with what most everyone before me has said. Dumpy rooms, extremely slow elevators (although on my first trip down the elevator DID try to speed my trip up by coming to a complete stop and then dropping a floor or so), and uncomfortable bed/furniture. I'm not even sure it's worth staying here for the location, at least not if you're planning on evening activities. The lack of activity on this part of Michigan Avenue after dark makes it feel very unsafe and uncomfortable. The next time I'm in Chicago I'll cough up a bit more dough and stay in a slightly more upscale joint.",N
147,"Friendly staff, clean rooms, but no free wi-fi!  $9.99/24hrs and the quality was bad at that.  Signal, no signal, signal...   Room service always efficient and friendly.  Breakfast average.  Air conditioner broke twice, owner apologetic.  Not our choice Chicago hotel, but it's in our timeshare network so we make do.",N
5793,"My wife and I stayed at the Lake Shore Ramada only because our friends had their wedding reception at the nearby University of Chicago.  Yes, it was a place to lay down after a night of drinking and dancing, but not much sleeping was done...no, not because of THAT....get your mind our of the gutter. Issue #1 - I found out king size bed to be very uncomfortable. Issue #2 - Either every single guest in the Ramada was speaking through a bull horn, or the walls were paper thin.  Either way, starting somewhere between dawn and when I finally fell asleep, I was able to hear conversations, other people showering, dressers opening and closing, and everything else people do in hotel rooms.  No not THAT. Issue #3 - Though this is beyond the control of the hotel staff, I must also mention that there was a bird right outside our window who, the very second the sun shone it's face over Lake Michigan, took it upon itself to inform all other living creatures that it was morning at the top of it's tiny, little lungs. Other unpleasantries: -Understaffed front desk.  It took a good twenty minutes to check in. -Hookers in the lobby.  Not call girls.  Not ladies of the evening.  Straight up white trash, track marked hookers. The good things: -Relatively in expensive for a Chicago hotel. -""Free"" parking. -Right on the Lake.  We were fortunate enough to view a regatta race going on in the distance as we checked in. Overall, I don't plan on staying there again unless under similar circumstances in which a night at the Lake Shore Ramada beats possibly killing children because of drunk driving.  This place is not horrible, but not favorable.",N
3689,"When one of our friends came into town and stayed here we decided to take high tea.  This was AMAZING.  It was roughly $34 per person, and this included finger sandwichs (which were delicious), pasteries, dessert, and of course as much tea as you can drink.  They have many choices, some of which are really exotic.  A great place to spend the afternoon with friends.",N
1783,"This hotel is so freaking CUTE! Art deco lobby with red velour chase lounges and leopard drapes.  Tootsie rolls at the reservation desk.  You can request a goldfish in your room to keep you company!  AND, they have soft, down comforters instead of yucky bedspreads!  A great place overall.",N
2806,"Stayed here during Lollapalooza weekend and was very happy with the hotel, the service and amenities. Location is great (right off the Grand-Red stop of the L), so easy to get to and close to a lot of great restaurants and activities. Wi-fi was a little slow, but there is a business center with 4 computers that you can use (for free!). Yes, it can be busy in there, just go during random hours (2am is a good time) and you're golden. Definitely would stay here again and recommend for anyone who is looking for a little extra room to spread out.",N

2896,"Ever wish there were a separate rating for cleanliness/maintenance in Yelp? Sheraton should lobby Yelp for one. This mammoth Sheraton has all the makings of a wonderful hotel: great river view, impressive lobby, lots of rooms, plentiful conference space, and a nice greeter. Top notch at first sight. They even give you a post card when you arrive and offer to mail it for you for free. Nice touch -- But I wish they'd spend those 19 cents on cleaning my room! The rooms are so run down and badly maintained, it makes makes you long for a $50/night motel. Here's a list of things wrong with my room that I noticed in my short one night stay: - Coffee cups not clean - Lid missing from coffee machine - Burned out light bulb in lamp - Broken wire to handset in the phone - Beaten-up toilet seat I'm on hold right now for guest services (using the speakerphone since the hand set is broken) listening to their recorded message brag about their newly refurbished rooms.  Too bad they're not newly cleaned too.",N
2399,"Great hotel! Went to Chicago for Lollapalooza. Stayed at this Hotel because it was across the street from the concert. When the girl at the desk realized I was in town for the concert, she upgraded me and gave me a suite on Michigan Ave overlooking the whole venue! Great, big clean suite. The people who worked there were really cool.. 2 good bars down stairs. Great food, as well!!!",N
1399,"I'll keep this one short-  decent hotel with a great location.  The prices are reasonable for a hotel right off the magnificent mile, and our room had been recently renovated, but was a bit on the small side.  The elevator was older and slow, but did the job.  The staff was friendly.  Its definitely worth considering again for a trip.",N
37,"Paid $140 for a room on this past Thursday. It was a last resort after the Sofitel was booked up and most of my coworker were staying there so I needed to be close  bye. Boy did I get the shaft on this business trip. I normally stay at the Sofitel which is amazing but this hotel can't compare in any way except the location. The check bell hop was very nice but besides him, the staff was not very helpful and kind of rude. I was told nothing about the hotel when checking in. I was barely spoken too actually. The room looks ok when I walk in, it was clean but older looking. The nightmare came at 2:30 am when I heard the couple next door having a good time soo clearly I felt like they were in my room. The walls were soo thin and the doors had more than enough room on the bottom for sound to come through. At 5 am the same couple wakes me again as they are getting ready and leaving their room. I finally fall asleep again just to be woken up by the cleaning staff cleaning that room at 7 am and again it sounded like they were in my room. I will never stay here again.",N
2659,"I appreciate attention to detail (ATD) so much that it's all I can think of when I stay at a hotel. I could care less about the amenities, but if they do pay attention to details, they win over me. The gym: it's gorgeous for a hotel gym. It has almost all the machines/equipment that you would need or could think of. It's clean and well-maintained. There are jars of ice-cold fruit-infused water with to keep you hydrated, and they get replenished frequently. They even provide you with wrapped earphones in case you forget to bring yours. Now, THAT is ATD. Instead of the traditional folio for your card keys, they have a mock-leather card wallet which includes a card-size street map. Very cute. ATD again. The room was clean, so very clean--spotless and odor-less. It's sort of ATD. I love that they don't have any bed spreads. They are gross and I hate them. Yay, I could just dive right into the bed without pulling it off first. Now, for the nitpicking items: I would've liked that the cute little ""dining nook"" (as they called it) would have some lighting in there for laptop or reading activities. Concierge, eh, that, we could live without. We felt that he was more about pushing his list onto us, rather than listening to us the sort of activities we'd love to do. Tips: We asked for higher floors and I was glad. We didn't have a view of the mile or downtown but it was bright and open. There were TONS of alcohol in the room; it was definitely a mega bar. I kid you not.",N
5327,This was my first time in Chicago and I was very impressed by the service at the Marriott! Neil the doorman even shined my shoes with the workers kit because they didn't have anything available to the guests. The because he didn't think they looked too different offered to take them down the street for me to a professional. He made a cab wait for me and they hap ply held my bags for a whole day. The room was nice spacious and warm! I highly recommend!,Y
1169,"This place is DISMAL! The rooms are cheaply decorated with yellow paint, plywood and junky light fixtures. While I did not see any bugs or murders during my stay, my instincts told me that both were definitely possible here.",N
897,"Two things really stand out at Burnham: its location and its ambiance. The hotel is located at State and Washington, and the view down State Street from our corner room on the 12th floor was awesome! During the Christmas season, the hotel is right across from Macy's and a block away from the Chicago Christmas tree. It's a couple blocks from Michigan Ave. and Millennium Park. So, walking around right out of the hotel was great and then catching a cab was trivial as well. It's a max $10 cab ride to pretty much anywhere, for example, Lincoln Park. The ambiance is boutique: small and casual. The service isn't snooty or smothering. The lobby is tiny with a fireplace and a couple comfy chairs. Our room was a suite but was still smaller than a more modern hotel. That was fine; it was a great setup and the windows on a corner room were huge. And yes, Burnham has the practicalities down as well... comfy beds and good shower/water pressure. The room had two robes in the closet a leopard pattern and a zebra. Ha! My only complaint... the tiny bar and cafe downstairs were hard to get into. We didn't make reservations for Sunday brunch at Atwood and couldn't get in. So be it! Of course, staying at a downtown hotel ain't cheap, but I think Burnham is a little less than a lot of other options. Highest rating for the Burnham Hotel!",N
476,"I stayed here for Lollapalooza weekend - it's close to the north location of the festival and just a block away from Michigan Ave so very convenient. The closest L stop is Grand-Red which is a few blocks away. Staff was pleasant but not overly friendly - I appreciated that the front desk staff found an available room before check in time and everyone was helpful when needed, they just didn't go out of their way to make nice if that makes any sense. Rooms are standard Embassy Suites with the separate bedroom and living room. The bathrooms were roomy and the towels were the nice big bath sheets which is always a plus. Complimentary breakfast was just okay - when the hotel is sold out like it was the weekend I was there, the lines are long and they run out of things fast. But if you're patient, you can pretty much get whatever you'd want for breakfast. They also have the complimentary evening reception with snacks. I'd stay here again but can't really give more stars since I wasn't wowed.",N
225,"Super precious hotel. Loved it. Will be my 'go to' hotel from now on. You heard it here first. So, I cannot stand downtown Chicago (i.e. magmile and all other typical touristy spots) so this offered a perfect location to the neighborhoody side of Chicago. It was less than a 5 minute walk to the lake, an easy easy walk to shops/eats etc, and was located on the cutest tree lined street you've ever seen surrounded by breathtaking homes. I was in heaven. The hotel was super clean and our room #701 was a corner double room with beautiful views to the homes below and I could even see the lake! It let in amazing natural light and honestly felt like my own little chicago apartment! I didn't hear a peep minus the loud girls next door who finally shut the heck up at 4am. The beds were comfortable enough, the hardwoods were great, and the room in general was spacious and so adorable. A few notes: Remote didn't work. Light fixtures were totally whacked up. And the bathroom was teeeeeny tiny. Annoyingly tiny. The rooms are showing signs of  wear if you care enough to look. I notice details because I'm anal like that, but otherwise a really really great place to be. Did I mention there were huge freakin blueberries on the wall? Cuteness overload. P.s. The front desk/entrance area smelled like vanilla. Perfect.",N
4906,"My best friend and I stayed here for a girl's night out.....the service was ok.  The hotel is in an ideal location for going out on the town.  I loved the architectural design of the building--uber trendy--the beds were VERY comfy.  Now, the shower I was not impressed with since there are no shower doors!  Water kept getting all over the bathroom so you have to be careful.  Also at one point during the evening an employee let himself into our room with his room key at approx. 8 pm asking us if we wanted a ""turn down service""!  The staff was not the friendly and some of them were out and out rude.  The price was reasonable however...and the spa was ""just okay"". Probably wouldn't go back again.",Y
1858,"Nothing to write home about. Standard W rooms, noisy as hell with the L running right around the building  Your typical service and W lounge/lobby down below.

5470,"Love the location,  love the rooms, and the penthouse suite is spectacular.  The regular rooms are very comfortable. The decor is modern and hip.  The staff is very discreet and accommodating.  The prices are reasonable.  I have had some good times here.  Went to a wedding here once and the ballroom was awesome. Ceiling to floor glass one floor above Rush street.  You can look right down and see everything and everyone on the busy Rush Street and they can look right back at you.  Being right across from Tavern and Gibson's with the Whiskey Bar in the lobby (sort of)  you don't have to go far for anything.  Hot hotel, Hot location, Hot views, this is a great place to put friends, Family, or yourself!",N
292,"we stayed at the seneca for a mini staycation this past weekend. the front staff upgraded us to the presidential suite, which was really nice. fully functioning kitchen, small dining area and a living space in addition to our very large bedroom. the only drawback was the teeny tiny shower, and the equally small jacuzzi tub. im about 5'8, and couldnt stretch my legs out in the tub.  the shower had weak water pressure and the head didnt have a knob to change the pressure. we had limited interaction with the front staff, but the check in and check out went smoothly. i would stay here again, but the bathrooms need some improvement",N
5474,"This place was decent.  I found out after arriving that this hotel is right in the center of the infamous Viagra Triangle.  AWESOME!  Needless to say, this area wasn't exactly my type of scene at all, but it wasn't bad and the location was pretty good for getting to other places.  The staff was great and the hotel itself seemed pretty nice, but the particular room we got was kinda lame.   The awesomeness: - Nice and competent staff. - Clean & fairly upscale. - Convenient location for getting to most things in downtown Chicago and the North side of town.   - It was a fairly good deal on Priceline.   The suckage (in no particular order): - Lack of power outlets.  Really, there was maybe one free... - Really bad sheets.  Not the most comfortable and they just would not stay on the bed.  Had to put them back on every night.   - TV was pretty weak.  You'd expect a place like this to have a nicer, newer TV.  It's not that important though.   - Really poor lighting.  This was a bizarre one - it was a very dark room even with the lamps on (there was no overhead lighting).   - Terrible shower.  Those detachable showerheads are fine if you can put them to a regular shower height and use it like a normal showerhead - the highest the showerhead went up was to my chest.  Is this shower for leprechauns?  In addition to the height issue, the water pressure kinda sucked.  The shower itself also seemed really plasticky and cheap - not in line with the quality evident in the rest of the hotel.  And what's up with the handrails everywhere in the shower and near the toilet?  Is this a handicapped bathroom?! - Wonderful 5th floor view of the shit-covered roof next door.  To be fair, beyond that was a decent view of a big department store (Barney's, I think) - Room was across from the maid's closet.  Awesome! It'll probably look like I'm being super picky but I'm really not.  I'm easy to please when it comes to lodging.  Basically, I don't need everything to be fantastic - I just need everything to not suck.  The hotel just came up really short in a lot of very basic and simple areas that you normally take for granted.  And even with a decent deal through Priceline you are still paying a good bit of money to stay here. Maybe all their rooms are kinda sub-par like that - I don't know.  I'm wondering if maybe we got a crappy room because we went through Priceline.  Maybe they just have a shitastic room they keep reserved for guests who go through Priceline.  Who knows. Anyway, aside from the location (which ended up being pretty convenient for getting around), this place didn't display a lot of impressive qualities and lacks in some very basic areas. 2.5",N
619,"Pro's - Einstein bagels in the lobby - Warm cookies when you check-in - Great restaurants/bars nearby (Timothy O'toole's, West Egg Cafe & Gyu Kaku) - Close to Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier and all the stores - Free wi-fi in Lobby - Decent price. We got it on Priceline for about $120/night Con's -Doesn't include continental breakfast -The smoking floors are AWFUL!! Cannot believe people can smoke in hotels there - 3 out of the 4 nights we stayed there our ""do not disturb"" sign disappeared in the morning and the maid woke us up....not a happy camper!! - Walls are thin so we heard the man next door to us coughing/throwing up two mornings in a row",N

2886,"Really- this was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. I am not a complainer but I felt like everytime I turned around there was something to roll my eyes about with this hotel. My girlfriend and I arrived after a 12 hour car trip from Philly at around 12 am. We knew that places like this fill up quick and called to ensure that our room (that had been reserved 3 weeks prior) was kept even though we were getting there late- no problem. We arrive and they have no rooms w/ beds left...so they gave us a room w/ a sofa bed and told us they'd upgrade for the following night. The sofa bed had no sheets on it, there were no pillows in the room and no remote control for the t.v. OK. Called the front desk, asked for these items and waited. Waited some more. Called again. A guy came up with 1 pillow (when we asked for 2-not an unreasonable request) and sheets. 10 minutes later someone came with the remote. Next day they told us the room could not be upgraded so we were moved to a traditional room (lower then what we originally booked). We got back from doing our touristy stuff, got the keys for our new room and our luggage was nowhere to be found (they told us they would move it), so we had to call a couple of times and have it tracked down. To be fair they discounted us $150 dollars and sent up some free fruit and water(whopee). Not worth the mental hassle and time it took away from Chicago enjoyment. The valet guy - Ed, I believe his name was - was very nice and patient while we unloaded a ton of bags from our car.",N
183,"Very nice room.  Very nice price.  AWESOME location.  Did valet parking around the corner for $28 for the night, not too shabby for Chicago. Room was laid out soo well, we almost felt like we were in an apartment.  Bed was very, very comfy and I have a hard time sleeping throughout the night at a hotel.  Check in/out was quick and everyone on the staff was willing to help us if needed. The only downside?  The elevators were insanely slow.  We waited about 5 minutes every time we needed to go somewhere, thank god the Ice Machine was on our floor!",N
1878,"I am a stick in the mud. Stick in the muds and the W hotel just don't match. It was a nice room, but I hate everything being a la carte. The sink showcased the bold look of Kohler, but was so tiny I could barely wash my face without splashing water on my feet. The elevators had this bizarre 3D sticker thing going on with a black light shining to make things super trippy.  I imagine it must be freaky when you're drunk. Speaking of drunks, this seems to be the place for a lot of clubbers to go out and then come back and spend the night.  We were woken up by a group of drunk guys at 3AM who decided the hallway outside our door was the perfect place to hold a conversation.   An extra star goes to security coming up right away when I called to complain.  At least they don't expect other guests to reason with drunk people.",N
3782,"I totally feel my colleagues' pain about the thin walls. Lucky for me, my experience wasn't too bad. And here's why. Ask for a corner room. When I made my reservations, I asked for my exact room I had during my last stay. I was on the 20-somethingth floor with great views and off to the corner--far from the elevator. Unfortch, they did me a solid during my last stay and gave me that room at our corporate rate (it's usually more for a corner room). I didn't have that option this time ... until I worked my charm, and the reservation specialist over the phone went ahead and gave me that corner room for the same rate. I love you Dana Hotel &amp; Spa. Nothing much changed from my last stay: it's still a challenge to get out of those marshmellow-ey, sleep-like-a-baby beds. The shower is heaven; bath products are spa-like ... Only change I noticed was the complimentary breakfast. It used to be laid out on the bar buffet-style, but now you have to go to the restaurant for a sit-down meal. You can still grab and go, but when you're in a hurry, it takes a bit longer. My only complaint is the loud AC. It rattles around when it shuts on and off ... and I do wish the rooms had a fans. When the air is on auto and blows for however long, the room is a nice crisp cold and lying under the covers in bliss. But as soon as it auto-powers off for a bit, the room gets HOT. A fan would keep that cool air circulating for the time being. Just a thought. Other than that, service is five stars; they have some of the friendliest doormen ever.",N
2687,"I've stayed at 4 hotels in Chicago in the last 3 months and this hands down is my favorite. My thoughts on The James: top notch staff, clean and modern rooms,  and free Kiehl's products. It was a convenient location to the office as well as all the shopping (even though I did not get to partake in it :) ). One huge plus is the Trader Joe's across the street which makes it easy to grab essentials. I would highly recommend this to travelers of both business and pleasure.",N
868,"Large, very clean, new enough decor, staid new mission style decor but not too overdone. Solid and tasteful enough. Good architecture. Mostly nice, professional and informed staff. The wireless internet works well and fast. In-room single-serve Starbucks. Wake-up call gives weather. Good linens but hard thick pillows, they need new ones. Nicer than comparable hotels in SF. Not shabby. I could hear the trains but was far enough away that it sounded pleasant like a wave--ask for a back room if you hate noise. Very downtown Chicago atmosphere but not chaotic or overly commercial, near the Art Institute. Interior room had view of courtyard/walls but nice windows (not openable), good light. You can regulate your room's digital thermostat.  I would have given it a 4 except for a few flukes. My bathroom ceiling leaked (I was under the roof air conditioner) and it smelled damp and was always too cold despite my changing the temperature. There was a panel cut in the bathroom ceiling probably to fix this leak previously, the water dripped in around it. Obviously this room has a moisture problem from that. They moved me graciously and the new room was great. The second morning my coffee maker spurted the water it heated spurted all over, and when I called the desk to ask for a replacement I was told there were no rooms left therefore no more coffee makers and I would have to go get my own coffee in the restaurant as the staff had not arrived (6:30am). No spare at the front desk? Big hotel for no night staff. I managed to fix it myself--when it was cleaned the hosing was disconnected.",N
4454,"If you are looking for old world class and a fabulous entry to impress. The Palmer House is your go-to. I would say it is over-priced but if you are attending New Years or a musical/ball/galla event and are decked out this is probably the place to stay to complete the experience/moment. I love Miller's Pub which a great rib restaurant nearby with a fun atmosphere. Events at the Palmer House are great too. However, if you are looking for a spacious and modern hotel with all the amenities the Palmer House is not your go-to. Old World class and big city grandeur make this a blast from the past in a good way.",N
2655,"Do you enjoy being pampered, unbridled 5-star luxury, and prefer service being served with a smile? If you answered YES to any of the above, then The James is the place for you. This past weekend I spent my 23rd birthday in Chicago. After scouring the 'net for hotel deals (for some reason people avoid traveling to areas where it snows in the winter--being from Texas, I relish it), I came across The James at $139/night through http://Travelzoo.com. Alone this would be a total steal (rooms generally run ~$250/night), and ON TOP of that a $100 food/beverage voucher was included for use at either David Burke's Primehouse, their in-house bar/lounge JBar, or In-Room Dining (more on that later). A separate spiel must be made for their concierge service/staff. A week or so before arriving I had e-mail correspondence with Daisy (such a pleasure to communicate with), to have ""The Anniversary"" amenity (a bottle of champagne along with these delicious bite-size brownie morsels topped with raspberries) awaiting my guest and I in our room before arrival. However, when we arrived--the amenity was not in our room. Not a big deal, I called down and they had someone send it up in under 5 minutes. But, the little card to accompany the surprise was not included. Again, no big deal. Thought nothing of it. Fast forward to the next day, my actual birthday. My guest and I hit the town for the majority of the day, returning early evening. Upon entry, I notice the card from yesterday WITH a plate of cookies (how thoughtful, I say to myself). THEN, I turn the corner to find a plate of birthday cupcakes with my OWN card signed by the entire concierge staff? Yes indeed, the sweetness overrunneth. FINALLY, as my guest and I sit down to enjoy piping hot Giordano's (the best in the city)--there's a knock at the door. It's Mirna the head concierge to apologize for forgetting the card yesterday and for the delayed delivery of the champagne with a tray of breadsticks and ice-cold beer !!! How did they know this would be the perfect addition to our meal?!? I have no idea, I just know I love them for it. Other Pros: Kiehl's bath products. Luxurious. Nightly turn-down service. Stayed two nights, two different cookies on my pillow. Room Service. See below After spending a few bucks at JBar before hitting the town the night before, we still had the majority of our food/beverage voucher to use the next morning before checkout. We. Went. Crazy. James Omelette for me (tri-tip steak, mushrooms, truffle oil, asiago cheese), Belgian Waffle for my guest. Hashbrowns, ham, juice, milk, & coffee to share. In a word? Delicious. Best room service I've ever eaten. They serve 24-hours a day too, including an enticing ""late-night"" menu which I'm surprised my guest and I didn't take advantage of--I think we passed out on the 300-thread count sheets before we picked up the phone. Cons? That I had to leave. You'll be seeing me again soon, James. Thanks for everything, you were the perfect start to a new birth year.",N
2248,"Not impressed at all!  I have stayed lots of hotels in the city and would NOT return to this one.  Customer service was horrible.  People could barely be bothered to help you...from the front desk to the bar staff.  It was pathetic.  While the historic tower was nice, be careful as they are currently doing renovation, and they begin working very early in the morning, everyday of the week.  Not at all impressed",N
3453,"Pro's: Price.  You cant find much of a better deal on Michigan Avenue then you will at The Allerton.  With all applicable fees + taxes our room was $140/night.   Location:  Right in the heart of Chicago.  A short walk to downtown, the river, and all sorts of shopping and restaurants.  Cheap cab ride to the musuems and the Sears Tower/Union Station area. Style:  I love the old school feel of certain hotels so I'm biased, but the Allerton was outstanding in this regard.  After a few drinks in the bar it wouldnt have been a far stetch to visualize it as being the 1920's...except for that whole Prohibition thing. Service:  The front desk attendants were somewhat standoffish, but all other hotel personel were very friendly. Con's: Tempurature:  It was fairly warm in our room and we couldnt lower the thermometer to offset the heat.  It seemed to be an innacurate read.  Overall not too bad, just something we noticed. This all being said I would recommend The Allerton to anyone.  It's a great experience overall.",N
941,"WELL.. where do I start. How about the good.. * Great location - right by Michigan avenue and all the shops * Across the street from Garrett's Popcorn! * Easy to find and get to... walking distance to so many places * Right next to the bus stop * Pretty friendly staff at the front desk * super cheap the bad: *dirty - rooms have not been kept up *small rooms - there was NO walking space *no desk *beds were very small and very low *bathroom is smaller than any other bathroom I have been too.. there is pretty much no room on the sink counter *lobby does not have a bathroom? isn't that weird? *room was not cleaned regularly *found a bug on the floor - do not walk around barefoot here *towels and amenities left something to be desired - the towels were so small they barely cover your body! *elevators are small, cramped, and chose to work when they wanted to In a nutshell... stay here if you do not plan to stay for long or are looking for a bargain room next to everything. Do not expect much.",N
1545,"I booked this hotel (1 king size bed, city view) through Expedia and managed to get a pretty good deal on it for the dates 12/28/09 - 1/1/10..  A few days later, I found it cheaper on Kayak and called Expedia for their price match guarantee.  I spent over two weeks waiting for them to process my credit before I called to check up.  They told me that the Kayak website did not specify the exact room (i.e. deluxe or not) so they couldn't credit my account.  I argued and ended up with a $50 credit.  Bleh, at least I got something. Anyways, as far as the actual hotel goes, it was better than average but not great.  It felt like a hotel that tried to be modern and hip but wasn't quite there yet.  Service was excellent with nothing to complain about.  Two elevators were available for my floor (they separate it into two halves, each with two elevators) and I never had to wait long.  Most of the time the elevator is already at the bottom waiting for you. Room was nice.  King sized bed was cozy and sheets were adequate.  I love the wireless connection in the room and used my laptop from the bed often.  I wish the TV was upgraded to a flat screen.  I used their business service center to print out my boarding pass the day before my flight and it was easy to do. The biggest downside of this hotel which is enough to dock off 2 stars for me is the bathroom.  First of all, I didn't like how the closet was located in there.  Second, no counter top?!?  All they had was a skinny ledge below the mirror which is barely enough to hold things.  The shower curtains were crimpled and the toilet was horrendous (weak flush and it kept making a pumping noise for a few seconds after you flush).  Tiles were old school and nothing to write home about. Besides the bathroom, everything else was good.  The biggest plus for this hotel is the location.  I found it very convenient to the Magnificent Mile (just a 5 minute walk) as well as the Metro stations. Would I stay here again?  Probably.",N
5124,"Second stay here and all was well. It was my birthday and after visiting our 4th floor room facing apts, a special request for a room with a view was cheerfully honored by CINTIA BECERRA at the front desk. She later sent a birthday card and cheesecake. Lovely.Another special nod to Jamael (?) who saw us wondering the historic tower and took time to answer question and unlock a few of the banquet rooms to show us around. Also took us to some of the conference areas and filled us in on the hotels history. Very nice man . Our room was clean, bed comfy plus and every staff member we encountered said hello and smiled. Little things mean alot when staying in hotels. Did I mention the historic pool? WOnderful!!",Y
911,"Another one of my indulgences is brunch.  A mimosa or bellini, a divinely prepared omelette or eggs benedict...yum.   Yet, I've struggeld to find this sort of experience...until now.  This is my third visit to the Atwood Cafe for brunch and I am now convinced. This is a marvelous, little gem!  The food is wonderful, the service superb and the mimosas are appropriately tasty.  Even more importantly, unlike some of the other brunch/breakfast places, you can make a reservation, the prices are incredibly cheap and space is wonderfully decorated.  Add the cute valet (that resembles Will Smith), the waiter with the catty...yet adorable accent, and you have the perfect Sunday afternoon.",N
42,"Decent price for downtown Chicago over a weekend.  Our room contained a air system which only produces heat in the winter and cold in the summer, so if it's one of those 80 degree days in February or March, I suppose you're screwed.  Piano in the lobby needs tuning.  Lobby is adjacent (attached opening) to Mike Ditka's.  Bed excellent, TV above average, bathroom and cleanliness meet the standards.",N
4067,"* This place was outdated 10 years ago - and hasn't been updated since! * I gave in and did something I usually don't do.  I stayed at the main conference hotel for a conference.  What was I thinking?  I usually like getting away from the crowds and having a little space to take a break.  But I remember last time I went to a conference in Chicago I hated walking around in the heat.  So I gave in and stayed at the Hyatt.   While it was good to avoid the heat, the hotel itself is outdated and has fairly pathetic ""service.""   I got upgraded to the Regency Club level (ok, that was a good plus) which is supposed to be a slightly better room, better amenities, and access to a club that serves breakfast, snacks, evening apps, late night desserts, etc.   I got to my room and found the electronic safe didn't work. (One of the buttons was broken.)  I also found that the desk chair had a broken arm.  I called the ""exceptional service"" button that is supposed to take care of any guest needs.  After waiting for about 7 minutes on hold (ugh) the woman said, ""Oh, safes are security's issue.  I'll connect you.""  So before I could tell her about the broken chair I was on hold with security.  I finally got through and told them the safe had a single broken button, but it was the important one that locks the safe!  He said he would send someone up right away.   While I was waiting I figured I'd call ""exceptional service"" and get the chair fixed too.  After another 8 minutes on hold I got the agent and she said they would have someone come up and fix it.   Nobody showed up for either issue.  I had to eventually leave, and when I got back later that night the safe was still not fixed, and neither was the chair.  There was no message and no note.  They ignored the issues.  I called again and went through the same run-around.  After 5 days at the hotel they never fixed the safe or the chair!  Sheesh! On the bright side, the Regency Club did have a nice view of the river and the lake (as did my room).  The breakfast wasn't terrible in the club (they actually had a pretty good quality lox).  I wish the bagels were fresher to match up to the lox though.  But I digress.   I did appreciate they had ample bottles of water to drag around in the heat, as well as some nice fresh fruit (the plums and peaches were particularly good).   Overall I'm not sure I will ever stay in a conference hotel again!  I will go back to my old conference strategy of finding a nice hotel nearby and enjoying the stay a bit more, while having a place to get away to as well during the craziness of the conference!",N
133,"I was in town for a conference, and they suggested the Whitehall.  First, the hotel is in a prime location near Rush Street and The Lake...Perfect for eating, drinking and jogging. This is a really different hotel.  Instead of a grand lobby like The Drake, it is rather small almost befitting a B&B.  The rooms, however, are spacious and lovely. Did I mention the rooms?",N
4545,"The lobby is breathtaking.  It is sooooo beautiful.  Coming here as a little girl, I was always in awe.  It is a famous and historic hotel in downtown Chicago and has been around since the 1920s.  Potter Palmer built the orginal in 1871 but it burnt down.  Definitely stay here if you get the chance, especially if you're a history buff.  I have always thought that having a wedding in the ballroom here would be amazing.  My sister and I also used to really enjoy the pool when we were younger and they seemed to have a nice fitness room. Give it a try, it is definitely a change of pace from all of the other chain hotels in the city.",N
1930,"Pretentious, much?  Stayed here with a discounted rate; I would have never paid full price for this snobbery. The W has a reputation for luxury, but I wouldn't consider this hotel luxurious. One of my friends said it best when he commented that staying at this hotel seems to come with the prerequisites of an eating disorder and a cocaine problem. The hotel just tries too darn hard. The lobby is dimly lit and full of mirrors like a 70s nightclub. The rooms are large, very clean, and somewhat well appointed, but definitely not worth the cash. The elevators literally made me want to puke with blacklights and holograms--seriously?! And for all of the ridiculous ""Welcome to the W, what's your wish"" nonsense, the people at the front desk were quite preoccupied by their personal cell phones. Parking's $51. Save yourself some cash and park at that Self Park down the street over night for $34.",N
25,"Breakfast no longer free, but the wifi is. The staff were friendly and responsive, and the price-for-location hard to beat.",N
2076,"I had my wedding here two weeks ago and absolutely everything about the whole weekend was perfect. Barbara Martin is the wedding coordinator and was just amazing. She is organized, makes your feel very comfortable and confident, attentive and responsive. Everything a bride needs leading up to her wedding! Although my husband and I live in Chicago - almost all of our family friends do not, so almost all of our 115 guests were staying at the hotel. It was very easy to get a room block that could accommodate and everyone we spoke to since the wedding has nothing but amazing things to say about their experience, the rooms, service and of course - the views!! Mart Plaza starts on the 15th floor of the Chicago Suntimes building and looks out over the river and the Chicago skyline. They also give the bride/groom and the bride/groom's parents their room free the night of the wedding. This is on top of their VERY reasonably priced rooms for wedding blocks. In addition, my husband's parents are divorced and they gave both sets of parents the free night. The ceremony, cocktail reception, and move into the reception was swift and flawless. The food was delicious. I really feel this venue provides a huge amount of value for your money. I highly, highly recommend the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza for your wedding!!",N
4472,"I must say that I was extremely disappointed with my stay at the Palmer House. Upon first entering the lobby of the hotel, I was very impressed. The ambiance is one of elegance and the presentation was amazing. I was very excited to complete the check-in process and make my way to my room. I knew that there was something strange upon check in - the representative said something about me being in a suite and how that was too large for one person. He then proceeded to downgrade my reservation to a standard room despite my assertion that I did not want to make that change. Dismayed with the check in process I made my way to my room which only increased my frustration with the hotel. The room was small, very small. Although the hotel had recently been renovated, the impression I got was that not much thought had been put into the design/layout of these rooms. The bathroom was terribly small. The toilet was the centerpiece of the room and from there you could adjust the water in the shower or do your hair in the mirror. Okay, so maybe that is a bit of an exaggeration but not much. The only redeeming quality about this room was that the bed was comfortable and clean. Of note - the hotel did not offer wireless internet, the elevators were very slow, and none of the staff seemed overly friendly or engaged. Furthermore, while dining at their main restaurant, I had to wait nearly an hour to get a check after our server went missing. In summary, this will be my first and my last stay at the hotel. If you're only requirement is an impressive lobby, this is the place. If you are looking for comfort and service, I'd recommend you book elsewhere.",N
1119,"There really isn't any other word to describe the Fairmont Hotel other than classy!  It is such a fantastic hotel with a beautiful lobby and great rooms.  I've been to parties here and the ballrooms are wonderful and the guest rooms are very nice as well.  They also have Aria inside the hotel which is a bonus also!  If you are looking for a really nice hotel for out of towners, this is it!",N
1703,"My friend's company had an event here, and I went along as his date. This hotel has more of a modern twist to it than, say, the Drake or the Palomar House. The lobby and the suites are decked out in geometric and Art Deco patterns -- some pretty wacky and colorful, but tasteful at the same time. The room was smaller than average and lacked a decent view, but it did have a very nice flat screen TV and French doors leading to the bathroom. The booklets on the desk would have been helpful to me had I been a tourist. We had complimentary drinks in the lobby before dinner, along with some delicious little hors d'oeuvres. The banquet room is a little more old-world looking than the rest of the hotel. All the food was pretty delicious, from the Caesar salad to the chicken to the chocolate cake and coffee. The round tables for eight were nice and roomy. Sometimes I feel squished in and crowded at banquet tables, but not here. After dinner, we had some more drinks at Encore, the hotel bar. The round bar in the middle is nicely designed, and the cocktails are prepared with care rather than quickly thrown together. Bottom line, if you love Art Deco and want to stay somewhere close to the theater district in the city, this may be a good option. But with more classic hotels in the area offering similar prices and more of an old-Chicago atmosphere, I'd rather stay at one of those.",N
5620,"This is a great business travel hotel. The location is ideal, on Dearborn half a block from the river and within walking distance to all of downtown Chicago.  The staff are helpful and courteous.  The rooms are comfortable (in the typical Starwood style).  Rooms have wireless internet that actually works.  The Executive Center is comfortable and well-stocked with coffee/tea, breakfast, and daily newspapers.   The hotel also has other above-and-beyond touches like complimentary evening cocktails and umbrellas on a rainy day.   I would gladly stay here again.",N
1896,"The comfiest beds that I can recall.  We were so in love with the bed that we were looking at their in-room catalog for the purchase price.  On an extended July 4th holiday, we would find ourselves in bed until two because we'd just loose track of time.  However, since the W is so centrally located, we found ourself doing all of the following, four days: 1 Wrigley game, 1 US Cellular game, several trips to the Taste, a numerous other touristy stuff, and 1 Nine Inch Nails concert at Tweeter. The rooms had a very modern appeal and the towels were very lush.  The square footage was small, but they made good use of their space to seem bigger. Quick room service.  Love the apples and little nooks in the lobby.  Two bars, one in the lobby and a larger one with a street entrance. Parking on the street is not difficult, especially at night.  But, you could also have them valet it for $39 per evening.",N
3138,"I recently stayed at the W Lakeshore for a few days and as time progressed I was less and less impressed with the joint. The rooms (and hotel) is pretty modern, but you can tell it was a holiday inn that got converted. Although my room wasn't bad, a friend of mine got stuck with a really crappy room where the wallpaper was peeling off, the shades were broken, and the shower wasn't the rain shower advertised. I had a ""city view"" room and wasn't impressed with the view. Basically it was looking directly into another hotel or office building, and looking down into an alley. Lake view rooms are the way to go. The W however does shine in the attention to detail department. If you are able to focus listening to the techno music in the elevator you would see the floor mats are updated throughout the day to say ""Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening"", which is something I haven't seen at any other hotel. I attended a wedding on here and the ballroom was converted to a very intimate setting, which was unexpected. The reception was held on the 33rd floor in a nice hall overlooking the lake and city. This was the best part of my stay here. The Whiskey Sky bar on the 33rd floor is dark and small, and drinks are expensive. After one drink in here I had to take off as I couldn't stand being unable to see my hand in front of my face and couldn't move without bumping into someone. Picture being in a walk in closet with the lights off and you'll get the same feel as this place. As others have reported, the lobby doubles as a lounge for the first floor bar at night, so if possible try to avoid this area at night. You won't be able to hear anyone working the counter, and they won't be able to hear you. If you aren't  in 'clubbing' attire you probably will catch a few unwelcoming glances by the older crowd drinking at the bar. Another disappointing  aspect of this joint is the pool on the 7th floor. It leaves much to be desired. Also, don't go into this place looking for a hot tub, because there isn't one to be found. Very surprising for such an expensive place. The gym however looked pretty nice, with free weights, machines, a cardio deck and kettle balls. All in all, if you want to get more bang for your buck, stay somewhere else in the city. If you do find yourself staying here, get a lake view room and hope for good weather so you aren't trapped in a real life version of A Night at the Roxbury.",N
186,"I recently had a wonderful stay at this Hilton location. The linens and curtains were surprisingly modern and tasteful (unlike at some hotels - ahem, plaid, floral, etc!) in neutral colour offerings and the suite was very spacious. The hotel itself was very quiet and insulated from all outside noise. I booked the room using http://www.hotwire.com (highly recommended). The hotel was perfectly located in the popular ""Magnificent Mile"" near several subway lines. If you want to experience ""the windy city"" this is the place to do it as there are so many tall buildings surrounding it, it's constantly blowing!! Conveniently located right across from the John Hancock building. The only downside is the internet - you can get wi-fi in your room but it's expensive ($12.95/day) or you can use the business centre if you're even MORE of a moneybags (pay by the minute I think). IMO it should be more affordable, especially for such a large hotel. Would definitely stay there again for a no fuss, flexible stay. Check in/check out times were reasonable and they gladly held our bags for no charge after we had checked out so we could enjoy our final day without baggage.",N
3659,"This place is famous right? Right. I gotta say that I was a little disappointed. This place feels pretty shabby chic. A little more shabby than chic. The carpets were worn. The tiles were cracked. The bathroom was really quite sad. As I walked the corridors, when I wasn't thinking about Marilyn Monroe or Diana staying in the same place, I was half expecting to see some kid on a trike yelling Red Rum! Red Rum! Creepy corridors kids. All in all a bit disappointing. I don't know that I would stay here again. It would seem that the old hotel has lost its charm and needs a serious makeover. Stacey? Clinton?",N
5037,"I was put up here for a business trip awhile back. I actually have family in the area, but didn't want to totally invade. I heard this was top-notch and thought, ""what the hell, why not?""I was glad to hear that they were open to pets. Because I do spend quite a bit of time with family/friends in Chicago, I wanted to extend my business trip a bit and bring the fam/dog along with me. The dog thing earned them 2 stars, but the rest of the hotel was fairly unimpressive. I am not one to bitch a moan about a free trip, but if I was coming out-of-pocket with that kind of money, there are far nicer hotels in Chicago I think.  I wouldn't call the staff ""rude"" as much as ""inattentive"". No one is jumping up to help you or offer you exemplary service. Which, hey, if I'm at the Red Roof Inn, I'm not looking for it, but the W? come on people!I guess the design/layout is nice for the modern feel they are going for, but it's simply not my style. In addition, location-wise, it's good for the view, but there are far better options close to the mag mile.",Y
2798,"I'll come back to this hotel. Rooms: 1 bedroom king suite was perfect for my needs. The bedroom was simple and closed off, which is exactly what I like. The living area had a couch, a chair, table with an office chair. The room also came with a rerigerator as well. Very clean, well-maintained. My only complaint was that central air didn't seem to work too well and I like to keep my rooms very cool. Evening manager's reception: well liquor drinks, 2 draft beers (MGD and miller lite). The snacks are very decent- on a Sunday night, it was pita bread with spinach & artichoke dip and fresh vegetables with ranch. Breakfast in the morning: The cooks who make your cooked-to-order breakfast are VERY nice! There is a variety of cereal, juices, fruits, and other hot breakfast items. Workout room has 3 treadmills, 2 elipticals and a stationary bike. There are mats and hand weights as well. Hotel has on-sight valet parking. It's underground and the valet staff are very friendly. Parking is $46/night. Starbucks is in the same building, but you do need to go outside to the corner of Ohio and State.",N
4820,Very nice roof top deck over looking the city.Take people from out of town to see Chicago from one top of the building. Food is OK try the pizza the other food is just bar food.Did not like the attitude of the staff. They are trying to create the feeling of an exclusive club. Its hard to get in on Friday and Saturday nights. Good for out of town people to visit.,Y
4066,"I've got nothing bad to say about this hotel. Stayed here on Sunday for just 1 night, the bed was very comfy and the view from the 30 Fl was pretty sweet. I'd agree with some comments about the check-in, not the easiest process, they seem to ignore you and then have some dude come up to you (kinda creepy) from behind and ask if everything is cool. Other than that, the stay was fine, the Big Bar downstairs is not a bad place to get some drinks at the end of the night as well.",N
182,"I grew up in Chicago and  early last month I came with my four year old son for a visit.  We had a horrible experience with the front desk but everything else was perfect.  I really liked the rooms and every other experience with the hotel staff was just fine.   Here's where I found impressive.  After I filled out the survey, the head of security emailed me because I'd only rated his department an 8 out of 10.  I told him that I could have very easily given him a 10 but I found it ironic that he'd reached out to me because it was the front desk I had a horrible experience with.   So he connected me with the head of rooms.  After much phone and email tag, I finally was able to communicate why the front desk fell WAAAAAAAAAAAAY SHORT.  The rooms manager then gave me a free certificate for my next stay.  Wow.  Totally unexpected.  That's awesome. Guess we'll be staying there again.",N
449,"This hotel is decent, and certainly cheap, with the bare necessities. I stayed for 4 nights splitting a room w/2 beds with 3 other people.  There is no continental breakfast, but ""Awake with pearl"" sells amazing breakfast sandwiches.  The rooms don't have a coffee maker, microwave, or refrigerator.  The neighborhood is kind of desolate, and there are not many restaurants or shops around, but it's very close to the McCormick Place convention center. They lose a star because they messed up my bill, and some staff members were a bit ornery at times.  A good place to stay if you can do without the works.",N
2239,"Hotwire listed this hotel as 4 1/2 stars, frankly it hardly qualifies as 3 stars.  While the location is fantastic, the hotel itself leaves a little to be desired. I got a great rate through hotwire, but if I would have paid the regular rate I would have been furious. The decor was tacky with peeling wallpaper and stained carpet and there was no mini bar or fridge in the room. Our friends in the room next to us had a mini bar, but we did not. The maids did a horrible job at cleaning the room and did no more than pull the covers up over the bed. Also, there was no umbrella in the room....if you are staying in a rainy city like Chicago you should have an umbrella in the closet! The room was very small and standard. There is nothing elegant about this hotel at all, Hotwire needs to update their rating.",N
306,"I recently stayed overnight at the City Suites. It was chosen due to the close proximity to the point of my visit to Chicago. I could not have got more lucky! So close to so many restaurants and shops, and as many have mentioned, the subway. Again not for light sleepers! The staff here was so helpful and really accommodating of all of my random and somewhat demanding requests. The rooms and common areas are clean and well kept. One of the nicest hotel bathrooms I have ever seen! The lobby was so quaint and throughout may stay had guests just relaxing & chatting by the fireplace. My first choice for a hotel in this area and I will be back.",N
1077,"Overpriced, poor service. Generally when I go to a place that costs around $400 a night I expect to be treated well and it to be a memorable experience. When I got there the king size bed I reserved was not available so my girlfriend and I had to spend the weekend sharing a double. The concierge had attitude and offered nothing for our inconvenience. We go into the restaurant to get more attitude from the waitress, who forgot out drinks and made us feel unwelcome. I travel a lot, and often get better service in more stylish rooms for half the cost. I'll never stay in a fairmont again, I suggest anyone who has a choice do the same.",N
4155,"First the good: 1. Great location. Very close to Michigan Ave, where all the stores & restaurants are, and the river. It's a beautiful walk from this hotel to the river and other locations. Navy pier is a 20 minute walk. 2. The hotel is huge, could be a plus or minus for some, for me it didn't make a difference. 3. Extremely nice staff at check in 4. River view if you are on a high floor and if you get a room with a view (duh) 5. Could be great value if you get a low rate The bad: 1.  The person who designed the lay out of the bathroom should be fired. The toilet paper holder (w/ the toilet paper naturally) was behind the toilet. That was really annoying as you can imagine. The water pressure was bad. They had a curtain instead of a glass door in the shower. The sink was not comfortable to use. 2. Parking was extremely expensive - $50 per night. 3. No refrigerator. If you open the mini bar and take something out, even without opening it, you get charged because the bar is activated by a motion sensor. 4. Kind of felt like they nickled and dimed you for everything. 5. Bad TV channels, nothing to watch, no HBO. 6. The coffee shop down stairs was expensive, but I guess it's not the hotel's fault. 7. No pool. Overall, I am not sure if  I would have stayed here over another similar hotel in the same price range, but if the price was low I would stay here just because the location is so great. Tip: ""like"" their FB page and you could get discounts for the room and/or parking and you can even make requests.",N
300,"I was pleasantly surprised by City Suites. It has an amazing location, right by lots of restaurants and bars. It took us 10 minutes to walk to Belmont Harbor! I was a little freaked out at first by the proximity to the Red Line station. You can hear the trains all day and night, but I got used to it pretty quickly. Inside the room, the bed linens and amenities were nice. It had a fancy tv and a very well stocked mini bar. They also have 24 hour coffee/tea in the lobby and a nice little continental breakfast. There was also no problem with an early check in as we arrived a lot earlier than anticipated. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating (nice to look at too)!!! The rooms are pretty small which is standard in big cities. We didn't have a lot of room for our luggage (I did overpack though). I would definitely recommend this place to a friend and will be staying here when I return to Chicago.",N
806,"Excellent hotel because of the prompt service and location! We found deals on Travelzoo and were so happy with the location. Less than a mile away from all of the shopping, restaurants, the beach, and clubs/bars. My only complaint is that the walls were paper thin and we all got pretty loud and some point but no one ever came to complain.  I would definitely stay here again!!",N
3582,"Where is the ability to post a photo for a review on here?  I can't find it, because I took a shot of the cheese platter that my partner and I shared at the Palm Court during our stay there this weekend. And that is where our story begins, my dear readers.  A cheese platter with Town House crackers on one side, and Clubhouse on the other?  Yep, you read that right.  Oh, how the Drake has fallen on hard times, I thought, especially when I heard that they just did a Groupon for High Tea there.  Has it come to that?  Before they do a deal with Groupon, Sun-Times' new WantsaDeal, or any other--- I would suggest they get their house in order. Now, since I stayed there the whole weekend, I feel a bit entitled to comment across the board on the Drake.  I've lived in Chicago for 17+ years (most of my adult life), so I never stay at a hotel in town, but it felt like a luxury to treat my partner to his birthday weekend at a hotel that, for me, conjured images of Mad Men, high style, and impeccable service. I won't go into the coordination ""challenges"" with organizing a group of 30 friends for late night dessert and drinks, but I will say that when the evening was complete and I was ready for bed, I found out we were ""conveniently"" placed next to a bridal party, who sounded as though they were in our room.  In fact, at 7 the next morning, these people hosted guests (more like the entire party.. people were literally in the hallway!!) in their room (which was not a suite). Really? The hotel allows that, when there's nothing but a hollow door that separates rooms?  As my partner said, he's never been in a hotel of the Drake's status in which you could literally hear the people right next to you. We capped off our stay with an $80 breakfast for 2 at Drake Bros that consisted of: a waiter who tried to push the buffet on us (lazy), 1 order of cold brioche french toast (3 small slices), 2 Drake Breakfasts (my ""aged pork loin"" was a shriveled up small slice of cold, bland ham), and water.  Ouch to lack of value. The Drake could be so much more than what's it's become-- a tourist destination for bridal parties, or girls, their Mother's, and their American dolls.  In fact, if they took a page from some great hotels in New York (e.g., Gramercy Park Hotel) that have emerged as hip, local destinations that still appeal to travelers-- with cool furnishings, but with nods to the past, it could be so much more successful.  Instead of cheese trays with Keebler Crackers, and restaurants with names like ""Cape Cod Room"" written in rope and ""Lobster Thermador"" on the menu (OML, Gordon Ramsey would have a field day here), it really needs to be brought into the 21st Century.  A nod to Mad Men, but contemporized.   But, please, start with eliminating the ""cheesy"" crackers and soundproofing the rooms. As a post script to this review, the Drake graciously accepted our feedback, apologized, and ""made it right by us"".  That's a classy start and I respect them and would give them another chance.",N
2398,"I stayed here for a staycation and was really disappointing.  We were on the executive level so we had access to refreshments and a continental breakfast.  The executive floor is crawling with kids who are un-supervised.  I'm fine with kids but there were no adults to be found to supervise them and then no one was staffing the executive room on the Hilton side.  It was rather frustrating.   The beds were worn down and the bathrooms were pretty small.  Ours only had one bathroom, but I've heard some have two.  The room itself was also small.   There was a stain on our sheets so we ended up sleeping on the to sheet because by the time we realized the stain it was midnight and we were exhausted. I guess I just think for the cost of this hotel there are better options in this city.",N
1834,"Didn't have a good experience here.  Granted I booked late, and so I paid a very high rate (around $450) and they still put me in this tiny room that makes solitary confinement look comfortable.  They called it a ""Cozy Room"" or something like that.  The front desk attendant offered me some snacks to make up for it, and they never arrived.  I called the front desk to ask and they promised they'd send them up.  Never arrived. I can't tell you how awful the room was.  I couldn't use the restroom as my knees were too long and hit the sink.  I had to leave the bathroom to dry off.  It was not possible to sit at the desk as the bed bumped into the table.  Really awful experience. I'm only giving it a second star because I know the rest of the hotel is much nicer, but be careful what room you get.",N
4669,"Nice boutique hotel. Rooms are smaller than what I'm use to staying in, but the great customer service at the hotel made up for it. Like I said rooms are small, and so is the bathroom. I like the decor but didn't like the way the shower was designed. The hotel staff was very friendly and catered to every need. Hotel lobby bar was very small, only about 6 bar stools but they did have a little lounge area next to it. Overall good experience and the the hotel was within walking distance to a lot of restaurants and shops.",N
391,"I thought it was a great hotel for the rate we got.  Plus, it was a last minute decision to get a hotel out there for the weekend and it was pretty cheap for a 2-bed room.  I was thinking because it was downtown, not far from Michigan Ave that it would cost us a lot, but the room was 69.50 + tax it ended up being 86.50ish, and we split that in half with my friend and her boyfriend, so it was pretty affordable.   I was surprised that the room had a mini-kitchen that included a microwave and mini-fridge.  I didn't expect to see that, but very convenient if you had some leftovers you wanted to reheat for a late-night munchie.  When we checked in, the front desk was very nice and told us all the amenities that were available to us.  And when we checked out, they were bright-eyed and welcomed us down with a 'good morning'.   The room was good, the beds were a bit soft, but doable.  They had a nice flat screen to watch some late-night television and plenty of storage space.  The room served it's purpose and for the most part, pretty quiet, I will say the walls are pretty thin...I could hear the other room's TV going on.  But the price was nice and that's what we like!  The room was clean and we enjoyed our stay.  I can't really say how much parking was because didn't park our car there.  Luckily my sister lives out there and we parked our car at her place and had her drop us off at the hotel.  So, all in all, great place to bunk.",N
1015,"Similar to many of the other reviews, the Amalfi has many strong points and a few drawbacks.  The room was comfortable enough and I liked the fresh colors and contemporary feel.  The jazz and soul music collections are a nice touch.  I really enjoyed the cocktail reception with the appetizers and signature drink, the Amalfitini.  The continental breakfast served on each floor was also well done.  Finally, the location is central to many of the popular downtown destinations. I'd have given the Amalfi 4 stars if not for a couple problems.  First the room, while appealing in decor, looked a little like it had been done on the cheap.  Some of the furnishings looked good but didn't have the level of quality as comparable hotels.  Plus, the carpet was really dirty in spots.  Since the place is really new, I suspect it's going to look worn before long.  There is no view as others pointed out, and the street noise can be troubling.  Finally, we had a billing issue where the rate didn't match what we'd booked on the internet.  We got it worked out but it punctuated a decent but not great stay. The overall value can be really good if you get a favorable rate.  If not, and you want an interesting newer place to stay in the same neighborhood, try the Hotel Sax.",N
844,"This review is a bit overdue.  I stayed for a conference at McCormick Place in December.  I got a really good deal through TravelZoo.  I followed the advice of another Yelper and checked in using my Yelp app and was upgraded to a suite (you can also use Foursquare to receive the same upgrade).   First of all, the location is great.  The temperature was in the teens and I was able to take the L from Midway and didn't have to walk more than a few yards to get to the front door of the hotel.  And the subway station to O'Hare for the trip home was only a couple blocks.  Having to go to McCormick Place which was south of the hotel and want to visit the theater district and Magnificent Mile, the location was very convenient.  So, if you're without a car, this is a nice place to stay. The hotel and room is a bit dated, but as many have said, it is clean and the rooms are relatively large.  I was traveling alone, but if I was with others, the roomy bathroom would definitely be a plus.  My suite had large windows in the bedroom, so since it was cold, there was a bit of a battle between the heater and the coldness coming off the windows, but it was not a major issue.  As far as the train goes, you do hear it.  However, it's not noticeable if you are accustomed to city noises.  If you need silence, this isn't the place.  But that's not to say that it's noisy, either.  As a matter of fact, besides the noise you might expect from outside, it almost seemed as if there were only a few people staying at the hotel. The free internet was nice, but I did have some problems with it.  The signal was intermittent, so at times my screen would freeze when loading or refreshing.  It would definitely be nice if wireless was available throughout the hotel. USA Today is available on weekdays, but don't expect it on your doorstep.  I like a leisurely morning where I can relax and read the paper in the morning, so I was just a tad disappointed when the first morning I found out I had to pick up the paper at the front desk. A couple times, I had problems with my key card and had to get it reset.  Again, a minor convenience. Considering the location and what the hotel offers, I would say that overall staying at The Silversmith is a great value.  If you don't need the features of the bigger hotels offer and don't insist on modern decor, this may be one of the best hotels in the area in terms of value.",N
3795,"Love, love, LOVED my room. I got a standard king bed, but the room was very spacious. I think it might have been the floor-to-ceiling windows...even if they did face a high-rise condo building. So don't walk around in your undies, ladies and gentlemen. The shower was uh-mazing with a rain showerhead and see-thru glass wall into the bedroom. Again, don't forget to pull those shades :) Every night while I was gone to dinner, they came and did a turn-down service and left these adorable chocolate-dipped fortune cookies. Me likey! And the gym has the coolest equipment I've ever seen. They have two treadmills with TV, Ipod and Radio options (and personal fans), an elliptical with the same options, and a stair stepper. I think I saw a stationary bike or two. They also have free weights, exercise balls and these wall units that looks like a bow-flex machine. Oh - and they provide ice water and towels so don't worry about bringing your own. The only thing that bothered me during the trip was the elevators. You have to put your card in to get to your floor, and I'm all about safety, but you literally have seconds to do it before the elevator doors shut and you're sent off to whoever pushed a button on their floor. Very frustrating when all you're trying to do is get to your room. Other than that, I'll definitely be back to Dana...the location rocks for getting around.",N
489,"Spent this past weekend in Chicago and stayed (with 4 ""young adults + husband).  Booked two rooms, the kids stayed in one, hubby and I in the other.  There was plenty of room, even with 4 in a room.  Kids complained that pullout sofa was uncomfortable, as most of them are, but in the end, they slept pretty soundly as evidenced by the fact that we had to wake them up each morning!   The real draw for us was 1) location - within walking distance of Navy Pier, Michigan Ave. and many of the major attractions, and 2) free buffet breakfast and happy hour.  Buffet breakfast was pretty eh, the made-to-order breakfast (omlets, etc. are a better option) and the nightly happy hour gets so crowded you almost WANT to pay for your drink if it makes the line move faster.   Also, don't go there looking for top-shelf - it ain't happening!  They really should figure out some way to make this run more smoothly.   This property is somewhat older, but it is in very good condition; rooms and public areas were very clean and service was top-notch.  We arrived about 2-1/2 hours before the 4pm check-in, but the rooms were ready and they allowed us to check in early.  The elevators are a little on the slow side, particularly during the breakfast buffet and evening happy hour, when everyone seems to be wanting to travel at the same time.",N
5136,"We had our wedding ceremony and reception at the Wolf Point ballroom on March 19, 2011. The wedding coordinator Barbara Martin is a true profeesional. I don't think she could have been any better. The view is AMAZING and the venue affordable for downtown Chicago. You will not regret your decision to book your wedding at the holiday inn mart plaza. They even through in free parking for the bride and groom parents, free hotel suites, and free bruch the next day...and the wedding cake is including and that was great too. All in all I can't say enough good things about the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza. Our guests couldn't beleive how nice it was",Y
2503,"One of the best hotels in the city by far.  After attending fundraisers, conferences and overnight visits at this hotel, I have come to appreciate it more and more.  The staff (no matter if they are waiting on you or you are working with them for an event) are excellent.  Very comfortable rooms too.  Also...little hint...the majority of the time you can get excellent deals on this hotel on hotwire!",N
2434,"This really feels like an old-time big city hotel.  Its grand in many ways, and the location can't be beat.  Right on Michigan Ave, its a short cab ride or a long-ish walk to the shops in one one direction and Soldier Field in the other.  If you're visiting in the summer, the park is literally across the street, and the view of the lake is perfect.   The lobby is very impressive, as you would expect from these grand old hotels, and if you get a chance, peek into the ballrooms and look up.  Really impressive - there are a lot of elements you will find throughout the property that has the charm you won't find at the more modern Hyatt convention/hotel places.  Of course the tradeoff is that rooms may be a bit smaller and the fixings are a bit dated. I had a corner room which provided great views through multiple windows, but I sense that it could be a little drafty on cold, windy winter days.  Overall though, very cozy and comfortable.  I'd recommend this hotel for out of town visitors, especially those with kids because there's room to run around in the lobby floors, and great access to the park and lake.",N
770,"This Westin really does a disservice to the brand. My husband and I are loyal SPG customers and tend to stay on points whenever we travel. For a two night stay in Chicago in June 2010 we were choosing between the W and the Westin and we really chose poorly! The room was barely passable, the bathroom was moldy and the service was indifferent at best. There are lots of great hotels in Chicago - do yourself a favor and stay at one of those.",N
4408,Ah the Palmer House. Old world craftsmanship my friend. They dont make them like this anymore. Amazing lobby. Great rooms on the 13th floor. Some are ridiculously huge. Bars and the restaurant are servicable but I still love this place. I find myself in rotation between here  the James and the Conrad  when I hit the big city. Always happy to go back to the House...,N
2716,"I'd recommend this spot to anyone. It's a hip little property that isn't trying too hard, staffed by people who are trying just hard enough. Husband and I took a mid-week vacation here when they had a ridiculous anniversary sale that we couldn't pass up.  Every person we came into contact with throughout our stay was fantastic: friendly, helpful, and thorough. The staff at the door, at the counter, in the fitness center, in the halls, all professional and courteous. The room was how I like them: modern but comfy with cookies on the pillows and great entertainment centers. We made ourselves at home and lived picnic style off the Trader Joe's across the street. The bathroom was amazing, sporting the best toiletries possible: 4-oz bottles of Kiehls shampoo, conditioner, and body wash with a Garden Botanika oatmeal cleansing bar. First time I have EVER used a hotel conditioner on my hair. Thanks to the maid for hooking me up with a few for the road... The gym smelled like ranch dressing, but I'm sure there was a perfectly legitimate and temporary reason for this. It's small but wasn't crowded any of the times we went. Individual TVs on the cardio equipment, with better-than-airplane-quality disposable/free (depending on your perspective) headphones. And pitchers of orange water, so refreshing. :) Will definitely be back as soon as I can convince a visiting guest to pay for lodging and let me stay with them, for a change.",N
5593,"Great location ... DAMN, is everything expensive ... rooms are pretty nice but not out-of-this world good. Was a bit ticked off that despite the standard nightly rate going above $340, they still want to ding you $9.99 a night to use internet. Really? Anyway, that led to another argument until they agreed to give it for free.",N
2774,This is the cutest boutique hotel and most convenient.  Its right across Lawrys and close to the Magnificent Mile.    They also give out Frederick Fekkai Shampoo and Conditioner which I have been hooked on every since I went to the hotel 4 years ago.,N
2658,"The James is easily a 5-star hotel, truly one of the best I've ever stayed in.  The minute you step onto the sidewalk from your taxi The James is there for you, from opening doors, carrying your luggage, to checking you in, making sure you have all the necessities you need to ensure a comfortable stay. We were checked into room 604, which my mother wasn't too happy about since she was afraid we would be disturbed in our sleep from traffic below - but we had nothing to worry about, since we slept comfortably all 4 nights, without hearing a single peep from outside (or the hallways).  The only noticeable sounds you might hear are from next door when they're taking a shower - and you only hear that if you're in the bathroom. I didn't have a problem with the tiny elevators, but they could be a little bit bigger and faster.  Our room (I say ""our"" because we noticed some rooms were bigger/smaller than others when we took a peek during turn-down service) was big enough for 3, minimal, simple, and modern, just like the rest of the hotel.  The bathroom was a bit small, but who cares?  'Cause the best part?  The James is amazingly, fantastically, awesomely CLEAN.  I've stayed in enough hotels to know that sometimes the maids get super lazy and don't give a shit about keeping the rooms clean.  But the housekeeping and turn-down service (delicious cookies every night!) at The James is top-notch. Since The James is a boutique hotel, the employees (specifically the doormen) recognized us and often greeted us by our names - which was very impressive.  There's a Trader Joe's across the street on one side, which is super convenient if you want to grab a quick snack, lunch, and/or dinner.  There are plenty of other restaurants near by such as Grand Lux Cafe (across the street), if you want something a bit more formal.  There's also a Marshall's, which came in super handy for us because by the third day, my mother wanted a pair of sneakers 'cause her feet were so tired from walking in heels.  And when it rained?  Marshall's was crowded 'cause everyone was trying to purchase an umbrella!  The James is also just a short block away from the Mag Mile. Again, The James is truly and easily one of the best hotels I've ever come across and I would definitely stay here again, no doubt about that.",N
5811,"Housekeeping staff here needs lessons--dusty fixtures, dirty glasses left in room, coffee and cups not replaced, room not vaccuumed, soap and towels not replaced.

4504,"Historic old hotel with a lovely lobby and bar area.  My boyfriend and I stayed here over our anniversary for semi-cheap because we booked on Hotwire or Priceline or some damn thing.

I'd happily come back, though!",N
3615,"I seem to stay at The Drake during nice weather days only.  It is on the South end Of Michigan Ave, and a short way onto one of my favorite running routes: Lake Michigan. It seems to be authentic.  It is, however, now the Hilton Drake, which could be an ominous sign for any vestige of uniqueness.  The ambiance is striking in a refined traditional manor.  A woman was playing the harp in the bar, which is nice The rooms are decent, but you are paying for location.  If it is freezing cold outside stay at The House of Blues.",N
3306,"It was ok.  It was a hotel.  Robert Plant overlooked our toilet and bed.  I hated the shower, as it was the kind with an opening to the bathroom, half a wall of glass- no way to retain heat, or double up on bathroom use if necessary.  Check in and out were smooth, valet service nice.  Wish we had had time to go from floor to floor checking out memorabilia.",N
3968,"I couldn't have been more unhappy with my stay at the Congress Plaza Hotel. Check-in went all right, although I'm still pretty sure that the check-in woman at the front desk never looked up from typing, she was short and rude while assigning me a room key - not the way you want your guests to see a first impression.     After getting to our room, we discovered that even though it's an old hotel, they had upgraded their TV's, to probably 26 inch flat screens, a nice touch. Only then to discover that THERE IS NO HEAT IN THE ROOM. After realizing I could not control the temperature in the room, I phoned the front desk and ask about the heat and I was rudely informed ""there's no heat in the entire building."" This is Chicago, and even in October it's cold, I can't imagine anyone staying in this hotel in the Winter - you will spend all your time under the covers or in the shower.     That brings me to the shower. The shower head was detached from the wall, hanging 2-3 inches off the wall (as in broken, not by design). The water pressure was more like a leaky pipe. Also it took forever to get the water warm (like 5 minutes) and I mean warm, not hot, it was never hot.     I tried to get a late check out as we wanted to walk around the city for a while before our flight out later in the day and they would not accommodate that, a fairly common request among hotel guests. We had to check out by the time given, and were told we could leave our luggage with the bell hop for free while we toured the city.     After checking out at the front desk, I was directed to the bell hop station to check my luggage. After waiting in line for 25 minutes I set my bags down to be checked - the bell hop asked if one of my bags was a computer to which I said ""yes."" He then rudely told me I could not store my computer there, that I would have to go to the front desk and have it checked by security. I asked him why no one at the front desk had bothered to tell me this when I checked out and asked where to check my things, and he responded ""that's not my job!"" I explained to him that I was aware of that, but a friendly suggestion to let the front desk people know that would go far with the guests. He literally got in my face, told me he didn't like my attitude and refused to check my bag. Mind you, I was upset, but I was not yelling, nor was I raising my voice or being out of line.     I then walked to the front desk, explained the situation to the 6 girls chatting behind the front desk and they stared at me like I was from outer-space. The one girl who handled my check out said ""well how was I supposed to know you had a computer?"" I responded with ""why don't you just tack on to everyone you tell about the baggage check, ""also, if you have a computer with you, we need to store it in a separate room with Security."" I am not joking, it's like I was trying to teach them complex math equations, they stared at me blankly like they didn't understand customer service. Security finally came and stored my bags for me. Mind you, I don't have a problem with storing laptops separately, in fact I think it's a great idea considering their baggage check is right next to the front door which is easily accessible to thieves. I just had a problem with no one taking any responsibility and not one hotel employee showing any care for customer service.     I apologize for this being so long winded, but I felt this was a story that needed to be told. I'm 32 years old, I'm not some old man who just complains about everything. I stay in dozens of hotels all year long, and this by far was the worst experience I've had in probably 10 years. I've never more in my life felt like I wasted money on something.",N
3772,"My fiancee and I celebrated the night we were engaged with a stay at the Dana. The front desk guy kindly upgraded us to a corner king room with a city facing view. It was GORGEOUS! If I could wake up there every single morning for the rest of my life with that view--I'd die a happy lady! Back story, we're hotel snobs. Even in our home city, we've stayed in nearly all of the higher end hotels for ""stay-cations."" While the Dana has a great location and very nice rooms, it's only drawback is that it's starting to show a little bit of wear and tear around the edges. Little scuffs and nicks are easy to clean up by maintenance staff, but really go a long way to keeping the hotel looking ""nice and new."" I love the fact that they have little bags of goodies on the nightstand for mini bar treats. Most hotels offer the same stiff and boring goodies, pretzels...mix nuts...cookies...BLAH! Forget that! The Dana has gummy bears, chocolate covered dried fruit, chocolate covered cookies, toffee squares...you name it! YUM! The shower was also one of my favorite features, it's glass wall faces the bed. So, you can get a place to sleep and a show! HAH! Bed was super comfy and I love the decor. Dana...we might just see you again!",N
2511,"I will definately stay here next time I am in Chicago again. I really liked how fancy this place was. The concierge and operators were incredibly helpful. We called for a toothbrush and got it in 5 minutes. They have computers in your room that help you find local restaurants, shopping and entertainment. There are over 17 floors in this hotel, but they have 14 elevators, so you do not have to wait long. Check out is a breeze- you can literall phone it in. Beds are so comfortable that we considered hanging out in bed all day. The TVs have limited channels, and our remote only worked from a certain angle. The bathrooms are really nice and the bath products were great. Plenty of towels available, and the softest pillows you will ever sleep on. I loved this place, highly recommended.",N
2224,Great location but parking is ridiculous! Front desk agents were robots and make me feel like i'm just another reservation.  Room was nice but nothing special.  I'd look elsewhere for the price.,N
3674,THis is a part of Chicago tradition - went to a wedding here (reminded me of My Best Friend's Wedding) and it's a great location with beautiful views of the city - beautiful hotel (I believe that they also underwent some remodeling to keep things more up to date),N
4026,"This place has been RENOVATED! (as of 8/24/2011) so many of the previous reviews may not apply if you see folks complaining about old, outdated decor and musty corridors. First, the Hyatt Regency in Chicago is the largest Hyatt Regency in the US. They have over 2044+ rooms and two large towers. Compared to Vegas, that may seem like nothing (Vdara houses an impressive 4408 rooms!) but here in Chicago, this landmark hotel definitely has presence. I got a deal on priceline and for once trusted my fate at a chain versus the boutique hotels I've been staying at in previous visits and I have to say, for the price I paid, it was well worth it. The front desk was pleasant, check in was easy and the room was clean. It smelled, felt, and looked clean and updated. The bed was large, comfortable, and the shower was well designed so you can let it rain or turn it on power mode to wash out that stubborn conditioner in your hair. The room service was ... OK since the hotel was big and it just takes forever to get anything but aside from that it was a very pleasant experience. This place is almost always crawling with kids, adults, conventions, tourists so just know what you're getting into.",N
2683,"We held our wedding here on 1/24/09.... PENTHOUSE -  I stayed here with my girlfriends the Friday night before the wedding, they allowed us to check in very early and we transported all of my stuff there at that time, we had just come from having a mani/pedi party at a salon by my house and so we relaxed and watched TV and hung out. All of us girls got ready in the HUGEmarble bathroom for the rehearsal dinner. The room was wired for an ipod and had surround sound speakers in every room so we blasted music and proceeded to drink champagne. I highly recommend booking this room even if you are not holding your wedding at The James, it had a separate living room, dining room and bedroom, the bathroom was HUGE and I never once felt cramped with all my girls, mothers, etc in there. This was where we all got ready the day of and where my husband and I stayed after the wedding, they allowed us a 4:00pm check out on Sunday. CEREMONY: We held our Ceremony at The James in a Chevron round (I think that is what they call it) basically it was a semi circle around the chuppah. We loved it because all of our guests were right up close to us. The James's lighting was great and included in the price so I think that was a added benefit. FOOD/RECEPTION: This was one of the main reasons we booked The James Hotel. My Husband wanted David Burke to cater the meal. We had Lobster bisque with a crab roll to start, then salad, then an option of Chicken or a HUGE filet mignon, then we had wedding cake and their famous Cheesecake Lollipops for the table. It was amazing. The cocktail hour appetizers were amazing and people are still raving about the food. It is not a typical wedding meal it is treated and served like a fine dining experience. The only down side to that is that our dinning portion of the evening lasted almost 2 hours and cut into dancing. Once we realized how long it was taking we asked for the service to be sped up and they did. A++ for the food. This is not hit or miss, it is a sure thing. AFTER PARTY/THE JAMES CLUB: We had mini kobe beef cheeseburgers and truffle fries brought into the James Club which is a room off the Great room with a pool table, flat screens, and a bar. We also paid for an hour or two of extra open bar for our guests. We hooked up an ipod and were good to go. This was a great idea and everyone loved it. We actually got more time to visit with out of town guests during this part of the night.",N
3552,"We chose this hotel based on Yelp. Highly recommend this hotel.  All employees were very customer focused.  Emily checked us in and since we were early they stored our luggage until our room was ready. We asked Emily to give us a city view as high up as possible.  At first she had us on the 32nd floor and when we returned to check in she had booked us on the 39th floor which is the highest floor with rooms. The pool and breakfast lounge is on the 40th floor which is top floor.  The view from room 3909 is fanastic.  This room is a king suite which has a leather couch witha pull out bed which is where our two kids slept.  The mattress was awesome and so comfortable.  Nice flat screen TV, closet space, and did I mention the excellent view. The waterfall shower head was nice but water pressure was not the best either because of the age of the plumbing or it was equipped with a water reducer or both.  It was fine for me, but the wife wished it would have had more pressure.  Not a deal breaker though. We would definitely stay here again.  Very close and centrally located to about everything we wanted to do. The roof top pool was awesome.  The views from there are excellent as well.  Since it was 90+ degrees it was busy during the day but in the evening it was manageable.  The first night which was a Sunday we had the pool to ourselves for awhile which was nice.  I thought the $250 per night average including taxes was very reasonable for all things considered.  Free wi-fi and they did not charge a seperate fee for the pool which alot of places do.  They have parking on site for $50/day but we took the train.  Cab ride to the train station is about $15.00 including tip. Navy Pier, Chinatown, and Willis Tower is all $15.00 or less each way too.  All the shopping, Hancock, and tons of excellent restaurants can easily be reached by foot.  This will be the only hotel we stay at for future visits to Chicago.  Highly recommend the Avenue Crowne!",N
2073,"I just booked my wedding here for the fall of this year in the Wolf Point Ballroom.  HOLY COW, best kept secret in Chicago if you are a bride on a budget but still want an urban downtown wedding.  Their per head prices are phenomenal and for the location, and all that is included, I am still in disbelief at the deal we got.  Our wedding is on a Friday and we received an awesome discount on top of everything else being amazing at this place.  check out their wedding packages on their website. The ballroom isn't your typical wedding hotel event space, which we TOTALLY did not want but this place is sweet! it has all glass windows surrounding 1/2 the room which face the west for a pretty sunset and the south looking at 333 wacker and the rest of the beautiful skyline....it's great, you get the benefits of having your reception at a hotel but don't have to have the ""ballroom"" vibe If you're wedding budget is around $20,000 just to cover your reception costs, check this place out for a 200 person wedding, because you can have an awesome downtown wedding for less than that which is really affordable!! I can't wait to write another review of how awesome this place is once the wedding actually happens.",N
3169,"I have stayed at this W before and don't remember it being so mediocre. The rooms are nice with great views of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier. Our TV remote didn't have batteries, one telephone didn't work and they tried to charge us $50 for a heating pad from Walgreens. The lounge bar usually has some stiff drinks but we had sangria that was more ice than fruit. The staff is super friendly thankfully otherwise it would have been a bust of a stay.",N
3416,"Location, location, location! This nicely renovated hotel sits right in the middle of all the hub-bub on the Magnificent Mile. If you are a tourist, or simply love to be in the middle of everything, this is a good choice. I enjoyed my stay here very much. I noticed a lot  of room size complaints.. I didn't feel my room was small but I did get a King size. It was big enough for two people and all their stuff for a long weekend Chicago adventure with friends. We weren't there except to sleep, shower, and get jazzy looking to go out. Only complaint, was that the shower drain had HAIR in it. EEEEW. GROSS. That is a huge negative. Aside from that the room was clean. Toiletries were minimal, linens fresh and clean, service friendly and hospitable, bar NICE. Also you get complimentarty martini tickets when you check in. I took full advantage.",N
3244,"What a fun and fabulous Chicago hotel! Everything about our stay was pretty near perfect. We arrived early from the suburbs, overloaded with our heavy backpacks, but the front desk was super nice and let us check in 4 hours early! We giddily took the elevator up to our room, impressed with the all mirrored elevators and the white, European, short, skinny, boy  with a huge blonde affro that stood silently and pretentiously with us (undoubtedly both wondering if he was someone famous). Our room was on the 17th floor. Each floor is a different theme, we were on the Annie Lennox floor (perhaps we'll have sweet dreams we pondered). The view from the room was awesome, overlooking the river and part of north Michigan Ave. The room itself was a view to take in with plush beds, tons of mirrors, and fun modern furniture and plasma TV. The bathrooms felt clean and new. Needless to say, later that night, we had a lot of fun having some pre going out drinks. We had to resort to drinking in our room because the Base Bar within the hotel was ridiculously priced. We also had too much fun travelling to each floor to check out the different themes and memorabilia that was on display. When it was time to go out, the doorman helped us hail a cab, very friendly. Upon returning at night, we fell into a blissful sleep on the most comfy bed I have slept in in a long time. When we checked out the next morning, the concierge gladly held our bags for a couple of hours while we shopped and got brunch. We took time to admire the building one more time before heading out, and you have to admit that the hotel, which is in the old Carbide and Carbon building is one of the prettiest in the city. Modeled after a Champagne bottle, the roof top contains real 24 karat gold. Fabulous! One of the best Staycations I ever took!",N
2351,The absolute best location in Chicago. close to everything and nice rooms. Had to take a star away since it's not wireless internet yet. overall a great location though,N
2528,"WORST HOTEL EVER!!! Please do not stay here. I should have listened to all the bad reviews posted by others at Trip Advisor. Paid about $190 to get a room here...totally not worth it. When we first checked in, we were told that the non smoking room that we reserved is not available and there is no other room available.  When we get to the room, the smell of the room was pretty bad...so we asked the front desk to check again. He told us that there is one room available, but it was a living room of a suite. But   the living room has been secluded now from the suite and the sofa can be turned into a bed. Hello!?!??! Did I pay for the room/bed or a living room with sofa? I could have stayed at a friend's apartment (for free!!) and sleep on her sofa if I wanted to do that.   Pros: - Looks good from the outside (inside totally not worth it) - Close to the millennium park (about 6-8 blocks?) But I am sure there's better hotels that are closer to downtown and better for the price. Cons: - Got a smoking room even though I reserved non-smoking room. When I read reviews online, it seems like this is their common practice to do this. Beware!!   - Room is dirty (There was a BIG spider on the wall when we got into the room) - Some portions of the carpet was WET (Gross!!) - Bed, decorations, bathroom are OLD. They really need to get updated. - Internet is $7.50 per hour, with no business center to check your email (Hotels like hampton inn can offer $130 a night with free internet and breakfast...and I don't know why Hilton can't...pretty ridiculous) - They seriously nickel and dime you for everything!! To leave your luggage for a couple of hours, you have to pay $2 per bag. - Beware of the extra charges. They slip me a bill for $6.40 for I do not know what. I called the front desk and asked what the charge is for, and they asked me if I took something from the bar and I told them no. Then they just dismiss it (imagine if you had not called). - Arrogant and full of attitude staff Definitely not a place I want to stay the next time I come to Chicago. Totally not worth the price!! Everyone should just avoid it. Every staff has some kind of attitude like this Hilton was the best hotel in the city (maybe in the late 80s or early 90s) but I don't think it is up to par with other hotel I've stayed in. My previous stay in Chicago was at Sheraton by the river...much nicer, more elegant and friendlier staff.",N
0,"Let me begin by saying that there are two kinds of people, those who will give the Tokyo Hotel 5 stars and rave about it to everyone they know, or... people who can't get past the broken phone, blood stains, beeping fire alarms, peg-legged receptionist, lack of water pressure, cracked walls, strange smells, questionable elevator, televisions left to die after the digital conversion, and the possibility that the air conditioner may fall out the window at any moment. That being said, I whole-heartedly give the Tokyo Hotel 5 stars. This is not a place to quietly slip in and out of with nothing to show but a faint memory of the imitation Thomas Kinkade painting bolted to the wall above your bed. And, there is no continental breakfast or coffee in the lobby. There are a few vending machines, but I'm pretty sure they wont take change minted after 1970. Here your senses will be assaulted, and after you leave you will have enough memories to compete with a 1,000 mile road-trip. I beg anyone who is even mildly considering staying here to give it a chance. The location is prime. We were able to walk down Michigan Ave and the river-walk in the middle of the night, all without straying too far from the hotel. There is a grocery store a block away and parking (which may cost more that your hotel room) across the street. Besides, this place is cheap. Super-cheap for downtown Chicago. The closest price we found in the area was four times as expensive. But, be sure to grab some cash. They don't accept credit cards. Some rules though: - Say hello to Clifton Jackson, the homeless guy by Jewel-Osco. - Buy him a drink, some chicken and look him up on Facebook. - Stay on the 17 floor. All the way at the top. - Go out the fire escape (be sure to prop the door open or you'll have a looong walk down) - Be very very careful. - Explore. (Yes, that ladder will hold your weight) - Be very very careful. - Don't be alarmed by any weird noises you hear. - Spend the night on the roof. 17 stories up, in the heart of Chicago. - Write your own Yelp review. I want to see that others are getting the Tokyo Hotel Experience. - Check out is at noon. Be sure to drink lots of water. - Spend the next day hung over. And... Please be careful on the roof.",N
3863,"After spending a night at this hotel, I thought to myself, every time I go to Vertigo this summer, I am staying here!  It turns your night lounge experience into one that doesn't have to end after the lounge closes!  I stayed in a Superior King room with a corner view and good wine already in the room for you.  The hotel was spotless, and the bathroom looked like it was built the day I stayed there.  A marvelous hotel, with personalized staff members there who treat you like royalty.  If you are having breakfast there, they have great salmon and bagels.",N
1240,"Stayed two nights. Great hotel! The only problem is that there is no easy access from the chicago metro. You have to walk a long way. Its best to get here from taxi. If you are flying in to OHare or Midway, take the train to any downtown location (like Adams street) and then cab to this hotel for like 12 bucks. also, there is nothing much to do near this hotel in walking distance...except the convention center is attached.  The room service food was excellent. they were able to make me a delicious vegetarian meal almost at midnight (when i checked in). Paid almost 180$ per night. I had awesome views from my room!!",N
2492,"I'm more of a boutique hotel kinda chick but I happen to like this hotel. This place is gnormous but it serves its purpose--accommodation only. Don't expect the doorman, the concierge, the front desk agent to go out of their way to please you. They will do their job and do it well but nothing over the top.  The best part of my stay here was our upgrade to Executive Level which entitles you to free entry to the Lounge. Woopdy-doo right? Heck, it's free appetizers, drinks, nice view...what's there to complain about?",N
2907,"I stayed here for a conference recently. Very disappointed with the small and dated room, which reminds me of motel 6. The lobby was nice and fit the name of Sheraton. Location was convenient though I didn't have the time to walk down to navy pier. Walgreen one block away was nice for stocking up snacks and bottled water. Irregardless, a motel 6 room is not worth the price I paid for sheraton. Won't be staying here again.  Oh yeah, no wi-fi in rooms? I was told free WiFi is available in lobby, I wasn't able to find it. Use of the gym is $20/day. Across the river, the swishotel and hytt both have lower prices, nicer rooms, and the gym is free at the Hytt.",N
512,"I've stayed at the ES twice now, both for business. The rooms are very clean and modern looking. The front desk staff is quite helpful. The location is great for walking to Michigan Avenue and nearby attractions. A taxi ride to Wicker park for instance cost me about $6. The breakfast each morning is good, although I didn't care for the eggs. The gym is small: there are 4 treadmills and a small variety of free weights. I would continue to choose the Embassy Suites Lakefront as my hotel of choice when visiting Chicago.",N
5122,One of my Favorite HotelsThere is a Starbucks in this Hotel. Free wifi,Y
1672,"I cannot believe this place gets such high reviews.  Maybe everyone who gives it 4 or 5 stars stayed in suite??  Or is hard of hearing?  Or enjoys using a converted closet as a bathroom? I only booked this hotel bc I got a special deal, at full price it's a total rip off.  I have no idea what a suite looks like, but the rooms are teensy tiny, even by urban city hotel standards.  The bathroom is even smaller and the sink splashes water on you.  The walls are paper thin, I was woken up at 2 am by a girly laugh fest  (I decided it was the universe paying me back for the hotel guests my friends and I woke at 4am when I stayed at the Hilton in SF).   And the service isn't all that great either.  I put in a request for a rollaway when I checked in and when I went to check on the status was told that they had none available.  I still can't figure out why I can't request one ahead of time.  It took a good 30 seconds of hard staring at the lady bf I got an apology.  I had to ask multiple times for late check out and despite the fact that I got the ok to check out at 1pm, I got a knock at the door at 1230.   Yes, the lobby is beautiful but I'm not sleeping in the lobby.  That hardly makes up for the shortcomings of the place. I loved Chicago and will come back, but def will not stay here again.",N
863,"I stayed here for one night on recommendation from my manager, who knows the area well.  The location was convenient, the rooms were well kept/clean/huge/comfy/quiet....more like a suite....the bar did what it needed to do, the service was delightful; overall the experience for a business class hotel (with a bit of personality) at $125 a night, blocks from everywhere I needed to be was wonderful.  Only, bring your shampoo if you're a lady.  Beware: they only offer the shampoo/conditioner combo option which means super bad hair day for important meetings the next day. :(",N
1796,"Well, I have spent now 3 weeks at this hotel for work.  The bed is pretty comfy, the TV is big, the channels are OK, the rooms are really small!  The staff is quite helpful - ask for extra pillows!  Be sure to try the Encore bar on the first floor, the food is good and tasty - as well with room service.  Location is convenient but know that the Loop goes dead on the weekends.",N
262,"I hop around all of the IHG properties in Chicago while I'm staying here for work, and the Holiday Inn on Harrison came due. The location isn't dreadful, but it certainly isn't close to anything.  There's a Panera, Whole Foods, etc about a 6 block walk, but in January winter and 5"" of snow, count me out.  If you have a car, then life is good, otherwise plan on taking a cab to everything. Great fitness center on the top floor, all health club quality Precor equipment, a great multi-machine, and dumbbells up to 50lbs.  Kudos to the General Manager for making the investment here. Rooms are good, very much Holiday Inn but clean and what I need.  I was upgraded to a suite #437, and it's more space than I live in on a daily basis, and has a microwave, fridge, and a flat-panel TV although I don't watch it. Front desk staff is friendly, although check-in took a little longer than I would like due to several people all at once. Room is surprisingly quiet since it's so close to the freeway. Great looking business center on the top floor, looks more like an internet cafe than the typical hotel business center - very nice. I see other reviews talking about the tiny lobby.  I use the lobby for checkin and checkout and don't hang out there, so it's small size doesn't bother me.  I did not experience the families, although I'm also not here during the high season. I did not try the pizza joint attached to the hotel, it has looked pretty empty every time I've passed by the window.  If the GM or anyone from the hotel reads the reviews on TA - The WiFi is pretty slow, and could use a bandwidth upgrade.  Find out whatever the Crowne Plaza on Huron has, and make the investment into the same pipe.  It would also be nice to have coffee in the lobby.

30,"For the money.. it was a great hotel. Clean, great location, comfortable and fabulous staff. I enjoy older hotels with character.. The Tremont fit the bill. Great views, There weren't an abundance of tv channels, but the picture was clear and I sure didn't travel to Chicago to stay in the room and watch tv. and would prefer not to pay higher rates so others can. I would so stay here again. I wish I could remember the desk clerks name .. she was awesome in answering questions about the area.",N
1753,You cant beat it for the price the quality and the location. I have traveled to chicago a few times and this so far is my favorite little spot. They have wine tastings that make for a good social. The bar is classy and the area of town very safe. I enjoyed my stay and look forward to heading back to chicago.,N
4689,"Great boutique hotel - nothing bad to say at all.  It's the Four Seasons of it's price range.  I stay at nice hotels and this is amazing for the price. The housekeepers are assigned to a floor so they are almost like butlers - they get to know you and are there to help you in any way.  Also this hotel is close to all the good restaurants like XOCO, Maggianos, Bandera, etc.  Best of all, a Whole Foods in just a short block away.  Amazing.  Staff could have been a little nicer/better (less snooty feeling) but they were ok enough.  Their restaurant's food is REALLY good too - especially brealfast.  Highly recommend.",N
5342,"I have never had such a positive experience. Every single staff experience was off-the-chart positive. They were all extremely helpful, made every accommodation possible. I can't say enough nice things about the front desk staff and Todd the chef concierge. The staff of Public are the best ambassadors that the city could have, and made my vacation.",Y
4911,"Nice hotel with small rooms.  Also, despite having booked a luxury room, they had none available at checkin.  I was moved to a slightly larger room when they could not fit a pack-n-play in the room I'd been assigned.  My biggest concern, however, is the security (or lack thereof).  Between the lobby and my room, someone managed to steal my cell phone and wallet, taking all of my money.   The thief discarded my wallet with credit cards in tact (they had rifled through the cards, but didn't take any), by leaving it in a cushion on an elevator.  While the staff was generally empathetic, I would have liked to have dealt with some onsite security personnel who could have investigated the incident and perhaps reviewed cam footage to identify the thief roaming their hotel.",Y
2893,"Just returned from 5 days and 4 nights at this establishment for a convention.  Yes, in Chicago in February.  Lucky me, the snow stopped but for half-time on Super Bowl Sunday and immediately after my flight cleared Chicago airspace headed for home! Convention accommodations:  the exhibit room hall had a few issues.  As an attendee, I wasn't particularly thrilled with the layout or the noisy HVAC system that was above some of the break out ""rooms"" that were on the exhibit hall floor.  The ballrooms and river or lake rooms were neither hot nor cold, but sometimes the temperature and attention to detail (like the coffee running out) was a bit lacking.  Having to ride the labyrinth of escalators was also a bit trying -- but basically the staff was reasonably attentive to the needs of the convention goer. Rooms:  I had a 15th floor corner King.  It was clean, my housekeeping staff were quite helpful and mindful of my privacy and the view (facing east) of the ice laden river and vast expanse of the frozen lake was breathtaking.  Because I was under the weather for a good portion of my visit, I didn't get to go exploring or utilize the workout facility.  For this, I will need to return when the temperature is well above 25 degrees fahrenheit!  And next time, I hope to be up just a little bit higher.  Nonetheless, I had an auto club association rate that BEAT the rate negotiated for the convention, so I had no real complaints about what my money was being spent upon. Proximity to services:  I wheeled myself from the CTA station at Clark & Lake with ease - and found that the neighborhood had many of the basic necessities.  Particularly important was the closeness of the Walgreen's -- which when one feels like the bottom of an icy river covered with a burning inferno -- is a welcome sight! In hotel services:  I had breakfast room service -- which was pricey but decent portions.  Too bad I couldn't really taste anything!  Business center staff, concierge and front desk have the 411 on assisting the business traveler and the bellmen have the taxi queue dialed in so one didn't have to venture out into freezing weather and wait for very long. Yes, Sheraton Chicago Hotel & Towers, I noticed that you appear to still be renovating some of the rooms -- your 32nd floor Presidential Suite was stunning and well appointed -- so please keep at it -- and I will recommend you to all of my friends who wish to stay on the ""north"" side of the river!",N
5712,"I can see how some people may have had a negative experience at this hotel; it is definitely no frills -- negligible ""lobby,"" smaller rooms with the bare essentials, no room service or view. But my experience was lovely for what I needed: a fabulous rate in a great location (half a block from Michigan Ave, right on the river), clean and contemporary rooms, and free bottled water!!  Great for all the walking and sightseeing we did!   If you are fine with a no frills yet modern and comfortable room, this is a great hotel!!",N
1557,"I really liked this place. Got a great rate here, and was slightly skeptical as most ""boutique"" hotels I've stayed in tend to favor style over substance. The hotel is in a great location, the staff was friendly and helpful and the interior was stylish without being gaudy. Used the workout room which was modest, but adequate and had a great city view. The room I stayed in was very large (another rarity with boutique hotels), the TV and cable options were slightly below average, room had a great city view. Bathroom was also spacious and nice. Had one incident with the hot water being too hot in the shower and a staff member was sent up almost immediately and fixed the problem within 5 minutes, and was very friendly. Overall a pleasant experience and I would definitely recommend it, especially in the $100-200 per night price range.",N
1324,"the best service EVER. i had my birthday ""coming out"" party here and the attendants were phenomenal. l'occitane products, fantastic rooms, jaw-dropping interior design in the grand ballroom and in the lobby of the hotel. very pricey but not at all a detriment. you get what you pay for. the reason why i give it only 4 stars though is because the event-coordinator of the hotel was implying that there was something minutely wrong that most of my guests were of a certain discent which i found very very offensive. i know his point, that the ritz is this prostigious place.. pretty much wasp and probably never experienced this kind of event with so many, let's say, asians that weren't all so neatly groomed. but they were my family so i didn't believe it was right to question it- my parents paid twp arms and two legs for the hotel's ballroom services and we weren't disrupting the hotel in any way. he could have at least acted like it was alright. sheesh. and what's with the pool? just a lap pool? for a 5 star hotel i was expecting at least a nicer recreation type pool.",N
3114,"I'm a W hotel fan.  If I ever go out of town, I try to stay at the W if my budget can afford it.  I just love the style of that place!  The W Chicago is great-- right on the lake, slightly tucked away from Michigan ave, but close enough that you can get to some of the great shopping areas.  The real reasons I come to the W:  Bliss Spa, and the Mojitos.  Some of the best in the city, and I'm a snobby mojito whore.  They do some great variations, with crushed blueberrys, rasberrys, or mango... and one wednesday a month they do special mojitos with a medley of pineapple and some other crap... and part of the proceeds go to The Humane Society.. getting drunk for a good cause??  Can't beat that.  I will say they tend to be rather expensive, and you can't really go there dressed uber casual without looking a little out of place.  Throw on some lipgloss, a cute top, and your good to go.  Another thing= The bathrooms are awesome.  I'm pretty sure the glass between the mens and womens rooms are see through, so if you look hard enough, you can probably get a free show... not that I would know or anything. Bliss Spa is great too, and kudos to them for associating themselves with such a great name in the Hotel industry!! One more thing, the bar upstairs, I think it's called the Whiskey- has an amazing view of the skyline.  Everything in the bar is black, so if your drunk enough, it feels like you are floating in the black abyss.  I love it.   If you ever get a chance, check out the W in LA... that's where my love affair began!",N
242,"Decent enough hotel for the price, maybe a tad rough around the edges. I wouldn't normally have chosen this place, but I won 2 nights in a silent auction, and I spend another night here during a long weekend trip.  Conveniently close to the Red Line, but there's nothing in the immediate area that I found particularly compelling or fun - unless college dive bars are your thing.   I didn't eat here, so can't say anything about the food.  The hardwood floors aren't such a nice selling point in the middle of winter.  Housekeeping skipped our room one day, but the front desk graciously refunded 50% for one night to make up for it.",N
4343,"Ok, so I'm admittedly an architecture and history freak.  This place had me sensory functions hitting all cylinders!  The lobby has an incredible ceilings that words really can't describe.  Every nook and cranny of this place had such great architectural detail it was just overload for me.  Freaking OVERLOAD!  It wasn't just old school stuff either, there was a mix of touchscreen monitors for flight schedules (how cool is that?) and updated elevators so they weren't slow as molasses.  Nothing worse than a slow elevator in an old building.   The Lockwood Restaurant provides a nice bar on the main lobby area and you can catch a great cup of coffee at Starbucks downstairs at the street level. The most amazing thing was every time I would ride the elevator and people would get off on their floor I would notice that every elevator lobby on each level was different and had it's own design.  Whether it was a piano as the main piece or a circular couch, each lobby had a unique flair. On top of all this, this hotel has been privileged enough to have guests such as Mark Twain and many great presidents and one stay and you will realize why.  Simply amazing!",N
2462,"Came here last night for the World of Chocolates AIDS Foundation event. The decorations were gorgeous. The food was only so-so though (except for the vegetarian chili. That was awesome!). Granted, they probably had outside catering... The cool thing about the event was that I got to sample a lot of chocolate AND I got to shake Governor Quinn's hand and take a picture with him (and my friend). Too bad I forgot to ask the photographer for her contact information... Would have loved to post that picture up here on Yelp. The hotel itself isn't bad. I probably came here at least three times in the past year. The first time I was working for a destination management company, and I had to show our guests where to go. I thought it was pretty easy to navigate throughout the hotel (though I suppose it does get a little confusing with some of the elevators). The second and third times, I came as a guest. The rooms were good (had a king-sized bedroom the first time, and two queen-sized beds in my room the second). I enjoyed the amenities. The concierge was also very knowledgeable about the dining places they recommended to us (although Mercat was a disappointment, as you may read in one of my reviews).",N
2284,"It's definitely right in the heart of downtown Chicago shopping.  Lobby is very nice with lots of seating witha bar and Starbucks.   Rooms are very small and the bathroom even smaller.  I rated 3 stars because it was just an OK hotel, certainly nothing to write home about!",N
5066,Love the hotel not the front desk.,Y
4384,"One of the most beautiful hotel's in the city.  The atmosphere is wonderful the way the hotel is laid out with the main floor a cozy bar and restaurant.  LOVE to stay here.  The staff is very helpful and the food is wonderful.   We had a suite and the bed was so comfortable I had NO trouble falling asleep!  The bathroom was small, but the room was a decent size.  I thought the entire staff was courteous and the check out line even though long we rather quick.   I would recommend this hotel if you are traveling with family or for business or just looking for a weekend away with your hunny!",N
2870,"Full service price, no happy ending. Once you open the door to your room you can see why this place is rated an average of 3.  The rooms are small and while the carpet and wall paper are new the place feels old. It's really a big convention hotel which is who they cater to.  I bought a room on priceline for $100.  The parking is $50 and the internet is $13.  So figure it out.  It's still $163.  But would you expect less than that sort of nickel and dime from this outfit?   It's good if you don't need a car and want to be downtown.",N
4566,"Stayed here for five nights on a recent business trip. Overall, I was pleased with my experience, mainly because I paid $70/night through priceline. When I arrived, I was greeted by a friendly receptionist and I felt like I was not treated any differently just because I had booked through priceline. I requested and was able to get a queen-size bed and a room away from the El. While the view from the room left a little to be desired (my view was of other hotel rooms about 100 feet across from mine), I didn't hear any street noise or the train. However, I did notice that the walls were pretty thin. I could hear people having phone conversations next door as well as hallway noise. The room was a little on the small side, but clean and well-designed. The location is excellent. It's two blocks away from Michigan Ave and the Art Institute. Three blocks away from Millenium Park. Entrances to the Red Line are one block away. I won't comment much on the lobby, because that has been commented a lot here...needless to say, it's pretty impressive. As with most pricey hotels, they nickel and dime you here. Internet is $20/day and I believe there is a charge to use the gym facilities. If you can book this hotel for cheap on priceline, then I highly recommend staying here. I do not know if I would pay full-price for a room here though.",N
1420,"What a run down dump.  A far cry from a 4 star hotel, although you can tell it has some history.  It's in desperate need of renovation.",N
1758,This joint is cute and therefore good for the ladies in your life (of wife in my case).  And you get a free glass of wine which is always a bonus.  The hotel restaurant/bar aint so bad either -- I had the mac n' cheese and fried chicken.  Yikes!,N
2974,"I was at this hotel for a conference and I wasn't very impressed. The lobby was very nice and the view from our room  of the river was great, but the room itself was not impressive. The bathroom in particular needed an update. It wasn't dirty, but it didn't match what we paid for it. Overall, not a good value and I wouldn't stay here again if it wasn't so convenient for the conference.",N
4673,"great little boutique hotel just off the Miracle Mile in Chicago. it's convenient to all manner of downtown public transport options and there are tons of eateries in the area (though not enough small, independent places for my liking...was kinda hard to find a fun+quirky breakfast, but i'd suggest Brett's Kitchen or the Ohio House diner). Hotel Felix *just* opened so the restaurant isn't even up and running and they're ironing out some kinks, but they make up for it with great and personal customer service. some examples: - i noted on our reservation that it was our anniversary and they had a bottle of wine and a hand-written note waiting in our room - when a surprise rainstorm hit on our last day, the front desk scared up an umbrella for us to borrow for the whole day - even though our stay was short, all the doormen remembered us and greeted us warmly and personally each time we returned. ...add to all this that the hotel is extremely eco-friendly (it has silver LEED certification) and affordable and you have a winner.",N
3786,"I loved my room at this hotel with one exception. The walls seemed very, very thin and my neighbor kept playing Back Street Boys on their iPod. (Just kidding Kathleen. ;-) ) The walls were thin, but I never heard any music, just the shades being pulled up and/or down. But, the atmosphere is beautiful. The floors are hardwood. The outside wall is made of floor to ceiling windows, which allows tons of natural light into the room. And the bed, my goodness, it was probably the most comfortable bed I've slept in for a long while. The staff here was super friendly. And the downstairs bar is a great place for a quick cocktail before or after dinner.",N
341,"Call me cheap but i thought this place was PERFECT!!!  Went on vacation with two girl friends of mine and stayed here in June (the most expensive month to vacation) and got the room at $95 per night. Why in the world would you go on vacation to this AMAZING city of Chicago and then want to stay in your hotel room?!   That just boggles my freaking mind!!!   I am no Bougie-Suzie, so this hotel fit me like a glove..   When I'm on vacation the amount of time I spend in my hotel room is close to none.   I want to be out and about, and only return to my hotel room in such a drunken stupor that I can give two rats asses about if the sheets are 200billion thread count.  WHO CARES?!   I'm gonna knock the eff out anyways.  Wake up and then do it all over again.  A hotel, while on vacation, is only a place for me to sleep in.   As long as the place is safe enough for me to not sleep with my shank tucked underneath my pillow - then I'm all in. For the rate we got this room, i think it was absolute perfection compared to the rates you'll get at other hotels that are right smack in the middle of downtown Chicago.  The location is amazing.  Walking distance to EVERYTHING.  With Grant Park, Millennium Park, Warehouse Liquors, Buddy Guy's Legends, immediate public transportation access, Lou Malnati's and a 24hr Dunkin' Donuts to feed your post-club drunken debauchery right next door;  just to name a couple of things you are adjacent to this hotel.  A mere 5 minute cab ride away from  anything you want to go to in the city.   This hotel is a STEAL!   The staff were good sports.  Especially when my group strolled in around 5:30am just looking a drunken hot mess with left over Rock N Roll McDonald's bags at hand.   I'm sure everyone at front desk got a good laugh watching us make a dent in that city.   ^-^  The staff laughed at all our sarcastic jokes and there was always someone around kind enough to take us on the frate elevators when the regular ones were busy.  LOVE THEM! Deal-tastic for those who like a great steal!  (ME!!) But Bougie-Suzies BEWARE - this place just isn't your cup of afternoon tea.",N
3277,"I was really disappointed by this hotel. When you think ""Hard Rock"" you think of something really impressive and historical. The lobby/bar are nice and they make some good drinks, but beyond that there is nothing to brag about. The rooms are plain, some views from the rooms suck, and they don't have a lot of rock memorbilia. We have been here a few times and i have made the decision I won't go back. It's not worth the money.",N
2147,"I enjoyed my one night stay here, but I have one question and one question only... WHAT IS UP WITH THE SHOWERS? Who designed this. If you haven't been it's a huge walk in with a curtain you draw. You could probably fit a good 7 people in that shower, which hey, could be fun, but I can't really see the Intercontinental being ""that"" kind of hotel. Anyway, here you are in this second room aka the shower and as you are going about your business you pull the curtain and walk back into the bathroom to find the entire floor soaked. How was this a good idea? First of all it's dangerous. Say you were drinking heavily in the hotel (not that I would know anything about that kind of behavior), but then say you took a shower and walked out to Lake Michigan Avenue on the slick marble floor. That just spells danger to me and a waste of towels since it took all but one of the supplied towels to mop it all up. Other than that, the room was HUGE and the views were great. i stayed in the historic tower and it was nice. Also the beds. WOW. I have trouble sleeping, but man o man, did I ever wake up with the best puffy eyed face and out of control bed head. In my world, that means I actually beat insomnia for one night and won! Other than those things it's just a nice hotel that I think a business traveler would enjoy. They do charge $9.95 a day for Internet which seems lame seeing as how you are already paying over $200 for the room, I mean come on, would it kill ya to comp that, but overall a fine place to rest your head. For a romantic romp however, I may stay somewhere else. Again, not that I would know anything about that ;)",N
2318,"I stayed here  w/  a friend during the labor day holiday. It's definitely the best location for a hotel if you want to be right in the middle of downtown Chicago. There were about 2 conferences going on in the hotel during my stay. So of course you will be taking the local elevator during the peak hours of the conference due to people going back and forth. It wasn't as bad as one would think. The hotel staff was definitely friendly during check-in, walking around the hotel, and check-out. they cleaned the room everyday immaculately, to the point I thought I walked into a new room. The room was GREAT! The view from the 35 floor ROCKED (although a bit scary b/c the window goes from floor to ceiling)! The only drawback is that $33 a day parking...def a hott mess! We stayed 6 days so that's $198...so not what anyone wants to pay on top of staying at over $100.00.",N
4944,"Stayed here for a week for business. Pros+ Excellent location.  Safe and right in the heart of the Magnificent Mile you are walking distance to everything.  Millennium Park, Navy Pier, all just about a mile away.  Infinite food, bar and shopping choices all around you.  24 hour Walgreens just a block away for any incidental purchases.  + Rooms are clean, comfortable, functional and modern.  + Facilities.  Business center and gym.  Which should be expected.+ Sky Lounge has excellent views.  Had breakfast here every morning.  Very friendly staff.Cons- Warning, if you have a car, the valet parking is pricey.  But this is Chicago.  Big city, big city prices.  Be reasonable, this is expected.- If you like to swim at your hotel, the pool isn't huge or anything to write home about.  But it's not the worse.Not really a lot of cons here.  The sheer convenience offered by the location of this hotel is worth the stay.  Highly recommended.",Y
1271,phenomenal breakfast. great pizza!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the lady at meets you at the door in AM. is the sweetest person alive. On the real.... the whole staff is nice,N
1376,"Comfortable and friendly. The Knick, good people here. Highly recommend. I have stayed here over and over the last few years. I say, the staff recognizes you after a while, and it is a very nice feeling in a big town like Chicago. I used to stay at the Talbot previously, but it changed hands, and became very corporate, inflexible and expensive, so I start going to the Knick. Its a pretty cool old hotel. Once the ""Playboy Club"", it does the job, day in and day out, as a great mid-priced downtown stay. Spotlessly clean rooms, lovely amenities, newly remodeled... absolutely no downside. Right by the beach, and right by the El, actually, just across from the Drake. Oddly, though, the bar serves up a decent Old Fashioned (ask for Steve) compared to the wretched crap at -of all places- the Elysian, or the Peninsula, which are absolute crap. (trust me on this) Knick, you are my ""go-to"" spot in Chicago. Thanks for the always nice stay Knick! Adendum;  did I mention they fill your ice bucket during turn-down service?   ...nice touch. Carry on.",N
1154,"I love the decor of this hotel. It is very edgy and attractive to look at. The wine bar has a great selection and the food there is great for a quick snack or dessert. The Aria Bar and Sushi is great for a snack and a drink before going out for a bit. I stayed there with my friend this weekend for her bachelorette party and the only thing I will say is at other hotels I have been to they give a discount or upgrade or a special treat for the guest. Our room was fantastic and classy, but the only issue I had was the beds are TOO soft, not comfortable when you have been drinking all night because your head sinks back towards the bottom while your feet feel raised up in the air. I woke up multiple times during the night because I was uncomfortable. The tvs are huge and the view was amazing from our room. Love the proximity to Millenium and Grant Park for the Taste of Chicago as well as the Art Museum. Only a 5 dollar cab ride to get to the busier parts of the city and the red line train is a 2 block walk.",N
3493,"We ran into a minor problem, but when we talked to someone they upgraded our room to their best in the house on top floor. Service here is impressive.  The building is a bit old so the rooms are pretty small and ceilings low.  I enjoyed their contemporary deco.  The location is the best if you enjoy shopping and good food.",N
5561,"I'm writing this as I sit on a friend-of-a-friend's couch.  Why?  Hotwire didn't make it clear enough that in the state of Illinois, you have to be 21 to check out a room.  I booked my reservation more than a month in advance, but upon going to the front desk, they informed me that I couldn't check in to my room.  After asking the dude at the front desk if they could make an exception--he promptly snapped at me and said that I should leave.  So, in a city that I don't know, 30 degrees, and no friends in the city... he threatens to call security if I don't leave--""no exceptions"".  After a half hour of calling around, I got a hold of a friend who told me that his friend would let me sleep there for the night.  It was a 45 minute walk-subway-walk to his house... and here I am.  Thanks la quinta... I would never recommend that anyone even consider going here.",N
3628,"The Drake is famous, and justifiably so. The lobby is relatively small, but more importantly it is tasteful and refined. No riff-raff lounging around as in New York's Waldorf=Astoria. However, some of the aspects of the Drake that can be cited for their traditional charm, such as the mirrored elevators with their upholstered benches, also betray the need for some updates. Service, including check-in, was as it should be-- quick, seamless, and nearly invisible. The rooms are highly variable, but even the standard ones are large enough. Quality everything, from bedding to bath supplies, but some things felt a bit in need of an update, such as the carpet and chair upholstery. It's possible to be traditional without being fusty. Where the Drake really shines the most, though, are in its restaurants. The Palm Court is a true delight. Beautiful room and furnishings, delicious tea and food (it's far more than it initially looks), impeccable service, and a harpist. It's quiet and relaxing while being social. Even if you don't stay at the hotel, come for the tea. Breakfast at the Drake Bros was one of the best hotel breakfasts I've had, with an enormous selection and, again, impeccable service. You get the privacy you want, too. Considering the price and the reputation, this is everything you expect. No less, but not much more, either.",N
5181,"This would be a good hotel if you were spending one night in the city to see a play and you didn't care much about having a quiet, relaxing, comfortable night. Otherwise, there are far better hotels in the area that are infinitely better than Hotel Allegro. The best things about this hotel are the fantastic bell hops and room service. And the art deco theme is wonderfully done. Otherwise, its a fairly dismal, low-class hotel. The ""quiet room"" we requested may actually be quiet when the only noise you would have to deal with is the usual hall noise, but we could hear every word (and everything) the people next door were up to until 11:30 pm, by which time we called the front desk and security asked our love bird neighbors to be a bit quieter. Perhaps these people were just exceptionally loud? But even without the noise, the King bed in our room was simply awful- it was rock hard and actually slanted towards the floor. The room itself, as so many others have pointed out, is very small (especially with a king bed) and the bathroom tiny, but  clean and well designed. Overall, the hotel worked for us because it was in walking distance to the building where we were giving a presentation, but I would never recommend it to out-of-town friends and we will definitely not be going back.",Y
3703,"Horrible service and dreadfully overpriced for the quality you get. I can't believe people get ripped off by this place over and over again. As a Chicago ""landmark"" I really expected more. Also, the Palm Court Oscar party was awful. Talk about time and money wasted!",N
4450,"How can you beat this location? You are 1 block from the Art Institute and Millenium Park. You are located between to L train stations that can take you anywhere in Chicago. You have all the shopping of State street and Michigan Avenue steps away from the hotel. This hotel is gorgeous and elegant and one of Chicago's premier gems. The service was A-1 and the food, both room service and downstairs at the Lockwood restaurant were above average. The rooms were roomy, the bathroom was a bit small, but that didn't bother us. This historic property ""feels"" like Chicago.....if I were visiting Chicago, I would definitely stay here.",N
4694,"My husband and I just spent 3 nights at Hotel Felix.  We landed a stay here for $110/night via Priceline and were pleasantly surprised.  Upon notification from Priceline we did some research on this hotel and most people complained how small the rooms are.  In an effort to make sure we had the largest room possible, we called the hotel immediately and requested a room with 2 queens over 1.  We also read in other reviews that the staff was quite rude.  When we called about the room - the reviewers proved to be accurate.  I was asked before I was given an answer where I made my reservation through and basically said I could upgrade if it was available but don't count on it. We arrived early for check-in and were pleasantly surprised by the VERY friendly doorman, and cordial front desk staff.  We were told they were sold out - so we didn't end up getting the room upgrade.   When we walked into our room we were quite pleased. Clean-very clean room, yes very small, but the modern decor, comfortable beds, and excellent location soon made you forget about it's size. We would definitely go back, given we find the same deal.  I'm not sure we would pay too much more to stay here, but would recommend it if it is in your price range.",N
313,"My fiance and I were going to a concert that started at 10, and didn't want to bothered driving back to the suburbs, so we hopped on priceline and got a great price for a room here! The staff was super friendly and the room was lovely. Before we went out, we relaxed in bed, watched some TV, and hopped on our laptop using the free WiFi. Previous reviewers have mentioned the sound of the El, which we noticed, but I guess are used to from living in a noisy downtown area. This hotel was right around all of our favorite spots to shop and eat. Awesome! The bathroom (and entire room, for that matter) was clean and well taken care of. Our room was small, but the bed was comfortable. We both had a great night's sleep after coming home around 2 AM.",N

5544,"Am staying at the Inn for a couple nights over the Thanksgiving Holiday weekend, 2009. In fact, am writing this review from a table in the 2nd floor's continental breakfast area.  The view of the surrounding downtown buildings on this gray, soggy morning is wonderful.  The food at the continental breakfast, not so much. The eggs are disgusting, they actually smell and taste like pancake syrup, which, since pancakes are not being offered, is hella scary. The bacon is crispy, a good thing.  Plenty of bagels and you toast your own. You can also make your own waffle (too much trouble for me to go to at a hotel when I don't make waffles in my own house). Now for my room. It's quite large, nicely appointed with modern minamlist decor, large bathroom with huge shower. Pluses:  36"" flat screen HD TV; full cable line-up; refrigerator I've now stocked with my own bottled water and diet sodas; nice decor; lots of fluffy feather pillows; free WIFI; plenty of drawers for clothes and deskspace for working; plenty of hangers in the closet. Minuses: Very stingy on the complimentary toiletries - two butter-pat sized bars of soap and one thimbleful of shampoo.  What ever happened to shampoo and conditioner and a little container of lotion?  Not to mention the shoe-buffing cloth (not that my shoes need buffing, but they make great lens cleaners for sunglasses). The water never got quite hot enough for my liking in the shower.  The AC/Heat system doesn't respond very well. I like it bone-chilling cold when I sleep at night, but the thermostat wouldn't let me lower the setting any lower than 65 degrees, and it never ever got below 67.  In the morning, I crank up the heat when I'm dressing, so I set the thermostat to 72 degrees.  An hour and a half later, the air temp had risen from 67 to 69.   Biggest complaint:  the hotel advertises they have safes at the front desk for locking up valuables.  That's not quite true. What they do have are safe-deposit boxes, the long skinny ones that you find at banks.   I found this out on my way out to dinner last night, when I took my netbook down to lock it up, since I didn't want to leave it in my room.  When I asked the staff member at the desk what other recommendations she could give me on how I could secure my netbook without having to carry it around me at all times, she said to just leave it in the room.  I don't think so. Biggest compliment so far:  Very cool decor.  Think Design Within Reach meets MOMA meets the Ikea look.",N
5538,"I booked this hotel through Hotwire for about $150 a night, after tax, for a weekend stay. The Hotel had no parking, but there is a garage next door for $34 a night. We just parked our car in Bucktown on the street for free and road the train in. We liked almost everything about our room. The beds are very comfortable. One issue we had was the amount of shampoo we were given. Only one little bottle compared to normally getting shampoo, conditioner, and lotion. The maid didn't even give us a new bottle for our second night. The other problem with our room was the view, or lack there of. All we could see was an alley filled with dumpsters and trash cans. It was loud early in the morning when the trash trucks came as well. One big advantage to this hotel is the free hot breakfast. It was very crowded, but the dining room and staff seemed to handle the crowd efficiently. The front desk staff was helpful as far as directions and very friendly. Overall I think this is a nice hotel for the money. I'd stay here again.",N
3380,"This hotel was great. The bellman, Javier, was excellent too! He let us know where to get great pizza (expect a review sometime later), great bars around town, and how to get around the city. First, to start off with a few complaints, the bathroom was ridiculously small. I know if some of my friends would have been with me, there is no way they could have shut the door without standing in the shower to do so. But, not a big problem. Second, the pool and sauna closes at 10pm, that sucked, especially since it seemed like such a great idea after drinking at a football game all day. Now onto the good stuff, there is a mini fridge (empty) in your room! I don't know why more hotels don't understand that I want to keep my own things in my fridge, I don't want to buy your overpriced snickers bars or one ounce shots of liquor, when I can buy something at the local 7-11 for a third of the price! Next, the view was incredible! My friend and I could see as far as we wanted onto Lake Michigan (we were on the 9th floor), we could see Soldier Field, and Navy Pier. The view was worth the price (about $150 after taxes and fees per night). The bed wasn't the greatest bed, but it wasn't horrible either. My last complaint, because it felt like they were just trying to charge us a few extra bucks, was to hold our bags Sunday after we checked out but before our plane left, they charged us a few dollars. I thought that was cheap, when we would have just tipped the Bellman instead (but we decided to, only because it was Javier though)! Regarding the price - our friends on the trip told us they got the W. Chicago for $100 the week before they left, when we booked two to three weeks ahead of time and paid $150 per night. I looked at the W. and it was definitely nicer, so that was kind of a let down, but not the end of the world.",N
2454,"If Ashton Kutcher popped out from behind the curtains and said ""OHHHH YOU'VE BEEN PUNKED THIS IS JUST A HOLIDAY INN!!!"" I would have likely replied ""oh Ash, you scoundrel. You've done it again!"" The room was comfortable but not terribly luxurious. Just looks like any other hotel room. Paying 12 dollars for room service cereal and it's just a bowl of cereal and some milk is outrageous. No fruit, no oj, no nothing. Expensive for what it is.",N
3433,"Most horribly managed hotel I have ever stayed in. I was there last month for 10 days. This is no 4 star hotel. Its a decent 3 trying very very hard to climb the ladder with trendy decor and branding but failing miserably due to a mismanagement and staff that has not been trained in what good service is. -When I arrived the valet kid literally dragged my camera case carrying over $20,000 worth of gear ( i am a professional)  across the floor and literally tossed it into the corner i specified he leave it. He couldnt pick it up to carry it properly but he could throw it ?? - I was coming in and out each day with large bags of camera equipment. There is a tall, skinny caucasian boy with brown hair at the front door bellman station who I am convinced is on facebook/waching movies on the computer up there all day long. He would literally watch me struggle through the heavy glass door with my gear day in and day out without moving a muscle. Other bellmen would help me carry it to the elevator but not this kid.... -I have diabetes and my shakes were removed from the mini-bar and thrown out. He obviously didnt know of my condition, but either way, UNACCEPTABLE. -the base rate internet plan (9.95/day) is so slow it was unusable. Upgraded to the 14.95/day plan which was enough to not have to wait for pages to load but not fast enough for me to do my work which requires uploading and downloading of photographs/video. The 19.95 plan was better, but CUT OUT ... literally stopped working completely once an hour or so, rendering it totally unsable. I told the Manager Carlos about all of this and he seemed sympathetic. I was booked to return this month, and he took off my internet charges, upgraded my room for my next stay, and promised a free fridge in my room. I didnt write a bad review and kept my week long reservation for this month thinking maybe this bad run was a fluke. I just called there to change my reservation and extend by one day. It took over 30 minutes and 4 seperate phone calls.. The reservationist was unhelpful and RUDE, transferred me back to the operator, who then transferred me again to some voiemail for reservations instructing me to leave a message?? C'mon....after literally at least transfers back and forth and repeating myself over and over for 22 minutes... No one seemed able to open or change my reservation and she insisted I booked it via a travel agent. Nope... booked direct thru their own website. I finally gave up with the attitude and ineptitude of the reservationists who literally REFUSED to transfer me to a manager. Took me another TWO MORE CALLS to get to the Concierge (first time i was transfered to a voicemail again)... finally where Lewis was helpful and apologetic. I remember him from the last time when i helped me and he is great... warm, welcoming.. one of the two (the other being Carlos) who seemed to give a sh*t about their jobs. This place is hit or miss. There are a couple gems in the staff but expect a rude, uncourteous, and downright pathetic experience with anyone else you deal with in the hotel, particularly on the phone. BOTTOM LINE THINGS TO EXPECT: - a small room with small windows so very little light - a tiny bathroom with no products (no lotion? ) and ZERO counterspace. Literally there is a 5inch metal ledge which was too small to accomodate my  makeup case. - pathetic service from everyone in the hotel except those at the top. (bellmen, valet, reservationists etc) - great location at a very cheap rate.... but you get what you pay for I guess... I'm sorry Allerton. I gave you another chance... I would not have written all of this had your phone staff not just wasted 45 mins of my day giving me attitude, hanging up on me, and telling me in 20 different ways they couldnt help.",N
3481,"I think this could easily be a great hotel, there's one thing keeping it from that... Elevators. If I were an elevator company, I'd be sending them proposals to upgrade their systems.",N
4482,"This is a very historic hotel that caters to the well off. My personal experience was interesting & rewarding yet unsatisfying. Obviously I have special needs with my disability yet the job to accommodate that was feeble at best. The bathrooms are small and few & difficult to navigate. There are even stairs and NO ramp to one of the main lounges featured bar. Top it off this is the downstairs.. Now Imagine how bad the rooms are for the disabled. They charge for everything.... the wifi even in the main lobby has a ridiculous fee. Lets not even get me started with the parking... LOL With the ""rich history"" comes a lack of vision toward the future. The atmosphere was stimulating & stuffy. The people were down to earth but yet on another planet. The staff where great, but that is what you expect for such a pricey hotel. Food was good but pricey as where the drinks. Location was well what can I say it is the tourist center of downtown.",N
1870,Agree with Jeremy S.  This could be one of the worst W Hotel I stayed at.  (BTW - Montreal is the BEST!!!) The room is small.  Service was so so.,N
5733,"The Crowne Plaza Chicago Metro was our host hotel for our wedding.  The front desk was extremely accommodating with our wedding related requests (putting a shuttle sign frame up near registration, passing out out of town bags, letting us do wedding photography in the lobby). Lena in the sales department was so good to me in organizing my hotel wedding block and answering my wedding related questions (early checkin, late check out, etc). We had booked two suites but I was in a little shock when I saw how tiny it was - we managed but that would be my only negative nit which really isn't the hotel's fault.  Just be aware that not all suites are made equal!",N
4506,"Walking into this hotel makes me feel like I'm in 1920s/30s Chicago, when everything was jazz! liquor! hacha! whoopie!  Very old-fashioned, but elegant. Great room service as well. Would definitely recommend it to others and stay here again.",N
2874,"This hotel gets high marks from me for it's consistency over the years. I stay at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers at least once a year for a global conference and it never fails to come through on all fronts. The guest rooms are spacious and very clean with all the special amenities and bed linens that make you want to stay in bed all day! The views are spectacular! Looking out on the lake, or the river or the city you really cannot go wrong. It makes our fine city look even better! The restaurants and bars have friendly and helpful servers working in them (a special thanks to the bartender in the lobby bar who brought a smile to my face the other night- you know who you are even though I've forgotten your name. Must have been all those martinis you were pouring for me!) I am here so often- that even the banquet help recognize me and say ""Hi"" and ""Welcome back"" when they see me. The Sheraton is located in a great spot- close to anything you want to do in Chicago and the concierge is always willing to toss out a new idea or two (especially helpful when all your global friends keep wanting to go get ""Chicago pizza"" or go to ""Navy Pier"" which, while great, are really not what I want to show people about our fine city! Valet parking is a breeze- just know that you need to take the elevator by the front doors down to the parking garage to pick up your car. It will not be brought around to the front of the hotel. Great location- close to everything Chicago has to offer, clean and spacious guest rooms, meeting rooms with all the necessary items to make sure things go smoothly, AND great help? Now this is a hotel that I don't mind coming to time and time again.",N
1385,"I actually got the hotel on Priceline for something like $60 or whatever so I really didn't have really high expections. I read some pretty horrible reviews about this place from some of the other hotel review sites out there though so I was a little nervous.   I've actually never had a bad experience from Priceline and this was no different.  For $60 or so, this place was great.  Perfect location, friendly staff, all the basics.  The room felt like it was out of the 60s with lots of dorky decor, but who cares, right?",N
3882,"Beautiful hotel coupled with unprofessional and inattentive staff equals pretty vacant experience. We stayed in the standard room which still afforded ceiling to floor glass windows, beautiful glass showers, and city views in this newer high rise hotel in downtown Chicago. Really the only negative was the unprofessional staff. Several times during the stay there was no hot water. Apparently they were having a hot water problem and the engineering staff had no clue what they were doing.  He came into the room, tested out the shower and said, ""you're right there is no hot water and I have no idea why but it should be fixed in a few hours."" The manager who sounded like he was in his 20s, very inarticulate and unhelpful promised a discount for a future stay which never came into fruition. A frustrating experience not having hot water, not being able to shower at your convenience, showering in different hotel rooms and empty promises from unprofessional, incompetent, juvenile staff put a damper on what could have been a perfect experience. Additionally, skip the mediocre over-priced food in their restaurant and room service.",N
5100,"We stayed at the hotel this past weekend for the 2010 Cubs Convention. The staff was horrible, and unattentive.  Next year we will definitely be staying elsewhere, maybe somewhere that cares about customer service!",Y
2471,"Yes it's got a lot of history, but I guess with that history and time comes a lot of stink.  Seriously, our room stunk, we were next to a kitchen (I think) but it smelled like a kitchen at an old folks home.  PLUS, we were put next to where I SWEAR the St. Louis Rams were staying because they were LOUD late at night, and early morning. Room was old, bathroom was old, I was just not impressed at all.  I was hoping for more with the money I paid.   *****The worst part?  The heater never worked in our room.  That is not a good thing in Chicago in December.  It is a good thing we spent very little time in our room, or I might have been more displeased.   Room service was overpriced for what you get too. ****The one cool thing about this place was getting to see the room that was used during The Fugitive with Harrison Ford.  So history and all that - isn't always what the hype makes it out to be.   I will go back and give another chance, but next time I will make sure they put me in a newer, more recently done room.",N
221,"I would stay here again for two reasons:  the staff and decor.  The front desk concierege were able to help us find a place for breakfast and hailed cabs in the blink of an eye.  I especially love the saltwater taffy at the front desk.  No crummy mints here.   I love the bright, yet calming seashore themed decor.  You forget that you're in the middle of downtown Chicago.  You can leave the metropolitan Gold Coast and step into your own seashell.  I really felt comfortable here.  How often do you hear ""outdated decor"" in reference to a hotel?  Not here.  No way.  Very chic, very relaxed.  Worth every penny.",N
3197,"Great hotel, amazing views, great Sp.  The rooms were great and we can't wait to stay there again!",N
5169,"This place was a big disappointment.  The experience really dulled my view of the W brand.  - We were initially placed in a (tiny) room directly across from an elevator bank.  We were kept awake until about 4:30am by guests in the hallway and, alternately, the elevators' chimes.  The noise began, again, around 7-7:30am.  - Without apology, the hotel said they would move us to another room the next day.  We were told we could just leave our bags in the room and they would move everything by our return that afternoon.  When we returned late in the day to get ready for a wedding, our things hadn't been moved and a new room hadn't been arranged.  After re-explaining the situation, we were offered another room with a smaller bed.  ""How much less is it a night?  We pre-paid for a king.""  ""Same price,"" the receptionist said.  ""Why would someone opt for a smaller bed at the same price?""  ""Some people like smaller beds,"" she said.  ""Yeah, but we pre-paid and opted for a King size...""  To which she said, and I'm not even kidding, ""You'll be fine.""  At which point she handed us our key.  We moved our luggage, ourselves, to the new room.  - A bunch of the cable channels weren't working properly.  But, more annoyingly, the in-room pay per view movies weren't working.  We called the front desk and they said nothing could be done.  We asked that we not be charged for the movie we couldn't watch - no problem, they said.  Apparently, there was a *little* bit of a problem because I still got charged for it and then had to plead at check-out for the charge to be taken off.  - On our final night's stay there was no running water (!).  This was Labor Day weekend, a different weekend than what was mentioned by another commenter without water.  So I guess it's a recurring issue at this hotel.  Except we didn't get offered a bottle of water or anything.  Sure, the hospitality business isn't easy - there are things that are beyond management's control.  But when you sell yourself as being a luxury brand and charge accordingly, you can't have multiple problems for a guest's stay.  And you *definitely* can't have even ONE of these issues without being extremely apologetic.  We didn't get any of that.  And it's not like we were making anything even resembling a big stink about anything at the time - though maybe we should have.  You know what would have gone a long way?  A complimentary *anything*.  It's not hard and makes slighted guests feel better:  Sorry you couldn't sleep last night, how about a cup of coffee?  Sorry we can't accommodate the size bed you pre-paid for, can we give you a drink at our bar?  Would you like us to move your luggage to your new room like we said we would?  Sorry about the water not running, here's a bottle of water on the house so you don't have to use the $5 bottle of water from the mini bar.  Nope, none of that.  Just a ""you'll be fine"" from the front desk.  Yeah, of course we'll be *fine* - but we're paying a bunch of cash to stay at a friggin' W Hotel, not a Best Western.  After my stay, the manager-person sent me a form-email asking how wonderful my stay was.  I decided to write back to see how/if they'd make amends.  So I wrote an email listing the issues.  The manager sent back another cookie-cutter email with an added line about trying to see if they could make the elevators quieter... and that she looked forward to me having a better time next time I came back to Chicago.  Huh?  Next time??  This experience has put me off staying at *any* W Hotel - least of all the the W Chicago - City Center.",Y
5640,"I have stayed at this hotel many times, as my corporate office is just a couple of blocks away. This westin is in a great location! The staff is always friendly and helpful. The room is always clean. The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the restaurant in the hotel. The food is okay, but not great. The sushi bar is a nice option, but it leaves a little to be desired. They didn't have any wasabi the last time I was there!",N
3104,"I'm reviewing the bar/restaurant...Bliss on LSD. This is another cool place to meet for a date...The food is awesome but a bit pricey. Have something light like the raw tuna & avocado appetizer that comes in a martini glass..delicious.  Sit at the baby blue lit up bar and have a drink. If the weather is nice you can then move outside with your drink and date & sit in the cool wooden lounge chairs right off LSD and watch the sun set over the lake....really laid back.  People are upper class folks but friendly. And the best part...if the date goes well, you're inside a hotel;-) This is one of my favorite hotel bars around...doesn't have the feel of a hotel bar at all. **Edit: I went here again and they don't have the raw tuna/avocado appetizer anymore...I didn't know this but they change their menu almost weekly...this time they were going on a 'world' tour of foods, so they had all kinds of stuff from different countries. Still love this place. And I figured out that you can see into the men's bathroom and vise versa....they're connected by a see-through blue window.",N
4108,"You know, based JUST only on location, this hotel has the potential of being a GREAT 5 star hotel.  I mean, you have the river, the famous bridges, Mich Ave right next door, perfect right? Except my husband ALWAYS decides to request rooms on lower floors claiming that, during conferences (frankly, business is mainly the reason we stay at hotels.. he he) the hoardes of people clog up the elevators, and he doesnt' want to get suck riding from the 34 floor to the lobby with intervals of 1 floor each. Understandable, right? WELL... unless you have the loudest bar/dance club downstairs. SERIOUS noise (ahem, music?) coming from downstairs, and at 3am I don't want to hear that.  That the rooms in the lower levels are not soundproofed for this is a major deterent. Also, when you REQUEST a king sized room, I don't care to hear that you're out, you're gonna give me a double.  Especially when the double rooms are NOT queen sized beds, but rather teeny full sized beds that make me feel that I'm gonna fall out. There are WAAAAAAAAAYYYYY too many conferences at one given time, and NOT ENOUGH places to just grab coffee and donuts.  Please people, conference attendees are STARVING, and don't have time for a sit down lunch... And Houlihans (or Bennigans, or whatever the hell is downstairs) ain't gonna cut it! AND THIRD AND LASTLY, Um.. THE TOILETS???? THEY HAVE NO COVER? It's kinda like the toilets in the industrial/mall bathrooms?  I mean, I know you're going for the whole modern industrial look, but I DO NOT want to be in constant paranoia thinking that something is going to fall off into the toilet and have to call someone to fish it out.... Aside from this, it's ok.   And quite hilarious coming back from dinner, and seeing the exhorbitantly long line of youngins trying to get into the already full ""club""/lobby bar downstairs.  Mainly because at their age, I used to do this... ;)",N
2286,"Location, location, location! My cousin and I recently stayed here for 3 nights on a weekend getaway trip. Because of the popular location we didn't need to rent a car. It was adjacent to The Shops at North Bridge, public transportation (bus/subway), taxi stands, restaurants, and pretty much anything you could possibly need. The lobby was always full of people since there is a bar and a Starbucks. After the first two nights we switched from a fairly small, yet comfortable and clean room to a bigger hospitality suite. It was basically a standard room with an adjacent living room (bonus Murphy bed we didn't use), a small kitchenette and two flat screens. Both of our rooms had spectacular views of the lake from the 44th floor. Being the needy gals we are, Concierge, the Elite desk and the front desk staff always took fantastic care of us, providing disposable razors, extra rooms keys, shuttle to O'Hare, etc. And the turn down service was a nice perk. Thanks for the chocolates.",N
2944,"The Sheraton is a large convention-style hotel with a nice location along the Chicago River and just off from Michigan Avenue and the lakefront. The lines can be long at the front desk, but the rooms are comfortable and reasonably spacious. Check out the health club's sun deck, which looks out onto the river.",N
2481,"Chicago trip tip!!! Book your hotel on priceline negotiator!  We once got the Palmer House Hilton for  70 bucks a night!   If you are lucky, you'll land there or at the Chicago Hilton. Great place to stay for a short trip to Chicago.  It is positioned right next to the park and art museum.  Within reasonable walking distance of most of the major downtown attractions.  I recommend taking a cab or the bus up to the top of the mile and walking it down, then grab a quick cab back and its worth the expense.  Especially if you go when Chicago is cold.... which is practically always!   The rooms are what you need them to be.  They are comfy, modern, and clean.  Spoil yourself and go downstairs for the breakfast buffet.  Just have them charge it to the room so you don't feel so guilty about it.   Flat screen tv in the room, ours was prob a 40 inch, maybe 45.  PC screen has free applications to cater to tourist needs and give you ideas if you run out of things to do.   BE ADVISED!  If you are taking a trip to Chicago... You will pay out the nose for parking so plan it into your budget(again, use priceline to save money so you can spend it on parking!)!  Expect 45 bucks or so a day to park at any hotel in downtown.  If you can afford it no problem.  If you can't... maybe look into parking at a commuter lot and taking the train into the city.",N
302,"Either everyones standards are really high or mine are just dirt low but this place was great.  I dont think I could have stayed about a better hotel.  Sure we looked at the really sweet 5 stars downtown and couldnt afford them due to non ballin'.  But hey... This place is close to everything.  Right at purple belmont.  Close to food, shops, bars, PIZZA. Staff left us alone the whole time which is a big plus.  Russ hooked it up several times. Small rooms but that is all you need.  It was clean warm and the bathroom had a window facing Belmont.  It was great and we will be back.....",N
4966,"WON'T BE BACK!Booked this special trip through Priceline and it turned into a very bad joke! When we got to our room we opened the door to what we believed to be a closet, we could barely turn ourselves around in it. Our great view was all of the boilers and air conditioner equipment. Internet connection was barely there ""that is if you could even stay connected"". I'm wondering where the rooms we see in the pictures for this hotel are because what they try to sell you in the picture is not what you get when you check in. So much for thinking this was going to be a special place to stay. Just my experience people but stay away from room 511.",Y
4099,"This hotel has its pluses and minuses. For the minus; small to no counter space in the bathroom. The toilette is situated in such a manner that to flush it one must reach in an awkward manner. When the toilette seat is up, it rests agains the tissue paper. Odd. I turned the air down when I arrived and then went out for a few hours. When I got back it was still warm. Called down (difficult to do, see below) and Juan arrived, saying he wished the hotel would give us a disclaimer. Their air system is not the type that blows air into the room, and it's silent. So no white noise. But he said they'd bring me a fan right away. To call the operator, one dials zero as expected, but then one gets a stupid robot giving options; speak the name of the employee or department you wish to reach, or press zero for the operator. I already pressed zero! Odd. After an hour I had not received my fan. I pressed the one touch button on the phone for exceptional stay. I was put on hold for over five minutes and then was disconnected. I dialed again and was spoken to after a minute. She had not heard that I requested a fan. It's been almost another 30 minutes. I want to go to bed, but I want a fan. The ice machine is about 3 rooms down from mine, yet I can hear everyone getting ice. Annoying. The pluses; great location, whether one wants to go to Navy Pier, Grant Park and the museums or the Magnivicent Mile, you are right there. The rooms are nice enough and the view is great. I've been here before and will most likely have to stay here again. But if given the choice, I would prefer other places over this hotel. But then again, I'm just happy to be in Chicago and staying downtown for a change, as opposed to by the airport.",N
1726,"Really?  For a 3-star hotel I get... a noisy hallway, the binging of the elevator clearly audible in my room, the world's teeniest room with smaller yet bathroom, long waits for the elevator, a crowded lobby, a swamped front desk staff and half the lobby blocked off for a private event. Harumph. We chose this place because they're dog friendly, but the accoutrement that according to their website were supposed to come to our pooch were complete no-shows.   Instead, the noisy hallway and banging of doors and elevator noises kept her up all night, pretty much ruining any chance of sleep. So the decor is quirky.  And for $1 extra you can get ""continental breakfast"" (really, just Costco mini muffins and danishes).  But it ain't all that.",N
3011,"3 separate stays here. I am a fan! Check in: I actually am a fan of the subtle vanilla/botanical scent that welcomes you when you walk into a starwood hotel. The staff are friendly and they do recognize the fact that you have stayed with them before. They always have room rates which includes valet parking ($53/night with in/out privileges) and 2 free drinks at the lobby bar (and it's not just well drinks. They do include top shelf). Room: Very clean. There is a day-bed looking furniture for lounging. The desk area isn't my favorite as it's not quite functional.. but if I was travelling for pleasure, it wouldn't matter much to me. They do offer 500 SPG points for foregoing daily cleaning service.  Internet costs $.  Also- there is an open panel between the bedroom and the bathroom. You can get your privacy by closing the wooden shutters. It's visual proof, but not soundproof. If you're there with someone you're not too comfortable with, you might want to look for another hotel. Business center: it's called ""wired""... It costs $$ just to sign onto a computer. Printing service also costs $$... Not ideal... Lobby bar: staff is okay. About $14 for johnnie walker black, plus $2 for ice! I find it ridiculous... but thanks to my free drink vouchers, I only had to pay gratuity. Lobby restaurant: Limited menu with small plates. Scallops are EXCELLENT! a little salty, but wonderful... And the truffle fries are to die for. Coffee: there is a small coffee station in the lobby every morning. Nothing too spectacular... But there is a starbucks a block away from the hotel. Call down to valet to get the car, walk down to get coffee and you'll be good to go by the time you get back.",N
2964,"It's your regular Sheraton hotel. Nothing too fancy, nothing unexpected. It is a big hotel, so the lobby is always busy. Location is good, a few blocks away from Michigan ave, but on the lower side so you would actually have to take the stairs to go up to Michigan... and it's about a 10 minute walk to it. Pool is nice too, the view from the pool area is also very nice! Could be bigger but I find nowadays that almost all hotel pools are on the smaller side. We didn't use the hotel parking, because we were there on a weekend and the metered spots are free at night and on Sunday when we were there (it may have changed)... so we were able to locate street parking for free or for a nominal fee! Apparently the last floors of the hotel, the windows of the rooms are bulletproof because a President stayed there once, I think our guide said Busch ... I didn't pay attention which one. After I had booked the hotel, I had emailed the customer service rep and had asked if we can have a room with a view of the lake because we were going to be in town celebrating my husband's birthday. She emailed me back saying that we would be upgraded to a room with a view and when we got there, the view of the lake was partial and really disappointing. Anyway! If you get a good deal, stay there, otherwise try to get a hotel on or off Michigan ave, if prices are similar!",N
498,"This turned out to be the perfect hotel for a spontaneous weekend trip in the city. We got a great last-minute rate on a two-room suite with a lake view, and the place itself is within walking distance from Navy Pier and Michigan Ave - perfect for someone who's just looking to chill out and enjoy Chicago without having to figure out how to commute from point A to point B. The free continental breakfast is okay, but I don't think it's as impressive as some previous reviewers mentioned. Definitely eat there before you start your day, but don't expect a gourmet experience! I would recommend skipping the free happy hour cocktail because everybody bum rushes the little bar at that time.",N
4097,"Absolutely one of the BEST hotels I've ever stayed in!! I won't talk about rates since I obtained my room through Hotwire's ""take a gamble and see where you end up"" service. (By the way, I HIGHLY recommend that service! I ended up here and OH was it worth it!) After scoring a free upgrade to a junior suite courtesy of who my uncle knows in the hotel, I proceeded to be completely wowed at every turn. First I was put into the newly renovated West Tower. My suite was impeccably clean with a massive comfortable king size bed, a cozy little living room area, and a bathroom with a shower to die for. They even have HD TV's in all the rooms (not just the suite) and iHome's for your iPod!! Let me tell you, when I dropped my bags on the ground and plugged my ipod in.... Let's just say I danced like no one was watching!  There was plenty of room to do so!!! As an added bonus, while I was out and about exploring the fine city, someone brought me a complimentary bucket of ice cold beer and a bag of Chicago's best caramel popcorn! Complete with a hand written note welcoming me to the city!! WIN!! The guest service from check-in to concierge to check-out was incredible. Everyone was extremely helpful and friendly. The gym was just perfect. It had everything I possibly could ask for (except a pool...). To top it off, I had just run 5 miles along Lake Michigan and ended it at the gym with some weights. I discovered their little wine cooler device with moist eucalyptus infused towels, which did wonders to cooling me down! I will say though that it was annoying not having a restroom within the gym. You had to go back to the lobby to use that. To top it all off, this hotel is so massive they have kiosks set up so you can punch in your destination and it will give you a print out map of how to get there! Wow!!",N
5651,"Good hotel, but for the price I was unimpressed.  They claim to have ""heavenly beds"" but they really weren't much better than any other hotel.  I had lunch at the restaurant downstairs and my $13 turkey wrap was pretty mediocre as well.  The internet was easy to use and reliable, though thats really  standard now so it really doesn't win much points in my book.  The rooms were pretty large, but again, pretty standard for the price.  If i'm back in town I'd probably try another place to stay next time.",N
5381,"The only reason I gave this hotel even 1 star is for location! I marked all the photos as not helpful because none of them represent the true suckiness of the room. I was doubly horrified because I brought my 6 year old son with me!  Five minutes after entering our room, he found a used razor under the dresser and in the course of our stay we found several other items that had been there, God knows how long. There was a clearly visable dirt ring where the vacuum didn't reach and obviously, the crack cleaning staff doesn't believe in moving furniture!Don't fall for the free continental breakfast either! They never had enough supply for the demand and unless you were down there at the crack of dawn, you were lucky to get coffee! Just go across the street to Duncan Donuts!If you're feeling brave, by all means enjoy the excellant proximity to many attractions. We walked to the Field Museum, Shedds Aquarium, Sears (Willis) Tower, Harold Washington Library, etc.  You can catch the #10 bus to  Museum of Science and Industry at 10th & Colombus and hop a train to Wrigley from State and Harrison. But, if you're faint of heart, run...run like the wind! I'm somewhere in between and I constantly went over the sheets for any signs of bed bugs and made my son sit on towels all the time!It may seem weird that they have an old fashioned elevator there, but we quickly learned that it was the only one that we really felt safe in. We were on the 12th floor so it wasn't an option. The other elevators seemed to lurch quite a bit, enough that my son was afraid of them...I was too, actually! If you end up facing North, the loop runs right outside your window, all night right outside your window. If your window faces South, you get to look at a brick wall!",Y
4377,"Last time I was here I had bad luck with drinks which is rare because I tend to pick great drinks, but when I went last week their winter drink selection was over the roof. I was absolutely in love with it! Drinks: *Berthas mulled wine (red wine, orange and lemon zest, cinnamon, nutmeg, star anise, cloves, vanilla bean, brown sugar, honey): I absolutely loveeeeeeeddddddd this drink. It was pretty much wine that was hot. I know it sounds weird, but it was really, really good. A must try if you go. My boyfriend drank like half of it because he also liked it so much. *Winter dream (absolut vanilla, st german, baileys, whipped cream, cinnamon): this drink was also good if you are a Baileys lover. I wish I had more of a Baileys hint to it though. It is sometimes hard to find seats here and my only complaint would be that I hate it when kids are taking up half the seats. For goodness sakes, it's a bar area and they don't drink, why the hell are they there? Other than that this place was very nicely decorated for Christmas, and I always seem to have a great time here (last time not so much with the drinks though, but this time it was great). The lobby ceiling is amazing.",N

3360,"I have some mixed emotions about the esSEX inn (juvenile, I know, but it makes me laugh).  It was in a great location, walking distance from Millennium Park and some other sites.  And I guess for the price, I shouldn't have expected much. The first night teh boy and I stayed in our own single room.  It was nice and cozy (and by cozy I mean really small).   The rest of our stay in Chicago we were in a bigger room with a few other friends.  And  the air conditioner started leaking.  We let the front desk know, but nothing was done about it.  By the third day, the carpet was soggy.  It squished when you walked on it.  No big deal if you could avoid it, but there were five of us in the room (one sleeping on the floor) so not a whole lot of room to maneuver around the marsh.   The windows in the room were kind of scary too.  We pretty high up and the windows near the floor just open right up to the sky.  No screens or anything.  Good thing we didn't have a baby toddling around or it might have toddled right out onto Michigan Avenue! The elevators were on the fritz during our stay as well.  Only some of the buttons would work, so if you were on one of the floors that it didn't feel like going to, you had to go past it and walk down a flight or two. The restaurant and bar were a joke, but I guess ok in a pinch.  If you want a drink, I suggest going to the Hilton next door. I sort of hold the esSEX inn close to my heart because it was so awful and just made our trip to Chicago that much more memorable and entertaining.",N

The Felix has wholly inadequate--almost ludicrously small--rooms. I was initially placed in a tiny room; but asked to be moved. This was done. The second room was marginally larger but, like the first, it lacked a closet; instead, there was a curtained-off niche which served as a kind of closet, though the bar for hanging clothes was a mere 15"" or so in length. There was no dresser; indeed, there was no space even to leave a suitcase open on the floor. The room had sufficient room for the bed and almost nothing else.I have been in many hotels in Europe, so am accustomed to rooms that are small by American standards. I have never been in rooms there as small as those at the Felix.There were housekeeping problems, too. The rug in the room was filthy; when I pulled back the bedding to sleep, there were long blond hairs on it. (I have dark brown hair.) ""The laundry must have missed it"" was the explanation offered by a staffer.Never again.",Y
337,"Sigh. What a pity. I was searching for a hotel in the downtown area for my trip to Chicago and Expedia threw up this Travelodge which was almost in the heart of downtown and good subway connections. With such a great location, they should be trying to make the best of it but instead, this hotel seems to have given up competely with any other effort to create a good hotel experience. This started off at check in when they observed the 3pm check in time to the minute. Any classy hotel chain would allow some leeway if the rooms are ready. So there was a huge queue of disgruntled customers all piled up at the desk at 3pm. There seemed to be little effort by the staff to appear helpful or particularly friendly. The room was adequate in a hostel standard type of way. In a way, it was good beause it forced me to get out and explore Chicago more althought I was feeling tired and jetlagged. Thank goodness I was only in Chicago for a night. Like any good Chinese person, I love a good bargain but this place isn't even worth the reduced price I did pay.",N
2521,"Excellently located.  Clean though tired rooms.  Public areas have a great aura.  Staff unobtrusive but helpful.  Access to the exec floor was great.  Simple breakfasts and access to a computer with printer made my day! Lake front room was wonderful to be in given the tulips, the blue lake, the Buckingham Fountain - pleasant to view at all hours.  Small unpleasant incident was well taken care of by the hotel.  Would stay again without hesitation.",N
2671,"I stayed here for a night and had a terrific experience. Upon arriving, the doorman and bellhop immediately made us feel like we were in store for something special.  They were friendly, talkative, and didn't try and rush us out of traffic.  Our car was whisked away and we were 'welcomed to the James'.  Valet:  Free in and out privileges - although we walked and cabbed it everywhere that weekend. The lobby is modern yet calm.  (Turned into a hopping night spot later on.)  There were problems when we were checking in.  We didn't know if our room was under my boyfriend's name, the promoter's name, or his agent's name.  The girl working the front desk was very patient with us and we got to the bottom of it.  Whoo HOO!  Free room upgrade because 'ours' wasn't ready yet.  I don't quite get that, but I'm not complaining. Side note: I love the luggage display by the elevators.   The rooms are fairly minimal but extremely comfortable.  We had a problem with the shower drain not draining.  Called the front desk.  POOF! Someone knocked on the door about 5 minutes later, did his business (not THAT business), and our shower was fixed. Bonus stars for the Kiehls bath products! We were suppose to go for dinner with the group, but everyone else had jet-lag.  Dinner cancelled.  We opted for room service.  Why leave the quiet luxury of this room if we didn't have to? I got the cob salad.  YUM!  And HUGE.  We could have split it.  Room service delivered quickly - food came about 20 minutes after we called.  I  didn't even have time to realize that they had forgotten our 2 ice waters when POOF! again.  Someone knocking at the door. After a long night out, it was a welcome treat to return to my little abode.   And HOORAY for late check out!  We lazed around in our bed fit for a king, ordered more room service, and left around 4PM. I would recommend The James to anyone.",N
3251,"The decor in the hotel is great--dark, modern, and sophisticated. The lobby and rooms are well-appointed, with super comfy beds topped with down blankets (a must as far as I'm concerned) and feather pillows. The rooms are reasonable, though amenities in the minibar are overpriced--common in hotels. The service is generally good. I had a few issues with the bar staff, but other than that, I enjoyed my stay. Frankly, though the W City Center feels more rock and roll than the Hard Rock.",N
91,"The location met our needs, and the hotel staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.  However, there were certain negative aspects that could not be fixed by a simple call to the front desk.  At this price point, you do not get what you pay for.  If we're simply talking about the quality of the rooms, I would say $75/night, $80 tops.  Certainly not $188.   Overall, the biggest concerns were the rooms' smell, and the rooms' cleanliness.  Even though it is a non-smoking hotel, the first room I was given was stuffy and smelled of smoke.  It reminded me of an old room in a B&B that is rarely used.  I get the impression that lots of weddings happen at this hotel, so I think people party in the rooms, and staff does not necessarily enforce the non-smoking policy.  One of the restaurants in the lobby is fairly new, and management did not adequately consider how the hotel's layout and air flow (or lack thereof) might let the smell of the restaurant linger in the elevators and the hallways of the upper floors.  There is radiator heat in the rooms, which is fine.  There are also wall air conditioner units, but there are no instructions- just a remote- and it took some time to dicifer.   The rooms just look dingey. The comforters are pilling due to wear,  blankets old.  The pillows had yellow stains.  Furnishings look somewhat grungey on the surface, as though they haven't been wiped down properly.  The wallpaper and sofa had white stains.  The bathroom had mildew.   When the first room I had smelled of smoke (I have a severe smoke allergy), to the hotel's credit, I was (very nicely) given a second room without question.  While the smell of smoke in the second room was less, the room was no cleaner.  Both rooms hadn't been vacuumed well, and there was grit and dirt in the carpet.   In addition, a previous guest had spilled coffee grounds in one area, and no one had cleaned it up. I understand that due to the age of the building, that most funds must be put into the exterior, and keeping it up to code.  That being, said, for the money you are paying, I think the owners should seriously consider addressing some of these problems.",N
4695,"I've found the perfect downtown hotel- finally (32/single/professional). I frequently travel to Chicago for weekend getaways and am thrilled that Priceline (Name your own price- $79/night) ""matched"" me with Hotel Felix. New. Clean. Modern. Great staff. I look forward to booking rooms at the Hotel Felix directly in the future. Several things really stood out with my experience. First, the self-park across the street was only $24/night. Most self-parks downtown nearer Michigan avenue are more like $35/night (there is also valet parking if you wanna pay for it). Also, Whole Foods is 2 blocks down the street, Walgreens across the street, dry cleaner down the street, old school barber down the street, 3 blocks from the nearest red line stop and about 4 blocks from Zara on Michigan Avenue. Another big winner for me was the the free WiFi through the hotel. No password. Easy. I stay at a lot of SPG properties and they are more than happy to charge you $20 a day or more for WiFi. This day of age, getting internet is almost as important as having electricity and running water in your room. Check-in was seamless. The H2O bath and body products were also a nice surprise. No bath- which other reviewers comment on- but it's not something I ever use. Esthetically the hotel is a cross between the W Hotel City Center and the Chicago Four Points by Sheraton. Despite having SPG ""gold"" status and being an AmEx SPG card holder, the W still throws me in their shoe box sized rooms where you can barely turn around. One poster said that this was a ""poor man's W hotel,"" but I'm kinda over the snooty service at the W. Didn't try the restaurant/bar- but both looked cute/cozy. Only criticism would be that the bed was more of a ""European Queen""- but not as obnoxiously small as the ""queen"" sized bed the Palmer house throws people into. Being a solo traveler this was totes fine. But if it was 2 'big boned' people they might have had some concerns. Also- the sink faucet was way to close to the basin to be useful. Clearly, the design team at Kohler was not consulted. Other more lackluster reviews on this hotel sited the lack of a minibar in the rooms. But I have to wonder if this is a criteria for ""LEED"" certification. The door men were helpful/upbeat. The developers/management team at Hotel Felix are truly to be commended. It takes a lot for me to be impressed in the service industry today. 5 stars not because it's a 5 star hotel- but because I had come to accept such lack luster experiences in Chicago's myriad of '4-star"" chain hotels. Others question the merits of this being a ""4 Star hotel."" My response to that is that most downtown Chicago hotels meet the criteria for being a 4 star hotel (all the horrible convention hotels; Sheraton/Hyatt/Hilton) but also consistently well-reviewed hotels like the Sofitel. I would never book a '4 star' hotel and expect anything other than the minimum criteria to achieve that ranking.",N
2872,"Going downtown is a hassle for me as it is, finding a place to stay is even more of a nightmare.  Price vs quality is all i'm contemplating, and this place was on par with what you would expect.  The air conditioning didn't work in my room, the room service was late and extremely over priced, the parking wasn't complimentary for staying at the hotel (freaking double dippers) and I could hear everything going on in the room next door - and it wasn't as exciting as you would think.   My next stay in chicago will not be here, that's all I can say.",N

1414,"Great hotel.   Really its all about location and this hotel has it.   You are right on the dreamy romantic part of Michigan Ave. and a just walk from everything.  The rooms are smallish, but the old school elegance of this hotel is tangible and cannot be faked.  You really feel its years envelop you and it welcomes you back from your jaunts like an old friend or drowsy lover.  When I stay here I always park in a pay lot and walk or take a cab since you could stay a week at a chain motel for what you pay to keep your car in the garage over the night.   See you there.",N
3448,"I stayed at the Allerton on a Friday night recently and despite the other reviews about not having enough space in the room, I found the room to be perfectly sized for 2 people. We were not in the room long enough to have a problem with confined spaces, as we stayed only for the night. The staff was great here and very attentive to our needs and wants. The only complains that I would have (personally) is that the elevators are INSANELY slow, and its frustrating to wait for an elevator for 10 minutes. Also, though the pedestal sink in our bathroom was very nice, I am a girl and have a decent amount of products and appliances that didn't have anyplace to be stored. I would definitely stay here again, but only for 1-2 nights.",N

2273,"I was staying at the Marriot for a conference in October 2011. I brought my wife along for a little mini-vacation. Checkin was smooth. Our room on the 15th floor was clean, small, but quite serviceable. The bathroom fan was either missing or inoperable. That was the only thing I found 'broken'. The bed was quite confortable and the blackout drape very welcome. There were really no complaints about the room... but for this: Being a geek I was surprised that wireless was only available on the first few floors not in the rooms. Instead there was a hardwire. The conference comp'd the internet access but I must rant anyway: YOU BLITHERING IDIOTS! In case it had not occurred to you, this is the 21st century. Internet access for most of us is not an 'optional' luxury. WTF is your problem Marriot nickel and dime'ing people for net access? I'd trade the f'in TV access straight across for the net access. No mini-bar, not that cared. We requested a fridge for my wife's medications and it was in the room when we arrived. Very nice. The front desk staff, concierge, and bellman were all well trained and cordial. The bar downstairs was reasonably priced for a 'hotel' bar. The catered conference food was really not very good. No matter, we ate out most nights as the location of the Marriot is IDEAL for a foodie looking for Chicago good eats All in all a solid 4 star performance. Not super luxury, and still pimping net access, but a solid establishment.",N
5790,"Ramada - Lake Shore Drive, Chicago- Stayed here two nights, July 19th and 20th, 2011. This hotel is past due for a tear down and a rebuild. 1st room - no air conditioning 2nd room - no working toilet (water pressure in the automatic flush valve was insufficient to flush anything, not even a piece of toilet paper) Other defects - broken TV on/off switch in room two, broken a/c control in room 2, cracked sink bowl in room 2, no cups in room 1, TV remote does not work in either room. Common Area defects - Hallways are hot - not air conditioned, elevators are slow, call lights are not lighted, 2nd elevator from parking garage in disrepair, no security and direct access from street outside to hotel floorspace using elevator 2, not enough parking available. Cosmetic - room décor is combination 70s and 80s. It's not timeless - just old. The bathroom finish materials are plastic and cheap and look terrible. Pluses - staff is working with a failing albatross, yet maintains a positive attitude toward guests - for the most part, housekeeping is doing a herculean job to keep bedding and towels and rooms in clean condition - for the most part. Negatives - staff management protocol near full booking is to re-sell a reserved room at 4 pm. I learned at 6:30 p.m. that my credit card reserved room was given away 2 1/2 hours earlier at 4 p.m. while I was in a jet flying to Chicago - amazing poor customer relations on this item. That's how I ended up with the room without air-conditioning - it's all they could offer. And because the entire city hotel system was booked, I had no choice. Unbelievable. I've never heard of releasing a room at the very moment it becomes available for occupancy...The second night, they switched me to room #2 which had A/C but no working toilet. Oh well, they tried, I guess. Overall conclusion: Do whatever you can to stay elsewhere. This hotel is broken. However, if you are an intrepid type and you don't mind hardships like heat and no working toilet, and if you are pressed for a room because there are no other vacancies within 30 miles, it is possible to sleep here and shower here - there is minimal but sufficient comfort to accomplish that due to the decent housekeeping. I found the cleanliness of my two rooms acceptable. The lack of a working toilet could be a problem, though.",N
4324,"In every corner of this grand old edifice -- in both basements; in the beautifully lit Palmer Lounge; in the Empire Room; in the ornate lobby with its glorious circular bar -- in every single room, and from every possible direction, you will feel the gnarled, grasping claw of rapine reaching into your pocket. For the love of God.  I'm willing to pay three hundred dollars a night for a hotel.  What I'm not willing to do is pay two hundred a night, then be nickled and dimed for the third hundred.  As I check in, I'm informed that the valet service will cost 60 dollars a day.  It's not uncommon to pay for valet service, but 60 dollars seems a bit steep, and it'd have been nice to choke on that figure before I surrendered the car.  Use of the internet costs 15 bucks per day -- unless you want a porn-streamable connection, and then it's 20.  Use of the gym 10 bucks per day.  There is a cheap plastic cork screw sitting on my desk, and I will not be surprised one goddamn bit if a nominal rental fee for its use magically appears on my bill tomorrow morning. And in this fashion, a high end hotel turns in a low-rent customer experience.  A particular shame given that the service people are consistently and exquisitely gracious.",N
2717,"I stayed here with 2 girlfriends for a girls night out. Centrally located near the miracle mile, it was a perfect weekend to get away from stress, family and kids.  The modern decor and square sinks were beautiful to look at. The Kiehl's body products change depending on the season. (We got the dry hair, but they have diff shampoo styles as well).  The service was impeccable and they had turn down service with cookies (diff one each night) before going to bed. Amazing. The concierge was knowledgeable, and recommended some great places to go, and eat, and dance the night away.  We made reservations to places we wanted to cancel and they did it for us. The door man is always there to help with luggage and get a taxi.. yet they don't stick around waiting for a tip, so you don't feel obligated to dish out for service like opening doors. The restaurant attached to the restaurant was incredibly delicious, and the wine selection was great.  I was so stuffed after eating there. The mini-lounge/club was disappointing. I think the lounge in the hotel lobby was more fun. Drinks were expensive, and not that great in the side lounge, but there was no cover, only mandatory coat check. I loved it here and I'd love to return again.",N

3777,"This is my review for the SPA at Dana i came here recently for a massage with Katrina (i'm pretty sure that was her name) and a facial with .. can't remember.   The massage was AMAZING.  I had an 80 min swedish massage- but she used all techniques and really customized it towards my needs.  She was very friendly and talkative when I met her, but knew when to stop talking when the massage began (thank God! nothing worse than a masseuse talking too much)  i have a really bad back and she really used deep pressure on those areas and wasnt afraid to get in there and work it lol. the facial was reallly good too.. i got a customized 50 min facial with microdermabrasion.. it was my first time so the lady really educated me on everything.. she was talking a whole lot at first but i guess she kinda had to so i knew what was going on.. but then she let me relax so that was nice.  she gave a small massage on my neck and head-- it was really bad and pointless-- something she should work on-- no pressure at all... the Amenities SUCKED. a tiny little steam room in the locker room- seats 2 people.. and 2 showers... the relaxation lounge was a tiny room for 4-5 people to sit... no snacks... but the kiwi-strawberry water was good. all in all, if u really are in need of a good massage and dont care for amenities, then u should come see Katrina... but if u want amenities and basically stuff that you're paying for... go to a diff med spa..",N
3293,"Let's be clear about this: I hate the Eighties. Perhaps I'm bitter because I officially did not get laid, even once, during that entire decade. The closest I came to actual sexual intercourse was watching old Lita Ford dry-hump her guitar on MTV. Granted, I was a teenager, but I still haven't forgiven Nancy Reagan for my unintended, decade-long abstinence. So, when I checked into my Eighties retro-styled hotel room for a weekend at the Hard Rock Hotel, my reaction was pure horror. Purple walls. Smoked mirrors. The image of John and Yoko staring at you in the bathroom. (At least, it wasn't Ringo.) I can only describe it as Miami Vice meets Sid Vicious. It's kind of room you imagine some coked-up minor record producer would try to hide a dead groupie. Hideous stuff. Putting aside my unresolved feelings of inferiority which were manifested in the 1980's....the rest of the hotel was surprisingly cool. There is definitely a rock-star theme going on throughout the premises, but it's less tacky than you might think. They actually managed some restraint. Patterned, rock star leather was to be found on all possible surfaces that could benefit from patterned, rock star leather. Their idea of ""elevator music"" is Beck, Bob Marley, The Killers, etc...a fun novelty. The gym facilities were genuine rock star quality as well. You could just envision a Rob Halford down there, working out his quads, in leather chaps. We entered the lobby on Sunday evening and were greeted by a ""celebrity"" bingo tourney, with an Amy Winehouse impersonator, cussing loudly at the mic....funny! Outside the elevators on our floor was Brian Johnson's (of AC/DC) stage outfit on display, complete with autographed white sneakers and guitar. You don't find shit like that at The Drake. What really won me over was the free guitar rentals. Yes, they will rent you an electric or acoustic guitar of your choice (nice ones, too!) to keep in your room for your entire stay. My poor wife...she thought a weekend in Chicago would provide her a few days of relief from my incessant fretboard noodlings. Give me a new guitar to play with, and I am like an infant. (The guitar rental form required the signature of the ""Artist's Name:_____"". That was a wildly pretentious moment. My guitar-playing is a lot of things, but ""art"" is not one of them.) Overall, there are certainly more refined and stylish hotel options on Michigan Ave to choose from. This would not even come close to being my first choice. (It was the official hotel for an event we were attending, otherwise I never would have picked it.) But, if you need to surround yourself with oversized images of Rodger Daltry and Angus Young on a 24/7 basis to keep you happy, this place will do just fine.",N
97,"I had my wedding (ceremony and reception) at The Carleton in Sept, 2009. The whole day was perfect - mainly thanks to Anne Mammoser Parker's hard work! Our wedding was the second of the day, and Anne got her team to turn the place around (and make it sparkle) in no time flat. The ceremony set-up was perfect, and the turn-around for a 165-person dinner happened like clockwork. Working with Anne during the preparations was a piece of cake, too. She was always available for a meeting or a phone call, and responded to emails immediately. Taking us through the tastings, to making suggestions about layout, Anne definitely listened to what we wanted and produced just that for the wedding. The hotel ballroom-area is beautiful. I received compliments all night about how amazing the hotel is, and what a fantastic venue it is for a wedding. The decor is perfect, and the size is just right. It's as formal or informal as you want it to be. The bar and two adjoining rooms are romantic and cozy, and perfect for quiet conversations and cushy seating. The hotel rooms are fabulous, too. We stayed in a room that was absolutely perfect. It was right up the stairs from the bar, and it had everything we wanted. The bathrooms are very ornate and updated, and the decor in the rooms is really unique. Truly a fantastic place for a wedding and other events! Anne is perfect to work with!",N

3595,"Would Marilyn Monroe ever use Priceline?  Are diamonds forever?  I think not.  Tell that to Kate Winslet. I was horrified to see that a hotel as glamorous as the Drake was using Priceline.  To think that regular people could be walking on the same outdated carpets and watching the same so-90s TVs as Judy Garland or the English Royal Family at $100 per night made me not want to eat for the rest of the week.  Lucky for me it was Ramadan. My two stays at the Drake have been like old-fashioned film noir love-making.  The little sofas in the elevators are to die for.  Who would ever think of putting sofas in their elevators?  Even my luxurious condo in my homeland Dania Beach does not have sofas in the elevators. Ya, and for a building with Chanel on the ground floor, I think Coco would have a chemical reaction to some of the guest rooms.  Go suite or go home.  The regular guest rooms felt dark and dreary.  Old-world style has been replaced for a reason.  I think I've rennovated myself more times in the past six months than the Drake has since 1920. So why give 4 stars you say?  hEllO, this one's easy: because the Drake isn't a hotel.  It's a museum with cleverly-disguised bedrooms.  Of course--because if you pay the same for the chic Swissotel down the street you can't say you walked on the same carpet as Prince Charles, or stood in the same lobby as Frank Sinatra.  And why people complaining about internet??  Of cOUrsE they charge a lot for internet usage in your room, hEllO.  Who goes to a museum and surfs the web?  Not anyone I know. If you want to surf the web or stay in a ""hotel,"" then go to the Best Western in Lakeview.  There is free internet and you're surrounded by gay people, all lovely, but you can't say that you slept in the same place as Frank Sinatra.  Only his wife can say that, or people who have stayed at the Drake. I won't talk about the price of this museum because I don't like to talk about money.  But if I did like to talk about money, I'd say that this museum's entrance fee is pricey on a per/night basis, but could you imagine how much the MoMa would fine you if they caught you sleeping overnight in the Marie-Josee and Henry Kravis Gallery?  You are getting 'quite' the bargain. This has been a Review by Fulgencio",N

The place is beautiful, that is for sure; a throwback to a time when fine hotels were majestic and grand and not modern and boutique: fresco ceilings in the lobby, gold trim, open bar and huge lobby.   The problem is twofold: it is aging and it is expensive for what you get.  The rooms have a old feel to them, but they are still quite old and small.  You don't get much room for your money and with so many great luxury hotels downtown, it is tough to make this the go-to choice.   Plus, the ample conference facilities means that the lobby is all jammed up with people from whomever the hotel is hosting that day. If you are going to stay in Chicago and want to blow ~$200/night on a hotel, I would stay elsewhere.",N
3315,"We went to the Hard Rock store, got good service.  I guess it helps that I knew exactly what I wanted.  The store is a bit small, but it has everything you would expect from the Hard Rock store.",N
5850,"So Surprising when we arrived, The staff was great, the rooms cleaned spotless every day and it seems that they gave you everything you would need during your visit. A real breakfast was included every morning, waffles, biscuits and gravy, eggs, cereal, fresh fruit, coffee and danish. The rooms have a fridge, microwave and a mini sink, The bathrooms are great. I was just more than impressed with my stay. The beds are a little on the firm side for me and it is my opinion and my skins opinion that they use a bit too much bleach on the linens. (Sensitive) Perfect location if you want to be in Chicago.",Y
2969,"I just stayed here for work in Chicago.  I got a great ticket/room deal on Travelocity for this place, wound up paying about $90 a night which for a Chicago hotel room in the center of everything is a great rate.  I had a lovely view of the river with glimpses of the lake, and the always shiny & interesting Chicago skyline. For my purposes this location was ideal, and enabled me to enjoy a bit of the city at lunch and after work, being so close to Millennium Park, the old Marshall Fields, Magnificent Mile, and the Art Institute. A comfortable hotel room with good coffee in room, a nice HDTV with LOTS of cable channels, not just sports & news which is what most hotels seem to offer.  Very pleasant staff. My only complaint is that I was put in a handicapped room, which was fine but the bathroom was a ""wet-room"" without a tub, but just a shower closed off by a curtain and two drains in the floor.  It took me a bit of time to get used to how to manage the water flow so everything in the room didn't get soaking wet. I'm sure they would have changed the room but I didn't realize it until the first morning and I was otherwise completely settled in at that point. I think they should tell you at check-in. I ate breakfast in the ""bistro"" one morning and had absolutely the most delicious poached eggs I've ever had. I wish I knew their secret!",N
885,"Yeah, this place rocked. It's a small boutique-style place right near the theater district. I walked around happily with this as my home base. There's a great comic store nearby, theaters, all types of shops, and many restaurants. Inside, my room was nice, and they did a great job with my dry cleaning - surprising, actually. Better than my home dry cleaner. One pet peeve of mine is hotels who say they have free wireless access but fail to have enough bandwidth to support the customers. My first day there, I watched a lot of content via their in-house wireless, but the second day I got blocked out constantly. Don't know whether it's their network or the source, but I suspect it was theirs. Still, I will overlook that and still give them a 5, because not having service got me off my butt and outside into the sunshine, which isn't all bad, is it?",N
263,"This relatively new Holiday Inn is conveniently located not far from Union Station, the Greyhound terminal, and the Clinton ""L"" station on the Blue Line. The facilities are decent enough, but you will be hearing the roar of expressway traffic here.",N
2895,"The only hotel I've stayed in my two visits to the Windy City. The hotel itself from the outside is fairly isolated and definitely imposing. Checking in was a breeze (it helps being a Starwoods Platinum member), but the lobby was both spacious and elegant. Sometimes at a Sheraton hotel it can be a bit hit or miss unlike the more upscale SPG affiliated Westin and W's. On both visits I had a 2 double bed setups and it definitely makes the stay more scenic if you can get a room faced towards the water because the rooms on the city side isn't much to really gaze at. I haven't tried the restaurants or lounges in the hotel, but they all looked busy and competent. Definitely a great starting point for anyone looking for an affordable hotel to stay in downtown Chicago.",N
533,"I live in a box in East Lakeview....(who doesn't?!), so, when I found out a bunch of my friends were coming into the city for my birthday, there was no way we'd all fit at my place. I booked a room at the Hampton because I'm a point fanatic for all Hilton properties.  Plus, it was right around the corner from Rockit, which is where I wanted to have dinner.  How convenient!  It's a good location, overall, for people visiting the city. The parking here is like $40 for 24 hours.  Not too bad for RIver North, I suppose.  There's adjacent lots for cheaper, but I'm not sure how secure those lots are for overnight parking.  Staff here is super friendly.  Like, whoa.  I didn't know the service at a Hampton could be so awesome. I got a rate of $189 online.  That's a pretty great price considering you get two rooms, two tv's, a fridge, microwave, coffeemaker, and pull out couch.  It's way spacious, good for pregaming, and I think they give you free popcorn.  Rooms are clean, bathrooms are small, but functional. Hampton's also offer free breakfast, which are handy in attempting to cure your morning after hangover.  If you're lucky, you'll be there when they serve up my personal fav - waffles.",N
3971,"I really enjoyed my first stay here, however upon my return the staff was rude, there are still employees striking and they made us prepay at the restaurant while letting other people go in without doing it! when we pointed out that they hadn't made us prepay the day before they were outright rude. when i asked if there was fruit for my cottage cheese (which was 7 bucks) they said no, and then i saw all sorts of fruit on the $20 buffet, which looked pretty rough. the reception was pretty spotty, and the whole place smells like stale cigarettes. ugh.",N
4352,"Wow. I'm a Diamond Hilton Honors member so I arrived, got an upgrade to the Executive Level and a fabulous rate on a good-sized room with free internet. The Executive Level offers the beautiful people complimentary coffee and a light breakfast, sodas, bottled water and snacks in the evenings. There is a cash bar. I would have liked free drinks but that would have been too good to be true. The lobby is beautiful and romantic and I enjoyed a few cocktails at the Lockwood bar in the lobby.  Every staff member was smiley and friendly and helpful. I had a little orgasm in my pants over the whole experience!  I stayed for three nights and I cannot wait to go back.",N
760,"I had been here before years ago and was only here for one night this trip.  Back to my usual how can you screw up one night. The hotel and location are great.  Of course love the heavenly beds.  I had a very nice room on the Starwood Preferred Guest Floor.  They had coffee on the floor in the lobby area in the AM, would be nice if they threw in some snacks too. My view was of the building next door so that was less than to be desired, but my room was spacious and recently renovated. The dual shower head was nice as well as the toiletries. The place was pretty crowded since there was a convention of sorts in town, I didn't get a chance to check out the facilities because my trip was packed and very short. My only question is why do the stores in the Bloomingdale's' shopping center close soooooo early.  I went over there a little after 7pm and it was a ghost town (nothing against the hotel)  - just a note for people visiting expecting to get a good shopping experience in.  In fact most of the stores nearby looked closed.  A bummer because sometimes after a long day of meetings you need some retail therapy.",N
1445,"Although the Omni is always a great choice, for some reason the bf felt like it would also be haunted. It wasn't. It was simply a fantastic hotel in a fantastic location in the heart of Chicago where you want to be if you're a first time visitor. Let me qualify this for a moment ... having been to Chicago several times for different occasions, I've come to discover that the whole Michigan Ave, Rush St, Lincoln Park thing is cool, but it's only a small part of what Chicago is really about. All those times I complained about having to go further than 2 miles from the area I was missing out on so much outside of what tourism has become of Chicago. One take on the Architecture Tour will show you all the other neighborhoods you're missing out on. Regardless, the Omni is nice, high class, great accommodations and very attentive staff. In most cities it's one of the best hotels and in Chicago it's no different although I make a convincing argument for some great boutiques I've had a chance to stay with. The restaurant has pretty good fares so room service would also be on par, but be prepared to pay a premium for having it in your room versus just coming downstairs, even if you're not dressed up.",N
3458,"Great location, but the entrance is on Huron East of Michigan, not on Michigan itself. Check-in is on the second floor.  I think I got a nicer room if not simply non-standard, it was a corner room, with a tight, but multiple room set-up. Living room and bedroom. Room service food was excellent.  Brioche French Toast and Goat Cheese Fritatta were quality.  They did forget to give us the sugar and toast though, which were brought back up immediately.  Get the pitcher of juice, although it is 18 bucks, it guarantees way more than 3 glasses at 5 bucks a pop.",N
4364,There are no major complaints on this hotel that I have. And I did enjoy the pool and hot tub. Our stay was short and we enjoyed the staff and cleanliness. We have traveled to several bigger cities that provide free internet and health club in the rate. I was expecting more from this hotel. Some other minor annoyances leaves me feeling underwhelmed. I'll try somewhere else next time.,N
4803,"This place is pretty weak. A bunch of wannabe's. All there is a bunch of Eastern European men trying to act like they have money with a bunch of gold digging ugly girls trying to get with them. Seriously, I looked around and everyone there is not attractive but they have big pupils with dollars signs in them. I'd ra...ther go somewhere else with people that actually have money. Poser Galore.  Spend your money elsewhere.",Y
5488,"So I have not stayed here yet, but I would recommend it to out of town guests from my experience tonight. I went to the hotel for an event and I really liked it. The bellmen, the door man, the wait staff, etc where all so nice and professional. That was impressive and the hotel was clean, it's convenient to Rush Street where there is always tons of things going on and great places to eat. I like how it's away from Michigan Avenue with all the tourist. If we have a get-a-way in the city, I think this is the next hotel I'd like to book a room at.",N
2668,"I have traveled to Chicago for business many times, and, while I had often wanted to stay at The James Hotel, it had yet to happen.  So, on a recent personal vacation, I finally followed through with a reservation.  The hotel was perfectly located in the heart of the River North area, only a few blocks from The Magnificent Mile and Lake Michigan.   From the moment we arrived until the moment we checked out, we received top-notch, friendly service.  Each coming or going was punctuated by a greeting from the door staff.  In addition, the concierge was thorough and knowledgeable.  The baggage checking department was also extremely quick and efficient.   The hotel offered a relaxing lobby with several couches and even a work station with various computers.  The hotel's gym was massive, with tons of weight machines and cardiovascular equipment.  Complimentary headphones and citrus-enhanced water were additional pleasant touches. Though we did not eat at the Primehouse restaurant, we did grab a soda in the bar and were impressed by the beautiful decor.  In addition, on our first late night out on the town, we found our way to their semi-hidden bar and lounge that served up custom cocktails in a dimly lit, skillfully soundtracked venue. Our room was just as stellar as the hotel amenities.  For starters, it was very spacious, especially for a city-based hotel.  The decor was sleek and minimalistic with the majority of the furnishings being white.  The room came equipped with a large flat-screen TV, a cozy reading nook, mini bar snacks, and a complete bar set with full-sized liquor bottles.  The bathroom was oddly equipped with a sliding door, the handle of which happened to fall off into my friend's arms on day one.  Regardless, the space was extremely large and offered Kiehl's products, as well as a convenient closet for storing personal toiletries.   Though I have loved the majority of my hotel stays in Chicago, The James had surpassed all of my previous experiences, both in the Windy City and abroad.  The flawless service, spotless room, comprehensive amenities, and beneficial location made this hotel a complete package for any traveler.",N
724,"This is a very nice hotel on the Mag Mile. The nearby shopping and dining is great, and the hotel staff is very attentive. I found it interesting that place actively uses their green program. For every night I went without having my room cleaned I got either $5 off food or 500 hotel points. If you are a frequent traveler like me the points are worth it. They can be used at Sheraton hotels as well. I've stayed at the Palmer Hilton nearby, and that's a much nicer hotel for not much more. This Westin is nice, and it gets the job done. Caution, the restaurant bar has overpriced food, but it's good food.",N
5676,"Nice, clean, and upscale. Neat decor, very old school, lots of fancy wood trim. I booked a group of my employees in there for a mini-conference. All loved their rooms, and there were no problems with our meeting room. The hotel bar worked excellently as a place to stop in for a nightcap, and everyone's room had a mini-bar. The hotel does want an exorbitant fee for internet access from a meeting room. That was a disappointment in this age of free wifi at every coffee shop in town. Even a modest fee would have been fine, but they wanted $400 (per day) for six of us to be able to connect to the wifi. (We got online via the hotel's free lobby wifi instead.)",N
196,"The Doubletree Guest Suites is a very pleasant hotel a block east of the Magnificent Mile. No free breakfast here, but when you check in you get fresh cookies in the Doubletree tradition. The rooms are rather spacious, like mini-suites with the bedroom separate from the living area. There is a sharp indoor pool on one of the higher floors, so bring your binoculars even if you are not swimming.",N
5747,"Really crappy customer service, the rooms don't have fridges, it overlooks a highway, and (again) has REALLY crappy customer service. And $36 valet only parking. I will never ever come back here, and really don't recommend it. It's not what they say it is.",N
2331,"It's a great budget option if you're really looking for proximity to the Loop and Mag mile. We spent a night here just to get away, and overall I was pleased. The hotel is bustling, the service is attentive and efficient, and the space is very clean despite heavy traffic. The room is very small, and we paid extra for a 'large room', but that doesn't bother me for a short stay with 2 adults. However, the room really lacked basic amenities: no mini fridge, blow dryer, silverware or glassware. Just would have been nice to know ahead of time, so I could have planned a little better. Nice space, and I would stay here again. I can't imagine having kids in the room, though - just too small for a family space!",N
5763,"I just came back from a two night stay at this place and it's not too bad. If you just need a clean, no frills place to lay your head at night, this is it. I would rather use my money to have fun in the city than blow it on some overpriced hotel. The cable was weird, maybe 10 channels...but HBO did work, so I guess that's a plus, right? There's no microwave, or mini fridge, for those of you who may want to bring food back to the room. The air conditioning worked perfectly, and the breakfast consisted of coffee, orange juice, muffins, doughnuts, fruit, and I think cereal/oatmeal. Not too bad. I'd quickly stay here again.",N
4644,"Wow.  We booked the Hotel Felix for our wedding night.  But after reading some pretty discouraging reviews here and there I gave them a call to discuss my concerns - I live in Chicago so the idea of dropping several hundred dollars for a bad experience when I could just sleep at my house is super unpalatable.   So, I called.  And the woman I spoke with was incredibly aggressive and rude.  She basically barked at me that what I had heard was an absolute lie and that in one particular situation where hotel staff opened the door to an occupied guestroom - that it was the guests fault.  And I quote ""If you are going to be doing that in your room you should observe the hotels policies and hang a do not disturb sign on your door"".  Are you kidding me? Insane.  This place needs to get it together.  I cannot believe that someone would respond to a guests concerns like that.  Totally mishandled.  Taking my business elsewhere!",N
154,"Got a good deal on a room here--decent location, but a bit boring in the Upper East Side kind of way. Rooms are very nice and spacious. I'd stay here again. The building used to be luxury apartments way back when, but then morphed into a hotel, and now a ""luxury boutique"" hotel. It's got a nice wood-paneled lobby that used to serve as a private restaurant for the former luxury apartments.",N
5126,"Stay away from the massages.  My husband and I booked a couples massage this weekend. The message therapist gave me a choice of a relaxing massage or deep tissue. I asked for the relaxing massage. The massage itself was a little uncomfortable at times, but over all felt pretty good. As suggested, I drank plenty of water after the massage. The following morning I woke up and was terribly sore. I was in pain all day and two days later, it is even worse. It is difficult for me to move my neck.  I had no pain whatsoever before this massage and now I feel sore and horrible. I am so angry that this 60 minute masssage has caused me 2 days of pain. Worse, I feel very foolish for  paying $125 to feel like this. I have gotten massages before and never felt like this!!!!",Y
4104,"Got this room on priceline for ~80 a night. The bed was comfy, and the location was great (well public transport was like 4 blocks but I'm just being picky on that one..). I used a machine to checkin instead of checking in with a person (to avoid a long line). The machine gave me a room on the lowest floor with 0 view that was a handicap room. Seriously it had to be the worst room in the place. I realize it's my fault for using the machine... but seriously.... anyways, note to self avoid the checkin machines in the future.",N
5615,"A great location for your trip to Chicago. The service was great and the room was impeccable. I was very excited that I was able to coerce room service to make me breakfast despite the fact it was very, very past the official hours of eggs. The bedding was like a magical cloud I never wanted to get out of. The only downside was the computers downstairs that charge by the minute. One froze on me, kept charging me all the while, and once I finally got a manager to come and help me, she was incredibly rude, and tried to claim it was my fault. It was a bad way to end a nice stay.",N
281,"A thin veneer of elegance fails to conceal a lot of sloppy upgrades over the years.  Many fixtures in the room were loose (power outlets falling out of the walls, bathtub faucet flopped around), and the furniture was worn.  Understaffed, had to wait unacceptably long to check in due to a guest in front of me having a complicated issue and no other front desk being available to assist other customers while it was resolved.  That said, the room was clean, the location excellent, and we got a great mid-week deal.  Good for the budget-conscious traveler who's not looking for any frills.",N
2474,"* I am basing my review on attending a seminar here, NOT staying in a room over night. * That being said, I think the hotel is gorgeous and was impressed with the ballroom.

At the great staff who checked us in, the decor of the lobby, the cute Parisian style elevator, the 2 tvs in our room, the excellent amenities in the bathroom, the modern mini bar, the comfortable pillows and bed, the soft towels, how it's the same $ as The Beverly Inn, LA but heaps better, the awesome complementary breakfast served in real bowls, not styrofoam!, their recycle bin in the lobby and there good location. Best quality hotel for this price range and this area for sure.",N

318,"The hotel is in a great location and offers a nice continental breakfast.  The major drawback the hotel has is the noise from the ""L"" train station at West Belmont.  I asked for a quiet room on the side away from the station some time in advance.  When I checked in, the clerk had me on the noisy side closer to the station.  He did move to what was ostensibly a quiet room, #208, but it turned out that the room was directly above a frozen yogurt shop.  The shop played blaring music that penetrated into my room.  When I called the front desk about it, they clearly knew the short comings of the room stating:  ""They'll close in about an hour.""  The hotel offered to move me, but I decided it wasn't worth the hassle.  I toughed it out and eventually the shop closed and the music stopped. I discussed the issue of getting a quiet room with the front desk clerk upon check out.  She informed me that though I might request a quiet room, there was no way they could guarantee one for me in advance. I emailed the hotel after having left with a summary of my concerns.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive a prompt email from the general manager apologizing for my inconveniences, offering a credit as compensation, and requesting that I call her.  I did call the GM, and she explained to me that the hotel had been working with the yogurt shop on noise issues.  Further she said she would talk with her staff as to how to better accomodate guests wanting quiet rooms.  Desired room types are not always available on the quiet side of the hotel.  In closing, she requested that I call her personally to arrange any future stays at City Suites. Given the gracious and generous response of City Suites' management, I will definitely give the hotel another shot.",N

3849,"My honey took me here for a romantic staycation weekend for my birthday.  I had no idea we were going there and hadn't heard too much about the hotel so had no expectations.  I did however read a few yelp reviews while we were there watching our romantic weekend go down the tubes because of horrible service, incredible noise, and snotty, huffy hotel staff. So I'll start with arrival - everything went fine, we get to the room and at first are ohhhing and ahhing over the very cool looking shower.  But after taking a shower, the coolness factor wears off - serious open door design flaw. So not too much of a big deal, but worth noting.  Then we went for drinks in their super swanky rooftop lounge.  That was fun (although crazy overpriced) but I guess what do you expect from a downtown hotel.  The appetizers we had were decent and the service was a little slow. Also, you couldn't get to the rooftop lounge unless you went back downstairs and had someone swipe a card to get you up there.  This seemed kind of ridiculous to me - I had a room key, that should work as well.  We go out to dinner, get back to the room and when we're trying to go to sleep the noise from the rooftop bar is unimaginably loud. I can pretty much sleep though anything but this was out of control.  So we called the front desk to see if we could be transferred to another room (even though we were exhausted and already in bed). The woman on the phone was completely rude and unaccomidating.  She said the rooms were completely booked (really? In a recession on an off weekend right before a holiday?) and there was nothing she could do.  She did say she would ""send somebody up."" So we stayed awake waiting to speak with this person she was sending up and they never showed.  We called again.  Same woman said that she sent security up to our floor to walk the hallways and see if this was noise.  Since they didn't hear anything (in the hallway) then she said there was no problem with noise.  I asked if there was anything she could do, that we couldn't sleep and she said she could send up a fan or earplugs. (which then took 30 mins to get to our room and didn't help much.) The next morning after a crappy nights sleep (oh and there were multiple holes in the sheets) we ventured downstairs for breakfast. We wouldn't have even eaten there (read the reviews before hand that indicated the service was TERRIBLE and the food mediocre) but we had vouchers. We get to the restaurant and decide to sit at the bar because we thought we'd have a better chance at getting better service. I think that was a good call and while we were waiting for our food we got to see how frantic, disorganized and unprofessional the management and some of the waitstaff were who were trying to get drinks to their table.  Food came out - utterly unforgettable, greasy, and not worth even using the voucher.   Finally we go to leave and as we're checking out the manager just tells us we're all set after we turn in the keys (they didn't even ask how our stay was.) So I pipe up and give him an earful in a respectful way but in front of many other guests. he kind of half apologizes and then says he'll follow up in the next 24 hours by calling me to get more information and see if there's anything more they can do. It's now been 2 months and no call ever came.   Do yourself a favor, if you are going to stay at a nice hotel in Chicago, skip the Dana.",N

Kudos to the staff for being accommodating. I have to warn you though, the carpet mixed with the burning candles they have throughout the lobby was nauseating to me. The carpet needs to be changed in the lobby as well as in the elevator. The floor and the rooms were fine thought, Thank God!

She performed extensive relocation of the furniture to ensure the ""flow"" of the room.  Sarah outreached to our incoming out-of-town guests and made sure they were educated on hotel  amenities.  W-Hotel also provided referrals for a nanny or evening sitter for our esteemed nephew-Mathew.  My cousin Sandra is a new mom and this was a concern for the family.  The service was wonderful on all aspects and we had a great time. Thank you to all the staff and especially Sarah Petermann.Michael & Janette  ""MJdragonfly""",Y
3826,"This was the first rooftop bar in Chicago that I've been to. I don't know much about the hotel and spa itself. Actually, I don't know anything about it. but this is probably the last time I'll go to this rooftop bar. I enjoy rooftop bars/lounges (especially in the summer\spring time). The Dana Hotel was really nice. It was half open to the outside and half indoors. It was nice. They had heaters for the winter, I supposed. The music was pumping, nice size crowd, there is some dancing and grinding involved (not trashy at all). Some of my girlfriends and I went to meet up some of our other friends here. I've been to settings like this before (stylish yuppies, douchebag ""bros"", rich pretentious old men looking for younger girls, ladies who are waiting by the bar looking hot slash slutty so they could find some pretentious old man to pay for their overpriced, skinny tall glass with a ton of ice and straight up alcohol drink, etc.) You just have to go there with a mentality that everyone's there to get wasted (as did I) and then judge everybody else. It's easier for ladies to get in than guys, unless you're popular and/or rich. Don't get me wrong, I had a great time there with my friends, but the place was too poshy, too stuck up, and wasn't my cup of tea. I'd go back if people asked me to, but I would never suggest going there to have fun. It's a good place to take your visitors, if they like to go to places like that.",N
2949,"I had a wonderful stay at the Sheraton.  The staff was top notch from check-in to check-out, the bed was super comfortable, and my hotel-room-scavenger-hunt yielded free PORN!  That's right, I found two magazines from August 1993 (Hustler & Velvet) - their similar dates lead me to believe they have been in hiding for 13+ years.  I also found a vintage bottle of Christian Brothers Grand Reserve V.S.O.P. Brandy, but alas it was either completely consumed by a previous guest or evaporated over it's years of impromptu storage.  The only thing I would change about the room was the bath.  The vanity and shower hardware are starting to show their age and the amenities were Pantene branded.  A little spit and polish would do the bath setup some good.",N
1304,"My fiancé and I stayed 3 luxurious nights in the Anniversary Suite for New Years.  We had arrived early so, we had the concierge hold our luggage until the room was ready.  During our wait, we ate at the cafe for lunch.  We waited 15-20 minutes for our meal. Since it was a minor inconvenience, the manager offered us 2 complimentary glasses of the Cabernet Sauvignon we were drinking.  I thought that was pretty nice...  I had the ""Four Storey Hill Farm Young Chicken, Yukon Gold Potato Purée, Baby Turnips, Crimini Mushrooms, Roasted Garlic Jus"".  That was probably the most memorable restaurant chicken meal I've ever had.  The meat was so tender and had excellent flavor. Not too overpowering... The vegetables were perfect.   As we got to our room, our luggage was already set up for us.  I'm not going to blabber about the details in the room.  The pictures speak for themselves... That night, we attended a black tie event in the greenhouse area.  There was a live band, our own private ice sculpture at our table! And a gourmet buffet adorned with fresh sushi, rack of lamb, caviar, French breads and cheeses, oysters, and so much more.  It was a feast! The last night we were there, I also had tried the ""Butternut Squash Lasagna, Butternut Squash Purée, Ricotta Cheese, Walnuts, Spinach""  -absolutely amazing... If you don't mind spending some coin for a luxurious hotel stay, this is the place to go.  Excellent service, convenient, great location, right at the center of the Magnificent Mile.  And I almost forget to mention I'm one of those gals that like 'free' stuff. -ha... I collected about $200 worth of L'Occitane soaps and conditioners.  Hey! It's good stuff can you blame me!? We had a fabulous time here...",N
3075,"This place is slick. I arrived Friday night after a long car ride and the lobby was lively with gorgeous young people dressed to impress. I felt really plain and out of place! However, the service was fine and the room (suite) was huge and decadent. The view was killer- I'll let my photo contribution do the talking. I had two problems with the room: 1) no coffeemaker/hot water pot (i like having hot water around) and 2) the showerhead (a rainbath like thing) was pretty weak. All in all great experience, though. The whole place had a very sophisticated, playful, and slightly naughty feel (the word cubes in the room were a great touch). What a lovely way to escape for a weekend.",N
4797,"Just returned from a 4 night stay and have a few additions to what's already posted....the rooms are adequate, and yes, you will hear some noise from the nearby L-train. Remember, you are in Chicago...if you wish to ride that same train there is a stop only a block away.  The comfort factor for the room is great, all the latest gadgets fit nicely on the workspace/desk, the bed is up to the new ""heavenly bed"" standards, bathroom is well set up (sink is a bit of a mistake, but shower, etc. are fine), and the TV has all the stations you could want.  Dined at both the restaurants and the food was outstanding (had the trout for dinner one night and breakfast every morning).  Prices are a little high-Hilton Diamond members get breakfast for free-so that's a plus.  Overnight parking was $45-again a little high for my taste, but the market rate for downtown Chicago.  Next time I may cab it everywhere and avoid that charge.  Given the location, you could also walk to plenty of attractions.  Rooftop bar was a scene worth checking out...even if it's not your scene.  Staff was very attentive, yes, they need some seasoning but they try hard so I give them high marks for that.  I will return sometime in the Fall, let's see if they get better at The Wit.",Y
187,"Yay, another great Hilton hotel! They ""stuck"" us in a room on the 28th floor with a unobstructed view of Lake Michigan.  Flat screen T.V. in the living room.  Another T.V. in the bedroom.   Came with a concealed fridge and and microwave. Also a wet bar. The fluffiest biggest towels anywhere. The hotel restaurant breakfast buffet is very good with a lot of options. Nicely within walking distance of everything in downtown Chicago (one block off Magnificent Mile). And for what you get....the Hilton Suites is not that expensive.",N
410,"No complaints about this place, the price was right, the location was convenient (RIGHT off the Red line, few blocks from Michigan Ave, surrounded by restaurants, etc.) and the room was spic and span. I would def stay here again!",N
1539,"I stayed in Hotel71 for two weeks over the holidays, and it turned out to be a pretty nice place. My boyfriend and I booked the queen double room with a city view. We chose the double room because it was considerably larger than the single bed rooms and was almost the same price on http://hotels.com. Our room came with two beds, a desk area, a chaise lounge, and a two-part bathroom (one room held the marbled sinks and mirrors, while the adjoining room had the rain shower and bathtub). Our room had plenty of storage space, a huge closet, and plenty of cabinets and drawers to store our belongings. The staff was very welcoming and helpful. We requested a mini fridge and microwave, which were both placed in our room by the time we checked in. The gym in the hotel is very nice with a ton of different machines. The gym also has an amazing view of the city, definitely a bonus while working out. My only complaints have to do with the cable and phone service in the hotel. The cable had a VERY limited amount of channels, about 20. If you're visiting the city for the first time, this won't be a problem since I assume you'll want to go out and about in Chicago and not sit in the hotel and watch tv., but since I am native to the city and stayed in the hotel for 2 weeks, I definitely had down time in the hotel. The no tv. situation was a big letdown for me. Lastly, the biggest problem we experienced was the phone service. The area code for downtown Chicago is 312, while the rest of Chicago is 773. We made a few phone calls to 773 numbers, believing that they would be considered ""local"" and thus be free. This is not the case, upon check out we were handed a bill for over $80 in phone charges. We checked everywhere in the room and welcome book, NOWHERE does it say anything about exorbitant charges for phone service. We called the front desk and explained that they should have posted somewhere about the fees and that we felt misled. They gave us a $40 credit and apologized, blamed the fees on some new phone provider that they are switching to. The credit was ok, but I definitely still feel taken advantage of. My advice if you stay at Hotel71, get a bigger room, it's worth it, and DO NOT touch the phone unless you want a huge bill waiting for you at check out.",N
1546,"I have no complains whatsoever about this hotel.  I wished we were able to do a late check out but that was the only thing they were not able to accommodate us with since they had other tenants coming in that sunday.   They were kind enough to change our reservations from 3 nights to 2 nights since our flight was canceled the night of in Vegas at no additional fee.  This hotel is AWESOME on location!  What more can you ask for since its right at the corner of Wabash and the riverwalk!  You are only about a block away from the bar/lounges area across the river, towards the Trump tower also! The hotel is also about 1.5 blocks away from CTA, if you are thinking about going to the airport.  Very do-able for someone that doesn't like walking either!  We upgraded to a river view deluxe king room, which was totally worth it.  The view was gorgeous and our bed... omg our bed made us not want to go out since it was so COMFORTABLE!  That is the most important thing in a hotel for me, the bed and hotel 71 won me over there.  Our room was more than spacious.. more than we could ask for at the rate that we got through travelzoo.  I was quite pleased.  The hotel itself is a large boutique hotel, with very nice and trendy decor.  They have a large office area for customers to use for internet/printing, large gym, and a restaurant/bar named Hoyt's that is open until about 1am everyday.  When it comes to reading all about the cons from other yelpers, those cons mean nothing to me since we were mainly outside, discovering Chicago, instead of trying to stay in our room.   We were accommodated with VIP Shedd Aquarium tickets, which saved us so much time with no lines from the hotel.. There's another plus. I am more than happy that I stayed at this hotel on my trip to Chicago and I wouldn't mind coming back with its perfect location of the river and magnificent mile.",N
2496,"I like this hotel. The service is never good enough for me because I stay in the regular rooms. The wait at the front desk can make the stay sour even before you get into the room. But after you get in peace is yours. The rooms are clean and smell nice. The pool is great and you can do the spa thing or work out. There is also a whirl pool, but it is often full of kids on the weekends. I may be foolish to spend money on a hotel when I live in the neigborhood, but I find it essential to get away. For the ""Taste Of Chicago"" it is a convineience and for guest it is a safe place. The handicapped rooms are great for your parents if they have any available. The food is OK and expensive, but such is life in downtown hotels. I recommend this hotel for families, too.",N
1122,"Great Hotel. 2 minute walk to Millenium Park, 4 minute walk to Michigan Avenue. Not sure how others are dishing the location? Rooms are very nice and BIG. Bathrooms are great. The restaurant downstairs, Aria, is excellent.  Service was perfect.  Highly Recommend.",N
1720,"I'm attaching my review from TripAdvisor. I love this hotel. I just find it very charming. I love the new decor, and the location is great. Front desk staff is always friendly and helpful. Valet's good too - there was this guy Chuck at the valet when I stayed here a few months ago and he was just the nicest guy. Haven't seen him the last 2 times I stayed here though. Also ordered room service for breakfast once and it was great. Like others have mentioned, the rooms (and sinks and closets) are definitely smaller, but in my opinion they're enough for 2. I've stayed here with my partner for over a week before and we had everything we needed (although a microwave would have been nice). It just sort of feels like living in New York, you have to be neat and make sure every space is being used. I've also stayed at the King suite before - nice separate living room space, but you can only sleep 1 comfortably on the sofa bed. My friends opted to lay the pillows on the floor and slept on the floor instead. I get the feeling that the hotel doesn't have all its processes down yet. Sometimes I make requests (such as pillows or pet bowls) and they take a long time to be fulfilled. Sometimes it takes multiple reminders, and sometimes it takes me to be proactive by going downstairs to the front desk. They certainly seem to be improving everytime I stay here though. and if anything does go wrong, the staff does its best to remediate the issue, an effort which I am appreciative of. My biggest issue with the hotel is its thin walls. Of my stays here, I've heard neighbors' passionate nights to phone conversations, and I'm not even a light sleeper. My worst experience was when my neighbor decided to wake up to Josh Groban 45 minutes before I wanted to wake up. An unfortunate incident likely resulting from being in an older building, but somehow I still like this hotel a whole lot and keep going back. I now request for quiet rooms in my Kimpton profile, and it seems to have helped in my most recent stay.",N
1247,"This hotel was great for what we were doing: passing through town. Our check-in was quick and the desk staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was booked through http://Hotwire.com (which is probably where everyone else that day booked their room, since there was no convention that weekend) and so it came over with a single King bed reservation even though I reserved for 4 people - a knock against Hotwire, not the hotel. Hyatt was happy to move me to a two-double bed room. The room had nice beds and linens, but the pillows were uncomfortable. The elevators were swift and to echo everyone else's statements about the gym: amazing. For gym enthusiasts: free towels, including chilled ones - free headphones, free water, music playing, TVs on, tons of cardio machines, free weights, jump ropes, resistance bands, medicine balls, balance balls, a full range of ROM weight machines, roman chair, etc. - really - AMAZING. The locker rooms have lockers, showers, sauna!! The pool is silly, it's more of a kiddie pool than anything, but the gym is 24 hours, so that's a huge plus. There aren't a million TV channels, and the internet is for-cost but those weren't material to us. It would've been nice to access the internet for questions about where to go to dinner, but the concierge was more than helpful about that. The hotel has really thin walls, we travel with a sound machine, but I could still hear TV in other rooms at 4am - lots of doors opening/closing late at night in the hall, too. Toiletries were above average and nice smelling. Plenty of towels. Room included iron, hairdryer (on closet shelf), bible, chairs, floorspace, mirror, bench. The split bathroom was nice for people traveling with more than one person. Temperature in the hotel was just fine for us, perfect for sleeping. For-cost amenities are over-priced, but we avoided them by bringing out own snacks/drinks and eating elsewhere. I would stay here again!",N
2205,"I always recommend this hotel to my friends and family when they visit Chicago. It's not as trendy as most of the hotels I like, but the rooms are very nice and it's an amazing location (especially for those who love to shop). My parents have also found hotel rooms here for as little as $159/night, which is quite a good deal for a nice hotel in Chicago!",N
5601,"I believe this may have been my first time staying at a Westin hotel, and it was very nice.  I was on the 3rd floor with a pleasant view of the river and the garden terrace below.  The weather wasn't terrific the 3 days I spent in the Windy City, but it was still a nice view to have.  The bed was really great, one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever had the pleasure to sleep in.  The room was nicely laid out, with a spacious and well lit bathroom (I dig the lighted mirror).  I also appreciated the inclusion of some nice teas with the coffee machine & not just coffee as I don't drink it. I was there for a conference, and the conference facilities on the lower levels were rather nice.  They provided tables to sit at instead of just chairs, which I love since I tend to take a lot of notes on a laptop or, in this case, my new iPad.   I ordered room service for two meals, one lunch & one dinner, and I felt like the food was good, but it was priced a couple dollars too high in my personal opinion.  I haven't had the best of luck ordering anything with avocados east of Nevada and getting good ripe ones, but the ones on my sandwich were perfect here, so kudos for that. I did have occasion to sit in the hotel bar awhile, which I felt, like most hotel bars, was overpriced a few bucks at least.  I was also disappointed my last night there, while killing an hour before leaving for the airport, that my cheese platter took almost 30 mins to be brought to me... I know it doesn't take that long to cut cheese, half an apple, and put the apricot chutney in the little bowl!   Overall I'd stay here again without hesitation.  I know the snack tricks now (get them at the gift shop & just ignore the mini bar) and the room was very comfy & relaxing during my conference down time.",N
2423,"Decent hotel, I stayed there for business and I am kind of a hotel snob so maybe this is why I only gave it 3 stars, but it was being renovated and everything smelled of wet paint.   Also not that I expect to be upgraded every time, but I do have Hilton status and usually am, and almost expected to be based on other yelper's experiences at this hotel - except this time, all I got was a free .5L bottle of water.   So I am fishing around for a .5L bottle of water in the mini fridge - didn't see one - there was a smaller Evian and a MOLD COVERED 12oz perrier can in the back.  Gross. My room's fire alarm was so sensitive that me taking a shower with the door cracked set it off - at first I thought ok, it will stop in a second - WRONG - 4 full minutes later, I got out of the shower, waved a towel under the fire alarm for a bit, and it FINALLY went off.  I was a little concerned that walking down 19 flights of stairs if it got evacuated would kill my night, so I am glad it finally stopped shrieking at me - but damn, if I wasn't worried for a few minutes.   So yeah.  Cool looking historic building, pretty good location (except not really near any EL stops) - but I won't stay there again unless desperate.",N
3512,"though i consider myself to be a modern bride, i did still want to tie in some historic chicago to my wedding day. i ended up choosing to have my wedding at this hotel because it has a very cool vintage regal feel to it while it is still updated with everything you need. our reception was in the renaissance ballroom. i wanted to have breathtaking views for our OOT guests to enjoy. they had an onsite planner to help with everything and it was a big help throughout the entire process. they even had experience with other asian weddings and were able to help us with menu choices that would satisfy both our eastern and western guests.",N
2451,"A very nice Hilton property and a good location for large groups.  Generous amounts of elevators to get large groups back to their rooms between convention sessions. Overall, I am never a fan of hotel room service and there was nothing exceptional here that would change my mind.  Take a cab to restaurant locations nearby 5-10 minutes, or order in. Hey, the rooms are clean.  Beds are good.  TV's are large, and the AC works.  Cool stuff.",N
2227,"One of the best hotels in Chicago, the Intercontinental boasts old world charm with contemporary elegance. The four-story lobby, which features a grand staircase and bronze embellishments, makes you feel as if you were a movie star.

3976,"Never stay here. The air conditioning unit was really noisy and did not cool the room, after complaining to the front desk they didn't fix it in 3 days, then said air conditioning was not needed on that weather. (The noise wouldn't let us sleep and opening the windows was worse) The second night of my stay I left my camera at the room to go out for dinner and to my surprise only 2 hours later my laptop and SLR camera were gone... (Being in the 13th floor, there was no fire-scape or way of entry other than the card activated door) The security department told me NOT to call the police. Of course I called anyways. There was a pillow missing, I presume that they used to take out the items. There was no manager on duty and the staff was poorly trained. When I finally got hold of the Hotel President a few days later, the gentlemen was as rude as it staff and said that he could not even file a claim to his insurance company (if they have one) because it could not possible be proven that it was his staff. The room was not clean when I got there, I had to call and have them pick up some forgotten clothes in one of the drawers...",N

Expected more from a hotel on the mag mile.",N
5290,I stayed here for business at the end of January and really enjoyed this hotel.  The front desk told me that they had just finished renovating the lobby a few days before I arrived and it did look very nice.  I took advantage of the free drinks at night and the breakfast in the morning.  My only real complaint would be that the parking was $44 overnight.  I should have just taken the train down from Milwaukee cause the hotel was located right in the heart of downtown.,Y

3514,"I was in the city with my significant other to visit a friend and celebrate my birthday and after doing a little research on Expedia we decided to try out the Allerton.  I am SO glad we did.  We were put in a very nice, unique room that looked right out over Michigan Ave. and the lake. The room was ""unique"" in that rather than being square and wide it was long and narrow, which I had no problem with.  Narrow and on the small side is how most of the hotel spaces are constructed (particularly the elevators) and I can see how, as some posters have complained, a standard room may be smallish and the narrow hallways and elevators were annoying (especially at check out time when everyone is using them all at once.)  However, it is not a secret that this is an old hotel.  If you don't appreciate the history, age and building structure that go along with an older building stay someplace else.  Everything about our stay was A+.  Friendly staff, super comfy bed and linens, a bathroom stocked with L'Occitane bath products and room service that was delicious and not priced at heart stopping rates. (We had a delicious full breakfast that cost no more than we would have paid at any standard restaurant on Michigan Ave.)  You can't beat the location, the room price was extremely reasonable for the area and we will definitely be back again!",N

Down one block west on S. Holden Street were 2 other parking areas one on the right hand side was outdoors unattended lot for $16 for 24 hours (we chose this one and our car was fine. Meter takes credit cards, most Chicago street parking does). On the left was a garage attended for $17 for 24 hours.",Y
5727,"This hotel is beautiful and the rooms are lovely. I decided to have my wedding here. Jennifer, my coordinator was helpful, friendly and unfortunately also a victim of this monstrosity of a business. My wedding looked a little shabby and as I marched down the aisle, I almost cried at how awful the ceremony looked. I couldn't believe that my instructions were not followed as I laid them out. That may or may not have been the fault of my mother. My wedding favors were never set out or returned to me. My guest book disappeared. My wedding coordinator came up to me (after My vows were read) and told me my cake was not there, and that I would have to sorta pantomime cutting a piece of cardboard for my photographs and guests. (amazing how no one confirmed that my cake was made maybe a day or two before). It wasn't until later I discovered what actually happened. The cake was outsourced to Bake for Me on Roosevelt. Jennifer assured me that my cake would be great. When I came in for my cake tasting, some 2 or 3 months earlier (an appointment that was made) I had to fight for the attention of person given a tasting to 3 or 4 other couples (why did I have to make an appointment?) Apparently, after I made my cake choice, My order was stuck in the back of a file, never to see the light of day. After I returned from my honeymoon, I was told I had to pursue the bakery (not the hotel who had a agreement with this bakery) for a refund. After all, all you did was make us cut a piece a cardboard and have my guests eat cake from Jewel - Osco). I was so heartbroken, All I could do is drink Tequila Sunrises at my open bar (which I was told was upgraded, but also closed 1/2 hr early). Sometimes, when I think of all the money we spent on this entire day, i just want to cry. We barely received an apology and no compensation for their negligence. Thanks for the memories.",N
4553,"We were fairly disappointed. While the lobby area is quite immaculate and historic, the rooms are not. They are quite small. On our second night there we experienced problems with some loud partiers next door. We called management and they tried to contact them a few times. Finally, we called again and they asked if they could bring some earplugs to us. We explained that we already had some. Unfortunately, we did not sleep well that night. We would choose a different place to stay the next time we are in Chicago.",N
4807,"Went to the Rooftop bar/lounge at the Wit Hotel in Chicago and want to say, don't go there on a nice day at happy hour....it's more crowded than a Chucky Cheese on Saturdays.  Nice place, nice looking...nice looking crowd, but good luck sitting at a table and hoping your waitress/waiter is going to come by often.  Obviously, service is not the forte at this place...more like try to look good and network.  Our waitress was awful and I saw her come near our table 1 time in 2 hours.  You might as well sneak in some booze or order liquor take out from Old Town Liquors and have them bring it to the lounge.  haha",Y
3041,"I was so surprised to see all the negative reviews of this place because I loved my recent weekend stay here. Yes - W hotels are awfully pretentious sometimes and honestly, it's not the type of hotel that I normally stay at. But I had some starpoints and it was a weekend mini-vacation in Chicago so I decided to try something out of the norm. I got upgraded to a suite on the 30th floor and the view was AMAZING. I personally loved our room...everything from the half bath by the entrance to the decor and even the window in the bathroom (but yes agreed with other reviewers - if I wasn't traveling alone or with family, it might be slightly weird). The service was decent - not bad, but also nothing extraordinarily amazing. I never got a chance to take advantage of their Acura service where they drive you anywhere within a 5 mile radius, but it seems like a great way to get around, especially since this hotel is not particularly close to anything. Quick walk to Navy Pier, but you're going to have to walk a few blocks before you get to anything of substance (Magnificent Mile, public transportation, etc) - that was my only complaint. Overall though, awesome weekend here. I would definitely recommend this W location over the City Center location.",N
2255,"work brought our satellite location crew into town for the weekend and everyone camped out at the Intercontinental. i was lucky to have gotten to stay here since i am local but i summed it up as a comped staycation. the hotel is really two hotels. i stayed in the tower and i saw both sections, and like it better than the newer section. the hotel offers commanding views of downtown so opt for the highest floor possible. throughout the course of the weekend i had fully explored the entire hotel. a few of us at at their zest restaurant. it was quiet and had a very american menu with nothing too ambitious. while it was expensive, the quality of the food and service unfortunately did not match the price. ENO on the other hand was very nice. their impressive wine list was deciphered with ease by their knowledgable waiter and glasses were complimented by some of the finest cheeses i have ever tasted. i felt very relaxed because the atmosphere was not pretentious. i believe the menu might have had a few sandwiches but we didn't try them.",N
626,"I am not impressed with the Doubletree.  The first room we tried smelled like an ash tray.  Not very appealing when you specifically reqeust a non-smoking room.  We headed back down to the front desk and luckily scored another room.  This room was fine - ok, kind of clean, not sparkly and new...just meh.  The parking was over $40 and it was self-park!  Ridiculous!!!  The breakfast for HH members was the continental buffet only, but don't be fooled, you can order off the menu (we didn't know this until we heard another customer ask).  The cont. buffet was depressing-The best item was the Dannon Yogurt and the muffins tasted like saw dust. We did not spend any time downtown, so perhaps my review would be better if we were looking for an excellent location near Michigan Ave.  I think I am becoming a hotel snob!",N
3510,"I can not recommend this hotel for business travel.  We paid a great deal of money for my tiny room and then when I had no Internet connection as promised.  When I enquired, I was told to the room had never been connected to the hotel's Internet and that I was simply out of luck. I wrote a complaint email to the general manger about the situation and was ignored.  In a city with great business-class hotels, why would I return to one that can't deal with such a simple (but important need) and who treats its clients disrespectfully?",N
1856,"We decided to have our wedding guests stay in a block of rooms here after getting a great rate through our reception site.  The people we worked with to arrange the wedding block were super-organized and quick to respond to any and all questions about the reservations.  They have a great website where you can track who has reserved rooms under your wedding block- this was helpful for reminding out-of-towners to get their butts in gear! My experience at the W, as a bride, was fantastic.  I was given a choice of room- a regular room for free or a suite for the discounted rate my guests had for a normal room.  I went with the suite.  It was AWESOME.  I checked in Thursday afternoon with a ton of stuff and the bellhops were super helpful loading and unloading all my junk.  The first thing I did was order a caesar salad and glass of white wine via room service- both were great (if overpriced) and I loved the little shot glass of gummie bears on the side.  Parking at the W is a total rip-off  but I was able to get a discounted parking pass for myself.  Getting the car from the valet usually took about 20 minutes so I learned to call ahead. I enjoy the club atmosphere on the first level (and in the elevators).  I thought it was really fun.  We had some pre-wedding fun at the bar on Thursday- the drinks are pricey but very good. The day of the wedding went off without a hitch.  My suite was more than big enough for all of us to have our hair and make-up done there.  We got some great photos in the lobby of the hotel.  When my husband and I returned to the suite after the wedding a bottle of champgane was on ice for us with some delicious chocolate truffles and a note thanking us for hosting our wedding guests at the W.  Classy! I did not give 5 stars in this review as the guest rooms were SO SMALL!  Nobody complained about it, as they got a great rate, but they were ridiculously small.  Also, I was charged $4 per bag to hand out our welcome bags.  I thought this was a bit much, especially as I had to call and complain that the people who checked in on Thursday were not given their bags.  Overall though, it was a great experience.",N
3152,The hotel itself isnt bad. I was a little disapointed though that I didnt get an ocean view instead i got a city view. The adjoining door between the rooms were a little thin. I could hear everyting that my neighbor was talking abotu through the door. They probably heard me also.  The shower was also a little messed up and kept leaking everywhere even after I asked them to fix it.  The drinks at the bar were also a little pricey for my tastes. The people/concierge there though were extremly friendly and top notch. My hats off to Ramon in Concierge for making my stay as good as possible.,N
1850,"My company had it's Christmas party in the city; so not to drive drunk we got a room here. I believe the mediocre staff gets paid to be aloof.  The house music from 1982 playing in the lobby is a little annoying and what's with the disco ball?  The rooms are small, really small.  The closets are in the bathroom, you have to close the bathroom door to open the closet door.  They DO NOT HAVE FOX NEWS on their cable line-up.  This hotel is for the wannabe, ""Sex and the City"" set.  I prefer to stay at the Peninsula. Whiskey Blue bar is cool.  If you're a fiddy sumthing rich dood looking for arm candy.",N
3672,"I enjoyed staying here immensely. The staff at The Drake treat their guests like royalty and, with the beautiful lobby and glamorous history, you will feel like royalty as well. My mom and I stayed here last summer in one of the suites. However, they had overbooked that night and ended up having to place us in a smoking wing. My mom is extremely sensitive to smoke smell and I don't care for it either. Unfortunately, there was nothing they could do about it so they upgraded our room. The suite we ended up getting was beautiful-- it was a corner room so it was bigger than most and had a wonderful view of the lake. We actually witnessed a tornado by watching it sweep across the lake from the safety of our room. I'm a big fan of historic buildings and luxurious and over-the-top decor. Give me blood red velvet curtains and gold embossed leather walls and I'm a happy woman. So you can see why I was so impressed with The Drake. The clientele this hotel attracts is equally impressive. I was in the tea room the same day a woman was throwing her bridal shower there. When I went to the powder room (really, ""bathroom"" doesn't do it justice), I overheard the woman crying about a lost diamond ring and her friends trying to convince her it's not a big deal at all. You can bet I was on the floor looking for it. The Drake is a wonderful place to stay if you're on a vacation that you want to make extra glamorous, decadent or special. On that same note, I wouldn't recommend it to business travelers as there are no office-type amenities and, while the service is great, the staff tend to take their time.",N
1473,"This hotel was totally unreal! It was a wonderful experience to stay here, if only for a couple nights (because there is no way I could afford anything more). The room service was absolutely amazing (though pricey), and they really paid attention to the minor details of your order. It was truly an excellent selection for a conference, as the rooms were spacious, the food service was on point, and all the amenities in the hotel compliment both service and decor (and I didn't have to pay for all the additional stuff). As for the location, you are right in the heart of downtown Chicago! What more could you possibly ask for? (Except for lower rates maybe) I recommend anyone looking for an excellent time (and carrying with them a hefty budget) in Chicago to stay at this wonderful hotel, as your experience will undoubtedly be a good one.",N
5810,"Over priced,  nickle and dime you for everything. 50.00 parking fee per day,  REALLY.   OH AND 10.00 PER DAY internet fee.  I do not recommend,  avoid if at all possible.",Y
4619,"Good points: good location, excellent service, modern lobby with couches, free wifi, nice water-pressure in the shower, plenty of outlets for charging your devices, and comfy beds! Bad points: no coffee maker in the room, crappy hair dryer, tiny room, and lots of ""hotel noise"" throughout the night/early morning. All in all, it's OK but I probably won't stay here again. There are too many other great hotels in the area for the same rate.",N
3454,"It's interesting to read some of the other reviews, because I feel like I stayed at a completely different hotel.  That being said, we didn't have an extended stay like some of the negative reviewers, so maybe the place just wears on you after a while. We booked a room through a discount site for a belated anniversary staycation.  The location of the Allerton is excellent, which is primarily why we chose it.  I noted on our reservation that we were celebrating, and upon arrival the front desk agent kindly wished us Happy Anniversary and offered an upgrade at no cost.  So sweet - thank you, Allerton! I expected a teeny tiny room based upon the reviews I've seen here, but we were delighted to find a two room suite (bedroom/living room) with two large screen TV's, a desk, a large bathroom, and a King bed.  I do agree with those folks who say that the toiletries are minimal...no lotion?  I actually mentioned that to my husband, I just assumed they had forgotten ours.  Also, no wash cloths?  That was odd to me, though it certainly wasn't a big deal. We ordered room service for breakfast in the morning, and as per usual in a hotel, the bill was quite high.  The food arrived on time and tasted fine, nothing to write home about.  I do appreciate that they accommodated a couple of special requests.  If I could do it over again, I would not order room service, primarilly for the cost. When we checked out, the front desk staff inquired about our stay, wanted to make sure we were happy, and wished us well.  I genuinely couldn't have asked for a better stay in a better location.",N
4861,"I stayed at the Congress Hotel three times now. It's a beautiful hotel, very old and elegant. The location is fantastic. Every time I stayed there it was clean and comfortable. If I needed anything, I got it in a timely manner. I plan on staying again and would recommend it to anyone.",Y
5031,"No, I did not stay at the W but how rude are these human beings. I asked, what I believed at the time to candy of my eye, if should could help me with a room reservation that I was apart of. She turned into a demon man, saying I wasn't on the reservation, which could of been solved by the use of the W's phone, which couldn't be accessed by my hands. So, please if you could go to any hotel, go there...not the W!",Y
1308,"Can you really go wrong with the Ritz? We stayed here for a little ""getaway"" one weekend. Everyone always knows your name, which I am still not sure how they pull that off. Service....impeccable, food the same, and drinks were great too. You really do get what you pay for. The room was a little ""dated"" in my opinion, but still had the comfy bed, fridge, and great bathroom. I can't say enough about the gym, I wish my condo had a gym like that. Headphones a plenty and great machines, and they actually had free weights over 25 pounds! Oh, and I also saw Juwan Howard pull up in his blue Ferrari, he looked a little tight in there, but it was still a sweet ride",N
1722,"I've stayed here twice when visiting Chicago with boyfriends and it's been awesome. Each room is totally different, very stylish and mod, and still inexpensive. They're on the small side, but generally, when I'm at a hotel, I've found that I spend very little time in it so it didn't bother me. I also have to say that I really love Kimpon hotels, and I've stayed at one in Dallas and thought it was quite nice too. I will say that on the downside, the walls are quite thin. I can sleep through anything, but those of you that can't, watch out!",N
89,I had my wedding ceremony and reception at this hotel. The day was perfect. The banquet manager Annie is amazing! I felt very comfortable with her from the start. She is very organized and professional. She is extremely nice and very caring. She made sure my day was perfect. I'm so  glad I had my wedding at this hotel!,N
267,"Dark but larger rooms in an older converted residential hotel. Bathroom was tight. Had a suite, though never sat in the dark LR. Tiny functional kitchenette, full fridge, lots of small closet space, king bed. Nice location at $160 a night. Relatively clean and quiet. Great for couples or small families on a budget. Money you save on groceries will pay for the $160 room rate.",N
1607,"my friend got a great room for a great deal: the view of the chicago river, trump tower is great! the yummy smelling shampoo they give out, the fact that the one bed room is clean and large, the friendly concierge who kindly gave us a menu for late night food delivery and chatted it up with us, and the decor is great! what's not so great: the fact that the fridge appears to be missing, the lack of a flat screen tv, the door to the elevators are full length mirrors that both me and my friend got so confused about that we both ran into them as the elevator door opened for us. my friend got confused cos he thought the elevator was full of mirrors (he was sober). i walked into it cos i was well a bit tipsy shall we say. unnecessary safety hazard! we'll upload a photo later for this. it's great that they offer dry cleaning (obviously for those who pack mainly office attire) but not all of the clientele are travelling on business. put in a laundry machine for the rest of us thanks! they charge $2.50 per pair of socks. ridiculous.",N
1032,"The Amalfi is a very nice hotel.  my wife and i spent my birthday downtown wining and dining.  we then retired to the Amalfi Hotel.  it's a very nice stay.  the room was different than others.  they've added a lot of nice touches.  the only reason i am not giving it another star is cause i really like architecture.  i wanted more.  Italian contemporary can really be wonderful.  we got free drinks at 5:30 and the drinks were great.  the bar atmosphere was not there.  i had already imagined what the hotel would be like from their website and i wanted a swank, fancy bar. the breakfast was specacular.  great choices in coffee and breakfast items.  very kind and helpful service at the front desk.  again, the front desk could have been a real beautiful room.  it is my disappointment and not their short-coming.  the Amalfi's rates are considerably more reasonable than the Peninsula or the Four Seasons.  honestly, stay at the Amalfi before you go to one of the larger chains, if money were not an issue, i'd stay at the Peninsula. cheers",N
2947,"PERFECT location, very close to Navy Pier & the Mag Mile.  I'm a frequent traveler - I usually stay in a hotel every week.  I can say that the interactive tables in the lobby are neat, the hotel restaurant is okay and the rooms could use an upgrade. My most recent stay at this Sheraton property was for leisure, we asked for a larger room & we got a room that wasn't large at all, there were very few towels in the bathroom.  After several calls to the front desk we were finally given additional towels.  Definitely not what I would expect from a Sheraton, but maybe this was an overly busy weekend.",N
1595,"Stayed here over the weekend for the Flyers game. Even though the hotel is undergoing renovations, it is STILL beautiful. Staff were great especially putting up with my constant bothering to get up to the penthouse (aka Bruce Wayne's place in TDK). I plan to go back when the hotel is finished.",N
745,"So much for 30 days of Yelping. If I do three today though, it'll bring my average back up! Onwards! Nice place (seemed to be under renovation), but our room was weird. The toilet kept making noise and the shower wasn't working all that great. It seems like the water pressure was totally off. Usually that's not a big deal, if it's a $75 a night room...not a $275 a night room. Side note, Yelp! - I think the 'business tips' should be adjusted to reflect a hotel, not a restaurant  ;-)",N
2088,"My review is specifically about the 17th floor rooms. I think all the other floors have been remodeled and the rooms are probably decent. But if you're lucky enough to get a 17th floor room like I did, you will be sorely disappointed. These are probably the ugliest, most outdated rooms (and bathrooms) in Chicago that still cost $170 a night. What a complete ripoff - not what you expect when you see the modern lobby. The front desk experience was unfriendly, and the hotel internet is horrid. Don't even think about VPN - you'd be lucky to have 2 webpages load up simultaneously on your browser. Not even the incredible river view is enough to save this whole experience. Hilton Honors - please take me back.",N
1883,"W's are hit or miss. Some are magical while others are old hotels with loud music and purple lights. This hotel falls somewhere in-between. Nothing about it really stands out. The lobby has your typical w purple club-like feel. The amenities are above average. The surrounding area is dead at night. Perhaps the best thing about the hotel are the rooms. Big, spacious, and the bathrooms have doors (many Ws do not have walls between the bathroom and bedroom). I expect to be blown away by a W hotel and this hotel doesn't. You'll enjoy your stay but you might feel a bit underwhelmed. The W Lakeshore has other issues but it's a much nicer hotel if your heart is set on a W. If you're a Starwood person I'd recommend the Westin North River.",N
539,"Great location!  It's close to L stops, great restaurants, and cool bars.  Very nice room and facilities.  Having free WiFi is a big plus.  They also have a great breakfast buffet!  Would definitely stay again.",N
2431,"I've never stayed here- but I do VIP hotel accommodations for perhaps the most powerful businessman in the world.  I've visited every luxury hotel in Chicago, and intensely scrutinized every Presidential suite and penthouse- and I think the most luxurious is the Hilton Presidential suite. Their sales rep for our request took us on a full tour of the hotel, gave us historical background as we toured (really fascinating history), and a very elegant front entrance off of Michigan Ave.  A nice touch- the United Airlines check-in kiosk by the hotel check-in counter.  You can kill 2 birds withone stone before you even head out to O'Hare. The views are stunning if your room faces East.   The hotel is beautiful, the Presidential suite is exquisite, and their sales staff was intensely helpful ad friendly and paid us a lot of attention.  I appreciate their help- as my list of questions and inquiries before the VIPs arrive is quite extensive.",N
398,"I recently stayed here for just one night, but I gotta say that Hilton Garden Inn's always impress me.  It might be because some people have a notion that the Garden Inn line of Hilton is their inferior brand.  I've stayed at several and they are actually better than some of the standard Hiltons.  I think it might be because most of them are newer properties. And yes, I am giving them 5 stars.  I know, I know!  It's not a luxury hotel like the Ritz or Four Season, but for a nice, newer hotel in the area that caters more towards a business crowd, it is one of the best I've been to. The lobby was really nice and modern and they are attached to Weber Grill restaurant that offers room service.  The check in was quick and the woman was super friendly and helpful. The room was great.  It was a corner room on a higher floor with nice city views to both directions.  The room was clean, had nice linens and decor, and also features a mini-refrigerator, microwave, and coffee maker.  I love having those conveniences in a hotel room.  The bathroom amenities were Neutrogena. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel.  You are just blocks to Michigan Avenue in the heart of the River North neighborhood.  You are also just blocks to the Loop just across the river.  Oh, and all that for just $145 a night.  Great price for the area and the quality.  I would definitely stay there again.",N
2915,"The Sheraton is a cool old, giant hotel right in the heart of downtown. It over looks the river, some rooms over look the lake, and it is a quick walk to everything: ~400 yards to the lake, 20 yards to the river, lots to do near by. Rooms are decent, normal hotel rooms. Beds were wicked comfortable and the room was cold.",N
1705,"Having our wedding at the Hotel Allegro was hands-down the best wedding-planning decision my husband and I made. We checked out a number of historic hotels downtown and left each one feeling pretty ""meh."" We saw blah ballrooms, met with indifferent hotel event coordinators, and we were starting to think we wouldn't find the spot we were looking for, until we saw the Allegro. The ballroom is gorgeous and was perfect for our 150-person wedding. It's modern, but with many historic touches, and we loved the urban feel of having the L go by the ballroom windows during the evening reception (but you absolutely couldn't hear the train). And we got so many compliments from our guests on the food. We didn't hire a wedding coordinator, and yet every part of our wedding went off without a hitch thanks to the amazing Allegro staff. From the doormen to the bellhops to the desk staff, I have never met a friendlier and more helpful group of hotel employees.  The catering/event staff in particular made the entire experience painless. My feelings were reaffirmed when my husband and I came back to the Allegro to reshoot our wedding photos recently. Shortly after our wedding, we found out our photographer had lost our wedding photos (wedding tip: when researching photographers, ask them how and when they back up their photos).  We decided to throw on the ol' tux and white dress and take some new photos with a new photographer, and when I contacted catering managers Kerry and Alyssa they couldn't have been more sympathetic or helpful. When we came by to retake the photos they surprised us with the hospitality suite for the afternoon (easily one of the coolest hotel rooms in the city) and a bottle of bubbly. We got some great photos in the suite, lobby and ballroom. Kerry and Alyssa really helped make an unfortunate situation fun and memorable -- four whole months after our event.   The Allegro is a fun, stylish hotel all on its own, but the staff is what makes it a particularly special place for an event.",N
3808,"I went with one of my good friends to the spa for a massage the Thursday before my wedding. My girlfriend originally was just going along with me since she was from out of town but at the last minute decided to get one as well, they were booked but after explaining our situation managed to squeeze her in, I just spent extra time in the relaxation room so that she could go before me. We spent about 3 hours there in between using the sauna/steam room and getting our massages, it was a great way to start off the wedding festivities. It is also very competitively priced for a basic massage compared to other downtown hotels.",N
624,"One Liner for those needing a fast read:  Good choice if you get a GREAT price (under $100). Excellent location and great service at the front desk.  They even let us check in early (11am)! However, the rooms were not the cleanest that they could have been.  For example, we dropped something under the bed and were surprised to find all kinds of trash and ""remnants"" from other guests.  Yuck. Additionally, we got the ONE room on the 5th floor that is by the ice machine...not good. Very loud all night...not just people filling their buckets, but also water running in a pipe to fill it. It should be noted that the pool is OUTDOORS, so to use it in March wasn't possible. The description should make this distinction. There is an indoor pool to use for a $15 fee per person. Overall though, for the Hotwire price of $77 ($88 with tax), this was a good stay and the location was right.  Note that overnight parking is $41 with in and out privileges.",N

3403,"I'm not sure why so many people had a bad time here. I actually enjoyed my stay here. I stayed at this hotel a couple of weeks ago for a romantic weekend in the city. I checked in Friday night, and checked out Sunday morning. My fiance got a Groupon, so we got a suite, free wifi, and two vouchers for two glasses of wine (4 glasses total). The hotel is very nice. It's location is on the Mag Mile, so it's a perfect stop for shoppers. The room was very clean and spacious. I get really paranoid when something doesn't feel clean, but this place put me at ease. I didn't worry about feeling dirty. The suite included a separate living room connected to the bathroom and bedroom. It makes the room more intimate. The room is very modern considering it's a very old building. The Allerton has been around since Al Capone was roaming the mean streets of Chicago. I did read about their renovation, so I could see and feel the newness of the hotel. The lobby and bar is on the second floor. The only complaint I have with their bar area is that it's so hot. The open fireplace makes the area so warm and stuffy. The bar is tiny, only a couple of couches and chairs. The second floor exudes modern luxury. I wished they kept more remnants of the old building. I love historical places, and I felt like it lost that touch in here. The second floor of this hotel knocked off a star. I personally did not have any issues with the staff at the hotel. Everyone seems to be hospitable. No complaints there! Overall, this was a fun place to stay. Considering I really love B&Bs, I wouldn't mind staying here again. If you want to stay at a historic building where gangsters used to hangout, a boutique hotel, or a place that makes you feel glamorous and modern, stay at this hotel. You'll like the location, and you'll like the modern feel of this historic hotel.",N
4226,"Just minutes into my weekend in Chicago, I stepped into the Hyatt Regency and thought, wait a minute, did I just walk into Las Vegas?  The massive hotel is a conventioneer's dream.  Two huge towers of rooms and an atrium that was so big it had me looking around for the missing slot machines.  I was lucky to be attending along with a tattoo convention...a very large tattoo convention.  The cheesiness of the lobby continued on to my first room that reeked of the strongest cleaner ever created.  Luckily, they were very nice about changing my room.  The view of the Chicago River and out to the lake was probably the greatest part of my room.  Even with a fancy flat screen tv, I felt like I might as be in a Holiday Inn.  Also, $13.50 for wifi?  Really?  I think I would rank this hotel as two stars but the price can't be beat for its great location.   I was blocks away from Michigan Ave, the Art Institute and Millennium Park. Also, I admit I can't really complain since I got a great deal for his hotel through Priceline.  If you are on a budget or just looking for a place to crash then is the hotel for you.",N
3369,"THIS PLACE IS A GEM. On a last minute trip to Chicago - we booked this hotel.  The price is super reasonable considering its prime location - located on Michigan Avenue - its right across Grant Park and in walking distance to museums and other tourist attractions. Their hotel staff is polite & courteous and helpful in giving directions and suggestions.   The hotel room is pretty tricked out. I mean, the Essex is much smaller in comparison to the other hotels on the block, but first  walking into the hotel room, it was dec'd out pretty nice. The room we got was furnished with a queen bed and a full sofa, mini fridge and a flat screen TV.  The bathroom was kind of small, but you never lost the feel of a 4 star hotel. For those not accustomed to traveling into big cities - paying for parking is standard. So its just something you have to calculate into your budget. The perk is, that although some hotels require you to park / walk to your own car - the Essex services valet into that cost. I'm definitely staying at the Essex Inn the next time I'm in Chicago!",N

While the hotel itself is fantastic, the location is fantastic, the staff is friendly and accomodating...if you have an issue with anything specific to service and follow up keep your expectations LOW! I parked a rental car in their overnight valet throughout my stay.  My last night there, the car was damaged.  I didnt notice it until after I had left the hotel, and stopped at a gas station.  Despite multiple assurances that the issue would be handled accordingly, five months later I still receive phone calls and other correspondence from the rental car company, stating they still have an unpaid repair bill. The service at valet attached to this hotel is sickening.  I waited for 30 minutes to get the car one day, AFTER placing the requested phone call ahead of my departure.  When I left and checked out from the hotel, the car tenant had this evil grin on his face I and was awarded an open door to my rental car.  Gee, I wonder why. DO WHAT YOU HAVE PROMISED ME AND MAKE THIS ISSUE GO AWAY!",N

My husband and I both remarked on this.  When he showed us to our room, I asked if he would mind turning the heat up, as it was quite cold in the room.  When we returned to our room later that night, we found a space heater outside our room.  I could not believe that this place did not have heat while we stayed here.  We had to rely on our space heater!  The room was so noisy from the street that I thought the window must be open, but it was not.  There are two shared bathrooms.  Both of which were bare and in great need of updating.  No soap or towels.  I was reluctant to even place my towel anywhere in this room.  Breakfast and coffee were not impressive.  Not worth the money and definitely will not stay here again.",Y
397,"During a weekend getaway to the Windy City, my brother and I needed a cheap place to crash after our sight-seeing.  We figured a Hilton hotel in the heart of Chicago would be a safe bet.  We were wrong. The service and staff were top notch. The location was good.  Quick access to the subway.  Millennium Park and Navy Pier about ten minutes away.  All positives. However, the room was were things fell apart.  I agree with many reviewers that the walls were paper thin.  Very annoying.  Also, the ventilation was poor.   All in all, the room was a major downer. The price online seemed a good value.  However, after you add the cost of parking per day (not included) and the not-so great room, I felt ripped off. 2 out of 5 and recommend looking elsewhere.",N
4685,"Great Hotel- Very nice, clean, great location.  Contemporary decor too. What was especially nice was when I got stuck there for two additional nights during a blizzard, they not only did not gauge me on the price, but actually dramatically discounted the room rate for the 2nd two nights.  Very nice, and very appreciated.",N

It's close to the red line and you can walk to lots of restaurants right from the hotel.  I was pleased & surprised to find that our room was very quiet at night. I only have one criticism -- there is breakfast but no designated breakfast room.  If you don't want to eat in the lobby you have to take your food back to your room.  However, this is a minor inconvenience -- plus, there are several good places for breakfast a block or two away. I would stay here again & I've already recommended it to friends.",N

Loved the location, aveda products, size of the towels, ie huge, and the décor of the room.

5521,"My parents stayed here while they were visiting, and it was nice small hotel. It's in a great location near lots of restaurants and shops - a little more character than being in a hotel downtown.

Prices are high for drinks ($4 for a cup of coffee, $14 for a vodka cranberry..) we would have loved to spend more of our time in the hotel, especially the lobby, but the prices are too high.

4626,"If you're a fan of paying $200 a night for rooms that are the size of a shoebox that are barely even big enough to house a queen sized bed (a room so tiny you think that THEY MUST have made some kind of mistake as your first impression upon walking in), invasive and extremely unflattering fluorescent lighting that shines downwards right over the bed and into your eyes straight just as if you were getting interrogated about where you were the night of August 8th, 2010, loud knocking from maids starting at 7 am and complete disregard for what a Do Not Disturb sign actually means, then you will LOVE this place. ME, not so much! There would be better noise proofing if I had set up a cardboard box underneath a freeway overpass and I'd probably have been more comfortable too. Speaking of cardboard, that's what their sheets felt like... scratchy and cheap. Wow! I'm giving this place some awards I tell ya! Home of the noisiest a/c that can't make up it's mind about whether it's going to blow cold or hot air so it alternates between the two and the shallowest sink I've ever seen in my life with absolutely zero counter space. Don't even start me on the water pressure or lack thereof in the shower and the toilets that don't flush, even considering they are supposed to be green. Oh that's right, this place is supposed to be ""eco-friendly""! So when you have to take twice as long in the shower to wash the soap away because no water comes out of the faucet and you're flushing the toilets at least three times instead of only once, how exactly is that saving any more water? Just curious. It's apparent this hotel is only trying to be ""eco"" so that they can save money on their end. Also Yelpers please take note, internet is slow as hell here, there is no bathtub, no mini-bar, and no reason that I could ever justify spending this kind of money (close to $200) to stay in a Holiday Inn/Motel 6 using an ""eco chic"" marketing angle in attempts to pass themselves off as a 4 star hotel. I hightailed it out of there after the first night and I made sure I picked a gas guzzling cab, cranked the a/c, and put all the windows down just to even my carbon footprint score a bit. I should have immediately gone to buy some aerosol hairspray and deodorant and left the lights and TV on 24/7 at my next hotel the whole rest of my vacation in order to make up for all the hardships I had to put up with after staying at that place. Hahaha! Seriously though, good riddance to Hotel Felix! As mentioned in the other reviews, the cool doorman was the best thing about this place but he's way too good for this craphole!",N
777,"If you can afford it, have your wedding here. Plates are very expensive upwards of over $120-160 per plate.  The minimums are also quite high.  If you can't afford the ballroom, they also have another venue space that can house up to about 120 guests, but it is in their restaurant space on the 2nd(?) floor. Didn't end up having my wedding here because I didn't want the reception in a dingy looking restaurant. Also no where to have the ceremony except for the ballroom.   If you can afford the $15,000 - $20,000 minimum and want an AWESOME location, this might be a good bet for you.",N
2093,"We've stayed there twice and suggested to several people.  Good location and good price.  The bad part is you have to ride from the lobby to the 15th floor just to get to the hotel lobby and then you ride another to your room floor.  I did enjoy the bar.  The view is great, the drinks were good and Aaron was an awesome bartender!",N
4533,"Truly a classic and elegant hotel, full of European glamor.  The lobby is definitely a must see!  I think the painter who worked on the ceiling also worked on the restoration of Michael Angelo's work in the past.  You can see why.  The rooms are old building style so not that large in size, but the amenities are decent.  No wireless internet unless requested...kind of weak!",N
4151,Fabulous! I got a corner room on the 15th floor and it was simply amazing. GREAT location right off Michigan Ave too!,N
5768,"Heart O Chicago is a funky, retro motel with clean and spacious rooms.  No frills - scratchy, thin towels, bring our own shampoo and hair dryer, etc.  The bed was comfy and the TV worked, but the heat did not.  When we called the office to get assistance they told us they had turned it off for the season 10 days ago.  The highs for the week we were there (last week) were in the 50's and low 60's so we weren't too thrilled that they couldn't be bothered re-starting it.   The location is great for some things, not so great for others.  Andersonville is a short walk.  Wrigley Field and the Lakeview area are a short and convenient bus (#22) ride.  The Loop/downtown area is a 45+ minute bus/El ride, if your connections are good.",N
5516,"IT's in a great location and when I had friends visiting and I couldn't host all of them - they stayed here and got free passes to my Bally's which is right next door.  So, it was nice - we got to spend quality time while on vacation working out, too which is usually something that most ppl miss out on when they're on vacation.",N
4330,"Went here for Afternoon Tea yesterday and had a very nice time.  I loved sitting in the lobby, as the ceiling and surroundings are so beautiful.  The jasmine pearl tea was delicious, as were the scones.  These scones were delightful and the best of the foods presented.  The sandwiches and desserts were fine but nothing I would readily seek out again. I may come back, as this was  a fun and relaxing experience.",N
1100,"So here are the bad things that I encountered at the Fairmont Hotel since that is pretty much what everyone looks for first. -Must pay for the little things like internet and jacuzzi. -There is no swimming pool. This really sucked cause my view from the hotel looks into the Aqua Condominium's pool area, which looked refreshing. -Only has one trash can in the room.   -No dressers to put clothes away. -Small closet. On a side note...the cab drivers are the worst (except for one). I wonder if they live in their cab. The front seat of every single cab we took had junk in the front seat, like Dunkin Donut coffee cups or leftover wrappers from yesterday's dinner or lunch. Just take a peek in their front seat.   That's it!!! Everything else was delightful. There is a reason why you stay at the Fairmont and that's customer service (and the most comfy beds for vacation). From the valet to the concierge, everyone was very helpful and eager to please. This Fairmont Hotel seems a lot more hip that the other Fairmonts. Two blocks from Wacker, and four block from Magnificent Mile.",N
1381,"I stayed here during my visit from Boston in the early summer. My friends and I thought it looked good online and the location seemed good (well, coming from the Concierge). Watch the progression of my rating...(we'll start off with 5 stars to be fair) When we checked in, the front desk gave us a hard time about our online reservations and were quite rude. After arriving upon our room, we discovered that it was a smoking room, when we clearly requested a non-smoking room (my friend has really bad allergies). When we finally switched to another room, the view was crappy and was tiny (especially for four college girls with about two suitcases each :P) -4 stars However, the rooms were very nicely decorated and the pillows were ridiculously luxurious! +1 star Bathrooms were tiny; my closet back home is bigger (that's saying something!) For the four of us (where at least 20 minute prep time is needed before going out), this became *quite* a hassle. -2 stars We barely needed our rental car; we could walk everywhere! Location is very good, as everything was about 10 minutes away. +2 stars The restaurants in the surrounding area were yummy and we enjoyed ourselves immensely with all of the culinary delights and nightlife choices. +2 stars Parking is crazy expensive, especially when you're on a student budget like we were. Even if you parked at a nearby garage instead of having the hotel valet do it, everyday parking came to be pricey. That definitely put a dent on our spending for going out, shopping, etc. -2 stars The upstairs area and the lobby are gorgeous; chandeliers, velvet, gorgeous draping, etc. Very nice; imagine the effect it had on us the first time we stepped in! :) +1 stars So, all in all, 3 stars. Next time I'm back in Chicago, I'll probably try somewhere else.",N
3184,"this W hotel is located near navy pier. it is an older building that used to be another hotel. okay, so i'm going to go through the bad before the good. several things were quite strange to me.   1) there is no shower door.  so i'm kinda cold while taking a shower     since the heat doesn't stay within the shower. 2) there are no curtains.  the windows have a shade on them but     sunlight still gets in...and i believe people could see us if they were     in a building across from us with binoculars.  not that great for     watching tv in the afternoon since there is a glare. 3) you can tell they don't dust.  yes, the beds are made and the     bathrooms are freshened...but you can tell that the glasses and     other things have a lot of dust on them. 4) there was a spider crawling in my bed.  maybe the itchy bite above     my hip is a spider bite.  don't know...but it's annoying.. 5) when we needed suggestions, we tried to ask the front desk.  they     kept referring us to the concierge.  well, the concierge didn't know     about any of the places we were talking about.  i suggest that the W     hire someone for the concierge who gives out tips and recs on     where to go instead of giving me a blank look when i'm talking     about some of the hot spots of downtown.  DON'T HIRE A     COLLEGE KID who doesn't know enough to be a concierge.  just     giving them a computer so that they could search the place doesn't     cut it.  i do that myself already... 6) free wifi in the lobby BUT NOT IN THE ROOMS. 7) AND FOR THE BIGGEST GRIPE...     THE ELEVATORS!!!       how can you have 4 elevators for 33 floors?  (oh, and one time, 2 of     them were not working..) when there was a wedding reception on     the 33rd floor, it would have been nice to have a designated     elevator going there instead of having guests wait forever to go     up/down.  fridays and saturdays...you have to wait a while cuz     people are hanging out at the bar on the 33rd floor...and if there is     also a special event...good luck. the good... 1) customer service is good and responsive. 2) they have some partnership with acura.  they have a free chauffeur     service from 12-7:30pm that will take you within 5 miles of the W     hotel.  easy booking. 3) great location!!  walking distance to navy pier...and also my fav     brunch place: yolk!  =) 4) we used points for the 1st 2 nights and got the 4th night free, so     really only paid for ONE full night.  sweet!! 5) pretty lobby with trendy furniture.  nice bar area with plenty of seating 6) staff is nice and professional.  i think the head guy (manager or     something) came up to us while we were sitting at the lobby just to     ask how we were doing...if we needed anything.  he gave good     suggestions on where to go, what to do. if you are not a hotel guest and just want to hang out, this is the place for you.  plenty of seating, nice bar, free wifi.  patio seating outside overlooking the water is cool.  then head up to the 33rd floor lounge to chill.",N
2557,"What happened?  A couple years ago this was THE place to be...heard sooo many good things about it and was really excited to come here finally this summer.  So we get there and there is a huge line, we walk up to the front and get right in... HOWEVER: there is security at the front, frisking the men and checking women's purses!  Ok....the security guy actually looked at us and said ""you sure you want to come in?""  Ok....we go in, and there's a $20 cover.  My friend tells the girl it's her birthday, so she says fine $10 to get in.  We're standing there, trying to decide if the thumping music, and potential for violence as evidenced by the fact that guys need to get FRISKED, is worth $10 or whether this is the end of the night. We decided to turn around and actually never made it in.  I was really sad about the whole thing, because I had built up Victor Hotel in my mind all these years...it was such a letdown, kind of like when you first realize your parents aren't the superheros you think they are, like a coming of age. Oh well, at least we didn't get robbed.",N
1263,"I was not impressed with this BW.  It was the 3rd one I stayed at in 10 days and it was the most disappointing.  :( When we were checking in the lady was not very helpful answering our questions.  We asked about parking and she suggested a public lot.  Later another worker said they had valet, so we did that, but why didn't she tell us??  They also neglected to mention that valet doesn't open until 6 am and we were leaving before that...How to get the car??  The morning guy was VERY nice and got it out for us and it was waiting when we came down. The room was clean but not very comfortable.  It was very cold on in the room and on the floors.  The Red Line train was loud and you could hear everyone who got on/off the elevator. I think we paid too much for what we actually got.  But I would stay here again if I had to, I just wouldn't choose it.",N
2171,"I have stayed at many hotels in Chicago over the years and this has been a favorite. Being the only hotel with a front entrance right onto the Magnificent Mile it is great to wake up in the morning and grab a cup of coffee from the Starbucks downstairs and walk right out onto The Mile. Location aside the lobby and rooms were modern and well appointed. I had a great view of Michigan Avenue from my room. Being busy I had not the chance to take advantage of the pool but I'm sure I will on my next visit which will actually be in two days. I can't stress enough how much location really matters in Chicago and this is in the perfect place. The staff was friendly and helpful, the valet service was on point but a little pricey...but on the same note it is downtown Chicago. I am staying again so that should tell you all you need to know.",N
654,"A decent, reasonably priced hotel.  Nothing particularly fancy, but it was clean and conveniently located near a  bunch of the touristy stuff we went to see.  The beds weren't too comfortable in my opinion, but I like everything fluffy and a billion pillows.",N
5485,"I stayed here for a month... a very long month. I stayed here for business for a month and was pretty disappointed. THE BAD The TV's were awful. They are the old tube kind, big and bulky. It reminded me of the kind you see in a motel. I brought my ps3 and could not hook it up because it was blocked. The Internet was way too slow, I tried to download a TV show fro iTunes and it literally took my 36 hours. There are no ice machines No in room coffee makers (they do offer complimentary coffee in the lobby until 9:30 but every time i tried to get some it was EMPTY! and if you try going closer to 9:30 the hot water for tea will not be hot) Terrible water pressure in the shower The bottom sheet on the bed kept coming off so I would wake up with my head on the mattress. THE GOOD Great Location.",N
5013,I have a dream of somehow striking it rich and living inside this hotel for a few years until my money is completely gone and am strung out to the point of rehab.,Y
494,"Embassy Suites is always perfect for families.  The suites are large enough - two full beds in one room, and a pull-out in the other (yeah - you'll need a back re-alignment in the morning).  Microwave and fridge included.  They have a managers reception (read free beer/wine) downstairs in the lobby, but it never really appealed to me - lines seemed way too long - no thanks.  The cook-to-order breakfasts are a big hit with the kids and easy on the wallet (included).    It gets fairly crowded so you should probably get down there early (8-9 am).  The pool is small and heavily chlorinated - so take advantage of the free skin exfoliation. Kids loved it, and if the kids are happy . . . .dads happy. Location is great - especially if you want to walk along Michigan avenue pre-Christmas.  Navy Pier is also just a couple blocks a way. Careful when ya travel - especially around holidays and breaks - during these periods make no mistake about it - this is a FAMILY hotel.  If you go expecting a nice, romantic, quiet evening - you will be disappointed.  It's wide open and loud, and kids are everywhere.  That can be good or bad depending on your status.   For us, it's perfect for travelling with kids.",N
3150,"Stayed here for just one night while my wife and I were relocating cross country.  Got what I thought was a great deal on http://Hotwire.com($120).  It wasn't till morning till I noticed the $48/night parking sign.  2 cars meant over $100 with valet tip...Ouch. I could maybe understand if the hotel were on Mich Ave but its several blocks off the mag mile.  That being said, location was good, close to restaurants as well as lakeshore.  Room wasn' t anything special.  The bathrooms are ridiculous.  Sliding piece of shutter for a door and a nice little window that looks out into the room also covered by a wooden shutter.  Every sound gets through unless the A/C is on of course.  Would stick to the intercontinental or the Hyatt.",N
5494,"I hate places with all the add-on fees. Parking is $45 per day. Internet is $10 per day.  Want ice?  You can only get it thru room service, so get the tip money out. No vending machines.  Want coffee?  Call room service.  Fitted sheets would be nice - theirs keep coming off. I can go to a Hampton (or many others) and park for free, get free wi-fi, etc.  Just like the airlines, please just charge an honest fee and skip all these extra charges. Pluses:  good beds, large bathroom, staff was nice, very good location if you like the ""Viagra Triangle"" places.",N
2831,"Given the great weekend price and the fantastic location of this hotel, I would say it's a very good place to stay.   It's been renovated and everything is clean and new.  And the rooms of course are huge with televisions in the bedroom and living room.  There's a Starbucks next door and each room has a mini refrigerator, coffee maker, etc.  It's a little noisy on the weekend since parents seem to think it's cute to let their children run full speed around the interior hallway.  And check in is slow as molasses!  Don't go in at three o'clock!   The breakfasts are what you would expect for free food.  Service was efficient and pleasant.",N
1159,"Sufficed. Needed a quick, cheap, centrally located one-nighter and while customer service does vary among different staff members and departments, it works fine. Got there too late to try for any upgrade deal. My floor was a bit loud at times. And in the morning I was entertained by the alley I was facing. An open garage business with guys moving stuff in and out struck me as kind of funny. Enough for me to whip out my camera. I'd return under similar circumstances.",N
2169,"Stayed here during the MEG convention and i was not disappointed. They upgraded me to a suite and it was gorgeous - 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, huge bathroom. I had my own little living room. They always had an elevator ready to go. It was in a great location in the city. You can walk to all the stores and there were a ton of restaurants within walking distance. Expensive, but if you can afford it, stay there.",N
2720,"I would move in if they'd let me (and only charge me as much as I currently pay in rent, because I'm cheap). Seriously -- very comfortable and luxe. And quiet, amazing considering its location in a busy part of town. I didn't order room service (for budget travelers who book into this place on a discount, there's a Trader Joe's across the street to get cheap snacks), but the menu looked mighty impressive.",N
4681,"This place has one flaw- room sizes. Depending on the purpose of your trip, this could either be a no big deal, or a huge one! I wanted to book a hotel in the downtown River North area, but not mag mile. Those hotels are often huge, loud, not updated. Arriving at Hotel Felix, I was pleased with small lobby, friendly front desk staff and modern decor. HOWEVER, the room I first got was incredibly small! My walk in closet in my house is bigger! I was traveling alone, but this room was claustrophobic! I can't imagine how a couple or worse- a family could stay in that room. I was ready to walk out but called the front desk first, and they put me in a slightly bigger room, which was better. All in all, this place COULD have been great, but the room size has left with a serious handicap when compared with other hotels in similar price range...",N
1570,"Hands down one of the nicest hotels in Chicago I have ever stayed at.  Service was wonderful, location is great!  Room was so comfortable, and had a wonderful view of the Chicago River, workout area very modern with a great view.  Would stay here over and over!  No reason not to come back.  Price was not bad either for Chicago, but we did book on Hotwire.",N
3936,"I, too, was scared to stay in this hotel after reading multiple terrible reviews.  My boyfriend and I planned a trip to Chicago because we have such a love for this city.  I was worried I was going to have a terrible, scary experience, which may ruin my trip here.   We had read ahead of time about the Congress being a haunted hotel.  We did not, however, have a haunting experience.  From the moment we arrived until the moment we left everyone in the hotel was super helpful and pleasant.  The parking situation was a little crazy, as the parking lot was also a lot for Taste of Chicago.  The parking attendant, once finding out I was a hotel guest, put me as a priority in front of all others trying to park.   The room definitely had character.  Yes, there's old wallpaper.  Yes, the carpet is old, dark red and dingy.  Yes, the shower curtain looks old.  But, the fact that the wallpaper and shower curtain has the Congress Hotel logo was neat.  I felt like I was staying in a piece of history, which is hard to find anymore.  The bathroom was clean, the room was clean, I checked for bed bugs and there weren't any.  Housekeeping was really fast.  We'd leave for breakfast and by the time we came back, our room was clean and ready for us.  On top of everything else, the location is excellent!  There are tons of places to eat within walking distance, it's close to the L and Grant Park is right across the street.   I hope this review is helpful for anyone reading the horrible reviews.  I think it's a hotel everyone should experience at least once in their lifetime.  The elevators are old and GORGEOUS!  Also, go check out where room 666 is supposed to be.  We read the room is sealed.  It's not just sealed...it was covered by a wall!  If you look on floor 5 and 7, you'll see the difference.  Maybe it's just me, but I felt like I was sightseeing right in the place where I was staying...at no extra charge :-)",N
881,"Stayed here last weekend and found every aspect of Hotel Burnham to be great.  The room was clean and comfortable.  The people at the front desk were genuinely nice and very helpful.  They printed out tickets to the cubs game for me, gave out an umbrella when it rained, helped us with a voucher for Atwoods.  The staff was excellent.  I felt like we got a great deal on the 2 night stay especially for everything that was included - as part of a promotion we received $50 to use at Atwoods and a free continental breakfast on Labor Day as Atwoods wasn't open.  We took advantage of the wine hour 1 of the days and that was nice. The location is excellent.  There is a lot to do within walking distance and if the places you are going are a bit farther away there are several options for hopping on the L.  Very convenient for getting to/from Midway airport as well.  Would definitely stay here again.",N
847,"We stayed here for 5 nights and my overall experience was great! I booked a room with 2 doubles. When we got there, the didn't have any available and gave me a 1-bedroom suite. The bathroom was huge with a separate shower and tub. The rest of the suite was pretty spacious too. There was a sofa pullout and the bed king-sized. Our room was next to the L-train, but it didn't bother any of us during the night. Everyone that worked there was very curteous and helpful. They greeted us when we would leave and greeted us when we returned. The location was pretty convenient. It was 2 blocks away from Milleneum Park and at the end of Michigan Avenue, which is part of the Magnifent Mile. There were plenty of shops and restaurants around the hotel. A great place to stay!",N

The rooms may be tiny but what the have can accommodate anyone.  Plenty of storage areas and beautiful decor.  This will be my first pick when staying downtown Chicago.",N
1259,"We choose this hotel based on price/location. Now with that the hotel is smaller and not as glamorous as other Chicago hotels but better then other Best Westerns I have been too. The rooms are small which is perfectly fine if all you are doing is sleeping and relaxing in between all the wonderful activities Chicago has to offer. The bed was comfortable and I felt like most of the room was updated nicely. The location is the best you are right across from Grant Park, down the street from the Aquarium, and the Art Museum. For people that do not want to walk down to where all the shopping is on the Magnificent Mile then this is not your hotel. It was a decent walk but it was perfectly fine for my husband and me. Parking is valet but we did not use our car once we were in Chicago we simply walked or took pubic transit.",N
2790,"THE most comfortable bed I have EVER slept in.  Service was four-star.  We left our valet ticket in the room on the 7th floor and Jason, the manager, went up to get it for us.  Great ideas for breakfast, great bloody mary in the bar and steakhouse with incredible crab cakes, steaks and desserts.  Will stay here again and again.",N
4780,"While the lobby was gorgeous our room was a TOTAL disappointment.  We were excited based on the photos on the website, but our room had clearly not been remodeled.  The bedding was old, the carpet was old, the wall paper was peeling off the walls & our bathroom reeked of mildew.  Not sure how we got stuck in the gross room, but we did.  We could have had a better quality room at a holiday inn.",Y

226,"I stayed here for two nights over the July 4th weekend, and I was very impressed.  The decor is kitschy but not over the top, and the rooms were great.  For the price we paid (I think it was about $300 for two nights, so about $100/person), it was a fantastic value. The rooms are pretty big and look like you're in some tropical resort.  The beds are really comfortable and you couldn't hear noise from outside or other rooms at all.  We got there much earlier than the posted check-in time (we took a 7 am flight from Boston) but we were able to check in, go to our room, and leave our luggage with no problem. This hotel is in a nice neighborhood, and it's really convenient--walking distance to many attractions, a few blocks from the Red Line, there's a grocery store and drug store (the drug store sells alcohol) a few blocks away, and there' s a Starbucks right down the block.  Bonus points for that, I need my iced mocha in the morning!",N
1591,I stayed at Hotel 71 in November of 2008 for a few nights with the girls. The hotel was very nice. The wi-fi worked well. The room was spacious and fit 4 ladies comfortably. It was so cold outside that we were able to chill a bottle of sauvignon blanc on the window sill! But the room was nice and toasty! The view of the river was outstanding. We were within walking distance of many places. Great location!,N
98,"My wedding has happened.  It happened at the Carleton and it was fantastic.  The most fantastic wedding I have ever been to; I am so proud to say it was mine.  Annie Parker, special events coordinator extraordinaire, oversaw this event with care and love and attention to every detail - as if it were her own.  Annie and I have gotten to know each other pretty well over the past year or so.  I have emailed her daily for weeks at a time with silly questions and requests and advice and she has always responded with clear, thorough responses and always with our best interest in mind. The staff at The Carleton deserve some recognition.  I had quite the crowd -- the most bottles  ever consumed at one event.  Yup, that's us!  We had a few scenarios that would've thrown the average banquet staff off their game, but not this one!  I can't say enough about the conscientious effort to make my wedding the best it can possibly be.  The food was amazing -- we had chosen honey mustard crusted chicken, rib eye and salmon.  All deserving high marks. All the guests that made mention of the food were pleasantly surprised with the quality AND quantity of these dishes.  The rib eye was the most consumed entree and this piece of meat was something to be expected at a high end steak house.  Very nice.  Our room was beautiful, clean and large.  We had 12 other guests booked at the hotel and all were pleased as well.  Poor Phil's is the bar and grill which I have reviewed in the past, but will mention that they serve a great breakfast!  Several guests enjoyed the morning after here.",N

4702,"This place is freakin AMAZING. I came here with a couple of friends and when we booked this hotel, I had high expectations from the pictures that the hotel posted online. Let me tell you, this hotel exceeded all of my expectations. It has a superb location, very close to the magnificent mile, bars, old town, zoo..you name it. The beds were the most comfortable beds I have ever laid on. We created a schedule for ourselves everyday but we always woke up late because we did not want to get out of bed...and it's not from us being hung over either (except for one of us but I won't get into that). The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The bellboys were awesome, especially Chuck! He helped us find some amazing local eateries and bars and was just awesome to talk to. They also have a gym, which isn't too big but hey, who goes on vacation to work out in the gyms at their hotels right? Bottom line, the service is great, very affordable, very clean, and great location.",N
4562,"This review is for those of you planning a wedding or big event.  My wife and I were set to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary on June 23rd of this year.  I really wanted to do something special to recognize the occasion.  Since we got married at the Palmer House, in the beautiful and historic Empire Room. I called the Palmer House's catering office and spoke with Jane Himmel, the Senior Catering Manager.  I inquired as to the availability of the Empire Room for our exact anniversary date, June 23rd - a Thursday.  Opportunity struck when I was told the room was not being used for a previously scheduled event that night. I suggested my idea to Jane that my wife and I have dinner for 2 in the Empire Room on the night of our anniversary, just as we celebrated our wedding there 10 years ago to the hour.  This is when Jane and her team took over. To my surprise and excitement, Jane took this idea from the start and worked very hard to make this idea, this dream, become a reality.  I worked with Jane over the next couple of weeks and days leading up to our night.  She helped me pull off one of the greatest nights and best memories my wife and I will ever share. The Palmer House is a beautiful and historic hotel.  Please consider when you stay here or have an event here that what you may be giving up in terms of modern amenities and size of the hotel rooms you gain in elegance, class, service, a sense of history and an experience to be had in your lifetime.",N

We sat and caught up in comfy seats and played electronic chess! Did I say, or write, ""LOVE IT!""? I wish it was open later. Minus one star",N
1175,"Excellent location, great prices, and free parking! There are bars, subway trains, and everything important near you. Fitness center is a little weak but indoor pool and outdoor deck with great views is fantastic. The valets are very cool and take good care of the cars. Check this place out for a cheap and clean hotel.",N
1150,"We stayed here for 3 evenings in December, and it was an amazing experience.  Our room was gorgeous, and the bathroom superior to any other hotel I've stayed in I think.  Our friends down the hall did find the layout of their room a little strange - the bed was more in the middle in front of a faux wall, and they didn't like that.  (but since this is my review and not theirs, I'm sticking with 5 stars).  We splurged and stayed on the gold floor - and so glad we did.  It was well worth the extra cost....I have stayed on other ""executive lounge"" or ""gold"" floors at other hotels, and I'd say this was the best to date.  The food is more than enough for breakfast so you don't need to eat elsewhere...and the snacks the rest of the day would tide us over until we went out for dinner.  The staff in the lounge were very helpful! We all got a massage one morning, and it was an excellent experience.  They could only fit 3 of us in, so they said they'd try to call some staff and see if they could call someone in, and they managed to squeeze the fourth one of us in!  That's service - considering we didn't try to book it until the night before, and it's the weekend before Christmas. Will definitely stay here again, next time in Chicago.",N
1335,"A beautiful bed with one of the most comfortable bed I have ever encountered. Yes it was pricy, yes it was luxury, would I stay again...not sure as there are so many other great hotels in the city.",N
3057,"Lounge area is cool but I've seen it before, it's nothing new...rooms are SO outdated and that god awful tacky shutter window looking into the bathroom...I get what they're trying to do but it ain't workin!..it just seems silly to me and like it's trying too hard.. I dunno..the W was cool back in the early  early 2000's... there are far more cooler, nicer, hipper, newer hotels in Chicago  I'd stay before here.  And the hallways were dark and dingy. The W is for two type of folks....20-somethings OR Married folks who have been out of the scene for a LONG time, lives in the burbs with 3 kids, rarely goes out and are totally clueless about what is hip these days, so they come to the W because of the name.... And I'd be willing to bet they go to Howl at the Moon, The lodge and Dicks last Resort for a fun night out.",N
1004,"Any hotel with an ""experience designer"" must be worth at least 4 stars ;).  My stay at the Amalfi was quite pleasant.  They have a great customer service department here and I love the fact that they sat at desks instead of behind a HUGE counter like most hotels.   We had a room with 2 queen sized beds in it.  Not big by any stretch of the imagination, but for $145 in downtown Chicago, it certainly seemed like a deal.   The location is great from what I could tell.   I did find the bathroom a bit puzzling.  I'm not sure if it was a handicap room or something, but the bathroom shower all drained into the center of the room - there was no bath at all.  There was also a bunch of poles to help you stand up if needs be.   Overall, I wouldn't hesitate coming back here again.",N
3461,"The location is the best thing going for the Allerton. It's right across from the Apple store and a block from the Garmin store. A veritable nerd's delight. I was there for a training seminar and had a discount rate of around $200 a night, which I felt was reasonable for the level of luxury this hotel offers. I noticed the web rate is like $400-500 a night, which would have been a travesty. I would say this is a 3 star hotel. The entire hotel is small in stature. The rooms are very small. Being one person I thought I would be fine but I noticed I was bumping into things and stepping on things on the floor all the time. Now I know how small animals feel in a cage. The lobby is very small as well, and finally to punctuate the smallness of it all, the elevators were miniature and could maybe hold 4 people comfortably. The rooms are fairly new decor wise. The bathroom was decorated nicely but the area around the shower was starting to show its age in terms of dirty grout and stains. The staff is fairly friendly and the front desk was very fast with the check in and check out. The bellhop was fairly overwhelmed in the late afternoon with the bag check and took a bit of time to get your bags. Would I stay here again? For $200 yes. Anything higher and you'd be better off at the Embassy Suites or Courtyard.",N
5820,"When we got to the place where check in was happening, we noticed that the entire lobby had no carpet, part of their renovations. We asked where the fitness center was, that was also closed down, as was the restaurant. We went up to the room where again the lobby had no carpet. It also smelt of smoke. We went back down to ask if there was a smoke free room and were told that while all rooms where smoke free, we were put in a room that used to be a smoking room but unfortunately there were no other rooms available due to the renovations. We then asked to leave, as this was ridiculous and for a refund. We checked into the hotel and checked out of the hotel all within 30 mins it was that bad This was an absolutely terrible experience",Y
3934,"Just don't do it.  Even if you'll save an extra couple of bucks and even if you think that the more recent positive reviews are a sign that they've made some improvements.   Mattresses sag, stains on the tile ceiling are just two examples of the general shoddy-ness of the hotel.  The only reason it gets two stars is that I had a lake view, the location was close to the convention I was attending and the folks there weren't complete assholes.",N
4047,"The hyatt is my home away from home. I have been to this one at least 10 times over the years. Whenever downtown, we stay here. The place is great. It has multiple levels, multiple towers. It's a fun place to be. Has a great bar, a few great bars actually. Big Bar can be pricey but it';s a place you have to go to once. All the staff is amazing! My rooms have always been great and comfy and quiet. This Hyatt does it right, everytime.",N
811,Yay! Typical Westin good service is an absolutely perfect location. My only complaints: expensive parking and gym not the best. I'll stay here again if in Chicago.,N
3691,"I visited the Drake for afternoon tea, and what a fun experience.  You might want to go with someone you feel comfortable talking with for a few hours because we were there for over 2 hours.  The tea was very good - I had the chocolate mint truffle green tea and it was very mild.  The food's okay but it fills you up.  They consist of sandwich bites, scones, itty bitty mini pastries.  For $35/person it was worth it for a one-time experience.  Although I want to try afternoon tea at a more contemporary hotel next time.  And then no more tea for me!",N
3567,"I'm not sure how I was so lucky to end up here. It almost seems tacky to say but somehow Hotwire got me and my S.O. a very affordable room over my birthday last year  (January 1st - no small feat!). Again, NO idea how this happened. I hadn't heard of The Drake and had no idea what to expect. My jaw dropped open upon arrival. Deliciously elegant with what I guess you could call old-world charm. That's not to say the fixtures and the beds and the HVAC aren't top notch and newly furnished. Great views, wonderful service, comfortable and functional everything. Now the Drake has become my gold standard. BAD IDEA. This means any other hotel has become a comparable flea-bag motel, no matter what the star rating, price, or how nice a view of a city I get. I open the door and... disappointment. Where's the perfection of the Drake (the roomy interior, handsome desk, huge bathroom, the tasteful color scheme, the fantastic location...)? Phenomenal. Classy. Retreat and romance material all the way. Still thinking and dreaming about it a year later.",N
853,"We stayed at this hotel for NYE.  I was pleasantly surprised at how spacious our room was.  It was cozy and comfortable and our bathroom was newly remodeled.  Great location, just blocks from Millenium Park and steps away from State St. and Michigan Ave. We will definitely stay there again.",N
4996,"We have stayed at the Essex Inn twice in the last two years. We stayed there in July 2008, and August 2007. We thought it a very pleasnat, well-run hotel. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The Concierge was a fount of knowledge, got me booked on a couple of trips - The Untouchables Tour which is a must when you visit Chicago.The rooms are clean, and quite spacious. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed both stays at the Essex Inn.",Y
2853,"For the high price I paid for a conference special rate, I would have expected a bit more.  It was just average. And trust me, I don't mind paying a lot for a hotel room and I know how much they can cost as I live in Hawaii, but the higher the price (in this case $230+ per night) you expect more.  At least some decent shampoo and soap in the bathroom?  The cheaper hotels even give you shampoo these days! Like everyone else says, the bed is amazing.  I would give that alone 5 stars as it is fluffy, big and loaded with pillows!  The room is also roomy and very clean and the location on the river is beautiful.  Shula's steakhouse in the hotel is also amazing and the hotel workers could learn a bit of customer service from the personable servers in that restaurant. The hotel service is what could use a bit of effort and some complimentary gestures would be nice.  The hotel seems to want to charge you for everything.  Little fees here and there.  WiFi was about $12 a night.  I would have liked to go to the gym, but I can run outside for $13 dollars less. A few elevators were also broken the whole time the 3-day conference was going on so that made getting from room to room confusing and the banquets were met by very loud servers that decided the middle of a speech was a good time to clear every hundreds of dishes from the tables.  The loud clanking was not good at all.  When they finished the speaker was also finished. Good timing. I had a reservation at the Embassy Suites across the street and had a night and day experience there.  Much more value for your money.",N
4972,"I was planning to stay at The James and instead opted for this property after coming across a cheap rate at http://www.getaroom.com. My only gripes: my room was small and the service was a little slow. The food we bought at the restaurant didn't disappoint! I didn't have a chance to use the gym (too busy checking out the shops along Magnificent Mile), but my cousin said it was worth checking out. This is by no means a luxury hotel, so cross this one off the list if that's what you're after.",Y
1531,"Is it wrong to give a hotel 2 stars based mostly on the elevators? I just can't justify 3, although to be fair I guess this should be more like a 2.5, because the room my parents stayed in was nice and pretty big, with a great view. But honestly, with the amount of money they have got to be making, they REALLY need to invest some time and energy into renovating their elevators. First of all, if you can get on an elevator in under five minutes from the time you push the button, congratulations to you! The elevator never, ever, ever came quickly, whether we had called it from the ground floor or the floor my parents were staying on. Even though they have the floors separated into sections, and a couple elevators per section, it doesn't help. One time my mom walked all the way to the end of the hall back to their room, let herself in, and got something she had forgotten -- and this was AFTER we'd already waited 2 or 3 minutes for the elevator -- and when she got back we STILL had another 1 or 2 minutes before the elevator arrived. Second of all, the elevator is S-L-O-W SLOW. I guess this goes without saying, considering how long it takes to arrive at whatever floor you're on, but oh my goodness, it's even more painfully slow than you'd imagine it would be while you're waiting for it. Pretty much every time we rode the elevator DOWN, it stopped at every single floor, and it quickly filled up (because, oh, did I mention the elevators are also pretty small? Cuz they are.) and so the first few people would be able to get on, but by the 3rd stop or so, we'd just be met with exasperated faces and rolling eyes every time the door opened and whoever was waiting for the elevator realized they'd have to wait for yet ANOTHER ten minutes for the next elevator and hope that it wasn't full. Honestly, I can't imagine staying on the mid-range floors, how did they ever get downstairs?! It honestly would have been faster to walk. And the whole experience wasn't MUCH more pleasant for those of us ON the elevator, either, considering how much longer it took to get downstairs. And, last but not least, the elevators are pretty terrifying. I don't know how old they are but I'm going to guess PRETTY DAMN OLD. Other than that, the hotel was pretty good.",N
1945,"FuFu is not always hip. Employees: The employees try to be so cool, they seem distant. Not much personality here.   Cleanliness: The hotel is clean, but looks too dark inside. Facility: The room we stayed in was just plain strange. It was long and narrow. The hot water for the tiny sink in the Bathroom, along with the shower was not consistent. The sink water never got warm enough and the shower water took forever to get warm. You can't watch the flat panel TV from any place in the room. You can't see it from the bed, even though they have it mounted on a swivel base up on the wall, it doesn't swivel enough. Not even close. There is no couch. You only get a fufu chair that is one of those long chairs and it's REALLY uncomfortable. As you walk into the room, there is only one tiny light in the ceiling. This makes the entire front part of the room too dark to be useful. The one saving grace for the room was the bed. It was great, along with the bath towels. The desk in the room (908) has broken leg tips. Those silly looking words printed inside the lamp shade and also in the wine shelf were just plain spooky. It made using those lights a no-go. There was a nice ice machine on this floor. The slide light controller for the lamp was lame. The elevators have sort of 3D images on each side of little round objects. It's not good to place 3D in transportation devices that go up and down. This makes some guests dizzy. You have to navigate through a narrow corridor in the Lobby because they have places for people to sit and drink as you attempt to leave the hotel. Overall Recommendation: This hotel is located near, well, nothing. A better choice would be the Intercontinental located on the Magnificent Mile. It has gobs of restaurants and movie theaters within walking distance.",N
4237,"Beware of the continual over-charging!!!! . First, the lobby, while impressive in a late 80's prom way, is far too confusing. This proved to be a problem in the morning as I apparently entered the breakfast area 'backwards' and was therefore not handed a menu warning me that a cup of coffee, a croissant and a banana would set me back 15 freaking dollars. I asked the man behind the omelet-y bar thing 'which is the free continental breakfast' as was noted on my itinerary from priceline (thank god i didn't pay full price for this place!!!) and he pointed to a middle island. The tub was a little gross and moldy. The toilet didn't flush properly (which I didn't discover until about 9:30 at night (after I spent the day walking throughout the city and was so tired) And....at the risk of sounding impetulant and dumb....the TV they have....how do I say this...sucks. If it's not an NBC Universal company station, Disney or ESPN, they don't have it. Which I found to be ridiculous. It happened to be the night of the season premiere of a show I was looking forward to watching snuggled down in bed and watch...but they didn't have the channel. And it wasn't some arcane channel....it was MTV (yeah, I know....I'm ashamed, but I was on vacation and the Hills is a guilty pleasure, OK?) So...no hills....no hot soak because the tub was so incredibly gross. toilet didn't flush.... Also, with what you pay per night, would free Internet be too much to ask? Or perhaps something less than the 14 or so it was for 24 hours? I can't believe that a huge hotel would consistently nickel and dime you like that. As for the positives: I will say the bed was great- nothing beats a down comforter and the feather pillows were nice. as was the lavender citrus lotion/shampoo. But this hotel..I'm incredulous that someone would pay full price for. No one greets you as you enter....no one asked how my stay was (save for the fellow who hailed me a taxi and was the only person who treated me as a paying customer) I will never come back to this hotel ever. I'm better off paying slightly more for an antiquated 1960's motel.",N
1446,Did an overnight here with the family so my daughter and I could do a Memories with Mom package at American Girl. Omni does NOT disappoint! Found a package for around $365 - not bad for a Friday night stay in the heart of the Mag Mile that included overnight parking AND $50 worth of breakfast. Check in - fast and smooth. Kids received a little Welcome Backpack thingie with little toys and a snack in it. Later that evening - cookies and milk were delivered to our room for the kids. They really take care of their little guests! Join their Select Guest Pgm so you could get the free wifi!!!,N
5780,"OVERPRICED and UNCOMFORTABLE!!! Hospitality was okay. Concierge was helpful when I wanted to find a place to eat, though that isn't asking much. Room looked really nice... until I went to bed. The most terrible mattress I ever experienced. I had what felt like the worst case of insomnia that lasted for HOURS. And the noise from the shower next door kept me up and caused my heart to race. I started to get angry. It was driving me mad! Drip-Drip-Drip-Drip, just wouldn't stop! In fact, it sounded amplified. Maybe the tub materials and leaky faucet? Is it rude to knock on your next-door neighbors door and ask them to sacrifice a clean towel for the tub to catch the drip? I was sure it would last for fifteen minutes. But it went on forever. Earplugs hardly helped. I vacillated about calling down to switch rooms, but I was exhausted from my travels and I imagined the effort. I thought I might end up in a room that was worse. Or it might take an hour. Packing and unpacking around mid-night would not be fun! When I left at 7:15am I wasn't in the mood to argue upon check-out. If I EVER return to this area, I will INSIST on staying somewhere else. Breakfast was overpriced and I didn't dare. I was certain the quality would be poor. No complementary buffet for the price? That's ludicrous. At least then I could judge the food by having a preview! ps. Sorry for venting! I know it's no fun to read.",N
1477,Stayed four days two nights.Great large room. Select Guest Service thing was ok. I forgot to put the thing on the door one night until after 2am (yes i was out partying late!! ;)). No goodies. The 3rd night i forgot to put the delivery time (no goodies again).  The staff was friendly but in that very vague robotic customer service way.  The pool was great. I used that two of the three nights i stayed.  Location was perfect. On Michigan had access to to the Red Line train and the buses on both Chicago Ave and Michigan Ave.  It was overall very enjoyable stay.,N
1469,"I would never stay anywhere else in Chicago! My husband and I came here for a weekend trip while he was home on leave from Iraq. We already had a room booked (at a VERY affordable rate!) but when we arrived, the front desk clerk found out the reason for our stay, and we were upgraded to a deluxe suite! From there, it was pure heaven. The concierge was more than accommodating with helpful tips on where to go, best restaurants and tourist traps to avoid. I felt like the staff was anticipating our needs before we even had to ask! Room service was delicious and beautifully presented. We even spent one evening relaxing in the hotel bar with glamorous martinis and yummy herb popcorn. Can't wait to go back!",N
291,"The hotel was the best part of my trip up to Chicago. I arrived and had requested a smoking room online, but they put me in a nonsmoking room. Went to the desk and quickly fixed the problem. Gave me an incredible suite with kitchen and great view. The breakfasts were great (and free). My girlfriend and I both absolutely loved  the location to everything she wanted to see. There was a problem with the parking garage they had just started using, but the hotel manager walked with us down there to not only correct the problem, but to not use them until they worked out the kinks.",N
2426,"I was fortunate enough to stay here for my birthday back in December. It is located right on Michigan Ave across from the Lake and the parks! Great location for a view, but in terms of things around it, there are not many shops or restaurants. The lobby was beautifully decorated for the holidays. One thing I didn't like was the ceilings of the lobby were really low, but there was a beautiful area with a huge Christmas tree. I got this hotel on Priceline and when we checked in, we were able to get a room with a gorgeous view. I was so happy! When we walked in, there was a computer that was playing musiak and had a personalized greeting on the front. Everything was nice and clean and I considered the bed to be comfy. Also, do not come to Chicago with a car. Parking is ridiculously expensive. 40 bucks and up each night. I would love to stay here again next time I'm in town.",N
3276,"It was just OK.  I booked my stay at the Hard Rock through http://Hotwire.com and scored the room for $129 a night..I stayed for four nights and for the price it was OK.  Their lobby is very small and the bar is nothing special.   Really, I expected so much more. The location though is perfect. It's close to Millenium park and at the south end of the Magnificent Mile.  Service was also just fine.  Overall, I probably wouldn't stay here cause it really was nothing special.",N
1712,"Strengths: Hotel was trendy and clean.  Staff was pleasant.  Gym was nicely sized and equipped.  Hosted happy hour was AWESOME. Weaknesses:  The location is not that great.  Yes, this is in the Loop, but in hindsight, as a tourist we should've stayed north of the river.  The bathrooms are pretty tiny. Opportunities:  More leniency with the hotel restaurant vouchers would be nice :) Threats:  Being that I'm a first time visitor, I cannot compare with other local hotels.  I would say that this Kimpton was much cleaner than the one I stayed in when I was in DC. Total:  $89 per night",N
2930,"Second time staying here.  First time was solo for a conference.  This time I was traveling with my 8 year old son and our Labrador.  I wasn't sure what to expect this time!  Actually, had a great experience.  My son loved the Microsoft Surface tables in the lobby and the hotel's proximity to the Lego store on Michigan Ave.!  Our room was great -- spacious with a spectacular view of the river and the City.  The hotel staff was great about us having a dog.  They even gave us a special door hanger (see pic) to use -- probably to alert room service staff.  BTW, room service food is solid and the deep dish pizza is great. If you are traveling with a dog, this hotel is nicely situated for some ood walks either along the river, down to Navy pier, or along Michigan Avenue.  There is also a park with some grassy areas just in front and down the hill from the hotel.  No walking for blocks to find a place for your pooch to relieve themselves. Two bits of advice.  First, don't self park.  I chose to do this to save money (not sure that I did) and to better maneuver the dog after check-in.  I should have taken it slow (they would have let me leave the car out front while I took the bags and the dog up) and let them valet the car.  We never used the car again while we were there -- opting to walk or take a cab.  Self parking was a pain. Second, try the Javatini in the Java bar (open after 3PM).  It's incredible.",N
543,"The hotel is very nice based on my stays at other Hamptons.  The location is super convenient to major downtown businesses and attractions.  Don't stay in a room near the elevator.  You will hear noise from the hallway and elevators.  The rooms have modern furniture and televisions but if noise is an issue, you may want to stay elsewhere.",N
5174,Not a bad W. The staff was nice but my rooms were small. The TVs at the Lake Shore W were nicer. Not much for room service either.,Y
2240,"Stayed there for three nights starting July 16, 2009. Got a very low rate on Hotwire and then was upgraded because my brother knew somebody that knew somebody. Overall it was awesome. Beds were comfy, it was quiet. Location is great - but you have to figure out how to get to the red line station ( cross the street, go down unmarked stairwell, walk 2 blocks...). Pool was refreshing, but very old-school and not set up for hanging out. Starbucks in the lobby was great. Location was perfect.",N
3266,"So......this was the place where we stayed for the bachelor party.  I had certain expectations of this hotel.  The Hard Rock Hotel in Downtown San Diego is awesome.  First of all, I know I shouldn't go into anything having any expectations.  It only sets up for disappointment.  I wasn't disappointed per say, I was just thrown off a little bit from my expectations.  First time being in Chicago, I never knew the history of the downtown area and some of the existing buildings that were renovated.  This Hard Rock was renovated a while back and it's evident.  Architecturally speaking, this building has charm and character.  It's quaint for a large hotel if that at all makes sense.  Check out San Diego Hard Rock Hotel.. You'll know what I mean.   The location is smack dab in the middle of where all our activities were.  Just a short walk to Taste of Chicago and other interesting sites.  We reserved the entire 32nd floor which was compromised of 3 suites.  The Hard Rock did their best to renovate the rooms and to make them contemporary.  But yet there was no air blower/fan in the bathroom which could make for a stinky situation sharing 1 bathroom with several dudes.  Answer to the problem....can of Fe-breeze saves the day!  Other than that, we had everything we needed with modern comforts.  The views from our suites were simply spectacular, amazing, magnificent, you get the idea. I was a little turned off to see so many spider webs outside our window however.  But what can you do...it's an older building and we were after all on the 32nd floor.  I'm amazed now how technology has changed.  Case in point the mini bar.  They have this thing rigged so that it actually measures the weight of all the bottles in the fridge.  So in other words, I was thinking how I can swipe a bottle of liquor with a bag of sand ...a la Indiana Jones style..... Concierge service was exemplary and they helped us with any questions or situations that we had.  I should have stayed one more night with my friends, cuz apparently they met up with Snoop Dogg at the hotel on the day I flew out.....F*Ker's.... I'm jealous...I wanted to hang out with Snoop D O double Jizzle.... Final thoughts.  I like it....it was different...cuz it was an older building.  It certainly has it's own charm.  I intend to go back to Chicago maybe in a few years.  I'd like to stay at the new Trump Tower.",N
3205,"i stayed here for a conference in May 2010 and the hotel was fabulous. the service was exceptional. i stayed here for 2 nights and from the moment i checked in to the day i checked out the the staff were very accommodating. the lounge area was incredible, the crowd seemed to be having a super time and provided good food and drinks. the room itself was good, i did not request a view that was not of any importance to me. i will consider staying at the W for future visits as the location of the hotel is excellent! overall, the service of the staff was the selling point.",N
3414,"LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION I can't say enough about how great the Allerton is especially since it is strategically positioned between Gino's East and Giordano' Pizzerias.  The fact that you could order the pizzas To-GO and bring it back to your hotel room to eat, bypassing the hours long wait in lines - PRICELESS! They are literally only a couple of blocks away.  Of course, my wife loved the fact that they were smack center of Miracle Mile where all the boutique stores are. Overall the hotel was clean and modern chic.  It is apparent that it is an older building that has gone through some renovation.  But this adds to a bit of its charm, including the funny smelling elevator. Only elevators that are over 50 years old can have that distinct smell - hard to describe, but you'll know it when you smell it. The room was a lot larger than what one would expect from a hotel situated in the heart of the city.  There was more than enough space to prevent us from feeling claustrophobic.  I have stayed at some boutique hotels that were so cramped that you couldn't lift your hands to shampoo in the shower and hit my head on the wall trying to get off the toilet (really!).  The fitness center is very large with equipment that have individual video screens and they provide you with disposable headphones as well.  Chilled towels are also available so you can cool down after a hard workout.  The only minus I found was the industrial flush toilets in the bathrooms - you'll know what I mean when you see it.  It is not the kind that has the lever on the tank, but the one that is on the water pipe. In addition, the concierge was very helpful and can even help you to bypass the line at Gino's East.  A definite must if you are planning to eat there.",N
5334,"DO NOT book your wedding at this venue.  Of all of the vendors I anticipated problems with when I booked my wedding, this would have been my last choice, and was by far the worst to have to deal with.  Initially booking under the excellent wedding coordinator of Rebecca Kuzelka, we were unaware that she would be abruptly let go a few weeks later.  Which the hotel did not contact me about, rather I found out through a returned email that I sent to Rebecca.  She was then replaced with the existing events planner who quit a few months later, the Doubletree once again never letting me know of the change, rather I found through a phone call to the Doubletree where they told me she was no longer there.  Finally they hired a new wedding coordinator, Brooke Bosak.  She did a nice job picking up where the others had left off, however her assistance in the back-office proved to be poor which is why I am writing a negative review.  These are the reasons we were dissatisifed with their service:- The final bill was incorrect, not taking into account the down payment we had made on the venue (which was a large percentage of the total cost) and incorrect service rates were used, that we did not sign on in the original contract.- In the final set-up (which I received a few days before the wedding because the ""system was down"") they had the wrong set-up (rounds of 8 instead of rounds of 10 which I had gone over with all three coordinators).  This would have been a disaster if I wouldn't have caught it because we had assigned seating at the wedding.- We went on our honeymoon immediately after the wedding.  I returned from my honeymoon to the incorrect amount being charged to my credit card for the reception with the old service rates (which I had fixed before the wedding) but had been changed back and charged to my credit card without my approval.  - Was charged $1,000 worth of room damage to our hotel suite which was absurd.  When I asked the hotel to provide reasons for this damage they provided pictures of three pathetic scratches which looked like normal wear-and-tear and could have been rubbed out with polish.  One of the tables they sent a picture of with a scratch on it was never even used by us during our stay. Also provided a picture of a hanging light the photographer had moved during pictures that was somehow shattered in the picture (but was not on our departure).  I accepted responsibility for that because the photographer had moved it, that was worth maximum $20.  All of the bridesmaids (which included 6 adult women) who I told about these charges and had been in the room that day were disgusted with the Doubletree for this.  I was able to get them to take off $500 after complaing and then another $50 when I reminded them that they shattered one of my champagne glasses at dinner.  I was acutally going to let that go, but not after this!- The night before the wedding I went to my maid of honor's room to share a bottle of wine before the big day.  We called down for a bottle opener and it took an hour and a half for them to bring it.  If you don't want to deal with a headache, then don't book your wedding here.",Y
2447,"This hotel was way too baller, but it's ideally located - a short walk from Millenium Park, the Museum Campus (where Shedd Aquarium and Adler Planetarium are located), and Grant Park's right across the street. That is probably a huge reason for its popularity. I like how the bar is actually crackin on the weekends. Carlos the bartender had his work cut out for him on both the 3rd and 4th of July. They have complimentary ice water set out on a table so that you don't have to bother the bartender with non-alcoholic stuff (although I'm sure he would give it to you if you asked). There are an abundance of tables situated by the window for people watching, which is always fun. I don't like the fact that they charge for internet though. Everything else is already pretty expensive.",N
1296,"Since they renovated I think I can now give this Four Seasons 5 stars.   The rooms are beautiful.  Their recent, much needed renovation level set the product with the service.  The lobby is modern and elegant with a gorgeous greenhouse bar and the Deca restaurant.  The rooms aren't all as spacious as you'd expect for the price, but they quality is there and the bathrooms are beautiful.   Service is always exceptional.  I've been staying at this hotel since I was a kid (shopping trips with mom) and the standard of service has never fallen.  There are still some waiters in the restaurant (now Deca, was the Cafe) that were there when I was a kid.  They are very good at making people feel welcome and at home.  Every whim is catered to.  As long as its legal ;) A great hotel with outstanding service and quality rooms.",N
4145,"Definitely above average in terms of the mid-range hotels I've stayed at.  Our room was clean, notably quiet, and BIG (also $40 less per night than the recommended hotel for the wedding we were in town for).  Excellent & friendly service and tons of amenities in the same complex, plus we couldn't have asked for a better location in terms of being able to walk to stuff, including public transportation.  Do be forewarned, though, that it's a business hotel, not really vacation spot, so there's no pool or breakfast area for example, and wi-fi isn't free ($13/day).  I would stay here again in a heartbeat, though.",N
4499,"Wow, what an amazingly posh hotel! My parents stayed here over the weekend and I got to spend a fair amount of time here. The height of luxury! Nice large room. Two cushy chairs. Mod furniture. Fairly small bathroom, but how much time are you going to spend in there when you're visiting Chicago? I love that they use CFL bubs in the rooms. Also, they have notes about the sheets and that they try to conserve water by washing them only when requested. Environmentally responsible. If I was a visitor from out of town and in search of a very nice place to stay, this is where I would choose.",N
3876,"Wow. Really amazing room.  Amazing.  Ordered the room through a hotel website.  Asked for a corner king with two walls of floor to ceiling windows. What I got was an unasked for upgrade to room 701.  Stunning.  One bedroom, plus a living room, plus two balconies, plus a spa bathroom with dual sinks, and a shower of epic proportions.  The shower was easily bigger than my full bathroom at home.  It had two plate sized rainshower heads.  One was accompanied by a hand shower wand.  The other was paired with 3 aimable heads lined up vertically below said shower head.  The shower also had seating at opposite sides of the room.  When the glass door to the real world was closed, you could turn the heat up and sit sauna like.  It was the best shower experience i've ever had.  It will be my inspiration one day when we move out of our condo and into a house and re do the bathroom.  Truly, succulent goodness.  I guess there was other stuff in the room.  Well priced in room wine bar, with no wine over $25 bucks, save sparkling.  40"" TVs in the bedroom and living room.  Affordable snack bar.  Zeppelin iphone dock in the living room which sounded incredible.  Why 4 stars?  The bed wasn't very supportive.  I like a soft bed, but this one was a little too soft.  And I suppose the point of a hotel should first and foremost be to get a good night's sleep. Not all beds are alike, i'm sure, and we may have just had a dud. Besides that quibble, this place was incredible.  Will definitely have another staycation in the spring when we can take advantage of the beautiful balconies.",N
5473,"We used Sutton Place hotel for our wedding reception venue and it worked out really well.  Anna, the event coordinator, was fabulous.  Working with her was like having a wedding planner.  Can't say enough positive things about her, but having people like Anna to work with in the stress of wedding planning is a lifesaver!  I could never thank her enough. The venue itself was great, too.  The location  is unbeatable, and the discounted room block rates were affordable for our guests.  When the dance floor was down and the room was set up, it really looked less ""hotel-like"" and more unique.  Plus, Sutton Place uses Flour, Cake, and Pastry for the wedding cake and those ladies do some fabulous work.  Overall, it was a great place to book our event and I'm glad we chose it.",N
2303,"The lobby in this hotel was very nice and the food at the restaurant was excellent. The hotel staff was friendly and the breakfast room service was right on time. The hotel rooms were fairly average sized, but the decor was a little nicer than most Marriott rooms. The room has a big desk and a lot of bathroom counterspace, although the bathroom itself was on the smaller side. They only have wired internet in the room and it costs $14.95 as part of their ""wired for business"" package that includes domestic phone calls.",N
4563,"So, I booked this hotel for me & my husband for 1 night via Priceline.  It was my 1st time to use Priceline so I wasn't totally sure what I was doing.  This hotel is really, really nice.  The entire staff, from the valet, to the bellman, to the concierge, were all so helpful.  Our room....it was very pretty, clean, but the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in!  My husband and I laughed about it, but seriously, I would guess a prison cell is larger!  I'm not even kidding...I think they took a storage closet and thought, ""Hmm, we could make a few extra bucks if we put a bed in here"".  Again, more than anything, we just thought it was funny.  It was quiet and fairly easy to navigate through the hotel...and this hotel is HUGE.  They said it takes up an entire city block.  We had show tickets for 11pm without dinner reservations and the concierge was more than willing to recommend dinner establishments & call and get us reservations .  It was a super stay!",N
1358,"We went for a quick last minute  weekend anniversary get away and wanted somewhere nice but not too expensive. I found this place on http://hotels.com and it was the cheapest on a Friday ( considering it was a holiday weekend) and looked decent , and was across from the drake close to all the touristy things to do in Chicago. The downside is that we drove from Milwaukee and parking in Chicago is atrocious enough as it is but the hotels valet service costs $50-ish bucks and I was not happy about that. The good thing is there is a parking garage LITERALLY across the street that is only $35.. you can't take your car in and out though and that's only for 24 hours. SO we did that, problem solved. Deets on the Digs: Presumably re-vamped recently, outside of the rooms were kinda run down, I don't know if they pay attention to these things but door frames and floor boards were filthy and in need of a good coat of paint. The elevator was terrifying. I mean, talk about a death box. I am claustrophobic enough as it is but I could barely move with all our luggage. I overlooked these things because of the price and location and then get into the room and it is small but very luxurious. I read others reviews here about the showers and laughed because there's instructions IN the shower on how to use them and I have to say I don't think I've taken that many showers in a 24 hour period, ever. I loved it. The marble in the bathroom echoed and it kinda made me self conscious about using the loo considering you could hear everything. I would suggest some kind of better rug or something in there that would muffle the noise. Also the toilet was confusing, The flusher was on the wall above the toilet and has two buttons that do the same thing. I guess it's a ""fancy"" thing I don't understand but I thought it was unnecessary The bed was AMAZING.. if not for the fact that we wanted to sight see I would have stayed in and slept. I was so comfortable in fact I passed out as soon as my head hit the pillow. Our bed at home is now an utter disappointment. We ordered room service twice and I have to say it was quiet reasonable. We split pancakes in the morning and they were delicious. My boy got late night cheesecake the night before and because they were missing an ingredient they gave us two pieces! Quite nice. Overall, knowing the small discrepancies here and there I would definitely stay there again.",N
888,"It was one of my first architectural discoveries in Chicago. I fell in deep love with the wrought iron staircase, the mosaic floor and the detailed elevator doors. That was 5 years ago. I live in Chicago and so needed a good occasion to stay in one of the rooms. I got married!!! (what's this for a plan?) We had the reception at the Reliance Room and were appointed to a complimentary suite for our wedding night. I loved it. The location is just unbeatable and the views.....incredible.... We decided right there and then to spend every anniversary night in that room and I can't wait for the first one!",N
3696,The hotel has a great location right near the water. The staff is helpful. The rooms are cozy  and aging. You have to pay for the internet. The reason I gave it two stars is because the walls are paper thin and you can hear the hollering and heavy breathing and almost everything from your neighbors. The gym was better than expected but crowded with business type workers. Even though it was non-smoking - the place can't help but smell of it.,N
4474,"+ less than a block from the red line, two from the blue, and the wabash exit puts you really close to the adams/wabash stop on the loop + we lucked out and ended up getting a huge king room on the honors floor for crazy cheap - there were dirty glasses in the room and it took them a long time to get us replacements - on a busy saturday there were two people working the lobby (1 at concierge and 1 at check-in).  wtf?   - there are charges for everything!  consider asking for a room that faces state street, you might be able to use some internet. + the bed was huge, the sheets were nice and clean, and the thermostat worked",N
4708,"I agree with others that this is a moden hotel with postage stamp size rooms but with a comfortable bed, very nice shower (though no fan in bathroom) and a very shallow wash basin. Hotel is located a bit off the beaten path, but a short walk away from State Street/Michigan Avenue. I am not as complimentary of the staff, however. The two bartenders had attitude issues. The late night front desk guy appears to be distracted. Agree that walls are paper thin as we had to endure a party next door. Fitness center has modern equipment, but just two treadmills, two eliptical machines, and some free weights.",N
3572,"The lesson from such old hotels is that - sitting on your laurels results in butt rash. The location is wonderfully convenient.  The rooms? Tiny as hell and the walls that separate them are thin as can be. I was treated to a rather spectacular fight from a somewhere-in-the-vicinity room at 2 am. There's nothing special about the rooms.  The bedding is just ""meh"".  On the 9th floor, the air conditioning never seems to be correct  It was colder in the room than it was in the refrigerator. Speaking of odd things, there's no dresser space.  Where am I supposed to store my man panties?  There's a closet, but honestly - I'm not going to hang my Andrew Christians up.  Drawer space!  Whatever space there might have been under the giant TV was taken up with the minibar offerings. The bathroom was very nice and had a tub, which I prefer over a standing shower - as long as it's clean.  The Drake does housekeeping very well.  Excellent soaps, shampoo, conditioner & body creams as well. As pointed out by Omar, there's no wifi in the rooms. So, be prepared to shell out $12.95 a day for internet access that requires an ethernet jack or bring your own internet access stick. The food, though, was quite good and I have to give the Drake a lot of praise for doing gluten free very well.   I can take a so-so room.  I can't take terrible food.  This was pretty darned good, and I was the envy of my colleagues all week, as my employer arranged for special meals at breakfast and lunch. If you have mobility issues, this could be a rough patch if you're using the meeting space.  Lots of stairs.  Frankly, I loved the stairs.  It was the only exercise I got - and I did lust for the very nice gym which features Precor equipment across multiple rooms.   The front desk staff is superb and the security is very good.  I got the fish eye once or twice as I meandered back from Jamba Juice.  Perhaps it was the tight jeans and t-shirt?  I just didn't dress the part of a Drake guest, perhaps. The hotel itself is extraordinarily convenient to shopping.  Gucci is across the street, and that's just the start of the permanent damage you can do to your credit rating.   Rush Street is about a 5 minute walk away.",N

4412,"Enjoyed my stay while on a business trip. The Palmer House Hilton is nearby a variety of city attractions, great shopping, modern and swanky restaurants, great lobby! The concierge staff were very attentive, great room service, although a bit pricey but the food was great....though do not use the business center and gym, you have to pay for the service (WHAT!?!?). I very much enjoy my room on the 29th floor, the only down side was the bathroom was on the small side and very little counter space.",N
192,"This place gets 5 stars for one reason, and one reason alone. It was at this hotel that I saw my first topless woman. When I was a young kid, my family stayed at this hotel for a weekend. It was known as the Guest Suites back then. I vividly remember being at the pool on the top floor and looking out the window across the way to the condos across the street. Sure enough there she was, a topless 30 something (or at least that's what my 9 year old mind though), walking around in a thong. Oh man. I'm sad to report that they no longer have the black and white tvs in the bathroom that I used to think were so pimp, and that the parking is ridiculous ($50 a night, park at the self park at the Hancock across the street and save $20), but the rooms are huge, and the views are stunning. All in all a solid hotel, in a great location if you don't care about access to the el. Sadly no topless women this time.",N
4015,"I don't know, I guess our stay here was fine.  Nothing exciting, the room was decent, and the bathroom was pretty nice. The check in process was smooth, but we were unable to use the in-room checkout for some reason. If you like them on FB they have been running promotions for 24 hours of free internet with the secret password, which is good since they charge something like $14 a day. We ate breakfast downstairs one morning, it wasn't great.  We ordered off of the menu instead of getting the buffet, I wish we had skipped it all together.  There is a Corner Bakery a block or so away, it was better and cheaper for sure. The location was pretty much perfect- close to shopping and dining.",N
4672,"The Felix. One star and  most of that goes towards the doorman. Can't remember his name but that guy was great. He did everything but tuck me in at night. Checked in with quite possibly the slowwwest front desk staff on this continent. I have checked in to a hotel in Morroco where no one spoke english and it went smoother. We get to the hotel and got up to the room , small room but thats allright , to find out that apparently the carpet was soaked. I found this out when I kicked off my shoes and stepped on to the soaking carpet. Nice. Had to leave to go to work so down to the painfully slow desk I went.  Told the woman working the desk about the carpet and her response was:  ""really?"" After a moment of awkward silence I asked if perhaps by chance if she wasn't busy could she wrangle me up a new room. Her response was: 'Hmmmm. Let me see."" Says she can get me a room later and she'll call me when its ready. Got a call several hours later , the new room is ready we'll move your bags , new keys will be waiting at the desk etc... All is well I think , They made a mistake and now are correcting it. Ah yes. Go back to the Felix and the bags haven't been moved , the keys are not ready and now my key to the slop soaked room from earlier will not work. Back down to the desk not once but twice to get everything rectified. The new desk clerk has no idea what is going on and is moving at a pace that makes the first clerk look like Jesse Owens. I started out giving this three stars but have since moved it to one. If you want to see the best thing going at the Felix just walk by and say hi to the doorman. He's the best in the city in my book. the rest of the place? Not so much",N
1168,"i'm giving best western river north four stars. not because it's the best hotel on the planet, but because it is the best value. two words:  free parking! which is extremely important in chicago if you've brought a car. it is not fancy or exciting at all.   it won't wow you. but it is down to earth, in a central location for tourist activities, did i mention free parking? the prices are unbeatable... roughly a hundred bucks any night. it's the place you want to stay if you aren't going to be in your hotel very much and don't want to spend much.   also, no creepies here [at least not that i'm aware of!]  meaning no creepies lurking in the elevator and no creepy bugs. it's definitely old, but it's a nice bang for your buck if you're not looking for anything special. i'll be staying there again next time i visit the city.",N
2289,"This one goes out to Chicagoan, Caroline A...  Who may soon become a New Yorker. Thanks to JetBlue delaying our flight from 8PM to 3AM, we finally arrived at our hotel by 6AM.  Although we had reservations, we were told we were lucky that 2 rooms were still available due to the Air & Water Show that weekend. Minutes later, we walk into our room...  Seriously?  No, really?? Yes, I'm tired...  Is this dream?  C'mon now! Our entire Marriott Downtown Chicago, Magnificent Mile room, including bathroom & closet, could have fit in the master bathroom of our J.W. Marriott Summerlin room in Las Vegas!  See review & photos: http://www.yelp.com/biz/...  In fact, our bathroom in Chicago is smaller than most of the bathrooms I've seen in Manhattan!  The door cannot swing open more than 45 degrees because the bathtub gets in the way! *Split second flashback to my hotel in Japan* Well, the view has got to be good, right? The window spans the width of the room & measure approximately 5'5"" in height.  The view isn't breathtaking & it certainly helps that we're more than 20 stories up.  The glass only slides open about 2"". You guessed it.  We're paying for location -- Step one foot out of the hotel's revolving doors & you're on Magnificent Mile. Yay: Spacious, tasteful lobby.  Nice curtains & sleek lamps. Nay: Tacky hallway carpeting.  No fridge, mini-bar snacks or safe. The lone, liter bottle of Evian in the room will cost you $5. 24 hours of internet will run you $14.95 The outdoor roof area is under construction until October 2007. We decided to extend our stay in Chicago past the weekend, BUT I could not tolerate the lack of space another minute!  We moved to the Sofitel nearby, but only after I inspected our room first.",N

2023,"I recently got married and had my reception at the Wolf Point Ballroom at Holiday Inn Merchandise Mart Plaza. First of all, the views are of downtown Chicago are breathtaking.  I'm not being biased but I really think the views from the ballroom are the best in the city.  You get views of both branches of the Chicago river. It's beautiful during the day and even more amazing at night.  Our guests complimented us all night long about the view. It's pretty incredible. Next the food is really delicious! We got married on a Friday and had the celebration buffet package.  The package itself is pretty reasonable and the food was delicious. We had Caesar salad, prime rib, chicken, mashed potatoes, fruit, and grilled vegetables. Everything was super delicious. The prime rib and the chicken were juicy and very tasty. The cake, which we got through the package from Alliance bakery was very moist and delicious. We got compliments on the food/cake from our guests as well :D Last but definitely not least, the Event Coordinator, Barbara Martin is just fabulous. She is organized, responds promptly and is very nice to work with.  She was one of the reasons we booked the venue. We knew with Barbara that we would be in good hands. Throughout the planning process we had great communication and she was extremely helpful getting things in order the day of the wedding. The Holiday Inn was recently remodeled with the newly added Wolf Point room. I think the secret is now getting out on how great it is.  The prices are very reasonable for a downtown venue. I think choosing the Holiday Inn as our venue was the best decision we made in our planning process",N
1227,"Very nice hotel but I have major reservations in giving it anything higher than three stars. The hotel itself is four or five stars.  Great accommodations, clean, sharply designed.  We enjoyed our time there. As a hotel for tourists, though, it's lousy.  I was placed there via a great Priceline deal, but the hotel is in a sketchy area, which you discover if you walk to the nearest CTA stop, or to the Metra station, or just straight into town.  During the daytime, you'll notice said sketchiness but I was never fearful of anything happening.  The evening is a totally different story, and we began taking a cab home. If you're going for a convention at McCormick Place, or just passing through town, this is a fantastic hotel.  If you're a tourist, I wouldn't choose to stay here.  If you're a tourist going through a deal site and are blindly placed here, just be prepared to drive or spend a little of that saved money on cabs. Finally, some people here do make great points about how this place is often understaffed -- the employees are very helpful and friendly, but during the daytime can be hard to find or get a hold of.",N
1628,The location and view were amazing but make sure your room is far from the elevators.  They were so incredibly loud that my husband got very little sleep.  Also the internet was painfully slow... used a groupon and they charged an extra fee for using it.  Seemed dishonest as I had asked if there were any other fees when I booked it originally and was told no.,N
5035,"So lets just say you will not miss the big ""W"" protruding from the hotel while driving down Lakeshore Drive.... From the moment we pulled up to VALET the car (may I add, it is ridiculous charge and should be cheaper for hotel residents... $40...but hey its the chi) anyways, It reminded me of a Miami vibe....with the shell mosaic shingles on the hotel front wall that glisten (I love) to the outside quarter to the right when you walk-in filled with posh plush retro couches and pillows (def a Miami wanna be). CHECK-IN: was a breeze...although had problem con my room keys at first, but problem easily resolved with the friendly concierge. It is a small hotel and the BLISS SPA is nice too (of course pri$ey) but I have been to way better spas in other hotels. So save your dinero!!! The bar located on the main floor is also filled with an upscale trendy crowd Now the part you should really care about...dun dun dun.... ROOM: very modern, beautiful, small, amazing view (request Lakeshore) but very comfortable...you will def have a great nite's rest....plushy very soft beds and pillows and Gorgeous marble bathroom filled with the hotel spa products ""Bliss"" with open french windows....You can see in your bathroom from your room or vice versa (weird but a nice touch). Overall, I liked it and I got a great deal on the room (hotwire) so not complaining!!! =)",Y
3076,"I will keep this short since there are so many reviews with different experiences, but just want to say that I've stayed at a lot of different hotels in Chicago, and this may be my favorite overall.  So let that speak to you however you'd like.  Just keep in mind that this property caters to the image conscious, although the roots of the building are not as glamorous (used to be a Radisson, I believe). Pros: * fun location for the summer (walk to Navy Pier and path along lake) * first class fixings - towels, linens, furniture, electronics (although the Bliss bath products are over-rated by some reviewers) * best workout facilities I've seen (with perfect views of the lake) * room service tasty and surprisingly reasonably priced Cons: * public transportation options limited (though I'd imagine that the great majority of their clientele do not take public transportation) * lots of pretentiousness in the lobby and the elevator (since the whiskey bar is on the top floor so you'll be seeing and smelling drunks as you try to get to your ""soothing"" room) * building shows signs of age when you look closely (you can try not to look, but if the power goes out when you need to check out and you're on the 31st floor and have to walk down the narrow winding stairway and start to get dizzy and thinking ""how much did I pay for this?"", its not so subtle or funny)",N
2507,"Its a great location away from all the crazy loud gold coast street noises and massive amounts of people. The hotel's architecture is amazing, from the main entrance on Michigan ave to the corridors or the guest floors. The gym is also state of the art with a great outdoor deck. I hosted a birthday party in one their suites and it was a great success. The catering department does a great job, and Eric our catering manager was knowldgeable and extremely accomodating. The event was flawless. I would recommend this hotel in a second.",N
2608,I've been here a couple of times... one for a Ford party and another for the Glamourama afterparty. Both times were fun so i have nothing negative to say bout the place.

4679,"We stayed at the Felix for a weekend in Chicago for fun. The hotel is located about five blocks from Michigan Ave. It is a quick walk to shopping and dining options. The rooms are small but, I have stayed in other hotels in Chicago that are the same size. If you are coming to Chicago, are you going to be in your room all day? They also allow you to park for free if you drive a hybrid. We have a Prius so that saved $42 a night for valet parking. The rooms are comfortable but, the walls are a little thin. Again, something I have experienced at other hotels. Overall, a great stay at a great little hotel. If you want to stay in Chicago and want to be within walking distance of a LOT of stuff, keep the Felix in mind.",N
4240,"Location, location, location and that's about it. If you want somewhere that is in the middle of chi-town, this hotel is excellent for that. I stay there just last week and it was nice that it was in the center of Chi-town but the hotel itself was a little run down. My facet in the sink & bathtub leaked and the walls were so thin that we could hear the neighbors whole conversation. It was crowd too.  Parking is $48 per night and internet is $13 per night. Oh and don't use the mini-fridge. They'll charge you $25 for using it.",N

23,"Checked into  the room for the Cubs-Cardinals series in early August.  Found the rate online and my critieria was cheap so I guess I can't complain.  Location was great.  Steps from Michigan Ave and Rush St.  On the down side, as we were checking in, a woman at the front desk was asking how to make the tv work, because she could only get a couple channels.  ""Oh...sorry...our cable is out until next week.""  Yeah...right! That should have been the first sign that this long-in-the-tooth motel was going to be no-frills.  So, not only is the tv limited to local only snow-casts, but having imbibed on great Chicago chow, I soon discovered that the toilet takes about 10 minutes and 5 or 6 flushes to disappear the package.  Yucko! Still, with its proximity to just about everything, it was quite a bargain for 3 nights ($159 per).  Just would have appreciated a little love on the bill after the cable outage. Ditka's adjoining restaurant made it barable.",N
2554,"What happened to this place? Victor Hotel has gone the way of so many other clubs. Started off hot, now desperate to make a buck. First, when you arrive, if you don't want to valet your car, then don't drive up to the club on Sangamon. It's a narrow street in the warehouse district with delivery trucks on all sides, making it nearly impossible to turn around. Secondly, after security pats the guys down,  you'll be paying a $20 charge. I came here with a birthday party, and they ""had no record"" of the party, yet the other people who got there before me didn't pay. Hmm. Victor Hotel conveniently has an ATM. This machine also charges you $4.50 per transaction when you withdraw the $20 needed for cover. Seriously, like other reviewers said, this is Chicago. If I am going to a club that makes you wait in line and charges $20, it better be amazing. Instead, $20 gets you what looks like a garage with strobe lights. The sound system is pretty poor here as well. Stand too far back, and you won't hear much. Stand moderately close to the DJ booth and your ears will ring for two days.",N
3472,"Don't be swayed by the less-than-modern exterior of the hotel, or the 1920s Tip-Tap sign at the top.  The interior is very modern and comfortable.  Here is my pro/con list: Pro - Large rooms - Sheets that don't move around - Comfortable beds - Decent Internet, although it is tethered - Excellent location - Very nice gym with windows and TVs on each machine Con - Older TVs - Small-ish bathrooms - In-room refridge was just on the ground by itself All in all, Allerton is now my go-to hotel in Chicago.",N
2317,"Really conveniently located hotel with lovely rooms.  I was here one night earlier this week, and the beds were the most comfortable hotel beds I have been in in months.   I also liked that they had a busy bar scene on Tues night around 11pm- looked like a lot of biz folks were at the hotel and that was nice, since it's also tourist season and it sucks to travel for business and stay at a hotel filled with families.  Makes you miss home even more :) Also, room was large and the hotel was right on the Magnificent Mile, close to tons of good restaurants and SHOPPING!",N
314,"I got a great rate for this hotel on Priceline and I really wanted to like this place for the deal I got. AND in all honesty we should have said something to the management the second we realized what was going on. So we get checked in and everything, the hotel is really convenient and I really like the placement as it was really close to everything we needed to go to.  It was a cute hotel and our room was a little small but hey, it worked for us. The issues first started happening when I tried to connect to the wifi in the hotel.  I couldn't get it in our room and I was frantically trying to do something on the internet when I couldn't get to the internet.  I walked down to the lobby and accessed it there.  I soon found out from my bf that we could get it out in the hallway outside of our room but not in our room.  Okay it's an old building I can deal. Then they had window units for the AC in the room.  Yes, I know it's Chicago but come on.  It was fine the first couple of days cuz it was cool outside but when it heated up, there was no way to get comfortable.  All the unit did was spew out uncooled air from outside.  We slept in our own sweat.  gross... That was the thing we should have brought up immediately.  Also as a hotel they should have central air and heating, but hey. We liked the hotel and the staff but the air and the wifi need some work.  We MIGHT come back but there is no guarantee.",N
5331,"I stayed here only for one night. We arrived too early to check in and the concierge was happy to stow our bags for us while we shopped outside of the hotel which was awesome. Check in was quick and friendly. We had desk agent Cookie. She was wonderful, pleasant, and all around a giggler which you usually dont get at hotels...or the fancier ones anyways. We didnt get the room choice we wanted but it was ok. I got a great deal on the room so i wasnt even a bit upset. Room was very clean, beds super comfy with TONS of pillows. Bathroom a tad tight but luckily my bf has a shaved head so we werent fighting for the bathroom to get ready ha. Quick response when we called down to ask for toothpaste and silverwear. The door man was funny and very helpful to point us in the direction we were trying to go. Cab service from the hotel was very nice and quick as well. There is an Einstein Bagels attached to the hotel which was perfect. I believe this is my new hotel in the city. Great value for the location and your modern ""hilton"" hotel. Very very pleased with our stay.",Y
3064,"The W Chicago Lakeshore is the ultimate in hip hotels. I stayed here over spring break of 2007 with a few buddies. I'd originally reserved a room elsewhere, but a reservation mixup with Expedia landed me here - and in hindsight, I couldn't have been more lucky! The hotel itself feels more like a hipster lounge than a hotel. Upon entering the lobby, you will be greeted by smiling faces set in an ultra-chic club room of sorts, complete with dark wood and metallic tile materials, falling water and fresh baskets of apples (a part of the W founder's tradition). The entire hotel smells of a light, almost floral cologne - it's delightful. Soft house (read: electronic) music flows and adds to the air of ""cool"". The room we stayed in was not terribly spacious, but it was satisfactory enough. A great view of the lake combined with W's legendary matresses made for a fine stay. My wakeup call I had scheduled the night before even included a recommendation to bring my sunglasses, as it was quite a sunny day. The Bliss Spa is also a luxurious indulgence, I received an awesome manicure there. At night, the lobby turns into a full-fledged lounge, complete with cocktails, cool furniture, a bar and a DJ. Very cool! Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the W. Extremely comfortable beds, helpful courteous staff in an ultra-hip environment is the name of the game. Don't bring a car, you'll pay heftily for parking.",N
2173,"You know I'm just using you for your pool, right? OK, cool. Now that we're on the same page, can I contradict that by adding ""and your wine bar""? Yeah, well yours is pretty great. And noshing delicious cheese and amazing wine does not prevent the swimming, so it all works out. The wine + cheese flights here are inspired, especially if your thing is to nerd out on wine and cheese. The thing that impressed me, although it could be considered overly corporate (whatevz) is that they added a printout of each cheese and wine's description right next to the thing. So instead of bugging your server to remind you which-is-which, you get a cute little card that you can tear out and bring home to enable future wine + cheese awesomeness.   They had a cheese flight that had ""coronary"" in the name. It's this amazing brie flight. I informally renamed one of them as ""Orgasmic Cheese."" That should tell you something.",N
4537,What an amazing place this is. The lobby is breathtaking and the artwork was recently restored. An excellent place for a wedding reception or special function. One of the most elegant hotels in the the area if not the Midwest.,N
590,"Just opened but you'd never guess it. Great staff, great feel and look. SERVICE WAS FABULOUS during my business stay for a week! Although i do like modern and busy hotels. If you are a light sleeper it may be tough...the walls are a bit thin and it is a hot spot for nightlife activity, but i enjoyed the accommodations, service, food and staff very much!",N
2600,uhm... i'm confused by this place. i don't get it.,N
2249,"We got a great deal on this hotel through Hotwire. We were headed to the Shakespeare play and wanted to enjoy a stroll.   Our room was in the new section of the hotel so it missed all of the ambiance that we had heard about from others  It was a nice room with soft sheets and lots of pillows and a decent slice of view of the lake.   My husband and I discussed why we would not rate it higher.  It was lack of customer service.  A bit of a wait at check-in but not horrible. Okay we can get past that but here is what is missing...detail.   We valet check the car and have a great guy, super friendly, chatting with us but no detail on how to get the car.  My husband had called about the valet service for the car but were not told that it was going to be  $54 for the night which seems a bit pricey but.  When we checked in we questioned where is the fitness center and got the info but again no detail on the fact that there is a fee.  Truthfully we felt sorry for the Fitness Center staff person because she caught the grief of numerous people who were surprised that there was a fee...just bad customer service.  Yes, the gorgeous pool is free and that is a bonus. We check the suitcase after we check out and get the warm fuzzies from the bell stand and were assured that we would be taken care of but when we get the suit case we are surprised tht the car was downstairs and spent awhile waiting downstairs for it...seemed like they could have had it all set up without wasting our time.   The $7.00 fee for the Evian bottle and the $14.00 fee for the internet and all of the pricey bar stuff were laughable.   Eno the wine/cheese bar is a four star.  The staff person was spectacular.  She really knew so much detail about the wine and cheese and helped us  make a great choice on the wine and  the cheese. The Zest menu for brunch was not memorable.  Yes, the food was okay and the service was great but it's Chicago and we expected a lot more. However, the old tower has some beautiful views and architecture.  So grab  a glass of wine and wander...",N
2498,"Old world charm that nickels and dimes you the whole way through.  There are so much better places to stay in Chicago, I must say I am not a huge fan of the Hilton Chicago.  Was put in a room with a view of a brick wall without being told, and the room was so hot I had to keep the windows open in March.  HORRIBLE!",N
5217,"I would never stay at this hotel again. I booked a king suite for my sister's bachelorette weekend so we'd have space to get ready and open some gifts before heading out for the night. When we checked in (at 5:15 p.m.) we were informed that the previous night's guests had checked out late so the room was not clean. They kindly provided us with drink vouchers and we settled in to the martini bar to wait for what we assumed would be a reasonable amount of time. AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER I revisited the desk and asked what was going on. I was informed that the previous night's guests actually hadn't checked out until 45 MINUTES AFTER we had arrived at 6 p.m. (check in is listed at 3 p.m.). This was directly in conflict with the previous statement that ""housecleaning is in the room cleaning it right now."" Despite checking in at 5 p.m. WE WERE NOT ABLE TO GET INTO THE ROOM UNTIL 7:30 p.m. (four and a half hours after we were supposed to be able to check in). Hotel staff could only say ""sorry, we really have no control over when guests leave."" What?!  While we were waiting, three other guests came to the desk with assorted other complaints. The hotel room phones did not work so we had to use cell phones to call the front desk. Staff noted that they did not work but did not come to fix them until we were checking out the next day. In addition, we had to ask three times for extra beverage glasses (which took a half an hour to show up), and had to request linens for the fold out bed as well. Speaking with upper management the day after was less than delightful. They did agree to deduct a small portion of the room price, but only after repeated complaints and difficulty. The hotel is lovely with lots of character. Too bad the same cannot be said for the management. . . For my money I'd rather stay someplace that can be counted on to provide a positive experience.",Y
5406,"I'm a Hilton honors gold member.  I've stayed at numerous Hilton properties, and the only thing that impressed me with this property was it's location.  Customer service was meh, there was no free breakfast, no bottles of water in the room, and there was an Internet charge of $10.  It wasn't a horrible experience, but I won't be staying here again.  I can get much better accommodations for almost $400 a night elsewhere.",Y
2605,"Sometimes you wonder if it's the people you are with or just you.  I'm starting to think I'm not a downtown night life scene type of person.  I didn't really care for this lounge, with the exception of the decor.  It's a very sexy place - the art and photos exemplify that.  The music is house if you like that, you could probably appreciate the place a little more.  It's an upscale older crowd - not the same crowd as the people that frequent the bars in Wrigleyville, that's for sure!  I would venture to say 30 year olds and up.  It's a very posh place, and it just seemed like people are pretentious and fake.  I look for genuine smiles and people looking like they are having a good time, and just didn't feel convinced.  One guy ended up elbowing my friend and caused her to spill her drink and didn't even apologize.  He was snobby about it when she called him out on it.  I don't understand if the place is a lounge why dancers are there, because I think the point of having them is to encourage other people to dance too.   I think lounges are meant for people to chill, hang out and drink.  I'd be hard pressed to go again.",N
4698,"My fiance and I have stayed here twice now.  (although I have to admit we got it by chance twice on priceline, we were so happy when we got it a second time!) We just love it!   We used to live in Chicago we love to come home often, and Hotel Felix is quickly becoming our home away from home.  The first time we stayed here we fell in love with the hotel. It was just what we were looking for, somewhere environmentally friendly, somewhere small and quiet but close to everything and a chic modern design.   My family also stayed here and loved it.",N

3830,"(NOTE: REVIEW FOR SPA ONLY) A friend and I decided that we wanted to treat ourselves to massages. It was a last minute decision so we called around until we found open appointments. This is how we ended up at The Spa at the Dana Hotel. When we arrived, we stepped off the elevator onto the Spa level and so far, we liked what we saw. The waiting area and hallways were very tranquil looking and contemporary. We checked in and we were told that we could use the stream room in the locker area before our massages. Having had massages at other Spa's, like Bliss (or The Elysian, Peninsula, Exhale, Urban Oasis, etc.), we were really excited to use the locker room amenities. Upon entering, we lost our excitement. The locker rooms here are tiny. Two restrooms, one small steam shower and maybe three showers. On the counter was one hair dryer and typical spa amenities - a few razors, some mouthwash, toothbrush/toothpaste, comb, deodorant and lotion. The atmosphere was nothing special. It was sort of a mess, even though no one else was in there. The ceiling was peeling and there were black stains on the wall (um, mold?!). We were disappointed. Needless to say, we didn't spend too much time in the locker room. We put on our robes and walked to the ""relaxation"" room, a dimly lit room with a few chairs and chaises to sit in while you wait for your masseuse. We were served strawberry-cucumber infused water. They had magazines and fruit to enjoy. The room was comfortable, but we still felt like we wouldn't want to see it with the lights turned all the way up. With all that being said, the massages were pretty decent. We booked 50 minute, $90 Swedish massages. The massage tables were comfortable, the masseuse was friendly and I did leave feeling relaxed. Would I go back to the The Spa at The Dana Hotel? Probably not. With all of the massage options in the city, I'd probably stretch my wallet to go somewhere else or spend my $90 in another way. I'm a sucker for great spa amenities, and sadly, this one didn't live up to my expectations.",N
2353,"My family has been staying at Marriott's since my dad started his career. We used points to stay here, and wow has it gone down hill...they need to stop building those stupid Springhill Suites all over parts of Bumblef*ck Indiana and Kentucky, and go back and invest in some of their most significant properties.",N
1574,"Meh.... Lobby is small. Hotel is kinda classy from the outside. Staff was very friendly. View was beautiful. The room was ok, just not as super spectacular as I was expecting for the location price etc. The rooms kinda look like it was an office building that had been remodeled so the closet  was in the bathroom, a little weird but whatever. Decent stay but did not blow my mind",N
479,"I had a pretty darn good stay here over the course of two nights. The location is not quite as convenient as being directly in the loop but it is very close and near enough to many shops, restaurants, cafes and the lake. The value proposition here is two fold: firstly, the room, or should I say rooms, give you more of an apartment style set up than a typical hotel room. The key here is that because you have a living room and a kitchenette area separating your bedroom from the hallway, blocking out the vast majority of noise from passer-bys. My bed was huge and comfortable. I had a view of both the lake and the city. The second area they really stand out in is the extras: all you can eat breakfast, and a two hour complimentary happy hour in the evening at the bar. Combine this with a 24 hour fitness center, a pool and sauna and it is pretty difficult not to enjoy your stay here. The staff, especially in the dining area, were exceptionally friendly. As for the drawbacks. The carpet was ugly and the interiors themselves were drab and in need of an update. The fitness center could use an update too. The style of Embassy Suites means you have a view of the exterior of all the rooms all the way up to the top floor from the lobby. Because they all look exactly the same you get the feeling of looking up at an old tenement building in a former Soviet bloc country. The hotel is very, very kid friendly, which means it may not suit all business travelers. Summary: This Embassy Suites meets and exceeds expectations on every level except the aesthetic side, and even that was not so bad. I would definitely stay here again.",N
751,"If you are visiting Chicago and planning to do some damage on the credit card, this is the place to stay. Located at the northern end of Magnificent Mile, this is a great place to start off your day of shopping (I even went back to drop off purchases because I only got about a block away). Plus any touristy location you'll want to visit is within walking distance from here (Navy Pier, Art Institute of Chicago, Millennium Park, etc). The hotel itself looks newly remodeled and clean. The staff was friendly for the most part but didn't care that we were Starwood Preferred and told us to go to the back of the line when we were checking in. Other than that person, everyone else was courteous and helpful. The rooms were on the small side but that's to be expected due to its location. I didn't have time to enjoy the amenities or try the restaurant, which looked like a popular choice for tourists.",N
1199,"I stayed here for four nights back in mid-June and had a pleasant experience. The hotel was clean and all of the staff that I encountered were friendly and helpful. That being said, I probably wouldn't stay here again unless I was actually attending an event at the adjacent convention center. It's out of the way of downtown and, although the Chinatown L stop is only a few short blocks away, it's doesn't seem like a safe walk after dark or for a female walking solo (like me!). I did like that I was upgraded to a junior suite upon arrival and that they had a boarding pass printing station in the lobby. The free WiFi was hit or miss; you literally had to be a few feet from the lobby to get a good signal. Not a major issue for me, but if you're traveling on business it might be good to know. There is WiFi that you can pay to have in your room for around $10-$15 per day. Next time I'll be sure to stay at a more central location to downtown attractions.",N
1543,"Make sure if you stay here you specify a renovated room.  I booked through http://hotels.com which boasted flat screen tv's in every room.  Not ours!  We had an old standard definition tv that was NOT a flat screen.  The decor was awful, didn't match, looked old, the headboard was clearly the result of someone stapling fabric and batting over a piece of plywood and not very well either.   We're from Chicago and I was looking forward to staying here as a relaxing treat prior to the Rock N Roll Half Marathon since my first choice, Hard Rock, was sold out.  It was not the well appointed, modern boutique hotel experience I expected, and to add insult to injury our view was of our first choice hotel! Save your money, our room at La Qunita was way nicer and less money.",N
4894,"Beautiful place, lovely room.  I am very sensitive to noise, and had none.  I thought the staff, if busy, very busy, were very helpful and very nice.   It took a while to check in, with two people constantly answering the phone rather than checking people in.  Took a while to get my luggage.   But I would highly recommend this place.  NOT your cookie cutter hotel room, European look and feel.",Y

Location is excellent, service is personal and attentive, complimentary wireless a big plus for internet addicts like me, modern decor, ultra comfortable bed, turndown service, and kiehl's heavenly products are just icings on the cake!  The only thing it was really lacking is the view.  I really love the views that some of the hotels near the water offer but they are usually farther away from the action.  Irregardless, this is an A+ hotel.",N
2435,"Stayed here for a business trip and had a wonderful time. Hotel was very  nice. The bed and pillows were COMFORTABLE. I could sleep there all day if I really wanted to. One thing I didn't like was that the toilet looked a like a public restroom toilet. That was a lil odd. Room service was the best. I must say, it was the best room service kinda food I've ever had. Waiter came into my room, served it on the table for me, and opened everything for me: bottles, lids, you name it. Typically, when I order room service elsewhere, the food ends up being stale and cold. But man..... my food (fish & chips) was soooo opposite of that. I know, I know... fish & chips?? Yes, fish and chips. It was GOOD! They even gave me lil tabasco bottles that were as tall as my pinkies. So cute. Shoot, the bill came out to $40. WTF? Also, had an all day meeting there. Servers were very attentive, food came in on time ALL the time. Technicians were always available for IT needs. Gym is huge! They even have a lil track surrounding the gym. That was cool. Biggest gym I've seen thus far in a hotel. I definitely would want to stay here again for next year's meeting.",N
5206,"Booked this hotel through the hotel website for $265/night with a AAA discount. Stayed two nights in September. Pros: Location on Mag Mile. Complimentary breakfast beverages and wireless access for Omni loyalty program members. Big selection of complementary morning drinks. Gigantic beverage serving sizes (see picture). Large, clean suite. Quick check-in. Nice exercise equipment. Helpful concierge (Hi, Marcus.). Ample bathroom space. Free headphones offered to gym-goers. Complimentary Sunday New York Times. Friendly doormen. Pretty cloud painting on domed ceiling of main elevator. Received star treatment from restaurant recommended by concierge. Cons: Room décor was a little dated. Couldn't get a room on a higher floor. Bland view (but at least I wasn't staring at a wall). Not sure if hotel has many double bed rooms (whenever I search for rooms at this hotel, I never see double bed rooms, which deters me from booking a room here). Only two chairs in living room area and no couch. Faint, constant whirring noise in room (not sure if noise was due to elevators or air conditioning). Have to take two elevators to get to room.  Long wait for elevators at times.",Y
180,"I am a fan of the Hilton chain of hotels and this one proves no different. The rooms are large, it's an all suite hotel, and as a single traveller I had plenty of room for myself. It was really nice to be able to spread out. The bed is soft and the sheets are comfortable. The heating worked and I had a great view of the lake. The people who work there were helpful and knowledgeable about the local area and how to get around. I felt safe in the neighborhood and walking around at all hours. It is close to places to eat and shopping. It's off the beaten path so you don't hear traffic or the noise of the street. The heated pool and the hot tub were a much enjoyed added bonus. I felt spoiled as I sat in the hot bubbles and watched a blizzard fall outside. This is a great hotel and I would stay there again in a heartbeat. It is good for families, singles, couples (although it's not overtly romantic) and business travelers. There is a charge for internet (which I don't ever agree with in hotels) and they have room service, but no breakfast. There are better places to stay in Chicago, but this is a good choice if you're given it. Enjoy!",N

1651,"This was our home base while in Chicago and the entire hotel was up to excellent Kimpton standards.  Yes, it's an older building but our room was spacious enough for two and we never heard a peep from other guests.  We were right next to the elevator and the housekeeping closet which resulted in some morning noise during peak cleaning times but obviously it didn't bother us too much as we managed to loiter in bed one morning until 10 am.  Speaking of which, nice beds!  I'm picky about those and slept wonderfully without any back or neck aches. The hotel staff was exceptional with great recommendations and advice and we enjoyed the adjoining Liquid Lounge.  After walking up Michigan Ave one afternoon I'm so glad we opted to stay here instead of on the Magnificent Mile - navigating the crowds there would have driven me batty!  The neighborhood is relatively quiet, clean, safe and had all the amenities (drugstores, local eateries) we needed.  Clark/Lake blue line is a short walk for airport transport, and we walked to Millennium Park, Magnificent Mile, and Willis Tower from the hotel. Small downside:  no in-room coffee makers but we didn't mind hopping down to the lobby in the mornings to get our fix. I particularly love the pet friendliness of Kimpton hotels - I rarely travel with my dog but being able to greet the traveling pooches while I'm away from home makes me happy.",N
916,"I have stayed in this hotel ever since I became jealous of another publishing type who had put authors up at the Burnham while me and my people were at the Embassy Suites. So I began my exploration of Chicago hotels. Love and hate. Hate the W Lakeshore for their pretentious, sometimes just mean staff. Love the Holiday Inn Silversmith for really nice and affordable rooms and the unexpected diner and weird, tucked under the L feel. Love what they did to 71 now as much as I hated prior to renovation (and that view from the penthouse rooms -- yea!). LOVE the Sax because you can get food from Bin 36 -- for reals, that is worth the stay (have breakfast there!!!). Love the Monaco even though is like every other Monaco  -- but the service is so perfect and what a location. Hate that giant Hyatt, love the Palmer house, love that place that USED TO BE the Nikko but is stil so nice. Well, anyhow, I could go on and on and on. I love the Burnham because the staff is wonderful at all times. I leave to go to the drugstore and they wish me well, I return ten minutes later and they ask how things are going. I love the tiny space you cram into for the happy hour wine. I love the nest of pillows I make in my bed. I loved the view of the Chicago theater out my wndow. I love the way the Atwood looks (even if food is spotty when too crowded).  I love my clunky hotel key clanking in my pocket. I love the frosted glass on my door. I love the metalwork on the stairs. Traveling a lot to Chicago and not staying at least once at this 150 year ld place is a mistake.",N
5833,"Very clean and super helpful staff.  The rooms have nice beds with down pillows and decent duvet covers.  The air conditioning in my room didn't seem to keep it as cool as I would have preferred but that did not hinder my review much.  The single room with a queen sized bed was a little small, but for staying just two nights and being in the room only to change and sleep, this was not an issue.The hotel provides free bottled water, free Wi-Fi, and free computer/printing usage.  Quite helpful for quick information and a drink.Right off of Michigan Ave., we were super close to the ""Magnificent Mile"" and had a beautiful view.I will definitely return!",Y
1734,"The customer service is EXCELLENT and cost was great (got my room for only $127 a night on Travelocity). I think they've got a litle happy hour in the evenings as well, but I didn't take advantage. The location is ideal and central to a lot of downtown attractions. Oh, and did I mention free internet??? You have to join their Kimpton program, but it's a snap. The rooms are charming, Art Deco-ish, and Euro-sized but that's cool as long as you're not a bigger person. The one thing that I would change about this hotel is the soundproofing. It gets kind of loud sometimes!",N
2160,"I stayed here for 3 nights this summer. First off, the hotel from the exterior is very impressive and the hotel is in a prime location right on Michigan Ave in walking distance to shopping and across the street from major bus lines.  Close to major sightseeing spots.  Overall, a prime location. According to a friend who came here for work, the meeting rooms are very fancy.  Except I wasn't here to use anything but the rooms and lobby. Apples to apples, for their 4+ star hotel rating it was an okay experience.  I was bumped to a suite which hey, I'm not gonna complain about!   Except a few things I found oddly sub-par - the picture quality and sound of the flat screen TV were very poor and the channel line up was very limited.  It was the shabbiest TV reception I've ever encountered at a hotel.  Even my 1 star hotel experience in Spain had better TV reception.  Each day I ended getting charged incorrectly by housekeeping for allegedly taking things out of the snack bar (which I did not).  The Ipod dock for my alarm clock did not work.  The Business Center which is contracted out to a third party, messed up my printing job and double charged me. Otherwise, the hotel is very impressive from the outside and opens up to a spacious and busy lobby when you walk in.  The decor is a little bland and old-fashioned but otherwise everything about my room comfortable and what you'd expect.   Some of the employees are polite and helpful, but not to any greater extent than what you'd encounter at Days Inn.  And some employees were brusque and not as helpful.  Overall, I thought the customer service was just meh. I would say this hotel was solid but I was not impressed.  I realized after my stay here that I am perfectly happy with a recently renovated room at 2 or 3 star non-boutique hotel with a younger, more modern decor.  Because that's usually where I stay as a budget savvy traveller.",N
1947,"This place is interesting. Lobby and decor are modern, as other reviews will tell you. I hate the cologne in the elevators... Rooms are OK, but nothing to write home about. It's an old building refurb, and there is only so much you can do... Service is phenomenal, which, along with central location, is what moves this from a 3 to 4 star review.",N
4744,"This should not reflect negatively on the staff as they are pleasant and attentive.  My issue is with the hotel being rated as a four star hotel.  The rooms are woefully small, the walls are thin and there are no tubs or water pressure in the showers.  The Internet service is next to unusable, there is no pool and no hot tubs.  The bar closes before midnight and there are no dressers in the room.  Even the door hangars don't stay hung on the doors.  Oh yeah, 1998 club music playing throughout the lobby and elevators.I'm all for an Eco friendly hotel, but not in place of luxury.  Four star means posh, not green.  On a good note, the Mattresses are comfortable an the rooms are clean.  Don't expect to get a king size bed though.",Y

It's close to the usual assortment of tourist mandated visits but it's also a great location for just getting outside and taking a walk through Downtown Chicago. The Staff is extremely friendly and they really do go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable.  I mean even the maids greet you in the hallway when they see you.   Meal choices are fair, but expect to pay top dollar to eat, or drink, in the hotel.  It's Chicago, get out and eat somewhere else.  The parking is extremely over-priced at $50 a night.  We opted to rent a car from Enterprise (within walking distance) and turned it in every night for less than $32 a day for a compact car. The gym is placed in an odd location and it looks like it was just put there because the space is probably un-usable for anything else.  Nonetheless, a good assortment of ellipticals and treadmills, all with tv's built in.  There were also some weight machines and free weights, butfloor space is limited and more than 2 people and you've got a problem. WiFi is not complimentary and I believe it's like $10 a day.  I found that rather cheesy, but I paid it anyway out of necessity.  The rooms were nice and roomy and mine overlooked the Chicago River and Navy Pier.  The wall were however paper thin as one night our next door neighbor received a call from his wife at 2:30am and proceeded to rip into his ass about leaving when their 5 year old child has an ear infection...and she had to work late.  Never fret, after 15 minutes he calmed her down and got his mother to come over and help with ""Brandon.""  and yes, we heard all that! All in all not a bad place to stay and I'd do it over again.",N
3492,"The Crowne Plaza did a nice job of renovating the old Allerton. The exterior is sharp with its masonry walls complemented by a newer glass awning over the main entrance. Only so much could be done with the old rooms. While they are pleasant enough, they are small by modern standards. The location is primo, right along Michigan Avenue where all the tourists want to be.",N
1670,"I've stayed at the Allegro several times in the past 5 years. Yes, the rooms tend to be small - but it's an historic building in downtown Chicago, and that's to be expected! From what I've experienced staying in other hotels in that area the Allegro's rooms are a fine size, and much nicer than most as far as decor and amenities. On our last visit (a weekend trip) we were offered a last-minute upgrade and got a huge 2-room suite for a fantastic price. We loved it, jacuzzi tub and all. Also, they've updated the wallpaper, furniture, and bedding since our last stay -- gorgeous. Staff were nice and helpful as always, the evening wine/cheese party was a plus, and the location is perfect for a weekend touring around downtown. Probably the only complaint I might have is that noise can be a problem - we could hear the person in the room behind ours when he talked on the phone. Of course, that might have just been because he was shouting... Oh - last but not least, they have FABULOUS swag bags for the kids. If you're traveling with little people, make sure you tell staff when you make the reservation.",N
5045,"Great hotel. I just had surgery and was staying here because my doctors office was right across the street. They gave us a nice quite room. The room was nice and clean. The service was good and the food for room service was good and quick. Valet parking is the only option for this hotel, it was expensive but simple (since some parking garages are chaotic). Check out was simple didn't even need to go to the desk. I will be back if i stay in the city again.",Y
1667,"Stayed here for the 4th of July weekend. PROS - - PET FRIENDLY (at no extra charge) - walking distance to a 7/11 (that sells hard alcohol!) - 10 minute walk away from The Bean and Willis Tower - cabs are always available - free wine everyday at the lobby from 5pm to 6pm - friendly staff - easy to find - 2 blocks from the O'Hare train line (Clark/Lake station) - decent room prices (we paid $110/night) via http://Hotels.com - free internet access - they have a ""recyclables"" trash can in the bedrooms! go green! :) CONS -   - the non-suite bedrooms are notably small. - bathroom mirror area is very small as well. only one person at a time.   - Room walls are very thin.  We were able to hear our neighbors' conversations and their tvs! we were also awakened by people having conversations in the hallway. good thing we weren't in the room that often! - no mini fridge - ice machines NOT available on every floor - on demand movies are $18.99! I'd stay here again, but I'd definitely book a larger room (i.e. a suite)",N
3133,"I stayed here for a wedding and had a great experience.  The rooms themselves- the decor was very stream-lined, modern.  The beds were very comfortable to sleep in, too.  The Bliss Spa bath products were also a great touch.",N
2937,"For a time in my life I could have sworn I lived here.  It got so the same bellman hailed me a taxi time after time.  This is my favorite place to stay in Chicago, for several reasons.  Nice gym, though you have to pay.  Two bars for your drinking pleasure.  A Starbucks-style cafe and a restaurant.  Excellent customer service.  Great views of the city.  An ideal location by the river.  Close to Walgreen's and AMC theaters.  I've probably stayed here about six times in the last two years and have never been disappointed.  Rock on!",N
2747,"very pretty, very modern and very very civilized. there may be no sense of a 'scene' but this isn't new york.  i want to spend a few hours drinking a cocktail with a companion in a place that's mature, well-appointed and ...civilized. it wasn't swamped with scads of people looking to hook up, tourists or screaming bachelorette parties.  a major plus.  folks were well-dressed, sedate and laid back.  very...civilized. i was actually surprised at how un-outrageous it was to grab a few here.  4-6 cocktails and a wonderful dessert came to about $80 for two people.  maybe my scale is skewed but i think that's all right for a fun evening on a friday night during the summer.",N
2320,"I was here for an Industry Conference (11/6-7/2008) but I didn't stay here since I'm ""local"".  However I will comment on the lunches we were served and the liquor. First day's lunch was actually an amazing piece of work, however, since it was the ONLY lunch option for the day and I don't like eggplant, well, I was really hungry after lunch. After a normal salad, we were served up truly a beautiful dish of Eggplant Parmesan.  3 Medium thick slices of eggplant were breaded and fried and then stacked with a ricotta/onion mix layered in between.  Melted shredded parmesan was on top and a spicy marinara was draped on and around the dish.  Truly magnificent if that's what you like.  Dessert was a slice of Eli's Chocolate Chip Cheesecake. Second day's lunch was much better.  We started off with a cream corn chowder soup (it was a chilly day too) and then it was a Cobb Salad with really fresh ham and turkey sliced on it.  Dessert was this awesome lemon meringue tart that was to die for. Both our private open bar and the bar in the lobby of the hotel served up a wide variety of bottled beers and extensive wines.  There pretty much wasn't anything you couldn't handle. Also, free wi-fi everywhere in the hotel is always a plus, especially when you're a guest for a conference and you're not checked in.  Valet was slow as heck, but I parked in the lot just to the northwest of the hotel for much cheaper.",N
392,Great location and friendly staff.,N
1522,"5 star views. 4 star room. 2 star noise. 1 star parking charge. Spent 2 nights here last week an averall had a very good experience. Let's start with the bad though. I know parking in Chicago sucks, but 45$ a night? Felt like I was just throwing money away. Now the great...got a room on the 37th floor with a river view - spectacular. Great river view-decent northward view - see pics. The location is also great - near the Loop, River North and Mich. Ave. 4 Blocks to Art Institute. The morning noise was pretty bad starting at about 8am. LOUD shuddering construction going on somewhere across the hall. nOt good but we left each day by 10am so not intolerable. Room was $184 a night.",N
3177,"I love the W, and this was my very first. I had a lakeview room, and it was great. The lobby area is chill, and the rooms are nice. It's a bit dark, but then again, that's the W's style. I highly recommend.",N
2065,"I would come here again if only for the view - it was awesome. We were in an east facing room and got a great view of the right break of the river and the merch mart itself. At night all over the city had colored lights (but wisely turned them off somewhere around midnight) and it was just gorgeous. Great location too. It was a quick inside walk to the Purple and Brown lines, breakfast was a short ways away also, and it was a good central location to a lot of activities. The one issue we encountered was finding dinner - it seems to be a very business area so most restaurants close around 4pm so we had to cab it places (it was 10 degrees). If you are there in the summer and walk or just don't mind dropping $7-10 on a cab all the time then it's great. (I'm a city walker but the weather was a bit prohibitive) The pool was nice (once they got the heater working) and they had a well stocked gym and a nice sauna. The price was reasonable for an inner-city hotel. To my friends' delight we were there during a conference of teenage girls so they got to be dirty old men sitting in the lobby one night....I Yelped...",N
1391,"While I've never stayed at this hotel, as the former chair of my grad program's Winter Formal Planning Committee, I spent my fair share of time at the venue itself and interacting with the event planning staff. Throughout the planning process, they were very willing to work with us to keep the event within our budget. They also ensured that everything ran smoothly on the day of the event, from allowing our committee to show up early to do some setting up, to being ready to go with both the coat check and the bar. They were very accommodating of our large, at and times rowdy, group. Everyone loved the light up dance floor. And everyone in attendance had a good time.",N
3547,"Very nice hotel!  Our room was on the 27th floor and we had an awesome view of the city!  We found the hotel on priceline for $109 + taxes.  Steal!  Then, when it came time to park our car, it was $48 for valet, or, the closest garage was $40.  Obviously, we opted for valet, (really, what's $8 more?) but were disappointed that parking the car cost almost half of what the room cost.",N
4848,"Great hotel!  Brings back wonderful memories as we were in staying over for a big meeting my daughter had (which turned out successful!).  Valet/bellmen were great, very attentive.  Lobby is beautiful, huge hotel, we'd definately stay again!!!",Y
77,"We picked this spot because it is the closest hotel to Forest Park.  We paid amost $200 a night and we did get a suite.  The suite was very large- but needs serious updating.  The carpets were gross, the wall paper was coming loose, the furnture looked like it had been in a Frat house.  Needless to say, the only reason we have chosen this place for a second time is due to it's location. I decided to ask the front desk manager if there were any remodels in the works.  She did explain that all of the rooms have been or are in the process of being re-modeled.  She also said that the suites were the last one scheduled for re-model.  So, my suggestion would be to make sure you request a re-modeled room.",N
5220,"While in Chicago for a conference I found this Hotel on Expedia.  Here's a tip...go directly to the hotel website, I was able to save a substantial amount by booking directly with the hotel.  The location is hard to beat.  Half a block off  Michigan Ave, kitty corner from the Drake and next to the best shopping in town.Rooms are very nicely appointed.  Bed is remarkably comfortable and the large screen plasma TVs are very nice.  Bathroom is very fashionable with Grohe fixtures and a waterfall shower fixture in an amazingly large glass shower and tub.  I'd recommend this hotel to any of my colleagues.",Y
1138,"I love almost all fairmont's hotels, and this is no exception.  We had a view of the buckingham fountain absolutely gorgeous at nighttime.

3097,"Threw a b-day party here recently and reserved the space in the middle (b/t Wave restaurant and the lobby/reception area).  There was a minimum but we had about 35 people so didn't have any problem in obnoxiously exceeding that minimum.   The space looked exquisite....they totally set up the area with tons of candles and flowers and some minimal decor...it really looked spectacular !!  hats off to Sara D (W's event planner) for helping me put this together. We had two personal servers who pretty much took care of our every need.  Ordered several passed apps which were very tasty but mostly stuck to the drink.  She also let us bring in our own Champagne with no corkage fee for a toast...saved a few hundo right there, kudos to Sarah for that:-) Outside of this event, i've been on a few occasions for drinks as it's right next door to where I work....always a good time.",N
535,"Nice location, decent room for the price.  We were in town to see a show at House of Blues, down Dearborn a couple blocks.  We were able to walk everywhere we planned to go with at most a 15 minute walk.  We did some shopping at Water Tower Mall, hit a few of the bars on Hubbard, wandered to Pizzaria Uno for late dinner Friday.  We were going to take a cab up to Rush St bars on Saturday, but were wiped out from the House of Blues show we went to,.   The free breakfast was decent.  We had a mini suite, 2 beds in one room, a living/dining room with sofa and armchair, tvs in living room and bedroom.  The full sized fridge was handy for leftovers and to keep the booze we brought with us cold.  Had we known we'd have a stove-top, we might have brought other stuff along.   Valet suggested we could self-park across the street for $25/night instead of their $42/night, and had in/out privileges.",N
3352,"Yes people the rooms are small, the sink is really 10 inches wide, the elevators are slow as heck and the bed sheets are not the greatest at all BUT if you have a room at the Essex you are in the heart of Chicago. Who the heck wouldn't love to start their day looking out to Millennium and Grant park especially if the Blues Festival happens to be going on and be within walking distance to the Shedd Aquarium, Field and Art museum? Although the weather wasn't great, I loved being able to grab some coffee and take a stroll through the nearby parks, jam to some awesome music and get lost downtown. The location is fabulous and you just can't beat the competitive prices here considering all the money you'll be saving in cab fares.",N

Convenient walking distance to the Art Institute, Millennium Park, Grant Park and all the downtown shops and restaurants. Had a Lakeview King Suite - gorgeous and the view from the 8th floor overlooking Michigan Avenue and out onto Grant Park and Buckingham Fountain was amazing. Paid a little over $320 for the two nights and it was worth it.",N

4737,"dare I say orgasmic? not so much on the sexual sense but rather on the sense of that intimate peak between two people, the breaths intertwined, souls lost into each other. yes, I know this is not a playboy forum and I don't expect it to play out as such, but, the conversation. Is rather, titillating, arousing, intense. A mental foreplay, that unfortunately leaves me wanting more. Yet, well worth the while, you are best served to leave this bar for your last call. Yes I know, some clown bragged about mimi, mimi this, mimi that, no. SUSIE, this displaced blond from california, with dreams in her eyes, emotions on her shoulders will engage you in your best drunken whimsical best. No matter your sense of being, drunk, stupidly drunk, saying what we believe to be golden wisps of of wisdom to anyone that would hear our sprawl, but instead of tallying us as another drunken drunk, Suzy entertains our inner demons, our hidden poets, our honest child, whatever it is that lurks in our drunken being, suzy nurtures that spirit. Where others may pass us by as silly or funny, archaic, Suzy will push us, see where our drunken dialogue leads us. Banter us, even. I hit alot of bars today, wanted to lay waste to chicago before I left, glad I saved last call to this little gem. Mimi this, mimi that. bah,  humbug Suzy rocks. drink up, hit this bar. This little blond from california is rather spicy.",Y

During our two day stay at Hard Rock, to satisfy our midnight craving and thirst my boyfriend and I wanted to check out what's in the mini bar and the drawers but nothing really caught our interest so we decided to head out in stead.

What the heck is that??? I think that's kind of absurd.",N

696,"We LOVE this hotel.  Gorgeous, modern room, the absolutely perfect location in the city.... ended up here by accident when an east coast snowstorm landed us in Chicago and we couldn't be happier.  Free wireless, laundry machines, super friendly staff, what more could you want?  When our flight got cancelled a second time, we had to stay longer and they extended our great rate even though we were now going to be staying over a holiday.  We were, of course, completely won over! But, yes, watch out for the heavenly scent of Garrett's popcorn hitting you right outside... we were fairly obsessed with getting some our entire visit!",N
4988,"This place is old and a borderline 3 star hotel. Beds are lumpy, sheets are rough, walls are thin, and the bathrooms need to be renovated. On the plus side the service exceeds some 4 or 5 star hotels I've stayed at. Everyone from the front desk guy in the middle of the night to the concierge to the service lady to the shuttle driver were super friendly and helpful. If this is your first visit to Chicago I highly recommend this place as the staff will definitely make your visit enjoyable. I rarely stay at a hotel twice but I'll be staying here on my next visit.",Y
4455,"I went to a wedding reception at the Palmer House and the Empire room was the perfect setting.  It's old school with black and gold decor and it's just beautiful.  Elegant and very fun.   My one complaint was that the food was pretty bland - which I guess is to be expected when you have 200 people eating steak and chicken at the same time.  The initial course - butternut squash soup was awesome and it sort of went downhill from there.  Don't get me wrong, it was still plated beautifully and it tasted ok, it just wasn't awesome.  And the cake was way too rich.  But overall, a beautiful setting for a happy event, good service, well thought out and nice presentation.",N
5231,"The Ritz Carlton Chicago doesn't compare to the other Ritz Carltons throughout the U.S. It has an older decor feel, like a Floridian sun room. It doesn't have that classy feel...and for the money, isn't that what you want? I went to a wedding here and although the main course was good, the rest was subpar and the room was a little blah. So if you're looking to stay in a nice hotel in Chicago or have a wedding downtown, consider The Peninsula, The Intercontinental or The Sofitel....my personal faves.",Y
4543,"The Palmer House was very nice to me and my compadres when were in Chi-town for the Associated Writing Program's (AWP) Conference in February. I fell in love with Chicago, probably because of how well we were taken care of here. We had one of the fancy pants suites, so we had two beds, a couch, two bathrooms, our own TV, a lot of nice things. We did not get BRAVO though, which severely hampered our ability to watch Top Chef. No matter, the complimentary breakfast and late night snacks made up for it. All the cranberry juice I could drink! The location is wonderful, in the downtown of Chicago, just a short distance from The Art Institute of Chicago Museum. I am certain there are cheaper places, but I really liked where we were.",N
5807,I spent some time at the Milshire a year ago. Great deal and great location. The cheapest room is $28 a night and it's literally steps from the blue line (Logan Square stop). Friendly and cooperative staff. People may complain about the conditions (and they're partly right)...but thats why the hotel is so cheap. Also great for nostalgia lovers...real old feel to the place.,Y
4410,"I stayed in a room with double queens. The room itself was big and had 2 closets.  The bathroom was tiny! You could barely close the door without getting stuck between the door and the toilet, haha. The rooms were always clean when we returned, with fresh towels.  One time, though, we came back and our bathroom didn't look clean.  Turns out, the toilet stopped up.  My mom called the front desk who immediately sent Maintenance.  He knocked on our door within 5 minutes, fixed the toilet in 5 minutes. 5 minutes later housekeeping knocked on our door, apologized about the mess and the toilet and cleaned our bathroom.  5 stars for maintenance/housekeeping! This place is already on the expensive side and everything else was an additional charge (for a nominal fee). Can't they just say the nominal fee is going to be an arm and a leg? I had every intention to workout at the fitness center until I saw that you had to pay a nominal fee to get in the there. We decided to try out the hotel.  And I had an expedia ticket of $10 off a night.  We weren't impressed enough to return. Convenient phone/tv checkout to avoid the front desk. Starbucks at the street level. Door men who look fancy but don't really do much.",N

Sometimes I didn't want to leave the bed! The location was also perfect. It was so central to everything, we were able to walk everywhere with ease. Thanks to the other Yelp reviews for making sure we booked at the James. The cleaning staff was amazing. After a long day of touristy stuff with my partner we'd always come back to a clean room! The room was the perfect size for two people and we even had a gorgeous view! The staff was always accommodating, setting us up on tours, recommending which place to go and always hailing a cab for us! The rate of the hotel was actually pretty decent. Plus, FREE WiFi! Loved the James Hotel and will most definitely be back!",N

4868,"I'm going out on a limb to give it three, as the hotel has potential.  It needs some reinvestment and better help.I don't know if the housekeeping and food service has to do with the strike, but I suspect not.  I stayed there in 1984 when it was the Americana Congress, and it was a little tired and dingy back then.  I don't expect a posh resort, especially at the price point of Congress. If it were up to its full potential, I would have to pay two or three times the rate, as you might expect to pay for a room in the Gold Coast or on the river.  But at the minimum, it is in need of new carpeting and better housekeeping.  I didn't feel comfortable walking anywhere in the room bare-foot.  The complimentary breakfast was mediocre, and the food servers were friendly but not terribly professional or efficient.   On a positive note, the location is great for tourists.  Bus lines, taxis and trains are all within easy walking distance, and it's right in the middle of the great museums and parks.  I would say it's a good location for the beginner who would like to see the more popular attractions, just bring flip-flops and spend the extra money and have your breakfast in a cafe nearby.I would not rule out the possibility of staying there again, but if I can find a comparable rate for a place in a geographically desireable location, I'll look at it.",Y

I booked on Tablet & got some nice perks like 10am check in & 4pm check out so felt like I really got money's worth by being there a full 1.5 days.  Didn't try the complimentary breakfast, but it's a nice plus, right? Best part was when I came back to the room one night totally hammered I wasn't even tempted to break into all the amazing looking snacks because there were 2 chocolate covered fortune cookies waiting on my pillow.  Bonus! Note: if you share a room, make sure it's with a significant other: the shower is a glass panel open to the entire room.",N

It wasn't an issue for me but just be aware if you plan on staying here!,N

It only took us about 5 minutes by cab to get to our appointment on Jeweler's Row to select a center diamond for our engagement ring. The best part is that we had reserved a city view room, but got a regular view. They were sorry for the inconvience and took $20+ dollars off a night. We will be going back! A great hotel at a great price. We have decided that this is our offical hotel.",N

The lobby is impressive but really, that's about it -- and who cares -- want to eat in the cool center dining section surrounded by the reflecting pool and TV screens? I've never seen it open any hour of the day any of the three times I've been there -- they close it off and seat people off to the side. Other bonuses? This time our room came without toilet paper. Which is almost similar to how it doesn't come with free WiFi -- both are basic necessities. I planned for the lack of Internet access and left my laptop at home and just used my iPhone but its still annoying. The staff is friendly (as well they should be) but the rooms are in dire need of updating.",N

Literally, she stayed in the room THE ENTIRE TIME.  She absolutely loved this place.  She did not want to leave.  I finally convinced her to at least meet some friends for dinner one night so she came out for a couple hours for dinner, but that's it.  I have to admit, the bed was extremely comfortable.  I should probably have written a bad review since my wife chose the hotel over joining me at the football game - the whole reason we went to Chicago!",Y

During my stay there we could hear every other guest flushing there toilets and closing there doors. We went to bed to these sounds and was awaken to the flushing of the toilets all night long. When we went out for dinner the next night we asked a staff member if they would make sure that our bed was made while we were out and guess what it was not. So the Allerton hotel was not a great experience for our celebration. Gail",Y
3639,Stayed at this hotel for 3 days for the neocon event. It is right at Michigan ave and close by Lake Michigan. It is a really nice walk from the CTA station and close by the bus transit. I enjoy staying in the hotel because they upgrade our room to Family room with 2 bathroom ( really awesome) . The bed sheets are clean and there are 2 TVs. The front desk is really friendly and we even have a limo ride to the gangster tour for free. You just need to ask them. I didn't have a chance to try the high tea because it costs around $30 per perosn. it it too much for me. The lounge is really fancy and you actually need to dress nice to be able to fit in to the area.,N
5821,"This Marriott could be described easily: simple. There wasn't anything that stood out about this Marriott as great or awful (except Chicago traffic- zing!).It was comfortable during my stay, and my only two complaints were that my Platinum upgrade was WEAK and that valet parking is required. That's probably to keep unauthorized people parking there though.I wouldn't go out of my way to stay here, but I would again if my business was close by.",Y
750,"Like the previous reviewer, I too was here for a one day conference.  I am giving it a 3 only because I did not stay in a room.  It seemed like a nice hotel with a good location.  We were on floor 16 in a conference room all day.  It was a bright room, with decent views.  The room had a lot of very nice things set up for us, including soda, coffee, and tee service, mints, pens, and paper.  The chairs were comfortable, which is important for all day meetings like this.  They also served lunch, which I thought was great.  Caesar and caprese salad, sandwiches, and soup.  The server was friendly, and they kept everything clean.",N
1562,"I love this hotel -- even though the first time I stayed here, I rolled off the bus, hungover and half-awake into a very dark lobby and couldn't find the right elevator to get to my room... It's a cute boutique hotel on Wacker on the South side of the river, but close enough to everything downtown (Miracle Mile... Navy Pier, blahblahblah).  It's also in close proximity to the El so getting to Northern neighborhoods (i.e. Wrigleyville, Boystown -- Halstead) is easy enough.",N
2238,"i stayed at this hotel a couple weekends ago with my family (who were in town visiting)... my mom thought she would splurge for a nice hotel on michigan ave to make their visit extra special.  she bragged that she found us a four and a HALF star hotel- fancy from where i come from. we got in the room- bleh. the a/c barely cooled the room on a warm/not even hot summer day. bathroom was a little outdated and 'used'... not the cleanest ive ever seen.  and the staff- like robots. location is great, yes, but there are cheaper and nicer hotels in the city.",N
3021,"I'd been wanting to stay at a W hotel for quite some time and finally got my chance while visiting Chicago. As with any hotel there are pros and cons...pros: location, Bliss bathroom products were fabulous, beds and bedding were very nice (my friend thought the pillows were too soft which i agreed but didn't really mind), quiet and comfortable rooms, room decor was nice, staff was super helpful and fun cons: having to leave a deposit locked out of my account for incidentals (puts a damper on your vacation even before it starts) btw the reservation was prepaid so don't know what that was about, the car service is great if you can schedule it which was hard, having to pay for wifi when really in this day and age it's just plain greedy of them but since i needed it i had to pay for it (smh). overall i liked the hotel was glad i got to stay there i just need to remember to have plenty of money in my account for the 'incidentals' hold",N
1669,"I came for a training and stayed 2 nights. The food that they catered was semi decent but nothing mind blowing, but that could have been because of the menu the facilitators chose. The decor in the lobby is funky/retro/neat but the rooms were tiny!. There was barely any space to pass between the dresser and the bed. Also the bathroom doors weren't real doors, they were more like shutters. And as others have complained, you can hear everything that's happening in the hallways and the rooms next to you.",N
3537,"For the price, this hotel is up to par. It is in a great location in Downtown, Chicago. You can either walk or take mass transportation to any of the spots in the city. The beds are the most comfortable I have slept on in a hotel room, hands down. The hotel has a rooftop pool on the 40th floor with spectacular views of the city. The pool was not all that impressive but the view made up for it. There is even a bar in the hotel that had Trivia Night on Tuesdays. We didn't make it to Trivia but the idea is always fun! If you are looking for a hotel in the mid-100s price range, I recommend this one.",N
2929,"Located just steps from the river and the major attractions, This hotel is in the perfect spot for Chicago newbies and lovers alike. Prices are reasonable, of course the valet will kill you, but who needs a car in Chicago. The L is right around the corner and trains of cabs are readily available. Book early to keep the rates reasonable, Play on the Microsoft table in the lobby if you get a chance. The Burger bar on the first floor is a neat place to grab a great burger and watch the river traffic if the weather is nice. The coffee bar also has some great cocktails and small bites. Salud!",N
5054,"Awesome hotel. Location is fantastic...there is shopping, restaurants, train lines & bus lines all around. The rooms are huge, breakfast is really good & the staff is amazing. One of my favorite places in Chicago.",Y
2744,"It's not what it's all cracked up to be and for the price, I was expecting a lot more than what I got. I know I might be on my own, but hear me out-- the room was really tiny, like NYC tiny, and it smelled like cigarette smoke as soon as we opened the door. Now let's start there--before I opened the door. I went to the front desk and checked in, went up stairs to my room, which was not the room number they told me, it was a converted conference room of some sort that they didn't even bother to change the name to a number. I proceeded to call the front desk and let them know that my room did not exist, which is when they finally told me it was actually called ""study number 1"". Went to put my key card in and did not work, so I tried a few other times before I finally gave up and called the front desk again. They told me to try again in a couple of minutes and if it didn't work, to go downstairs and get a new card. Of course, I had to go and get a new card. So I go downstairs and wait in what seems like the longest line (which I know wasn't their fault but I was just annoyed) then got a new card and headed back upstairs. Guess what? It DOESN'T WORK... AGAIN! I call the front desk again and get an answer by an equally annoyed front desk person, who tells me that I must be doing something wrong because the room key works. How rude! Finally, a very nice employee comes in and tries to use my key, which does not work (thankyouverymuch front desk girl). He got it opened with his key and had to get me a copy similar to his key for the remainder of my stay. That same night I was getting ready for an event and had my itunes on while chatting with a co-worker, when I was interrupted by the concierge because ""people were complaining about the noise level""--ARE YOU KIDDING ME? What kind of dorm room/church retreat twilight zone was I in? I turned it off... I will give this place 3 stars only because of their location--it's in the middle of where everyone wants to be and all the shopping. Maybe next time James Hotel.",N
1310,"The hotel staff are very hospitable, I love the fact that this hotel is pet friendly & the bar is lovely but every time I stay here I feel like something is missing.  I cannot figure it out!   The people are fantastic, the workout room is spacious/nice & the spa is small but it works.",N
5016,"Not worth the price, even a little bit.A week prior to scheduled check-in, receiving an email for a room upgrade and accepting, of course, upon arrival, nobody knows about it. Typical. After nobody was doing anything about it, I notified them of this stay's review will be posted on the newly-developing TheChicagoCritic . Com, all of a sudden they figured out the problem and even offered an early check-in. Too little, Too late.Very small room with 2 queens instead of the ""Select King"" I was supposed to have. Windows didnt open, TV took forever to change channels and the bathroom fan was not controllable.The faboulous Lodge Net system that every hotel in the world uses for ease of checkout for guests, well there was no check out feature.This shit hole couldn't hold a candle to the Las Vegas Hard Rock!",Y
4775,"I booked this hotel through http://Hotwire.com at a rate of $81 a night when I traveled to Chicago for the weekend. For this price, everything was great. The staff was incredibly nice and the hotel lobby is really pretty. The room was really quiet and I had no trouble sleeping. Additionally, the location is really convenient.However, if you are going to pay full fare, I recommend making your reservation elsewhere. The room and bathroom wereTINY and the tube TV was from 1992. In this day and age, every hotel should have wireless internet, but at the Palmer House Hilton we had to go downstairs and get a ""wireless tower"" at the bargain price of $15/day. We had breakfast at the hotel restuarant and it was just ok. If you are short on time, I recommend going downstairs to the corner bakery and having breakfast there instead. If you have time, then it is definitely worth it to make the trek to Tempo!I recommend this hotel if you find a great deal, but otherwise it is worth it to stay somewhere a little more updated.",Y
3618,"I had a chance to stay here last night and it did live up to it's historical reputation except I think they need to do some remodeling.  And I didn't like that fact that my TV was so far away from my bed.  Or maybe it was my room since I had an upgrade and it was huge.  By the way, sorry about the picture (having my bags there) and no, it's not a murse.  It's my computer case! Anyway, not sure if I would pay another $350 a night to stay there although it's conveniently located.  I just don't think it was worth it.   Nonetheless, it was a good experience.",N
236,"BIG FAN of this hotel.  Super close to EVERYTHING.  In walking distance to Michigan Ave food and shops.  3 minutes from the Red Line.  3 minutes from the little Irish-bar area.  Very friendly staff - the airlines threw our 3.4 oz toothpaste away and we got a new tube quickly.  We got lucky with an amazing view, as they put us on the 11th floor overlooking the city.  The rooms are a bit small, but it wasn't a big deal at all for us, since we spent all our time out and about in the city.  And I love any place that has FREE WiFi.  Many many thanks for not nickel and diming people. For anyone looking for a great hotel, close to everything - Hotel Indigo is definitely a good one.  I'd stay here again on my next visit.",N
1442,"Simply beautiful!  Located in the heart of the windy city, Omni Hotel offers top notch singular service.  Quick and simple check in and the rooms are quaint. The views are incredible, reminds of the couples retreat movie quote: ""It looks like a screen saver."" The view of Sears tower up close and personal, I had a take a moment and just soak in the view.  Don't forget to join the select guest program for free wifi~!! Room:  A Cleanness: A Overall: A ps. Don't forget to try Cafe 676 and their PB & J Waffle Panini *trust me its GOOD""",N
2254,"This was a top contender for our wedding.  The ballrooms are beautiful.  The packages were definitely on the high end of our budget but they were not  too outrageous as far as downtown hotel wedding package rates go...  We worked with Chris and thought he was very good - friendly, responsive - a good salesman.  The main reason we did  not select this hotel for our wedding was that the room rates were too high for the dates we were looking at.  At least half of our guests are coming in from out of town so we needed to find room rates that were a bit more affordable.  Otherwise - a great spot!",N
493,"I'm usually not a fan of the big conglomerate hotel chains and much prefer the smaller local places... but when i looked it seemed that this was the most bang for the buck.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The hotel has an updated style and a modern feel.  The check in was a little confusing to me, but that's probably b/c i live in a place that doesn't normally have basements and such.   The hotel lobby has a modern water - statue thing that was pretty neat looking till my bf said that it resembled an urinal... uhm, there goes that modern feel!  lol.  nevertheless, my initial take was that the lobby was clean and comfortable. The suites are well maintained and clean.  The bathroom was updated with granite counters; unfortunately, they didn't update the whole thing and the wall paper was peeling a little, but it wasn't a huge deal.  Otherwise, the bathroom was fine. Love that they had a microwave in the room, esp. with all those HUGE Chicagan portions!   Really loved that they have a managers reception with free drinks and snacks at 5:30 - 7:30.  Helped me finish some reports before i starved to death before dinner!   The gym was ok, on the small side, but it had most of the equipment one needs.  The pool was a lap pool, but there were kids in the pool that didn't treat it as such, so i didn't try it out. Breakfast was fast, lots of choices.  Overall, a great location, great price and good service.  Only thing keeping from the 5 star rating was that the business center was incredibly small (3 computers, one printer) and they charge for internet which i think is ludicrous in any hotel!",N
1283,"WOW. Best hotel I've ever stayed at. I tend to like modern / minimalist hotels and while the Ritz wasn't that it struck a nice balance between old elegance and modern. The service was PHENOMENAL. The staff were what tipped the scale. Everyone was friendly and helpful. They help elevators open for you. Loved turn down service. Concierge was friendly when I asked for advice on places to eat. Facilities were great (nice pool and lobby). Location was convenient. The views facing lake Michigan were awesome. Loved that you could get your shoes shines for free by leaving them in a bag. My girlfriend joked that if they could legally walk you to the bathroom and hold your hand they would. It was a joke but exemplary of the extent to which they value customer service. Everything just came together. Very impressed. Video: View from our room: http://www.flickr.com/ph... Also, was very happy with the free wireless ( wifi ). It was slow but if that bothers you it is only $10 a day for faster wireless.",N
1248,"My #3 choice for hotels in Chicago, its a bit out of the city but about 5 mins of cab ride to the central heart, when I usually work at our Sears Towers offices.",N
2810,"For a guys' weekend this is a great choice. You have plenty of room, you have a sleeping area that can be closed out from the sitting area that has your minbar area and flat screen tv, you have your complimentary buffet breakfast with made-to-order eggs/omelette station, you have your complimentary manager's reception of drinks and snacks, and you have complimentary internet use in a shared area to check out that there is local Whole Foods Festival with Cracker being the main act. What more can you want? It's also only one block away from the Grand rail station and within walking distance to many tourist destinations (i.e. Navy Pier, Millenium Park, Chicago River, etc.).",N
20,"My husband and I came to Chicago for a week and decided to stay here. The price was right and it's in a very convenient neighborhood. Yes, it's old and small but we had a good time here. We stayed in a room with one queen bed and it was more spacious than I thought it would be. You could tell one wall had some water damage at one time, but everything was clean and everything worked. I didn't deal with the staff besides checking in and out, but the people I did speak with were friendly. There weren't a ton of amenities but I didn't come to Chicago to hang out in my hotel room. The train is only a few blocks away and you're surrounded by tons of places to go shopping. I would definitely stay here again.",N
3714,"This Hotel service and staff is hands down UNMATCHED.  I met a friend in the city that I hadn't seen in some time. After we shopped and ate it was very late and while we both live in the suburbs we decided to get a room in the city and continue the fun. She suggested the Drake having been there for the tea room only days before..and while I could care less about the tea room I wanted a High End upscale room for the night. First of all this Hotel is Dated, it reminded me of ""old Chicago"" almost as if you stepped back in time. These staff members and servers were beyond friendly and helpful to her and I.  Our room was right around 300 for the night and honestly worth every cent. King sized bed two beautiful bathrooms and elite room service. Alot of wannabe hotels claim to be classy and yet their staff shows otherwise. I plan on going back and staying for fun in the future. Well worth the money.",N
3505,"Used a Groupon and had a King Suite for three nights - spacious by city standards. Very clean & great service - needed extra towels & they arrived within minutes. Room service breakfast reasonably priced, delivered quickly & tasty. Bar area cozy with a very good $5 menu - the chicken quesadilla was excellent! A terrific location for shopping & a nice long walk to Navy Pier. Wi-fi was included with the Groupon & reception was adequate.",N
762,"I was in a wedding at the 4 seasons last weekend.  We stayed here because even at $200-$300 a night its cheaper than the 4 seasons! This hotel is very convenient, very clean, very serviceable and very forgettable.  The hotel bar is average, and the room decorations were so dull.  I mean, white linens and 2 black and white photos?  And no flat screen?  Strange. I also found the lines at check in to be long and annoying each time i needed something. That being said, there are beautiful flower arrangements and the seating in the lobby is generous and well appointed.  They should have hired the lobby decorator to do the rooms as well!",N
2561,"I had a great experience planning and throwing a party at victor so I'm a huge fan.  I held an event here for about 20ish people on a Friday night, and the hostess was extremely helpful in making sure everyone in our party got in quickly and free (this is huge, as our ratio of guys:girls in the group was like 3:1). It was a surprise birthday, and the surprise part couldn't have gone smoother thanks to the staff on hand (headed by Ruth!).  We got 4 bottles over the course of the night and took up most of the back red room, and were given 2 wait staff members to serve the group's needs, which they did so well!   And really, despite the complaints by other yelpers, I liked the industrial feel of the place, despite the small # of restrooms and pictures of fashion models & nude models on the wall.   So what if the servers come back every five minutes?  I like to feel waited on when I'm shelling out for a big group and probably do need some help that often :o)  I paid zero attention to the crowd at the place, but that doesn't matter too much to me when i'm out with friends to celebrate.   Bottom line: if you throw a party here, they will serve you well.  beyond that, you're better off checking out the other reviews",N
3838,"Ah, Dana Hotel, home sweet home for a few days. Overall, I'm most certainly a fan, but with a few caveats or odd design things that I wish someone had thought about (maybe they did?) in the design of the rooms. Pluses: + Clean and modern decor that still didn't feel sterile or cold. + Turn-down service with chocolate-covered fortune cookies (...and they filled my ice bucket, too?!  Is that normal or did someone think I was going to have a party in my room?!) + Big comfy beds with smooshy comforters + Cool iPod docking stations with pretty great quality speakers + Flat-screen TVs with non-confusing remotes + Exceedingly friendly and helpful staff + A nice hotel bar on the ground floor + 24 hr room service was available if you needed it (though there is a 7-11 located across the street if you are looking for cheaper late-night snacks). +Free wifi +Mini-business center with 2 computers and a printer +Great towels!  I don't know why this should be such a big deal, but it IS.  sometimes even the nicest hotel have those super-scratchy small-ish towels.  These were bath-sheet size and so soft you wanted to nuzzle 'em. Minuses/Funny things: - No matter how many hotels do this, I still find it slightly jarring to check in on the 2nd floor -- although the 2 elevator system was a little wacky, that probably does help narrow down on the confusion, though... - The rainwater shower was cool, but it was also.... literally, cool. Because there's no way to close off the shower from the rest of the bathroom (there's just a partial class divider), it can feel a lil' drafty -The walls seem pretty thin. The funny part is that one of the loudest recurrent noises you might notice is that of the neighbor's curtains going up or down.  Considering that the walls are all glass, this is bound to happen pretty often! Also...ask for a room way from the elevator, for sure. Otherwise, you may be hearing lots of ""ding, ding, ding"" while trying to sleep. - Because of the walls of glass and the way the shower and bathroom are set up, you'll need to close at least one set of curtains before showering or using the bathroom. It's a little odd to think that if someone didn't notice that, they would immediately be exposing themself in multiple vulnerable states. I didn't get to visit the upstairs bar/lounge, but wish I'd had a chance. I also would have liked to try a spa service or two but alas, I'm trying to save a little money.   Considering my overall experience, I'd be happy to stay here again next time I'm in Chicago (and not staying with friends or family) and hopefully check it out, along with a massage, perhaps!",N
5390,This place is dirty. The bed was terrible and the hotel staff was unhelpful when the room next to us was loud and obnoxious until 3AM. This place needs a major upgrade. There are so many other nice places to stay in Chicago. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.,Y
4650,"For a quick trip down to Chicago for the night Hotel Felix was perfect! When I was having issues with Priceline, the staff at Hotel Felix were beyond accommodating, even called Priceline with me on the line to help solve the problem. My first impression was the staff going above and beyond for me as their customer and set a great tone. The reviews are right, the rooms are small. This is not a luxury suite by any means. It's a small space but we weren't staying long and with just the two of us, it was plenty of room for us and our stuff. I wouldn't stay here for an extended amount of time, but for a weekend trip - the space is plenty! The best part about the hotel was the location - we were within walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go.",N

The hotel is located at a fantastic location right near Merchandise Mart, which is a HUGE building of grand architectural design, as well as most of Chicago. This hotel is over the Chicago SUN newspaper and has SUPER FANTASTIC VIEWS of the city, river, and we got a small glimpse of Lake Michigan as well. The hotel is attached to the Mart as well as small Mall which is convenient. It is centrally located to Michigan Ave for shopping the local MBTA (T, Tube, Metro, etc), and the the river tours. Not really that many gracious amenities here. No room service, no gym, and a boring evening after hours lobby. The View here is worth over a million dollars from every side. I like to face the river or the lake. Just spectacular.",N

2760,"I was fortunate enough to stay a night at the James last week. And I can't wait to go back! The James Hotel is the perfect balance between modern ""chic-ness"" and the comfort of home. When you walk in or out of the building, someone greets you or bids farewell--and that doesn't happen much in a city of this size! The rooms are super comfy--the beds are soft, there's no ""hotel"" signage or advertisements, and the dimmer switches throughout really set the mood. The James would be a GREAT place to have a corporate party, engagement party or anything involving food, drinks and lots of people. I attended a private party there during my stay and they treated us so well--everyone was really surprised. The next morning we ate breakfast in the David Burke Primehouse, and I've got two words for you: Banana Pancakes. The James is perfect for the next generation: its got all the frills of the Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton minus the uptight, stuffy attitude. Really cool. 5 Stars.",N

Knickerbocker: go read a book on the Four Season's up the street at Borders and take some tips on customer service.",N
4986,"This is a very nice hotel with a very friendly and courteous staff.  We stayed in a king suite.  The bdrm was very large, the living rm was even larger and both rooms overlooked the shoreline, a park, and major attractions.  We liked everything about the hotel except the very small bthrm, which was quite difficult to maneuver in and out.  The pool and gym were nice, housekeeping was okay but it wasn't until 5pm when they got to our room on the 9th fl.  You can catch the bus on both sides of the street in front of the hotel, and catch the subway around the corner - two blocks.  The Essex Inn is away from the crowds of North Michigan Ave, yet convenient to major attractions along the Mag Mile.  We will most certainly return here.  Oh, there was something going on EVERY night at the park.  A couple of bands performed two nights, there was Salsa instruction another night.  Quite lively and entertaining.Overall, the hotel was nice but a bit pricey for the outdated decor.  We ate at the Inn's restaurant our first visit because we had to wait until after 4pm checkin for a 5pm room availability.  We arrived at 3pm!

4337,"Anyone else come here for the MUNUC conference back in high school? Good times. I have to admit that The Palmer House is my default for staycations back home, just for the nostalgia and the sheer beauty of the place. Last Christmas, my friends and I let ourselves get upsold to the Executive Floor for a weekend and it was just what we needed. I gorged myself on the breakfast, snacks, and nighttime hors'doeurves right down the hallway from our extra-large suite. Excellent. Also, bathrooms are much nicer on the Executive Floor, with dual showerheads and ambient lighting. The age of the hotel is really starting to show though, and they haven't gotten around to updating all the rooms, so it's a total crapshoot as to whether or not you get a good one. And after having stayed in both styles of rooms, the older one definitely feels...well, old, almost grandmotherly. Internet is also ridiculously expensive when free WiFi is becoming the standard. If you want a historic, gorgeous hotel, and really don't mind getting nickled and dimed here and there, this is the place for you. There really are more comfortable and higher quality hotels out there for the price, though.",N

3495,"For the price, this place is worth it. It's kind of small in comparison to say, the Avenue, but it has charm. The elevator is a tight fit, and our bathroom wasn't big at all, but the it had all the necessities and it was clean. The beds were decent and the room itself was nice-sized. The biggest perk was being so close to everything. The service was tremendous and we were treated wonderfully by the staff.",N
237,"The Hotel Indigo had a piña colada feel, with a smoothie-shop-decor, and the lobby smelled like coconut lotion. When hotwire notified me that I had made reservations for the hotel Indigo, I went to check it out on-line. The pictures scared me a little. I thought It would be too girly or cutesy for me. I was prepared to not be amused by this hotel. Once I arrived, It wasn't as bad as I thought... It was kind of cheerful. The service: was ok, nothing to complaint about or rave about either. No stars there. The room was one of the smallest rooms I've had in Chicago. But it was neat, clean and had everything I really needed. Nice small room, with a small window, but for the price I paid it was ok. Loved the location. Good restaurants, shopping, and the beach are all so close. Just take Division and it takes you right to the beach. After a long night out, my friends and I came back to the hotel area and decided to go to the beach and see the sunrise before calling it a night. It was a nice thing we could do since the hotel was a few blocks away. It was a nice hotel to stay at once, but I think I saw other 'nicer' hotels around that area that I might want to try next time I visit Chicago.",N
5652,"A fine Westin with some special perks, like in-room desktop computers (with free internet), an executive snack lounge, and a sushi restaurant integrated into the lobby. Rooms are quiet and a comfortable size considering the downtown location. No problems with valet parking.",N
5502,"This is a first for me! I'm going to give a Best Western 5 stars! Now wait a minute.....Before you snub your nose read the rest of the review! Again a tiny hotel in an obscure location that does not look like much from the road! Then to have the Best Western Name on it, most folks would not give this place a second look! Well you would be sadly mistaken on this one. Ken at the front desk was great, my corporate travel department messed up the reservation and they did not have my room. Ken fixed everything with a smile and made it perfect! Thank You Ken! Then to walk into my room is when I was blown away! A suite with a living room, kitchen and bedroom very well appointed with all the modern conveniences that worked and looked great! Dishwasher, Microwave, Stove, Sink and refrigerator. Flat Screen LG 42 inch!, King Size Bed very comfortable and great bed linens and pillows! AC did not blow on my face! Love that! Then to get to the bathroom took it up even higher, beautiful appointments, Granite, two sinks, great lighting, huge modern shower with two shower heads one a rain shower, plenty of thirsty towels waiting to be used!   The bonus is I get a front row seat to the Chicago Marathon this Sunday, it runs right passed the hotel!",N
2397,"Very elegant hotel in the South Loop of Chicago, right off the Harrison subway exit on the Red Line. Very good location, with easy access public transportation. Our room was big and clean, with a wonderful view. We actually had two views, one of Lake Michigan , the other of downtown. I would request a corner room, we stayed in room 1169 if you would like to request that room. The only downfall is you have to pay an extra fee for access to the gym. It was $15/day and when I peeked in there wasn't anything spectacular. The pool is an indoor lap pool with two jacuzzi spa but it has a nice outside area where you can lay out. The service was friendly and fast and the hotel bar is fully equipped. I would definitely recommend this hotel to visitors of Chicago who want a convenient hotel. It was walking distance from Buckingham Fountain and right across Grant Park.",N
3113,"Okay, I've stayed in some pretty run-down places, but come on W! I expected much more from a 5 star hotel than a window with shutters in the bathroom, that opened into the bedroom, right next to the bed! Who designed that? Were they thinking when they did that to the room? To the bathroom? A bathroom is a sanctuary of peace and private business doing, not a place where everyone and their mothers can hear and smell (sorry people!) everything you do! I can't tell you how many times my companions and I talked about using the facilities up stairs. COME ON! W, you are not what you claim to be. Oh, and did I mention the cycling air conditioning system?  It was loud and wouldn't turn off!  I was totally uncomfortable. Ugh, never again!!!!!!!",N
4435,"The Palmer House is a pretty spectacular hotel. When I first walked into the lobby, the ceiling made me feel like I was in Las Vegas, but it a good way. My mom stayed on the Executive Level (gotta represent, son), which she loved. They have free cookies and cokes and other snackies. The best part about it is it's not supervised, so I was able to load up on all the free sweets. Made my day. The room she had was quite nice. The interesting thing was that her room had two beds and two bathrooms. I've never had a hotel room with two bathrooms. Very unusual. It turned out to be considerably convenient since her friend shared the room with her. I am told the price of the room was very reasonable. It's right in the heart of downtown. You can't really ask for me. Why my mom loves this hotel so much? It's connected to the Croc Store on State St.",N
4062,"I wouldn't normally give a giant, convention-crazed mega hotel a 5 star review, but the Regency Hyatt gets one and here is why: So in order to get to the incredibly small regional airport that services my hometown - I must inevitably fly through one of 4 cities: Dallas, Cincinnati, Atlanta or Chicago. I try to avoid Chicago at all costs. O'Hare is a nightmare and something ALWAYS goes wrong when I fly through. Well this trip was no different. One canceled flight later, I was on my way to the Regency Hyatt in the Loop - I mean, come on, I'm not going to stay at the airport. I got the room at an absolute steal on Priceline (the airlines don't pay for anything nowadays - but that is another review). When I arrived I was dubious to say the least. This place is huge - frickin HUGE. I prefer the boutique route, but whatever it was cheap and I was only going to be there one night. As I checked in, I made small talk with the desk attendant, Gabrielle. I was just talking about my flight being canceled and the nightmare of getting downtown on public transportation because of construction, etc. Not really bitching - just talking. Well - the fabulous Gabrielle - informed me that she was upgrading me to a suite and then proceeded to give me a voucher for free room service and 2 free drinks in the bar! I told her that was absolutely not necessary, but she insisted. The suite was phenomenal with a beautiful view of the river on one side and the lake on the other - did I mention it was a corner suite? :) That is really some amazing service. Next time I'm in Chicago, I will stay again. thanks, Gabrielle!",N
4372,"I reviewed my reviews and can't believe I'd never reviewed this place.  This is my favorite place to stay in Chicago.   It is absolutely stately.  I feel like I'm staying with ""history and elegance"" every time I'm here.  I get a nice corporate rate.  You can't beat the location, so close to the El.  The other reviews do a nice job of describing the beauty. Finally, please pay attention to this simple tip: Get your Hilton Honors number before you stay here and be sure you present it before you check in, everytime.  The points add up quick in a high dollar place like this.  Once you get Diamond status, you are comp'd to the Executive Level, where you get free breakfast and evening hors d'oeuvres.  You get your own elevator (down stairs) that goes express to the upper levels.  The view of the lake is phenomenal from the breakfast room. This is a grande dame from another era, still breathing life into the Loop.  Stay here once, regardless of the cost.",N
4955,"Outstanding Hotel! Our first contact with Chicago and its people was the Avenue Hotel. My girlfriends and I met in Chicago for a weekend getaway and everyone was so kind, helpful, and pleasant from the moment you entered the door.  They definitely gave one the feeling you were their main concern. We were all so hungry when we arrived and didn't really know what direction to walk. We asked the first person we saw which happened to be the Bellman, what he suggested.  Without hesitation he got us a map and highlighted a few places and sent us on our way.  We couldn't have asked for more. The hotel is beautiful. Great location for walking if you don't mind the frigid air, but it was a nice change.  Shopping, museums, restaurants, they were all so close we didn't' even need to rent a car.  However at one point the Taxi Cab did feel warm and inviting.  The rooms were very nice and comfortable with a hip, contemporary feel and awesome beds. I don't remember the last time I slept that good in a hotel. There was a lot going on at night and the Sky Lounge at the top of the hotel was a perfect way to end our evenings, what a view!  It was a happy place. We would love to return for another Girls Weekend in Chicago.  Thank you Avenue Hotel!",Y
4405,"I stayed here last summer after booking a room for $89 on Hotwire.  I've come to be a little wary of using Hotwire for booking nice city hotels, as you occasionally get crammed into the tiniest room on site - but in this case, they offered me an upgrade to the executive floor for $20 or $30 and I jumped all over that.  For the small cost of an upgrade, you get to ride the fancy schmancy executive elevator and have free snacks, sodas, and appetizers in the evening.  It was money well spent.   Overall, the hotel is stunning.  It's one of those grand old hotels where the building is sturdy and glamorous, even if a few things seem slightly outdated.  The service was great and I didn't notice any significant amount of noise during the stay. The only minor flaw in the whole experience was the breakfast.  It was fairly pricey given the quality of food served, but it was still good - and the atmosphere of their restaurant is very opulent, too.   Although I love sampling lots of different hotels in every city I visit, I would definitely return to the Palmer House on a future trip.",N
266,"We booked through Hotwire and got an amazing deal on a suite with a full kitchen, sitting room, dining area and most importantly for traveling with family, a real wall and door to the bedroom.  The living room was so spacious, we even had several local friends over for drinks before going out, or down as we first stopped at their wonderful little wine bar and bruschetta place in the basement.   They are updating the rooms but if the grandma style decor (China press with blue china monkey) is part of the low price we had no problems.  The staff was really nice and helpful with old school service like bell hops and door men.",N
5783,This is the perfect place to stay if you are visiting someone who goes to UIC or lives/works in the medical district!  You know its a nice hotel because its a Marriott and they have an all you can eat pasta special for lunch everyday!,N
2294,"Well if you looking for clean motel with a nice lobby bar then this is your place, but you might have got that for a lot cheaper at a Motel 6. Look here is the story if you are any type of a business person don't expect to have WiFi in your room only in the lobby. Come on folks it is 2011, which resulted in me trying to use my Verizon Cell phone hot spot which was also horrible. Let see if that fails maybe I can watch a little TV, woops again no HD TV signel, no menu on the remote this can't be it is 2011. So if you want and expensive place to stay with no electronic abilities then this is your place.",N

309,I am not sure that the people who wrote the four and five star reviews of City Suites actually stayed here. I will say that the staff is exceedingly friendly and helpful and that the 24 hour coffee in the lobby/living room is nice... But you go to a hotel to sleep. And at this hotel sleep is hard to come by. The main problem is noise.  The walls are thin enough you can hear your next door neighbors TV.  The ceiling creaks from the upstairs occupant just walking around.  And I had the misfortune of staying in the room opposite the elevator so every time the doors creaked open you felt as if people were coming into the room.   I give one star for service... one star for cleanliness... but the stars for comfortable and a good nights sleep I have to withhold.,N
1211,"easy to get to, great landscaping, amazing conference rooms...this was the best manditory workshop ive ever been to, because this building and its staff were so great. at lunch time...after i copped an extra diet coke with lime and cup of ice...i scooted down to the concierge and asked him where i could find a mailbox. he pointed to somewhere on a nearby wall. i then asked some follow up questions to insure that the postmistress was really going to come and get me envelope. he assured me they would. but i wasnt convinced. so he took the envelope and tucked it in his breastpocket and then said he would hand deliver it to the postmistress for me. alls i know is....the bank got the check and i got to keep my condo. yessss!",N
3067,"The hotel is decent: nice decor, comfortable rooms, beautiful view.  Unfortunately the staff is rude and incompetent. In short: I paid for a room filled with flowers, they did not deliver the flowers.  The next morning they promised to refund my money and send a make-up bouquet to my wife.  A month later, after three reminders, they sent the bouquet (with a blank card).  A week after that their staff said everything was my fault.  They have still not refunded my money.  My credit card did the dirty work and charged back the flowers. Again: nice hotel, just avoid the concierge.",N
5061,"This is a cute smaller hotel in downtown. The staff is very courteous and pleasant. Everyone from the doorman to the receptionists seem to be very genuine. Most of my experience is with their banquet facility on the 2nd floor. It is a very nice space. Didn't end up spending any time in any of the rooms, but if I ever had a need I would definitely consider James Hotel.",Y
4228,"Oh, Hyatt Regency Chicago. How your Lost and Found department has tainted my review so. I attended the NYE 2009 bash at the hotel and let me tell you, it was a bash and a half. I went with a bunch of friends and we ended up getting three rooms total and all of the rooms were incredibly nice, big flat screens, ipod docks, granite counters in the bathroom, great views, etc. The party allegedly had 2000 people attending but the Hyatt was definitely ready for everyone, checking in was a breeze, and they gave us our three rooms all on the same floor, which was a total perk. The party was a blast - the top level was the band and it had lots of light, and the second level was much more dark, clubby, and had a DJ. I would HIGHLY recommend if you attend the shindig next year to get to the party as early as you can because finding seats to eat was a struggle. Partially because we had a large group but that was pretty much the only negative for the party. You occasionally had to wait a long time for a drink but almost every bartender handed them out two at a time and they were all strong. The party was a huge success, the hotel was beautiful, and everyone had a great time. HOWEVER - upon checking out the next day and heading back to the burbs, I realized that I had left something in the room. Right around the same time, my friend called and told me she had left something in her room too. OK partially our faults because hey, check and make sure you have all your stuff. So I called and talked to the Lost and Found department and they told me they'd look for it and get back to me. They didn't get back to me. I called the next day. They said they still hadn't found it but that doesn't mean that it had not shown up. My friend stopped by the next day. They didn't have either thing. I have called about every other day for almost two weeks now and neither of our items have shown up. Their voice mail message says they will call you back in 24 hours and I've probably left four messages and gotten one call back. I just think it's insane that they have a designated lost and found department ... employees whose ENTIRE job is recovering guest's lost items... and they haven't found either item OR gotten back to us about our lost stuff. So that really negatively affects my overall Hyatt experience, sadly. I understand that NYE was really busy and a lot of people probably left stuff but I have called multiple times and they are well aware of me and what I am looking for.... how could they have not found either thing, almost two weeks later? Bogus. In short, the NYE party is a GREAT value but if you attend next year, MAKE SURE YOU LEAVE WITH WHAT YA BRUNG!!",N
5495,"If you should have pockets so deep or a generous corporate discount to stay in a chic boutique in the heart of the Gold Coast, you can do no wrong by selecting the Sutton Place Hotel.  Located at the corner of Rush and Bellevue and across the street from some of the best Chicago restaurants where the elite and upper-crust tend to frequent, the Sutton Place Hotel is a dream for a business person or tourist.  The beds are incredibly comfortable featuring pillow-top mattresses and oodles of feathered pillows.  The rooms are sleek, modern, and includes Bose sound systems and flat screen TVs.  The bathroom for me is the most telling feature of a hotel.  And Sutton Place leaves no detail unturned.  Love the onyx black granite countertops, shiny chrome fixtures, and impeccably clean rainforest-like shower head (no water stains or buildup).  The purple orchids they leave on the bed and in the bathroom are nice touches and the bird's eye view of the Gold Coast, particularly when it is evening time and the streets are lit, emotes a great vibe.  I've stayed here twice -- didn't want to leave --and I've also been here when I was in the neighborhood and very light-headed after a night out with business associates and used their  restrooms.  In all aspects, their hotel staff is most polite and courteous.  It is why to this day, I continue to recommend my guests and out-of-town business partners to stay.",N
4526,"If the rooms in this hotel matched the style and substance of the lobby, boy would this place be something. As it is, most of the rooms I've stayed in are indistinguishable from a Holiday Inn. The bars in the hotel are decent, but the concierge staff doesn't do so good - rely too much on recommending the restaurants right next to the hotel, which are less than good.",N
2652,"Where to begin. This place felt like a hotel that thinks it's all that, but in practice stinks like a wet fart.  We arrived promptly to check-in, and were told that we would have to wait for up to 2 hours before our room would be ready.  This was pretty inconvenient given the fact that we had solid plans for that evening already (dinner, concert) and really screwed up our evening mojo.  When we relayed our distaste over the delay to the concierge or whatever you call it, they offered no kind of consolation (free parking, etc.) other than 2 free drink tickets at their hotel bar.  We didn't have time to enjoy the drink because of our rush at this point. After returning from our otherwise excellent evening, we went back up to our room.  It's got this very funky design which was kinda cool, but the carpeting is this super thick red/maroon stuff that looks like it's just rife with problems that only a blacklight would reveal. The bed was pretty comfortable, minus the fact that it didn't even have a proper fitted sheet.  That's right, they just placed a sheet over the mattress, probably thinking, ""this won't be a problem as long as they don't move at all while they sleep"".  On top of that, the comforter was given the appearance of a duvet cover by sandwiching it between 2 plain sheets.  Did somebody forget to do the laundry or something? Ah, this would be a good time to mention that when we arrived back to the hotel from our evening out, we wanted to use our handy-dandy free drink tickets.  To our dismay, the bar was CLOSED.  At 11:30.  On a SATURDAY.  In CHICAGO.  Seriously? Anyway, long story short, my wife raised a s**tstorm the following morning about all this business and they covered our breakfast in the hotel restaurant - which was pretty good.  Other than that single redeeming factor, I was pretty disappointed with the entire experience.  I won't be back.",N
11,"I'm a SPG Platinum member and can't believe that Starwood even keeps this property in their portfolio.  I'm writing from the dingy room as we speak. Pro:  It was $100 for a Thursday-Sunday room in early December, when prices usually spike around the Magnificent Mile. Cons: only 1 (slow) elevator, very old and dingy decor, poor front desk service, no movies, very few electrical plugs. I could have chosen between the Hampton Inn and Tremont.  I stayed at the Hampton  a month ago and should have stayed there again.  Yes it's cheap and close to Michigan Ave, but if you are a business traveller and accustomed to SPG standards, this is not your place!",N

I would definitely recommend for groups or personal travel!",N

5484,"I am a fan of the Sutton place. I often travel back to Chicago for work and I normally stay at the Sutton Place. It is a very modern hotel with comfortable beds and the bathrooms are big. They have a nice walk in shower and a big oval tub as well. Last time, I stayed at the Sutton Place I also tried out the fitness suite, which was small but got the job done. It has 2 treadmills, elliptical, bike and a couple weight machines and free weights.  It was actually crowded in the morning hours.  The location of the Sutton place is fantastic. It located in what most people from Chicago call the ""Viagra Triangle"". It is steps away from many restaurants. My favorite place is Lou Malnati's for pizza.  I also like to stop at Mr Kites chocolate shop  to get some S'mores and Mountain Tops! I highly recommend stopping in and getting some chocolate!  Overall I enjoy the Sutton place and look forward to visiting Chicago next month.",N
991,"Really nice hotel with a very nice, accommodating staff. They were extremely helpful with early check-in and late check-out in order to meet the needs of my schedule.

Would definitely recommend Amalfi and will likely be staying there again in the near future.",N
4162,"Excellent hotel, it's close to anything related to Michigan Ave! Not far from the train, and in walk able distance to a lot of attractions. We walked from here to the Taste of Chicago, as well as up and down Michigan Ave! It's very big, I believe they have two separate towers with a really nice bar and restaurant. Check in was fast and the rooms were clean. The cleaning lady did come at an odd time, but I guess she probably started or ended with our rooms.  Elevators are a bit slow but what do you expect with the number of floors. Overall I was very happy with my stay here!",N
1108,"I stayed here in May og 09 because I got a free stay.  Yes, it was free.  My company is in the Aon Center (which is connected) and they gave all us administrative assistants a tour, lunch in the Aria restaurant and a free one night stay. Anyhow, I had a king room on the 29th floor with a park view.  The park view is high on my list of things that do not suck - I get no view at work since I don't have an exterior office.  The bed was awesome.  It was like sleeping on a puffy cloud on a warm sunshiney day in heaven. We also decided to splurge on room service.  I got a steak.  It was done the perfect shade of medium rare.  It was also crazy pricey.  $113 for my meal and my BFs meal.  However, when I called they were all ""How may I help you, Ms. Diggs""  Which I totally got a kick out of. Maybe they were being extra nice to me because of the nature of my visit and due to the fact that our companies have a deal, but they brought me up a complimentary Perrier and a fruit plate.  Not a fan of the Perrier, but the fruit was delish! I did buy some snacks and beverages at Bockwinkles (this was before the CVS was opened - it opened two weeks later) because I didn't want to pay for anything in the mini-bar, but I do expenses for a lot of travelers at my work and I knew those items would be vastly overpriced. The room was pretty big, the toilet had its own separate area from the shower and bath, and the food was good.  I have no complaints.  I'd stay there again if I came into some money or wanted to have a nice weekend with my BF on the town.",N
3230,"Let's start with the bad. Obviously there is nowhere to park in Chicago, so the fact that the Hard Rock offers valet parking (for $46 a day) sounded like a great idea. WRONG. I got my car back and there is a HUGE scratch on the side, not to mention TONS of pine sap all over my windshield and the front of my car (that took FOREVER to get off). They for sure do not take good care of your car at all. Next, the food is terrible! I ordered a Cobb salad-how can you screw this up? They did. Also, the chicken bites were full of fat. So gross. The good? GREAT location-minutes away from shopping. Also, had a really nice experience with the concierge, Zach. He helped us with restaurants, a route to run in the morning, and getting cab. Also, the elevators were very fast which was awesome. We got a corner room which was very spacious but so poorly lit! There is an entire hallway in the room with no light. All in all not a terrible hotel; this trip was my second time staying at the Hard Rock Hotel but probably will not be staying here again-the huge scratch on my car was definitely not appreciated.",N
3850,"1) Great location. A couple of blocks from the El and surrounded by restaurants and bars.  Walking distance to Rush St. and Michigan Ave. 2) Great rooms. Flat screen TV, iPod docking station, and lots of space. Loved the big shower, but the only concern might be the floor to ceiling windows looking across the way into an apartment building. Also, the see through shower to the toilet is definitely for the adventurous. 3) Most of the staff was great.....friendly, helpful, and curteous.  Only one douche works there, and unfortunately he was working the front desk on my visit. If I had avoided the foreign guy during check in I would have given 5 stars.",N
1105,"Clean room, and quiet, albeit much smaller than I expected. I kind of feel I got the overflow room.

Nice 38"" flat screen. Work desk is simple and nice with plugs and eithernet jack built into the top.The decor lamps hang awkwardly low. Bathrooms with separate tub, shower, vanity and toilet areas (almost nicer than the room!) The toilet looked like something out of a newly renovated truck stop. Dunno what that was all about, but hey, it flushed and worked. Staff is very thoughtful and prompt. Down side: room was unnecessary  drafty. Vent in the hall blows cold air. The doors aren't designed to really seal so a cold draft blows through the room. And it was 9f outside.. brrr...",N
362,"I stayed here during my last two visits to Chicago because it's consistently the best value for the location.  The rooms were clean and spacious but clearly aging.

3465,"The Allerton is an old hotel with a new look. It was redesigned in 2008. A redesign is great for changing the color palette, putting in a hip new chair, and even adding (not free) wifi. That said, walls can't be moved, and floor plans won't change. The short doorways, and single room with more hallway than bedroom are charming to me. I like when old meets new. Free wine from 4-6 is legit, and the location is ideal for just about anything. I wouldn't consider myself a hotel connoisseur, but I really liked this place. The price was right when we booked ($115 for a Friday), but once I'm in the demographic that The Allerton is marketing to I'll be willing to pay the full price. - Free wifi only in the lobby - 24 hour fitness - not the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept in, but certainly not bad.",N
2715,"The sexiest boutique hotel in town. Great location. Kiehl's products. Mini bar with Maxi bottles of booze. Sleek modern but warm, elegant rooms. If I was visiting Chicago, I wouldn't see much of the town if I stayed here...I would just stay in my room:)",N
946,"Great location, cheap as is comes. Small rooms. Missing remote from tv but not in the room long enough to care. No conditioner supplied in shower. Water is luke warm. Show drained REALLY slow. Walls are paper thin. For chicago on a budget this is ok but I have stayed better.",N

856,"I stayed here in April 2008, and it was really beautiful. I've been in many hotels throughout my life spanning from cheapies to luxe. I've also had experience in real estate, enough to know when a place is in good, clean shape and has great fixtures (I can't help but notice the little things). The ceilings were wonderfully high and the complimentary desserts in the lobby truly blew my mind. Amazing! I've paid three times the price for ""luxury"" hotels in Las Vegas that weren't even as nice as this. It is noisy if you sleep in a room beside the L train, but I stayed on the opposite side and slept peacefully. I'm coming back here some day!",N
3043,This is a very classy W hotel.  They comped me breakfast and it was delish!  I didn't rent a car....I think I either took a cab around or their shuttle??  They had a giant pillow in the shape of a plum on the bed and I slept with that cushy plum every night and wouldn't let the maid service take it away... Great place to check out the nearby shopping and music/restaurant scene...the museums from....check it out...,N
1114,"I have stayed here a number of times.  The rooms are very cool.  The restaurants/bars are more numerous than the nearby Swiss, but the in hotel restaurant Aria doesn't compare the the Swiss's powerhouse Palms.  The Aria Bar is a sushi bar that is more like a club for downtowners at night. The wine bar inside the Fairmont though is very nice and has a good selection.  Hopefully you know a lot about wine because the few times I've beent here the person working didn't and actually gave me information I knew was incorrect. There is another Eno bar down Michigan that is better in my opinion, but if you just want a drink or two before bed this is a good place to go.",N
1426,"Attended a conference in this hotel and stayed here for 4 nights. The bellhop guys were so friendly and funny and the staff was very accommodating. The rooms were a tad small, but bed was very comfy. Pricey but nice hotel.",N
5316,"Initially, we were very satisfied with this hotel upon arrival.  The location was close to everything we had planned on doing and the room was clean. Our troubles began around 6pm the day of arrival (we were only staying one night).  Our neighbors were a group of young 20-something kids who were running up and down the hall, slamming their door repeatedly, and yelling.  After about 20 minutes of this, I went down to the front desk to ask what could be done.  I was told that this hotel had a ""zero tolerance policy"" and they would be given one warning and then evicted.  While I did not want anyone evicted, their response was satisfactory to us as we felt the situation would be handled, and we left the hotel and went out for a while.Upon our return at 10pm, our neighbors were still loud and were preventing us from falling asleep.  We called the front desk, and for the second time that evening, security came up to their room to speak with them.  The security officer told our neighbors that we were the ones who complained.  Our neighbors got revenge on us at 2:30 in the morning, by banging on our door and yelling.  We called security for the third time, and the hotel offered us a new room, but at 2:30 in the morning, who wants to switch?After a night of no sleep and feeling very dissatisfied with the way the hotel handled the situation, we spoke to the manager (Shawn/Sean) at check out.  The manager could not even look us in the eye, gave a simple apology, and did not care when we said we would never stay at this hotel again.  I was shocked at how much he seemed not to care about what happened, despite the hotel mission statement of leaving guests feeling ""well-rested.""  I'm not sure where the people who work for this establishment were trained on customer service/security skills, but they failed miserably.  We left feeling incredibly disappointed and angry with this hotel.",Y
3157,"I loved staying at this lake front hotel right on Lake shore offering awesome views everywhere!  I sort of felt like I was at the Hard Rock in Vegas but with an added touch of feng-shui energy.  The hallways are paved with rocks and have iridescent lighting everywhere as trance music is on everywhere from the elevators all around.  Love the whole 'W' theme...Whatever, Whenever and they certainly lived up to it. I needed a shower cap and called this line and they were there pronto.  In addition, was very impressed with the W store catalog but didn't get a chance to do any retail therapy there this weekend.  While the room was nice, the bathroom was considerably smaller than expected.  The shower was certainly no marvel of engineering.  Whoever left the door off of the stall shower is probably the same person mopping up the floor afterwards.",N
3811,"I hate to buck the trend here, but after spending a night in the Dana, I've got to say I'm not sure what the stars are about... First off, the good stuff -- yes, the staff is very hip and pretty friendly, at least at the door and while you're checking in... And the place has a very cool look to it (actually reminds me of my favorite sushi restaurant out in Batavia - Swordfish -- but I digress)... But when you look at things a little closer, it all kind of falls apart a bit. The waitstaff in the downstairs bar, the first floor restaurant, and even the rooftop all seem to be fighting both an urge to be nice when they meet you with a deep desire to run away. For example, at breakfast in the morning, one poor busboy was running around like a madman, cleaning tables, filling coffee cups, and seating people. All while a waiter struggled to figure out how to split a check. I watched one table get their breakfasts from 2 different food runner, then they waited for at least 3 more visits from runners to their table to finish bringing their toast, their fresh fruit - etc. All while the waiter continued to poke at the touch screen. Breakfast was good, by the way. We went to the rooftop bar, where at 5pm there was already cigarette butts on the floor around the outdoor firepit, and the carpet by the stairs was so sticky I had to laugh -- this is a place where you have to reserve a table for bottle service? Four drinks at 5pm at the rooftop bar = $80 The rooms are okay, but some details seem very weird, like the unfinished concrete ceilings. Really? And the huge glassed in shower with the curtain that almost covers the glass -- and the shower head that blows out so much water I realized why they had concrete ceilings and floors (whatever happened to water conservation?)... But by far the scariest part of the whole deal was when we realized that EVERYONE going up to that rooftop bar takes an elevator that could and often does stop on any floor in the hotel. So much for hotel security... Overall, I think maybe I'm not their demographic -- maybe if you're a spa kind of person, this place is very special. For me, not so much.",N
3942,"What you might not know about Yelp is that we try to kill our young. Sorta. Figuratively. Maybe. Charged with helping to train up one of our newest (give a shout out to Jon A in Indy; holla!), I needed to find a place where we could eat, talk and clickety-clackety in peace. Since he was staying downtown, I thought we'd do our trio o' biz downtown. It's somewhat ironic that someone who boasts an above-average knowledge of Chicago neighborhoods had NO IDEA where to go on Michigan Ave south of the loop. We wandered, stumbled, looked up, down and all around, and I had no idea of where to go. Finally, I spied some al fresco seats and a smartly-handsome facade. ""Oh, a Michigan Avenue hotel. This is a good choice."" Cue the part in the movie where the horny teens decide that skinny-dipping at Camp Crystal Lake at midnight is a good idea. We enter the dining room to find a decently-busy area. The waitstaff is a little preoccupied, so we wander around and, finally, get led to a table. It's not big enough for our purposes, so we move. Cool. Seated and lap tops out, I start the miseducation of Jon A (first single, ""I Ate Nasty Food In Chicago""). Our waitress was extremely nice and a little nervous. It was her first day on the job. No biggie. I'll order a tonic with lime. ""We don't have that."" You don't serve tonic water? A hotel bar on Michigan Avenue doesn't serve tonic water? Alright. First Day. Training. No biggie. ""I'll take a Sprite."" It arrives. Flat. I gag a little. Jon peers at me. ""Cannotflipoutinfrontofthenewguy."" Alright. No biggie. First day. Training. I'll drink water. Waitress comes back and I order the SEAFOOD SALAD SANDWICH. Cue the part of the movie where the dim busty blonde doesn't care that her sorority sisters have just been hacked up. She's going to take a shower in the abandoned, haunted locker room right.this.minute. Jon looks at me as though I am crazy. I don't quite pick up on this. I am in professor mode. The sandwich arrives with another Sprite. Cool! Gah! It's FLAT! The second Sprite is flat. Gah! No worries. I'll try the sandwich. ""It...tastes...not.good. Oh, wow. This is sorta gnarly. Hmm, I wonder why a mayo-based seafood sandwich served at a hotel with no tonic and flat Sprite tastes off. Gotta eat it. Can't scare the new guy."" Meanwhile, I am completely oblivious to the fact that Jon is in dietary distress from his meal. Oops. In an attempt to stop eating, I go full throttle into a training session. Questions are asked. Questions are answered. Johnny speaks. Jon is razzle dazzled. The check comes...sweet, merciful Lord, the check! ""Can I get you anything else? Would you like another Sprite?"" ""NO! I mean, I am full. Thank you."" By this time, Jon is a little queasy, overloaded with info and disoriented. We leave and I find out that I just checked into the food (and hotel) equivalent of The Overlook. Welcome to Yelp. Hope you survive the experience!",N
409,"Reliable, consistent good service along with great location and reasonable price make this a very desireable resting place in downtown Chicago. I'm still not sold on the Garden Inn adjustable beds, but aside from that it is clean, the staff is friendly and attentive, and the breakfast is hot and made to order. Within an easy walk or short cab ride of anything you want to do downtown, this hotel is affordable and suitable for business travelers or families on vacation.",N
3626,"I recently attended a baby shower here -- the shower itself was wonderful, but the Drake needed a bit more pizazz.  The hotel is beautiful, but it is ""past its prime,"" needing some serious redesign that incorporates the best of its old elements.  The architecture, idea and history of the place are appealing -- the older, broken down elements are not. For example, there is a ladies' ""powder room.""  Each lady has her own vanity in a little private bathroom.  But the faucet leaks.  The chair upholstery is worn.  The toilet paper roll fell off the wall. Also, the tea for this place is outrageous.  $30 for tiny white bread egg salad sandwiches.  I get it, I've been to a high tea before, but this is not worth it. So, a spruce and a spiff and the Drake could be back in business as a heavyweight, instead of silently shuffling off to the bench.",N
1089,"I recently stayed at the Fairmont in Santa Monica so maybe I expected too much from this location, but at the Santa Monica location, my God, you're treated like a king.  It almost gets to the point of being a little embarrassing.  Similarly, this location positions themselves as a top tier ""luxury"" hotel.  Definitely not the case.   I'll start on the positives and work my way down: LOCATION: One of the best possible locations in the city, no question.  You're right in the heart of it all.     LOBBY: Great design of the lobby, very 'male'.  My wife suggested that they need some flowers to soften it up a little, of course I'm oblivious to a note like that, looked cool to me. The doormen were super friendly. ROOMS-LAYOUT: Very disappointed.  We walked in and were like, really?  This is IT?  Literally, it looked no better than a Holiday Inn, very small.  The furniture looked nice but it was form over function... literally, you get TWO drawers for clothes.  Hopefully you are traveling by yourself or your party packs SUPER lightly.   It's a little nit-picky, but why in the world is the TV lined up with the wall of the hallway (dividing the main room from the bathroom area) while the two-drawer seat is lined up with the end of the bed?  Maybe someone crashing in the hallway wants to watch some ESPN?   ROOMS-NOISE LEVEL: What in the world is up with the 120 decibel toilet?  I don't care that it looked like something you're see at a roadside gas station, but my Lord, when you flush it is insanely loud.  With our baby sleeping in the main room, we would try to not wake her; closing the outside bathroom door, closing the immediate bathroom door, and literally taking a robe, wrapping it around the closed toilet, hugging, then hitting the lever... and it would STILL jolt her awake.  I'm not even exaggerating. The doors close normally then - BANG!!  It just bangs shut, soooo loud.  You learn, after the first round of stink-eye you receive after you startle everyone awake, to ease the door closed... however, all night long, count on your neighbors' doors banging shut.  The walls were paper thin and it got annoying. SERVICE: This is were they really lost me.  Maybe it was just in our case but compared to the Santa Monica location, it really was like a 'get over it' attitude.   When we booked this two months prior, we were crystal clear that we needed a crib, which is standard (it was waiting for us in our Santa Monica room, even with toys!).  We called the week before as well as the day or so before to remind them about the crib, ""No problem.""  When we got there?  No cribs left.  Awesome.  I asked the worker at the desk, ""What should we do with our baby?""  ""I don't know what to tell you, Sir.""  I guess saying 'Sir' and 'Mr.' helps sugarcoat bad news. So the first night we had to sleep with our 11 month old in our bed, trying not to crush her during the night, trying to make sure she didn't quietly wake up and roll off the bed onto the hard floor.  This would have been a deal-breaker had we known they weren't going to come through on this.  On the second day, they finally got us one. CHARGES DON'T DRINK THE WATER!!!  They lock the mini-bar and you can only open it if you request the key, which we obviously didn't want.  At the Santa Monica location, however, they set out complementary bottled water.  ANY hotel puts tags on the water if they plan on charging you for this... not here!  The water's sitting right out there for the taking, no tags, no indication that they will be a charge, but get ready to pay $10.58 for two small waters when there is a CVS right across the street.  This is just flat out b.s., don't rip me off with something like this.  I called down, got a couple ""Sirs"" but they wouldn't take it off the bill. MISC: -There was a nail polish type of smell in the hallway every day. -$1 a page to print at the ""Business Center""!?  It's like $.05 at Kinkos (which is around the corner, thank God... my wife needed to print a 60 page script). -No free internet at this ""luxury"" hotel unless you're a member of the President's Club, which, fortunately, we were... sucks for other guests though.  Internet is standard these days, it's like paying for cable. OVERALL: I gave it two stars because one star would have been overly harsh, a one star is something like a Motel 6, but the rooms aren't that much better - no pool, bad service, constantly nickle and dimed.  What's the point of paying this price point?  A hotel with basically the same location and everything else is Hotel 71 (where my parents stayed) for about $100 a night, a fraction of the Fairmont.  I'd highly recommend that over this Fairmont. At the end of the day, would I come back?  NEVER.",N
4370,"The Palmer House is absolutely amazing. Because I get a specialty discount, I was able to stay there twice for $110 a night for our anniversary. Living in Chicago, it's important to have a place in town where we can go and just have a great experience and feel like we're on vacation. Whenever a family member from CT is coming to visit, I always recommend them to stay here. In fact, my parents are coming in a few weeks and they'll be staying for just $217 a night which is really great for downtown hotel. When you first walk into the Palmer House, the first thing you are greeted with is a beautiful lobby, high ceiling painted like the sistine chapel. This lobby is gorgeous and I don't think I've ever seen one like it anywhere else. There is a bar and restaurant attached and both are very high end. Upstairs, the rooms are spacious and funny enough even smell really good! I don't know, but something about the whole place just feels rich. The bathrooms are all granite and marble and everything is always clean. The pool and hot tub are immaculate and top quality, but get a little busy with families and small children. The hotel is in a great location, I think 0,0 right at the point where the streets become N and S. Anyway, its right near the park and in the busiest shopping area on State St. also not far from Block37 and the Chicago Theater. Not just a great hotel - amazing hotel. Good enough for even Chicago residents to stay at for a night away.",N
2133,"I am a career event planner and have been planning and operating events for over 13 years. The InterContinental Hotel Chicago is one of my absolute favorite venues. I operated a very high end, high profile event for my (then) employer, and it was executed to perfection. My bosses and attendees were thrilled with the event. The location cannot be beat. This hotel is the only one in the city with a street level lobby on Michigan Ave. The service is impeccable, and the facilities are gorgeous. I would give a full five stars, but some of the rooms in the new tower are a bit on the small side. If at all possible, try to stay in the historic tower. OH! and an insider tip! Be sure to ask the concierge about the self guided ipod tour of the property... it's an open secret that you will love to take advantage of. Another tip, if you need to catch a cab to take you south of the river, cross the street before you grab one. It will save you a few bucks over getting it from the hotel cab stand.",N

My bf slept, but no light sleeper stands a chance!! If i stayed here again I'd ask for a room in the back, off the street. Bed was nice and room was clean.

3789,"I come to Chgo about 1x/month on business, and stayed here for the first time just this week. Net-net, here's what you'll get: ROOM: 3 stars overall. Bathrooms (5 stars) are awesome, with terrific lighting, big mirrors, huge rain shower w/ lots of water pressure and nice amenities. Beds (2 stars) are WAY too softy-plushie, no support, bad pillows and overall not nearly as comfy as the Westin. If you have a bad back or just o/w prefer a firmer mattress, do not stay here, you'll be miserable. Lighting in room (2 stars) is extremely dim, and you have to turn on/off like 5 lamps individually to get maybe 2 candles' worth of lumens. Windows (5 stars) are beautiful though, completely floor-to-ceiling so you have a great view of the city. SERVICE: 5 stars. Valets remembered my name every time I entered/exited the hotel and addressed me as such, welcoming back and forth by name. They were prompt and courteous and overall some of the best I've experienced in any travels, anywhere. RESTAURANT: 5 stars (I only had bfasts there). Solid menu selection that includes organic foods (yay!), fast servce, courteous and professional by all, from hostess to busser to server. They understand the business traveler. FITNESS CENTER: 4 stars. I'm waffling b/w 3-4 but I'll give 'em 4. See my photos of this place, esp since the hotel website itself doesn't showcase it. Enough stuff to get a workout in, two overly fancy, overly fussy machines, but it's new and clean and has big windows and iPod plug ins. Couple quick tips: Ask for a higher floor even-numbered room and you'll get a nice view looking East (towards the lake). Whole Foods is 1/2 block around the corner on Huron, so you'll have a terrific healthy food option within spitting distance!",N

The location was perfect for downtown: close to everything, but far enough that the price was right. The conceige was so helpful and had great tips on restaurants.

5375,"I had the worst hotel experience ever in the Congress Plaza Hotel. Despite of all inconvenience I experienced during my stay, including the strike was going on, the toilet was not working and there was no wireless internet access, I was not planning to write a yelp review until The Congress Plaza Hotel Security lied to me:11:45am on Dec 22, 2011, 45 minutes after we checked the hotel, my daughter found out she left her retainer on nightstand in the hotel room. I called the front desk and I was transferred to Hotel Security. The gentleman on the phone took down my information and asked me to call back one hour later. I called the Security at 12:45pm, the person on the phone told me that they could not find my daughter's retainer. I asked if housing keeping had cleaned the room, the person emphasized that the house keeping was in the room while the security checked out the retainer for me. The person even said that the security also checked house keeping's garbage bag to make sure no retainer was there.My daughter was very sure that she left her retainer in the hotel, so we decided to go back the hotel to check out the room ourselves (around 3:00pm). We found out the room was not even been cleaned yet, and surely my daughter's retainer was still on the nightstand.As a frequent traveler, I left stuffs in hotel many times. The hotel staff and the house keeping were always very helpful. I could not believe that the Congress Plaza Hotel could not hold up the basic hotel standard to help it's customers to locate stuff they left in their hotel room. This instance is a reflection of poor hotel management which leads bad customer experience.",Y

At night it was a little noisy hearing the train pass, but I got used to it after a while. My room did not have 2 bathrooms as several others have mentioned, but I think it's because I had a corner room. The second day of my stay, the cleaning crew took my iron! I had to call for a replacement, and they had it to me in about 15 minutes. Other than that, I had no complaints.",N

They made me feel very comfortable and welcome. + AWESOME VIEW at the 22 floor. I was able to see the tall buildings and snow fall from a higher elevation. It was epic. + GORGEOUS interior design. We had two beds and the pretty flower artworks on the wall matched the color theme of the room. +WHOA, COMFY ASS BED. I wish I had this at home! The pillows were coshy and the comforter was like a million marshmallows hugging my body. +HD CHANNELS, NO WAY! Plenty of choices and in high def no doubt. Not too shabby. +UBER FAST elevators. I hate those slow crackity ones that smell like old fart. Plus these had clean mirrors to double check your morning hair do. + PRETTY SCENTED lotions and soaps. It wasn't floral or manly. It was a neutral smell that was fresh and sweet. I brought some home...;) - SLOW shower.

Careful though, there are only 59 rooms, so it books up FAST!** They are adding more suites soon...",Y
4697,"Received an amazing deal for the hotel that I could not pass up - $130/night.  Found the deal through http://bing.com which led me to the online booking engine, http://www.easyclicktrav....  Basically purchased the room ""on request"" which means your room is not confirmed.  Easyclicktravel contacts the hotel to see if they will sell the room for the ""on request"" price...and within 48 hours the TA will either confirm your room or not.  Lucky for me, the room confirmed. Moving onto the hotel...the review will be done in categories (at least the categories most important to me). Room:  Clean, modern and sleek.  Definitely liked the decor and the cleanliness.  This is a boutique hotel and I have found that the synonym for boutique is small.  I booked a regular hotel room and it was much smaller than what I'm used to.  There was very little walking room around the bed and the small desk.  Personally, cleanliness overrides room size for me so I'd still give the room category 4 stars. Transportation:  Chicago's public transportation is easy, reliable, and clean.  From O'Hare airport, you can take the blue line to the hotel.  It is a bit of a walk from the closest blue line stop to the hotel though so be prepared to walk.  There are buses that you can take from the blue line stop to the hotel though, but I didn't try that option.  The red line stop is much closer to the hotel.   Sight-seeing:  The hotel is in a great location.  If you don't mind a nice walk, you can walk to Navy Pier, Magnificent Mile, Museums, etc.  The hotel is also a few train stops away from Wrigley Field, Soldier Field, parks, etc. Food:  The hotel is walking distance to many great restaurants.  Each night my bf and I would take a stroll to our restaurant of choice and walk back.  That options were endless.  The restaurants ranged from nice, pricey restaurants to economical down right grubbing restaurants.   Service:  The bellmen were super nice.  Always greeted the guests when they arrived or left the hotel..  Always willing to provide suggestions, give directions, etc.  The front desk personnel were a bit snobby.  I'm not sure if the attitude came with the motif of the hotel - green, boutique hotel, but I thought they could have been a bit more friendly. Overall, the hotel is in a great location.  I'd definitely stay here again...but not for more than $200/night.",N
2473,"My husband and I stayed here the night we eloped and got married. We stayed in a realllly high up room that overlooked the water. It was pretty rad that we could see an up close and personal view of the fireworks at the Navy Pier at night, but overall we were fairly unimpressed by the room itself. Sure it was nice, but we got charged quite a bit extra for a room with a ""view"" and the window was tiny tiny tiny. I just feel like if you're charging for a view that it should be a helluva view . Biggest pet peeve: So we get here the night we got married after we had already previously arrived to settle in, and our room is hotter than dammit at 10pm when we had definitely left the AC running. We call the front desk and tell them about it, and we were just sitting there in our fancy clothes waiting for someone to come up to fix it because we didn't want to be in the shower...or uh, consummating when they got there. So we waited 30 minutes, then 45. After 3 angry phone calls to the front desk, a very friendly serviceman arrives to fix the filter on our A/C. He then proceeds to explain what the problem was. He was nice and we were appreciative, but man, I just got married. I don't care what the problem was, just get out of my room so I can get busy. And of course, we never got any compensation or apology for the annoyance. But I'm still married, so I guess it didn't turn out to be too big of a deal, haha. Overall, the location is what would make this place worth it. Other than that, save your pennies and stay elsewhere.",N
4169,"This review applies to the parking garage service.  I am very funny about turning my car over to anyone since I have a hybrid and I'm always paranoid they are not going to know how to drive it. It is quite different at first -took me about a month to get the hang of it!  Since I was on my way to a work related event and we didn't know where else to park, this was our only option.  The attendant reassured me that they have had experience with my kind of car and I left it. When I got back, they had my car back to me within 5 minutes and it was all in one piece. I guess I have Ferris Bueller level paranoia! I would definitely trust this staff again with my car if I had to park in that area!

3178,"I've never seen the rooms at the W, but I hear they are very nice.  However, I love the lounge for drinks.  It's a perfect date spot or I've also been to parties in the bigger room upstairs and it's a really cool atmosphere with an amazing view.",N
440,The reason I am giving it 3 stars is my housekeeper was amazing.  She was there outside my room every morning and I could get anything I wanted towels what not.  When I first arrived I didn't have a do not disturb sign.  She was just walking down the hall and I caught her and she returned with one in no time. On the other hand the food establishment inside the hotel was lousy.  They cooked everything on Coleman camp stoves and hot plates plus it took over 45 min for a breakfast sandwich. On Monday when I got back to my room my key no longer worked.  So I had to go stand in line at the front desk. It seemed there was always a wait at the front desk. If you stay here make sure to get your reservation on http://hotels.com or Travelocity or what ever your favorite travel site is.  It will be cheaper than calling them.  I called just to ask about getting the same price they said they couldn't which I found odd.  But hey what ever floats their boat.  The price was very good for staying in Chicago plus free parking.  Our tab was $82 a night. It was near china town which was great because I love chinese food.  Plus it was only like a 10 min walk to the red line which I used during my whole trip.,N

As a matter of fact, I really liked our waitress in the wine bar too, so maybe I will give SERVICE a 4 star and the hotel room itself a 3 (nothing too special). the location was great, smack in the middle of anywhere you want to go along the ""Magnificent Mile"" and easy enough to grab a cab anywhere else.",N
5541,"This hotel sucks.   It was recommended to me by the hiring manager for my current gig, but I'm not sure why they suggest people come here because I think it is, quite frankly, an overpriced Travelodge.   I had a pretty crappy room (516) for the duration of my stay there and there was this smell that would welcome me every night when I came home from work.   Wet carpet smell, perhaps?   I dunno...   I actually looked on http://Hotels.com to change after about a week here but I was unfortunately not able to find anything else within the same price range.   Luckily, on my next trip, I booked Hotel Felix for $45 less per night.",N
4932,cool bar atmosphere and staff. drinks are worth the price.,Y
5218,"We prepaid two nights in advance, called and told them we would be arriving late, and told them we needed two double beds to accommodate three guests. They said ""no problem."" We arrived a little after 1 a.m. and were told they were out of rooms and they were making arrangements at another hotel for us for the night. They could have called us to tell us that, and we would have driven straight to the hotel they were going to ship us to without parking our car with their $50 valet for that evening. So, we enjoyed a cab ride across town to the Allegro. The hotel they sent us to only had rooms with one king bed - no doubles. So, we had to have the desk person at the new hotel barter with the Millennium to get them to provide us with enough beds to sleep in. Overall, they made things more or less ""right,"" but the manner in which it was handled was really poor, and I really don't expect much. We ended up back at the Millennium the next night. The rooms themselves were nice, and Dave the bartender at the martini bar is a super cool dude.",Y
99,"I cannot say enough good things about Anne Parker and the Carleton Hotel. We had our wedding there last weekend, and all the guests stayed there as well. Anne did an amazing job with planning our ceremony and cocktail hour!  She was so professional and knowledgeable. From the first day we met, I knew I was working with the right person. Anne is amazingly good at what she does, and takes all of the tasks related to wedding planning very seriously. So much so, it helped me to be at ease knowing she had the details under control. I could not have been happier with Anne and the venue as a whole. Their beautiful vintage bar was perfect for our cocktail reception and photos. Additionally, I heard nothing but good things from guests about the hotel itself. I stayed there the night before the wedding and can attest to how nice the rooms are. The Carleton was the perfect venue for our wedding! Thank you Anne,and the Carleton Hotel, for exceeding every expectation!",N
1926,"Very trendy, cool looking hotel. However when I tried to get information for a wedding and reception for 45 people I was told that my party was too small and perhaps I'd be better elsewhere. Thanks for the suggestion!",N
4485,"The hotel is very nicely done up. Exactly what you would expect from a prime location such as this one. The hotel is a blend between old fashioned style and modern ikea furniture. The room was really nice and I loved the fact it was sweepingly large. I had a fantastic time here. I would like to return to this hotel, if they were having another special like they were when I stayed. Otherwise I would imagine this place would be pretty pricey.",N
2574,I recently visited Victor...and WOW! What a hidden gem! Very cool place with a great staff! Check it out!,N
4969,"I liked this place! We stayed for a wedding in December & the Allerton staff were really fun, and professional! The ballroom on the top floor is absolutely beautiful, but can feel a little small when there are lots of guests. I was sweatin' on the dance floor & bumping into everyone, so maybe it's better for a small wedding but we all had fun. Beautiful room though. Wedding organizer should have handled the reception bar set-up better too for a hotel on THE Michigan Avenue. It took a while to get a drink because there was only one bar for so many people.Another thing that could have been improved on was the main/only entrance. It's just an entrance with no grandeur, but when you get up to the 3rd floor the hotel comes to life.  The elevators are ridiculously slow. It's an old, historic hotel though, so if you know that going in, the quirks are really endearing.P.S.   My bed was great! So comfortable, and the room was small but clean and well-decorated. Room size was not a big deal. It was comfortable, pretty, & clean, AND I had hot water, unlike some other guests in previous posts. I'd stay at The Allerton again in a heart beat. I'm sure they'll keep improving as they get feedback.",Y
2297,"I was impressed with the Chicago Marriott Downtown on several counts. * Perfect location * Amazing concierge service * Comfortable beds * Extensive health club equipment * Kick-ass lobby The location simply can't be beat.  Halfway between Water Tower and the Loop on Michigan Avenue means that the hotel is suited for business travelers, shoppers and tourists.  And since it's adjacent to Grand you're a few blocks away from the Red Line and along the free trolley route to Navy Pier.   Again, the location is simply unbeatable.   The concierge service was awesome.  They went above and beyond with helpful tips for sightseeing, restaurant recommendations/reservations, and even brought up a phone charger to my room for my use. The beds and down comforters were quite the highlight.  I overslept a few times, and like to think this was the reason. While the pool and hot tub were standard and ordinary, I was surprised to find how awesome the health club was.  I expected to find three treadmills, two barbells and a situp contraption.   To my delight I found a cardio room of 20 machines, and a completely separate free weight area with about 40 machines, barbells and dumbbells -- in a hotel??  That's almost as good as any nearby gym. And, yes, the lobby is busy, well appointed and not too stuffy.  Tons,of plush furniture flanked by a bar, Starbucks, and the busy din of travelers milling about. While there are better hotels in the area (Park Hyatt, Peninsula, Drake, etc.), we all can't afford that - so this is a good compromise.  All in all, it was a postive experience in a recommended hotel.  I would stay here again. My only complaints would be the general noise and loudness of the area, the hotel's lack of WiFi and the cramped hotel room bathrooms.  Even being 43 stories up, the noise of the streets below still felt a bit loud at times.  For a popular convention hotel such as this not to have free WiFi is kind of embarrassing.  The bathrooms are TINY.  I couldn't even open and shut the door without completely maneuvering around the sink and toilet.  This bathroom rivals NYC for petiteness.",N
1845,"DON'T. EVER. STAY. HERE. OK, I said it.  I arrived at this hotel for business last week.  From the beginning, customer service was terrible.  The guy up front snickered that I didn't have any Starwood points.  I asked if he could help, because all my points are being diverted to Delta.  Sadly, no. My room was tiny, even by Chicago standards, the bathroom so cramped and crowded that my makeup fell into the toilet.  The bed had a glowing light underneath that I couldn't figure out how to turn off.  I had to sleep with the light on. The water got turned off one day into the trip.  Hotel staff offered me a Fuji water to compensate for the fact that my co-worker and I could not flush our toilet, brush our teeth, or take a shower.  Gee, thanks. We arrived back at the hotel at 6pm to find the water still turned off.  Front desk arranged for a transfer to W Lakeshore but was not courteous at all.  The woman I spoke to refused to let me speak to her manager.  We moved to another hotel and I complained to Starwood corporate.  The hotel compensated me some points, but the whole experience was way horrendous.",N
4134,"Initial caveat:  we got a 4-night stay during the holidays for $75/night using priceline's name-your-own-price, so it's hard to complain, cause the place is really pretty swanky.  But, I strongly doubt that the maid service, concierge, and other service personnel knew we were there on the cheap, so it doesn't excuse their behavior. The place was undergoing major renovations, so the outside of the buildings and the (main) east tower was kind of a mess, which maybe explained why they may have been short staffed or disgruntled.  We stayed in the West tower and it was quiet and the rooms were nice and comfortable, with good views. The service was rotten though.  The maids never once replaced anything they removed from our room.  If I ever wanted fresh glasses, ice bucket bags, or shampoo/conditioner, I had to call the maid service and request them.  And when I called, I usually got attitude: ""Can I get turn-down service tonight while we're out this evening?"" ""OK, someone will be up shortly."" ""And would you ask the maids to possibly check and replace any used or empty items around our room while they're up here?"" (gruffly) ""Ok, sir, you're going to need to tell me EXACTLY what you need.  What do you ACTUALLY need?"" I listed the various items, which I found later in a plastic bag tossed in the bathroom sink.  They couldn't even place the items in the shower or their various places. The other big issue was room service, whose absurd prices (I assumed) already contemplated the strenuous task of delivering the food up an elevator,  Nevertheless, they charged a $4 delivery charge on top of auto-gratting the bill 18%.  Thus an already over-priced $13 turkey sandwich cost a mandatory $20.  Ridiculous. I like Hyatt and would probably try the other one near the Water Tower if we visit Chicago again, but this experience was a mess.  If we'd been paying the full $179/night, I would probably have lost it.",N
2698,"We stayed here for 3 nights, June 30th-July 2nd. It was perfect from beginning, (upgraded us to the top floor) to the end. The Front Desk, Concierge, and the Doorman were all friendly and helpful. The room was stylish, hip, and comfortable. The bathroom is especially nice with dimmers on the lights and the sliding door and  the beds are heavenly! I ate at the restaurant for breakfast and I could have split it with two other people, it was huge, but delicious. The Hotel is perfectly located for all Chicago shopping and dining. The Front Desk and the concierge both gave us awesome restaurant recommendations. Check out time is 3:00!!  unheard of.........so great, no rushing around to check out.  I would stay here again for sure.  Oh yeah, we saw Adam Levine coming in after a night out .........so Rock Stars stay here:)",N
3032,"Now this is what a hotel experience should be about. When I checked in, Front Desk Jen asked me about my flight and taxi ride in, had my room all ready. And the room itself was terrific - king-size bed, a plasma tv, nice modern accents, and slick shower, complete with Bliss Spa bath products. I had wake-up calls scheduled each morning I was in town, and the person who called each time was soothing and polite, so a nice way to start each day. Oh, when I did get to my room, about 20 minutes into it, Jen called to inquire if I needed anything. I actually didn't get a chance to really enjoy the bar but it seems more of a scene at happy hour than at night, but that could have been because I was there on a Wednesday and Thursday. Still, as with all the Ws I've been to around the US, the bar and lounge were typically sleek and playful, sort of like something out of a Jonathan Adler catalog. Since I took cabs (always plentiful outside), I didn't get to really explore the walking area around the hotel, so I can't comment on location, save for the fact that wherever I went around town, my fare was always under $10. All in all, I'd easily recommend this W for a stay, whether you're a tourist or business traveler, heck even a weary local who wants a bit of style and fun. Note: I booked my room via Expedia, and got a super deal since I also made flight plans with them.",N
3126,"Great location, amazing views, stylish design, big rooms, cocktails comped to us, great front desk person, very good price.   Why not five stars?  I think in this day and age, hotels should have free wi fi.  (With VOIP, some hotels are now offering unlimited long distance and free wi fi.)  Otherwise, entirely a five-star experience.",N
3189,"I like this place, not sure why I don't come here often, but I have never had a bad experience!! Yeah it's a bit snotty and what not, but hey it's a great way to break the cycle of our usual hectic and at times boring life. Besides their restaurant is yummy!!! U should walk in here with no expectations and hopefully u'll be impressed if not then hey at least u can say ""been there done that""!!:-)",N
832,"Location is what this hotel is all about. It is within walking distance of Millennium Park, State Street Shopping, and even the Sears tower, andn many, many other tourist attractions. The L is right outside, so if you need to go anywhere, it's steps away. And don't worry about it being loud - I slept fine there.   However, I wasn't crazy about their room and decor. They are older, and the room we had was a bit too old for my taste. The bathroom was clean, but it didn't have the new industrial touch many other hotels I've stayed at did. While I like the location of Silversmith, I would still prefer a hotel near the Magnificent Miles, since the Loop isn't as cool at night. I guess it is fine if you're just looking for a practical place to stay while in Chicago, but if you're looking for something a bit more ""special,"" I'd recommend other hotels.",N
349,"I have a mixed review for this place...it was cheap so I understand you don't get as much, but my first night of sleep was painful....bright light leaked in from the curtains from outside and since I'm a light sleeper the light kept waking me up.  The next night I got creative and I put a bed sheet over the window frame which blocked the light.  I also ran the air-conditioning at night to block the noise from the Ltrain. Pros - cheap, air conditioning works, good location, clean room Cons - Small small room, no parking for cars, elevators took a while",N
572,"This Ian Schrager retooling of an iconic Chicago hotel seamlessly melds classic architectural details with modern style and service. The hotel hasn't been open for long, and the quality of service is where this fact is most obvious. The staff are all improbably attractive, and tremendously green. I'm sure that they'll get better, but the generally inexperienced staff -- front desk, valets, coffee bar, bar -- are what cost this hotel a star in my review. Probably would have cost them two stars had they not all been so good-looking! I'd definitely stay there again!",N
112,"This Holiday Inn Express used to be the Hotel Cass. My friend and I are currently staying here for Lollapalooza and so far our experience has been great. We arrived at around 10:30pm CT on Thursday due to delayed and re routed flights but no biggie. When we got here the concierge already knew my name and was waiting for our arrival. We were upgraded to a King suite. Rooms are nice, clean and modern. Small in size but they remind me of hotel rooms in Europe. I like that. Free breakfast every morning with, eggs, sausage or bacon, cereal, fruit and cinnabuns. Yum. Free high speed wifi with an excellent connection and a business center. Super comfy beds. Lots of pillows labeled soft and firm. Sleeping here is dreamy. Right across the street from Trader Joes and loads of yummy restaurants. We got a great deal on this hotel because we booked months in advance. If you're planning to come to visit Chicago, this is a great and affordable place to stay.",N
4029,"This is a huge hotel that does a lot of convention business. However, we stayed here for pleasure and were very pleased. The rooms are decent size and clean with a modern decor. The staff is friendly and efficient and the location cannot be beat. There is a huge contemporary bar, appropriately named the Big Bar, a Pub, as well as a bistro and steakhouse on site. There is also a nice patio common area to relax at if you want to chill outdoors. The hotel is near Michigan Ave., Millennium Park, the Riverwalk and within walking distance to Navy Pier, the L, etc. I also appreciated the convenience of a very nice grocery store next door. Great property, great location!",N
1959,"Kind of crazy.  This place is super swank in the lobby. Sort of West Elmy with a plum velvet twist. Light projections, art, velvet furniture, black lobby. 2 door guys, 1 concierge, 2 desk people, 1 very tall blonde and removed store clerk. Some very cute, kitschy and extremely specific items in the hotel shoppe. The hotel's restaurants and bars swing right off the lobby behind tall black walls. Initial impression was grande. The stay. The stay was super plush with a cushy king, proper amount of pillows for 2 plus a nice body pillow xtra. Toiletries included Bliss travel pack (found at Sephora for $25 a pop). Very nice. CS/Modern Luxury and Wired magazine in the room, nice details. Overall, the stay was comfy and friendly. We stayed in the Fabulous room. Service. Service was ok. It didn't seem to be very coordinated. I was supposed to have champagne and strawberries delivered for my birthday morning. Didn't happen and we got tired of waiting. They tried to reschedule for the evening and that really wasn't as seamless as you'd think, either. The first night of our stay, we requested extra hangers. We had to ask repeatedly and then we finally got them. Like a DOZEN of them, on our last day. Thanks. The Whiskey Blue was a nice hangout and you can't really beat the location as far as being able to walk to many of the touristy attractions and CTA. The hotel did seem to be a magnet for underage teens which was kind of odd to me. For some reason, I don't really notice teens in VA unless it's in Tysons Corner, where they persist in droves. In Chicago, it seems like it is teen CENTRAL!",N
4743,"I really hated staying at the Hotel Felix.  My hatred was in part due to the fact that Priceline led me to believe I would be staying in a 4 star hotel - I wouldn't rate this place above a 2 - and it only gets that much because the hotel staff is very friendly and helpful.  I've never been more uncomfortable in a hotel room (or motel room, or in any random side of the road travel hotel I've ever stayed at).  The room is tiny, and I was awake all night listening to the air conditioner turn on and off (it made a loud booming sound - the maintenance guy said that's just the way it was made).  Also, while the eco-friendly thing is nice in concept, it also means that they do not allow you to turn your air below a certain level (central air) - sure the thermostat says 65, but it feels like 75 (or worse, sometimes it randomly blew out hot air).  The bed was short (though not uncomfortable) and there was no natural light.  The location is good but there are tons of hotels in this general area.  Unless you're on a seriously tight budget and need to book through Priceline, I wouldn't recommend staying here under any circumstances.  I don't plan on using Priceline again because of this experience - their rating system obviously can't be trusted.",Y
5127,"Three day vacation with 4 year old son and wife.  Room was rather small, and the bathroom door was tight to get in to.  Stayed in the 'new' tower with a stunning view of Michigan Ave.  Room was clean, well laid out and very comfortable.  Plasma TV with digital reception was a real plus.  All of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful.  Zest restaurant was decent if a bit pricey.  You must see the historic Jr Olympic pool (very ornate and a time capsule back 90 years).  You are in the heart of all the action.  TIP If you are adventurous, use public transit.  They have a fantastic system (3 day pass $14).  We took train from Midway to Lake Station and bus right to front of hotel in about 40 minutes.  Very convenient and efficient.",Y
3478,"More like 3.5 stars. Stayed here for a bachelorette weekend. Rooms? SMALL. This ain't a Vegas suite! All boutique hotels have small rooms so we were expecting the room so to be small but these were PINT SIZE. The double rooms have two FULL SIZE BEDS, not queens . If you plan on having more than five in a room, a double room will not accommodate a cot without creating a fire hazard, so you'll have to go with a jr. suite. The people at the front desk realized our situation and were nice enough to upgrade our room to a jr. suite at no extra charge. Sink had a crack in it and there are just signs of wear and tear everywhere in this hotel overall that could use a little TLC. Nevertheless, our stay was comfortable and you really can't beat the location. It is right off Michigan Avenue and walking distance to almost anything and everything you want to see downtown. The bellhops downstairs were very friendly. Storing our luggage after check-out and arranging for a van cab to the airport were no problem. Wouldn't mind staying here again for the location alone, but it would be nice if they did a little refurbishing.",N
4890,"I have mixed feelings about this hotel. The steakhouse is pretty good mixing steak and sushi dishes quite well and the club upstairs can be a fun time but the rooms are just okay. My first room had a very bad smell in it, which they accommodated by changing my room but the bathrooms have glass walls. There is no privacy in the bathroom and the walls and ceiling of the main bedroom are concrete. I just feel like the hotel could be a lot better.",Y
5535,"Solid hotel for the loop! The rooms are updated and clean but nothing out of the ordinary like a boutique hotel.   Besides being walking distance to Millennium Park, the Sears (Willis) Tower, etc. I also liked....   - About a block away from the Madison CTA transit station (Brown line)   - The Starbucks and sandwich/coffee shop across the street. - The included continental breakfast - comes in handy especially on Sunday where most all nearby restaurants are closed. (waffle station, bacon, eggs, muffins, cereals, etc)   - Pool is cool - Jacuzzi for 2, yes you are soaking in my foot water.   - Free Wifi - Decent rates @ $150 / nite - Primarily in the Financial District part of downtown, it get's pretty quiet after hours and weekends. Sundays are barren (everything is closed). Solid 3.5 star rating. Rounding up for they had an ice cream vending machine! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_...)",N
2692,"Not impressed. From check in and the people behind the counter arguing with each other, to the clogged tub to side table they called a desk, to the painfully slow internet connection, to the tiny room and the dark corner called a closet, and the been there done that interior. All in all an unsatisfying experience.",N
4355,"Cons: I got a great deal to Palmer House, which is why I stayed there. Before my trip I added a day to my reservation... That caused an issue. When I got to the hotel they couldn't find my extra day, which was cool because they eventually found it. I was told it would be corrected in the system and put as one reservations rather than two.. Great... that is until I tried to get into my room at like 1am and my key wasn't working! Apparently the woman forgot to fix the error in the system & I was checked out. That was fixed and they checked me back in after about 30 minutes. Next they didn't clean my room the day of the ""check-out situation""... I don't know if it is because no one was supposed to be in the room, but I think that it's disgusting. I was annoyed to enter my room and see my bed still unmade and no new clean towels and wash cloths. Lastly, I was supposed to receive a non-smoking room and received a smoking room. By the time I checked into the hotel I was so exhausted from work & my flight that I didn't even care and bought a candle to try to help the smell of the room. Pros: Nice Lobby, Decent rooms, Lounge/Bar in the lobby, Comfortable bed, Crabtree & Evelyn products in the bathroom.",N
2704,"The rooms are beautiful, and sparse. I love the fact that they are conscious about the environment and will only change the bedding if you place a card on the bed. It's a bit on the high side for the stay, but you're just off of Michigan Ave., where everything is happening. Nice spot.",N
3880,"5 star service on a budget. http://Hotels.com was offering rooms for $125 on a saturday night. Amazing views from our room featuring floor to ceiling windows.  Flat screen tv, luxury bath, ultra hip decor, and much more. Roof top lounge is a must. They have heat lamps and a fire pit for cooler nights. I'd recommend this hotel over any other.",N
814,"I would agree with Joe H. on his review. I was checked into a room where the bathroom was COVERED in mold. I stayed in the room about 2 nights and had to request a new room, they upgraded me to a different room, which had a partial view. This is also the second time that I have left something at a Westin Hotel and they have ""lost"" my lost item. This time I had left behind a $150 Eileen Fisher shirt. I called 2 days after I had left, when I saw I left the shirt behind, and the lost and found said they could not find it. They did not take the description of the shirt down, all he wanted to know was what floor I was on, then proceeded to inform me that there were other shirts found but none matching my description. I got VERY frustrated and explained he never TOOK a description of the shirt, so then he asked what it looked like, waited 3 minutes and said ""No, no shirts like that were left behind"". I called again today (2 months after the fact) and was told all clothing left behind is thrown away. I was NOT impressed with this hotel nor their service. I have always been impressed with Westin, but not this hotel. Take my advice and others...this is NOT worth the money you will be spending.",N
695,Very nice courtyard Marriott located in a very easily accessed area of Downtown Chicago.   The staff was super friendly and the room was clean and very attractive. The hotel itself is attentive to individuals in wheelchairs as my wife is in a chair.  However the beds in the handicap rooms are extremely tall making it difficult for anyone that is wheelchair bound to gain access to the bed by themselves. The onsite parking garage is a nice option and is centrally located making it easy to get around the Michigan Ave. area of Chicago.,N
47,"Don't kid yourself, you're paying for location and not much else. Mind you, the staff was nice and attentive, but that's mostly because they know it's the only thing that they've got to cling to. The facilities are atrocious. ""Quaint,"" or ""charming,"" or ""has character,"" would apply if the rooms were small but well maintained and attended to, which they aren't. The shower had barely warm water and backed up such that I had water about 4 inches deep by the end of my short, cold, shower. The images shown of the hotel are of the, admittedly, nice lobby and the penthouse suite. The actual room we stayed in? Comparable to the YMCA room I stayed in while on spring break in New Orleans during college. If it were anywhere else besides 1 block off of Michigan Ave., the phrase ""seedy dive"" would spring to mind. I really don't want to waste anymore of my time on this place, so I'll stop now. PS, we got it through Hotwire and they claimed it to be a 3 star ""boutique."" Crazy.",N
4143,"Worst staff ever. I tried calling a guest there and was 1) transferred to the front desk, where no one picked up 2) told they didn't stay there 3) transferred to a Hyatt operator who wasn't even in the hotel 4) finally transferred to her room, without an apology I just lost 30 minutes to the incompentence of this staff.",N
2197,"I'm from Los Angeles so perhaps my expectations are unrealistically high...  The good news:  the staff is very helpful, the location is ideal and the rooms are decent.  However!  They nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING and I'm talking E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G!  I'm surprised there's not a $2.00 fee to look out the window.  They charge you $5.00 to watch last week's Saturday Night Live, a show that aired for FREE.  The upcharges are obnoxious.  I wouldn't stay here again - it's a total ripoff.",N
5076,"I just got in from this place (Saturday), and I won't be going back. When I first arrived there with friends the place wasn't too crowded. The first thing that immediately caught my attention was trying to walk on the very uneven/holey/sticky floors. If you require women to wear heels you should at least have a floor to accommodate that ridiculous rule. There are supposed to be no gym shoes/boots/white t-shirts but most of the people who came after 11pm had on all of the above. Vale was 20$ which isn't bad I suppose but I've definitely had cheaper. To use your card it was a minimum of $25 which I think is completely fucking absurd. The DJ wasn't that awesome at all, played a lot of old music and played the same song maybe three times in the same hour. Once the club was packed they jacked the entrance prices up to 20$ for ladies and 35$ for men, there is no room to navigate, and it's hard to breathe in the stuffy environment. If you paid for bottle service you got let in faster. All in all, there are better places to go for a good time in Chicago. This is just definitely not one of those places.",Y
2293,"This hotel is perhaps the best place to stay for your value. Let me emphasize that I've stayed at a lot of hotels in my time working in Chicago. I've stayed at: Conrad Hotel on Monroe Westin on Michigan Ave Westin on River North Residence Inn on Michigan Courtyard on Grand Palmer House on Monroe This place is still on Michigan Ave, but more like in the middle. It's got Ethel's Chocolate Lounge as a neighbor. You can get to any restaurant you want from this location. I stayed for a full 6 weeks and my room was always clean and neat when I arrived and cleaned well when I returned, and I'm a slob in hotels. When I had a complaint about charges to my room they were promptly taken off without a lot of hassle. Kudos to this hotel. This is where I wish I had stayed all the time.",N
1849,"My cousin had her wedding reception here last summer, and holy crap what a shitstorm it was. For one, the food was cold. Every last bit of food was cold. This includes soup, salmon, and fillet mignon - all of which, last I checked, should be at least above room temperature. At least I was served, though. Some tables on the other side of the room never got food, even though my cousin laid out very specific floor plans as to how many of each type of entree each table received. That's just atrocioius, who ever heard of a big fancy hotel not feeding all of its wedding guests? There are two bars, set up in tremendously inconvenient corners of the ball room, so that in order to grab a jack and coke, you had to squeeze yourself between a few tables and knock into about 15 people on your way. The wedding was a Greek wedding, so the reception followed in kind, with a lot of Greek dancing. One of these dances involves the relatives of the bride and groom throwing money at the new couple. Hotel staff was all too quick to sweep up this money on the floor and pocketed quite a bit of it (according to my cousin, anyway). The hotel is lovely; the lobby is modern and gorgeous, and if I were celebrating an anniversary or something, I'd have no qualms about booking a room here. But I'll be damned if I ever think about throwing a large important event here.",N
3712,"Took my sister to afternoon tea for her birthday. I made reservations over the phone which was easier than doing it online because online (via phone) I kept getting an error message. The reservation was from 1pm. The reservation deskperson had told me not to be more than 10 minutes late as they don't hold reservations past that time. Each seating is 1 hr and 30 minutes so we were there until 2:30. The Palm Court is in the lobby area and the hotel is beautifully decorated for Xmas. Also, if you have the dough to spend, the Chanel store is attached to the hotel. There is a very tall, well decorated tree when you go up the stairs to the Palm Court area from the lobby. It is definitely worth a kodak moment. The hostess was very polite and seated us immediately. There was only one waiter and at least 7 tables of people seated for tea. With the afteroon tea, they serve 4 types of sandwiches, egg salad, cucumber tomato, asparagus/ham and roast beef. My sister didn't want the beef so we got extra egg salad sandwiches. They were all very good but I would have loved a choice of breads for the sandwiches. Also the tea came with our choice of tea, we each got a teapot. I had the dulce and she had the pear caramel. They allow you to try other teas and so we also tried the chocolate peppermint. My favorite was pear caramel. Also, the tea came with 4 small pastries, raisin scones and banana bread. The scones were soft and still warm. Overall, the service was decent and they constantly filled our teapots with water.The ambious is great but for $33 a person plus tip,  it may be more worth it to come for a cocktail.",N
3200,"i like this slightly more than citycenter because its more airy. besides that it is kinda a pain in the ass to get to (i mean where would you walk there from?) it is a good time. i just wish that perhaps they would make the lobby a little darker at night. citycenter is just too dark ALL the time, but when this lobby turns into a lounge @ night i don't need to be reminded that light hurts my inebriated eyes.",N
3146,"I've been in one of the rooms here before. It honestly was pretty cool looking--wood paneled walls with a really big modern bathroom with some weird  little window that opened up onto the room. But I'm still not convinced it was $300 a night good. For that much money there should be, like a bottle of champain waiting for you. And a whore in the bed.",N
1252,"Beautiful room, with a spacious floor plan and the most impressive shower head I've seen in some time. Conveniently located near Museum Park and Soldier field, there are plenty of close options. The bar and restaurant in house was great, with an amazing staff. The bedding was fantastic and it's been awhile since I've found such a nice bed away from home.",N
1549,"A nice boutique hotel in the heart of the city.  Location can't be beat, views from almost every room are great, and the staff really make the place come to life.  Everyone from the doorman to the housekeeper was friendly, smiling, and seemed genuinely happy to serve you. I can't talk about the cost, because our room was paid for as part of a wedding party we were attending (thanks, E!), and yes, valet parking is the standard downtown $45-50/day.  So if you're stuck with driving, you'll pay the price. Our room was definitely larger than expected, well-appointed (though my wife thought it was a little dark -- more lamps needed?), and comfortable.  There was a large medical convention group staying there that weekend as well, but despite the hotel being full, our room was always very quiet.  The bathroom was also quite large, but the tub/shower looked like it had seen better days, with the chrome tarnishing and some of the grout starting to flake.  The adjustable shower head was also no longer adjustable. In spite of these small missteps, we loved being able to walk everywhere in the loop, and we loved the cheerfulness of the front desk folks every time we returned for the night.  It felt like our personal urban oasis.",N
2943,"Nice hotel, esp the club level.  We were there the week of penny parking, but no one at the hotel told us so we had to go and get a rental car everyday and return it everynight.  A bit tough to get to the L.  Great steakhouse, Shulas.  CHeesy decor, but good food.  Also, the hamburger place in the bottom of the hotel is excellent and great for kids.",N
2468,"I visited Chicago in August 2010 for the annual Market Days event in the Boy's Town district of Chicago. I was able to secure a deal on this hotel through undisclosed means, and we chose the hotel based on the history, beauty, and location of it in proximity to Michigan Avenue. We were set to arrive quite late on a Friday night. I had called earlier in the evening to inform them that I would be arriving late, but not to give away my room, as I had the reservations made in advance. I was informed that this would not be a problem. When we arrived in Chicago, the hotel's attached parking ramp seemed rather hard to find. Though this is to be expected, a head's up: parking was $43 for self and $55 valet. Before you complain, remember you are in downtown Chicago. Stay somewhere else if you don't want to pay for parking. I was immediately impressed with the gorgeous lobby area and entry area to the hotel. Anyone who can appreciate historic buildings will love this hotel. Given the lateness of our arrival, there was not much of a line, and only a few individuals working the desk, which I expected. However, I was rather dismayed to find out that the only room they had left available (I had booked a room with two queen-sized beds) was a ""parlor,"" which is simply a living room area attached to a larger suite. It has it's own bar area, TV, desk, computer, and bathroom, but only a pull-out sofa bed. It was only for one night and we were very tired. Knowing that these things happen, I grabbed the keys. I was, however, disappointed that this happened given I had called several hours prior to avoid this very thing. The parlor was more than adequate for a few people, but if I were to have had a party of 4 or more, I may have been more upset. It did slightly bother me they didn't offer any form of ""apology"" or incentive to make me feel welcome. It almost felt like a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" situation, and did not make me feel very valued. I appreciated that taxis were always available on the Michigan Avenue entrance of the hotel (consequently one of the most beautiful parts of the lobby as well). As a full-service hotel in a downtown metro, it annoys me when people complain about the nickling and diming. Yes, there is a charge for the internet, fitness center, breakfast, and items in the room. This is to be expected, and I will not knock the hotel, as it was my decision to stay here. Other reviewers would be wise to remember that. You're not getting a free buffet for your family of six at this hotel. The next day, we switched rooms to a room with two queen beds and two bathrooms (which I VERY much appreciated the next morning). The only complaint I can make about the rooms are that the windowsills had a lot of dead bugs on them, and notes advising guests to be cautious of opening the windows, lest bugs get in. Advice was noted and well-taken. The beds were nothing outstanding, surprisingly, as I do prefer a softer bed. The bathrooms had very nice gold accents and everything in the room was very well cleaned/appointed. However, when we were in the process of switching rooms, there was a VERY long line of guests, and it took 15-20 minutes to get to the front of it. I was shocked to see only two people working on a Saturday morning during Lollapalooza, which was across the street. They definitely needed more staffing both mornings I was downstairs. In summary, there are a lot of great things about this hotel. It is very historic, well maintained, and I felt a lot richer than I was staying in it. The rooms were nicely appointed and the location was great (though it's still a few blocks away from the shopping areas of Michigan Avenue). I can say, however, that I would not pay to stay here unless I were to get a good deal again, as the service, while not terrible, was very flat and apathetic. The desk agents, regardless of the time of day or night, sounded bored, uninterested, and I got a very unapproachable vibe from many of them, though they were never downright rude to me. Perhaps this is because they are trained to be ""professional"". A little smiling never hurt anyone. The Hilton in Chicago is a beautiful hotel in a great location that is simply hampered by a few rough edges. From my experience, my only complaints were being stuck in a parlor room when I was guaranteed a two queen-bed guest room and the flat service from the employees (perhaps the biggest turn off for me). I suspect that if I wanted to be obnoxious, I could've mentioned my complaints to the desk and I have may have received some sort of compensation, though I am not that kind of person and nothing about the stay (except the room issue) even remotely seemed to warrant that kind of complaining. In the grand scheme of things, I don't really consider these minor issues to be indicative of a poor hotel. We had no issues with the cleanliness or noise, and I would stay here again, though I'd make sure I found a better deal than rack rate.",N
354,"If you see pictures of this place, it doesn't really look that bad, it actually appears to be pretty decent looking... wrong!!!! Really, the only word to describe this ""hotel"" is DINGY.  It is horribly outdated and although the bathroom looked like an attempt to renovate had been made, the toilet was the kind with the thin metal lever like you would find in a gas station.  The door looked like it had clearly been kicked in at one point and they restuck the chain link on there to make you feel safe... um yeah. which brings me to my major point of contention with this place because sometimes all you really need is a bed to crash in at the end of the day and in that case who cares if it's not the ritz, but I have never felt more unsafe in my entire life!  It truly felt like any minute could have been my last staying in that place.  The windows were small and extremely dirty, the a/c unit turned on and off all night.  Honestly, I would not recommend it and I would never stay here again.   The ""upside"":  Pretty good location - right off S. Michigan Ave, across from Grant Park (which is beautiful).  We were able to walk to everything we wanted to do, including the Sears, restaurants, shops, a trolley tour, etc. The location alone is why it get's that one star.  Also, the parking garage guy is really nice but the whole garage is a little bit of a sketchy scene too... when you go to pick it up in the back, there is this whole pulley system that looks like they drop your car 20 feet underground.  It's a little awkward (also fairly expensive - cost us $65 for 2 nights - which maybe isn't that bad, but we already felt like we were being porked on the crappy hotel).",N
3970,"Can anyone say, ""The Shinning""!!!! This hotel is creepy and old. Usually, I  love kept up old architecht but this had our toilet over flow two days out of two days we stayed there and they really didn't care! All the presidents except GWB and Obama have stayed at this hotel. That is an interesting fact and tells you just how old the place is. Cool high ceilings and an awesome lobby and bar area except for the employee's. The front desk would not help me when concierge was not around for directions and concierge was doubled as a parking lot attendant/bell hop who had to be called in to work concierge when he was busy working the other stations. The bartender is a grump and will NOT help anyone unless you literally wave your hands and yell for him. Then if it is 10min before closing (10pm on a weekend) he won't serve you because he is too busy closing. Just to even walk through the bar he will not greet you or smile. No WI-FI. The only good thing about the place is that it's location is perfect for the price.",N
4631,"I absolutely loved my stay at Hotel Felix.  I booked a King room the weekend of June 20th.  The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.  It seemed like 4-star service at a 3-star price.  The room was very comfortable; the mattress and pillows were cushy to my taste.  I loved seeing the Chicago skyline from my window. I enjoyed a quick workout in the small-ish but clean fitness center.  Although it was small, it didn't feel claustrophobic.  The windows helped. I also have to compliment the spa.  Again, it was very small, but I actually prefer the coziness.  The massage therapist gave me one of the best I've had.  At $85, it was well worth it.  I ate dinner after the massage, and pretty much slipped into food coma after that.  Luckily I had a comfy bed, and a big old TV with movie rentals.  I totally girled out and rented a chick flick.  What better way to spend some days off?   The location is great to walk to various places downtown, but I can't really recommend hanging out downtown.  There are much better places to spend your time and money.  Fortunately there are plenty of train lines around. I highly recommend a stay at the Felix.  Although I booked a great rate on Hotwire, I'd be willing to pay the regular rate, which isn't bad at all.",N
3222,"First lets talk= money King size room with a nice lounge area in the heart of downtown for under $140 thanks to Groupon. $46 over night parking.....yeesh,pricey I know.....but after fighting through rush hour traffic and oodles of construction the price could have been 5x that and I still would have thrown the valet my keys 9$ for mixed drinks at the bar....tourist trap! Second= Service Bell Hop, Front Desk, and Valet were all professional....not amazing but I wasn't expecting the Hotel from Pretty Woman Third= atmosphere/experience I was hoping the Hard Rock was going to be super cheesy.....zebra skins and chandeliers.  But it was pretty tame...looked like most of the places I've stayed in Vegas with an occasional guitar just hanging out in a hallway.   In the end, its just a hotel.  A place to lay your head betwix the journey.  Bottom Line: It was clean and the right price.....service did what service was supposed to do.",N
3617,"The drake is definitely a classy hotel, but I agree with Kiki that it could use a little bit of a makeover. The lobby and rooms are very nice, but it doesn't even compare to The Peninsula and some of the newer popoular hotels in Chicago. Edit 1/3/07: Attended a tea party for a friend's bday at the Drake today.  It was a wonderful day and I had fun celebrating, but not overly impressed with tea at the Drake.  The tea was good, but the sandwiches were pretty gross...hardly compares to tea at the Ritz and/or the Peninsula.",N
1200,"Was in town for the night and needed place to crash, got a great deal through priceline.  For the price i paid, the hotel was outstanding, and i really liked the self-checkin kiosks.   The only thing that I didn't like was that it was a bit out of the way, which is probably nice if you are doing something at McCormick Pl. I was using public transit and the 21 bus was spotty, it also doesnt run until 6am on Sundays, so if you have an early flight you're taking a cab.   A courtesy shuttle to/from the Cermak red-line stop would be a GREAT addition and give alot of added value to this hotel.",N
5649,We went to the Westin for an over night stay.  The hotel was very nice.  Our room was very comfortable and the bed was very nice.  We both got a good night sleep which is usually not the case at a hotel.  The only charge that we thought was high was the parking fee.  It was $52 to park our car over night.  It would have been cheaper to go another route.  Check in and out times were very decent.,N
998,"I prefer boutique hotels above chain hotels, and at the price point, the Amalfi is a fantastic value. The interior is trendy, but not obnoxious, the rooms are well appointed and sizable for a downtown hotel. The bathrooms are fabulous!   My complaints about the hotel are pretty minor. They have teeny little closets and itsy bitsy drawer space. I hate not being able to unpack. And I never realized how important room service was until I had to wander the halls looking for coffee. Seriously, providing me with coffee in the morning is in everyone's best interest.  Don't make me get dressed and talk to random strangers in order to get coffee.) Those quibbles aside, the staff was magnificent, the room was nice, and the price point was more than reasonable for a hotel with such a great location. If someone would bring me coffee and a muffin in the morning, I would be a regular visitor.",N
3334,"the place was nice, but man, was the shower weird.  it was a freezing cold bathroom and there was no actual door.  we ran the water a little bit on hot, just to heat up the shower, but it really did nothing.  the view is great, the lounge is a ok and the food was over priced.",N
1359,"Welcome all to another edition of ""Johnny Asks..."" So Johnny asked ""what hotels are good but cheap for a secret getaway?"" (eyebrow notched) Why do you ask JT?! Have some secrets do you?! Are you asking me on secret getaway!?! Listen, I like you and all Johnny but I'm already in a relationship, you understand, right? Anyways, you could go to the MKH. Not the best hotel in the city but the price is fair, the rooms are not huge but enough (awesome pillows and super comfy bed which is the most important, right?!), service is average, great location in the city, they host a murder mystery dinner on the top floor, and they have a descent bar in the lobby of which you can order some bar food too. Their bartenders are hilarious and make a fierce drink. They do have complimentary bar snacks but honestly why would you eat them?! Do you know how many hands have been in there?! So I only stayed one night after watching the murder mystery dinner. I don't recommend the mystery dinner (I'll explain later). I hope this helps, sounds like you're up to know good again JT!!",N
4214,"Hotel was okay.  No pool, rooms are very small and not especially clean or well decorated.  No refrigerators in the room, and only one guest per room can get a cup of coffee because they only leave one pod.  I paid $125 via Priceline, willing to stay again but only for $100 or less.  Don't bother asking anyone at the hotel about parking or public transportation, they actually gave us bad information regarding bus routes and stonewalled us about parking. Parking near the hotel is available at 111 E Wacker for $35/24 hours with no in/out.  You can access the hotel via the concourse level (Bronze), so no need to go outside.",N

Convenient location with Panera in the next block.",N
4432,"Great location, good rooms, but a bit old style.  Still much better interior than many of the old hotels in the Chicago area. Just minutes away from the orchestra and Michigan avenue loop area makes it a good place to move around especially during festivals and other park events. A little disappointed when Trader Vic's left as the hotel is trying to update its look and push for a higher (profitable) customer.   The lobby bar had a good pour but was a bit expensive - hopefully not a sign of the times for Chicago hotels.",N
3468,"So the Allerton is the old school hotel on Michigan Ave at Huron the one with the neon sign for the  Tip-Top -Tap... The place looks ancient, and I think it is, but clearly the inside has been totally renovated recently and it's really nice. You have to go up to the lobby and there's a sleek bar area there. i didn't eat at the hotel, so I can't comment on any of the food services, but the rooms were great!! Beautifully decorated and well appointed. We had 2 rooms and one was the 2 room suite, which was awesome and huge! The bathroom was nice and there were yummy L'Occitane soaps& shampoos! The staff was also quite nice, friendly, and efficient. Give it a shot...Don't let the exterior fool you!!",N
2327,"I would like to first say that I am a huge Marriott fan.  I've stayed at lots of Marriotts all over the country, and have rarely been dissapointed.  I was this time.  Our room smelled like a nasty old cigarette, even though supposedly it was a non-smoking room.  The bathroom was so small you could barely close it to go to the bathroom.  There were a couple of hairs in the shower, before we ever used it so they weren't ours!!!   The only real saving grace to this hotel is that the location is pretty much perfect.  And there's a Starbucks in the lobby which is nice. Wouldn't stay here again.",N
411,"The rooms were nice, and I didn't pay much to stay here, but there were a few things that were pretty annoying. 1.  The whole joint smelled like the pool.  Strongly smelled of pool. 2. The elevators were so slow, I thought it was a joke.  It was not.  I, at one point, caught an elevator going up just so I could eventually go down. 3.  The walls were paper-thin.  I heard children running, families talking (not yelling), a dude whistling in the hall through the door.  Worse, was the guy puking his guts out in the bathroom next to ours all morning.   If I had kids, I would stay there again and toss them in the ultra-chlorinated pool while I enjoyed some Webber Grill treats at the adjacent restaurant or took a nap in the very comfortable bed.  Since I don't, I will stick with nicer, quieter, more romantic places for now.",N
5760,"We stayed here for 3 nights in June 2011. It was clean, well kept, and definitely affordable. If your looking for a spa experience, this isn't it. At all. Not even close. However, if your looking for a clean, safe, affordable place to stay while exploring Chicago - with weekend rates of $79 bucks a night, and a free and safe place to park your car it doesn't get better than this. Some quirks which I personally didn't find to be a deal breaker: *DO bring soap, shampoo, hair dryer, etc. *The entire bathroom was yellow. I mean YELLOW! It was hilarious. The tile, the paint, the shower curtain, you needed sunglasses in there in the morning. *The towels are small, thin, and scratchy. *There were no towel racks or hooks to hang your wet towels. I thought it very strange, but on the other hand, the floor is fine since they'll bring you fresh ones anyway. *The air conditioner pumped out room temp air loudly and we were unable to adjust the temp or the level at all. Pretty sure the controls were just for looks. All in all, we have very fond memories of this place and plan on coming back next time we're in Chicago.",N
1419,"We stayed here during our wedding weekend: 11.21.08-11.24.08. We had many questions in prepping for this stay, and our contact, Ann, always responded quickly and almost always with a happy result. Our suite was large, clean, and brand-new. The bedding was very comfortable, the whirlpool tub was great, and the TVs were awesome (although barely used). We appreciated the use of the steamer for my dress, the free internet and the tray of fruits and champagne. We enjoyed the carolers and extra Holiday cheer in the lobby. It was a shame that the renovations were not able to be completed, though it is beautiful all the same. And everyone was very friendly to us. And, of course, the location is unbeatable. The room was a lacking a few things, such as a hook tall enough for a wedding dress, good bathroom lighting and quiet ventilation. Also, a maid had left the door open when we left for over an hour (the deadbolt was engaged, so the door could not close). That could have ended very badly for us. Thankfully, all was fine, and they were able to compensate us satisfactorily for the scare, although it took some work to get to that point. We look forward to staying with you next year - hopefully, in warmer weather, so we can take advantage of the beach.",N
1937,"Nice hotel, but it is near the track so it is loud and it is loud all night long. I like the vibe in the lounge and the whiskey blue bar. It has a very nightclub like feel.  The drinks are ok the service is awful. I think it was because I didn't have suit on or wasnt dressed properly.  They had good music.  The rooms are nice, bathrooms are much bigger than I would like. I would like to have had more room in for the room itself and less for the bathroom.  I love their bath products by Bliss, they are usually excellent and I enjoyed them. They change the carpets in the elevator so you know what time of day it is. The elevators I think were trying to be very 3d-ish but I think it just got me dizzy and was quite annoying. The workout room was small but they had voss for water.  I have been to the W's in New York and would say its about the same but probably quieter depending on which W you are at.   Trendy, dark boutique hotel.  Decent for the young hipsters and the like",N
4870,"I stayed with a group at Congress Hotel in early December, and we loved it. We booked 2 rooms, each with 2 double beds on the 6th floor. The room rate was excellent. With tax, it came to about $130 per room, per night. Parking was not included, but for $28 (split among a few of us) the Congress will park your car in a secure lot overnight with the option to pick it up late afternoon the next day. Considering the Congress is smack in the middle of the South Loop, I'd say this was a pretty huge convenience. We could get brunch the next morning without having to worry about feeding a meter or moving our car.The inside of the hotel is a bit ""The Shining,"" but luckily a lot less creepy. It's very old. The hallways are long and off-white, but clean and warm. The rooms were very clean, with high ceilings and lots of outlets (small, old ones, but lots!). The bathroom was a decent size and yet again, very clean and well-stocked with towels and soaps.There was a nice-sized TV, a huge closet, a very large desk and multiple chairs. Our room overlooked the Auditorium Theater and a corner of Michigan Avenue. We stayed on a Friday night and the hotel was busy, lots of groups of twenty-somethings as guests. This was fine with us. Oddly enough, even though the hotel is old, the walls are not very thin, and we did not hear much noise from inside our rooms. We even took our time exploring each floor and the ballrooms, service stairways, and so on -- the hotel is full of awesome history. Make friends with the bellhop & security guard...you might get some scary stories outta those guys!The only thing that did *not* please me was the unfriendly desk associate upon check-in. She was helpful enough, and we got what we needed (checked in, room keys, a spare room key later, easy check-out via the TV in the room). However the Congress Hotel  charges you the minute you book the room, not when you check-out, like most other hotels I've experienced. Generally a hotel will keep your credit card on file during your stay and charge you upon check-out, in case of incidentals.When we arrived to check-in, I was told I'd need to provide a card on which they could ""hold"" another $100 for incidentals (even though they had already charged my card as a purchase and still had my info on file). When I explained that all I had was a debit card, and that the $100 would cause me to overdraw, the front desk worker told me, ""Any time you check into a hotel you have to give a security deposit. That's the way hotels work."" So I told her, ""Actually, every hotel I've ever checked into charges me upon check-out, and charges me later *IF* there are incidentals.""  Luckily a friend of mine presented a credit card and we were taken care of, but I don't appreciate being talked to like I've never used a hotel before.Aside from the 1 attitude problem, everyone at the Congress Hotel was very friendly and accommodating. The place is gorgeous. The bar is really cool. And the bellhop Carl was super fun to talk to about the history. I highly recommend the Congress for an inexpensive, clean, very convenient, historical & interesting stay.",Y

4205,"Wife and I were taking a ""bucket list"" train tour of the US and had just arrived from the West Coast on the Empire Builder. It was late, we were tired and didn't know what to expect for our $79 Priceline room. A King was not available, so we were upgraded to a suite that I am sure was nearly 1000 square ft. if not larger. The notice on the door said the room rented for $1000 (or that could be charged for it). It was on the upper floors and had a spectacular view of the Chicago River and the Wrigley Building across the river. I had a minor problem at the front desk inquiring about my ""Gold Passport"" and the manager upgraded me to Platinum status allowing us access to free breakfast and evening cocktails. I couldn't have been more pleased with the nice lady who checked us in and the hotel manager who more than resolved a minor problem with four days of free cocktails! We spend four wonderful days there before continuing our ""bucket list"" train trip. I am not easily impressed, but our treatment here was nothing short of spectacular. Everyone from the Bell captain, front desk to my infrequent visits to the bars, was exceptional. I had no idea the hotel was ""upgraded"" or ""remodeled."" It looked, to this traveler, like a brand new facility. A side note: Our room had two full couches a conference table with 6 chairs and a full business desk. I asked the front desk what the room was called for my review. She said the room wasn't ""officially"" listed, but could be requested. It had several floor to ceiling picture windows and could function as an office as well as a hotel room.",N
1566,"In my opinion, Hotel 71 Chicago is probably one of the best places to stay in the area.  Located downtown and in the heart of the city, Hotel 71 is close to everything.  I especially am impressed with the high level of customer service and attention to detail.  It's nice to be greeted with a sincere smile in a big city like Chicago.  I hear the Hotel is opening up a fabulous new cafe, which will be terrific because the hotel is so close to the River.  Equally, there are plenty of great restaurants around Hotel 71, including Mortons and Corner Bakery. Make sure to ask the hotel staff about Windella river cruises, which are a stones throw away from the location. Equally, the decor of the hotel is fabulous, with an ultra-modern lobby, full of trendy pictures and lighting.  Chances are, you won't even need a cab to get around because Hotel 71 is so close to everything. Situated right on the Chicago River, and a block away from the magnificent mile, it's easy to spend a whole afternoon just people watching.  I highly reccomend this hotel to anyone looking for an upscale, classy hotel with affordable pricing in the windy city.",N
2864,"I was here for a conference.   This Sheraton is centrally located which makes walking to the various restuarants and places to see easy.  It's also a block away froma Dominic's, so you can stock your room with snacks for a fraction of the cost you'd pay for the room snack bar.   The staff was friendly and accomodating.  I especially like that the business center doesn't nickel and dime you for one or two copies or to log in for a few minutes.   One minus is the wi-fi is wireless in the common areas, but wired for the rooms.  If you have two people with laptops, this means disconnecting one peson so the other can log in.  They need to rethink this concept IMHO.",N

The room was small, the closet so small I couldn't fit my carry-on suitcase in it and pants could not hang straight down without hitting the safe. Besides the desk, there are really no places to put anything since the nightstands are so small and with the lamp on each one leaves no room for anything else. No dresser - the only drawers were in the tiny nightstand. There was no space in the bathroom for toiletries. Somehow I got a handicapped bathroom, so it was huge but had no space at the same time. I do have to say that the water in the shower/tub was really hot. The menu in the restaurant didn't look all that great to me and was slightly overpriced. There is a wine reception from 4:30-5:30 each day and the bar/lounge area was nice for a drink. The location is great - right in the middle of Michigan Avenue. This is my new corporate hotel, so we'll see if I got a flukey random room this time and will get a better room next time. I'll be visiting the Allerton often in the future.",N
2563,"After my one and only visit I give this place 3 1/2 stars, but I have a feeling it will go up after the next time I drop by. The interior is definitely something to see, it's cool in a very odd sort of way. The set-up kind of made me feel like I was in someone's living room (someone with an affinity for pictures of naked women since that's what is all over the walls), but it was very eye-catching and original. The ten dollar cover was a bit annoying since it wasn't particularly crowded and we were inside by 11:00, but I did notice that all of the employees were very friendly and not at all pretentious, which was definitely a nice change. I would recommend starting with drinks at Fulton Lounge, which is just around the corner, and then heading over to Victor Hotel.",N
5457,"Stayed here recently for a trip to Chicago to celebrate our anniversary and the Fourth of July.  I'm going to say that, dollar for dollar, this is the nicest hotel I've stayed at in recent memory.  Ended up paying around $130 a night with taxes for a room on the 21st floor with an amazing view looking North out to Lake Michigan. Room was very comfortable, loved the bathrooms, spacious, bed was perfect, and the furnishings were stylish.  Only a few minor complaints - could hear people/thumpings/etc. through the walls at night, didn't really bother me but it did the Mrs. Location here is great - red line subway a few blocks away, and all sorts of pricey shopping if you're into that sort of thing.  Bar scene at night was bustling, though I wouldn't recommend many of the bars, unless you want to rub elbows with graphic t-shirt douchebags.  Gibson's steakhouse across the street was really solid, and there are some good quick places to grab breakfast if you don't feel like springing for room service.   Just like all the reviews have noted, the staff here was incredibly helpful and polite.  They helped us book a river cruise and answered numerous other dumb tourist questions.  When I made my reservation a few months prior, I explained it was for our anniversary - and upon our arrival we received a personalized note from the manager and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries.  Obviously, the Chicago hotel market is very competitive, and this place understands that guests appreciate a staff willing to go the extra mile.   Again, I've been at nicer hotels, but if you are into value, I don't think you can beat Sutton Place.",N
3381,"Oops, they failed to cancel our prior reservation and charged us for two stays.  They refused to give us a confirmation number when we changed the date because ""they don't use confirmation numbers"", yet they screwed it up.  We didn't know until after our stay.  Two stars off for you, Essucks Inn",N
2529,"I was going on a booze cruise Saturday night and didn't want to drive. I had made the reservation about a month ago, but didn't realize that the LaSalle run was on Sunday. The place was packed to the rafters. I checked in at 3:45 and the line was pretty long but it moved quickly. I asked for a king size because I was told on the phone that doubles were the only thing available. I was very suprised when they gave it to me with a full bar and living room overlooking Grant Park. Score! I was going to put the bag full-o-liquor in the washroom. I called everyone over for a pre-boat party. We almost didn't make it. The room was nice. It had a bed that folded into the wall? It was a little low, but very comfortable. The decor? Hmm. A little dated. I know that they spent 185 million 22 years ago to gut the joint. But. It's 07 going on 8. Spring for some curtains at least. What would Paris say? But, who am I to bitch. I just got jacked up. It's a beautiful hotel. Just not as nice as the competition. And that list keeps growing.",N
5353,"We hosted our wedding reception here. For all brides and grooms out there- pass on this place. We had several issues occur- from being passed around among three wedding coordinators to the wrong chair cover color! HUGE mistakes were made, luckily we were reimbursed for our troubles. If you are willing to spend the money for a downtown reception- do not book here. I thought since we were the only event that evening, everything would be perfect but they managed to screw up royally by double booking my bridal suit and not being able to raise and lower the lighting.  On a positive note, the wait staff was amazing.  My husband and I were very pleased with the food and dinner service. The steak received great reviews from our guests. The chicken was delicious too. If you are a perfectionist like me, this place does not fit the bill.",Y
4132,"This is a nice enough hotel. I recently stayed here for 5 nights on a vacation and it was not a bad experience. Our room was, according to the girl at the front desk, recently renovated. I believe it, it was pretty swank and modern inside and had a nice view looking out at the river. The Bathroom was a good size. The afforementioned front desk employee was very nice. It was pricey, which is understandable given the location, but that price not does not include wi-fi. Very dissappointing. It may seem like a trifling complaint, but in this day and age wi-fi is as basic as cable tv in hotels. Also, housekeeping comes by very early, which is no big deal unless you forget to throw the ""privacy"" sign on the doorknob the night before in your drunken stupor. The location is very central and convenient to the all the train lines, but is more shoppy and businessy than anything. Not a lot of exciting bars in the area, but cabs and trains are everywhere so it doesn't really matter. Parking looked like a giant pain, the front check-in lot was always a tangle of poorly places vehicles. In short, not a bad hotel by any means but i will try someplace else next time.",N
269,"I'm surprised this hotel got such great reviews. I suppose my experience wasn't bad but it certainly was not 4 stars. I must have gotten a non-renovated room because it was really small, dingy, the hair dryer didn't really work and everything inside was a little on the small side, all these small nooks and crannies made it uncertain what exactly it was I was supposed to use. Overall check in was easy, check out was easier. They held the bags on the last day since my flight out wasn't until late. The place was mediocre priced but for the room and the amenities that I received, I would have expected it to be even lower. The location is great but sort of overshadowed by the Hancock building. It's easy to get taxi's from this area as it is right near Magnificent Mile. There was nothing bad about the stay, but it was definitely unimpressive and could have been better in some ways taking note of the price. I will probably hesitate to stay here again unless I get a killer deal.",N
1041,"We decided last minute to head to the city for the weekend. We did the usuall research and shopping on travel sites and came across the Amalfi. We prefer boutique type hotels over the huge mainstream hotels in the city, a couple of our other favs (the W, Dana and Wit) were sold out. The Almalfi had an advertised rate of $199 per night for the weekend...almost too cheap so we did more research just to make sure, read lots of great reviews so we booked it. When we arrived we checked in with what might have been record time for hotel check-in, it took all of about 1 minute or less. The Lobby is small but beautifuly decorated. When we opened the door to our rom we were pleasantly suprised, we were on the the top floor with a pretty decent view up and down State St. The room was on the small side but very clean, very nice decor and a comfy bed and a large bathroom big enough for two people to get ready at the same time. All in all an ultra bargain for a weekend room in Chicago. Our $199 per night rate included their complimentary happy hour cocktails in the lounge every night from 5:00-7:00pm as well as complimentary continental breakfast on each floor every morning. The hotel staff was helpfull and friendly and housekeeping did a great job. There are nicer places in the city but nothing in this price range will compare. The hotel and price paired with the great River North location on State St has pushed the Amalfi to the top of our Chicago hotel list. We will be back for sure.",N
3368,"Enjoyed my stay!  I was here for business and thought this place was just perfect.  My room was comfortable - great bed, big desk and a nice flat screen TV. The bathroom was small, but I have come to expect that in city hotels.  I did laugh because it had the tiniest sink I had ever seen in a bathroom.  The staff was very helpful and nice.  I had trouble trying to print my return boarding pass in their business center, the gentleman at the desk took care of it for me without blinking and eye. Nice stay and would definitely stay there again.",N
2348,"This is the first time my family has stayed at this facility. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful. However, even though we booked the room weeks in advance, my wife and I were given a handicapped accessible room even though neither if us is handicapped. I commend Marriott for having these rooms available for those who require such accommodations however the room was very ""user unfriendly"" for both my wife and I.  The coat hooks on the back of the bathroom door made our clothes drag on the floor, the shower had no shower curtain which allowed water to splash all over the bathroom floor during my shower (my wife refused to use the shower).  The pillows on the bed were not the traditional rectangle pillows as they were square and not nearly big enough. Also, given the price we paid for the room we were amazed that Internet access was $14.95 and not included in the room price. Given the above I would not recommend this hotel and we will not be booking a reservation at this Marriott location in the future.",N
5179,"where do I start. The GM was a nice guy for handling the incident I had. Anthony -the Concierge - set me up with a massage when the reservation at the spa i requested was unavailable. Anthony said he knew this spa and it was nice. He set me up and quoted me a price of $125, When i got to the spa (which was actually a seedy nail and hair salon) i saw on the front window that a massage for an hour was $100 with 20% off. At the end of the massage I gave the lady $100 and said thanks you can keep the change, She insisted that I got ""A Hotel Rate"" because Anthony set me up. She called Anthony and confirmed the rate then told me she had to go and pay Anthony the difference - $45. She then offered me a ride to the hotel since she was going there which I declined. In short - shady dealings with this place. I was quite taken back. The GM Selman comp'd me a night but , I felt swindled big time. Stay somewhere else. The concierge has something going on...",Y
5099,"Booked the room blind through hotwire for $75 a night.  The room was totally worth $75 a night...there is no way it is worth the standard rate of over $200 a night.  The beds were comfortable and we had a great view of the city.  Nice large flat screen TV.  I didn't mind that the room may have been on the small side as some other guests mentioned on here.  If I had paid the full rate I may have been more irked...but we were only there to sleep so not a big deal at all.  We stayed in the Executive levels of the hotel..not sure if that makes any difference whatsoever in the rooms.  Sore points:  They charge for EVERYTHING.  Parking, gym use, internet...don't open that bottle of water they leave out...it's not free.  They even charged me $1.50 to make a local call.  I don't mind nominal fees, but $43 a night for parking, $15 per day of internet use....adds up quick.    We were afraid to touch the complimentary coffee or turn on the lights for fear of hidden charges!  They also sell jewelry in the lobby which I thought was kind of tacky.  I'll leave on a positive note because despite my griping, it's not a bad hotel:  The rooms were comfortable and guest services were helpful and efficient.  The soaps/shampoos were Crabtree and Evelyn which I love.  This is a business class hotel, not a luxury hotel...so if you're expecting the royal treatment it's probably not going to happen.  If you can get a great deal through priceline, hotwire etc to offset the cost of parking, go for it!",Y
4386,"Really pretty hotel! Walking in and seeing the reception/ bar area it's rather breath taking. Painted ceilings and just really pretty architecture inside. The halls to the rooms are a bit confusing as we got lost on our first go round, but all the maids in the hallways working were super friendly and directed us correctly. The room was really cute and very spacious. We had a double bed room and it also came with desk, a large comfy chair and ottoman. TV was old school CRT but no big deal. I peeked into other rooms as we would walk around the halls and some were not nearly as large and others appeared to have rooms within rooms. Bathroom was pretty standard and the tub made me feel claustrophobic without a curved shower rod. The bed was comfortable and I really liked all the decor of the hotel inside rooms and inside the halls. We had an issue with the shower and the maintenance guy came right away and we also got extra towels very quickly after requested. Concierge was super helpful and friendly and booked us our tour bus tickets online to save us 10%. Also, great people watching in the bar area. Careful though, I got caught checking someone out. http://Embarassed.com I enjoyed my brief stay here and found the location to be very convenient.",N
4716,"The B & B's great location was the first reason I chose to stay here.  I was in town on business for 2 days and since I used to live in Chicago I knew there would be a lot of things to do within walking distance of the inn.  It's a cute place with some antique furniture and a variety of different sized rooms to choose from.  We stayed in the front of the building which proved to be kind of loud with the street below being busier than I remembered.  I had to get up early both mornings, otherwise I wouldn't have cared.  If sleep is important to you, I wouldn't recommend staying here when there's a Cubs game either.  But, for the most part we enjoyed our stay and will try it again.  The staff was really nice and helpful.The breakfast is, as stated on the website, conservative (?) but they give vouchers for Trader Joe's next door, which we would have tried had it not been so busy (again, the Cubs).This was my first stay at a B & B and really, it's not for everyone.  But, like I said, it's a great location with good restaurants, stores and bars nearby and it's right next to the El.",Y
5249,We stayed here on the last leg of our trip. It was alright. I would like to have continued to stay closer or in downtown. This is just to far of the L or any downtown activity.,Y
1568,"Stayed here for the Chicago Marathon. We were allowed to check in early and assigned to a fantastic room with tons of space and a SPECTACULAR view. The bed is awesome, pillows were not my style but comfy enough - other hotels are worse! The staff is VERY friendly and helpful. You need toothpaste? they have it, shaving cream? got that too. There were a few hiccups (Marathon related) but nothing significant to really complain about. When I go back to Chicago, I'm staying here again!!",N
4839,"The hotel itself was ok, but we used the event planning/catering service for a private event and the service we received was atrocious.  The main event planners here are completely incompetent and totally dishonest.  Not only did they make promises that were left unfulfilled, but they also blatantly lied and stated that they provided services that were not provided.  The food was passable, but it was not served according to plan, the service workers were late, and the planners/managers were absent and unreachable when food and drinks were not provided in accordance with our contract..   I will never provide this company any more money after this botched event, and I advise that others not use any event services/catering services offered by these people.",Y
57,Great location but the hotel is super old and scary... like honestly I wouldn't walk around anywhere by myself. We recently stayed at the Conrad downtown for cheaper than here. PASS,N
2805,"From the time, I had made the reservation until I left the hotel, I had an  excellent stay! Checked in on Saturday at noon.  Check in was very easy - no long lines.  Manager on Duty had explained about the Manager's Reception and about the morning breakfast.   I knew the hotel is going through a renovation.  When I got out of the elevator, I was blown away.   The carpeting (shades of red, orange, brown and black design) is really sharp - very contemporary, the walls are standard white. I opened the door and was blown awhile.  The room is done in browns and tans, modern furniture.  You can tell everything was new. The bedding is very comfortable.  Had a very good night sleep. I did make it to the Manager's Reception.  I was great that they had both hot and cold snacks.   I had ordered the BLT sandwich through room service.  I was told it would be delivered within 25 minutes.  I believe it was less than 25 minutes.  Great Job!!   The breakfast was very easy to maneuver around.  The cooked-to-order breakfast list was not long even though there was a gymnastics group staying at the hotel.   I did not use the pool or the complimentary business center but both very clean. Check out was also very painless.",N
1559,I was more than happy about my stay at Hotel 71. I know what some of the reviewers are complaining about because the first room I was assigned to was horrible. The internet didn't work and the bathroom looked a little worn (toilet made noises and the shower looked outdated). I called to complain about the internet connection so they moved me right away to a different room. The new room was the jackpot. Pros: - free internet - VERY spacious room and even more spacious bathroom - the bathroom was the cleanest and most modernized bathrooms I've seen that wasn't in a 5 star hotel (there was a flat screen in the bathroom). - good location. I was able to walk to most anywhere I needed to go along State St and Mich. Ave. Cons: - not the best view I would definitely stay here again and make sure that I stay in one of the renovated rooms.,N
3542,"I booked a ""deluxe room with king bed"" through http://hotels.com, for about $145/night, but they gave me a corner suite on the 38th floor with some amazing views of not only Michigan Avenue but also of the rooms and people inside them at the Affinia across the street. the living room area had a big LCD tv, a zebra-printed chair, a big leather sleeper sofa, coffee/tea maker station, and a huge desk. the bedroom was okay. the bed itself was super comfy, and they have zebra-print robes in the closet! as someone mentioned before, the water pressure in the shower was weaaaaak! so much for trying to soothe those sore muscles from all that walking (ahem.. shopping). but as a girl, i appreciated that they had an ionic hair dryer and not those mini conair ones that hotels usually have. the complimentary business center and wireless internet is a real plus (free printing too!just don't abuse it so it stays free for everyone). you don't see many higher-end hotels that offer free internet these days. i decided to have breakfast at the Skylounge on the day that i checked out. they only offer a buffet priced at $17.99 or so, but i decided to give it a try. to be honest, i was not blown away by the view or the food, but i was impressed by the attentiveness of my server. the space is probably best used as a lounge, like it is at nights. if you have a room in the higher floors, i would suggest skipping the Skylounge. 4 solid stars for the Avenue! i took a star off because i felt the front desk could be a little more organized and that the staff could be friendlier.",N
4328,"Now, I was prepared not to write a negative review despite the fact that this hotel charges an additional $20/day for internet (there is no wireless - you have to plug your computer in like in the Middle Ages). I was prepared to ignore the fact that the gym costs extra. I usually love any hotel, so for me to take the time to write such a negative review means something is wrong. After I got home on Monday, I realized I had left a dress hanging in the closet in our room. I called right away, and they directed me to the Security/Lost and Found department. I was on hold for 20 minutes, and finally spoke with a woman there. I explained what had happened, gave my room number, described the dress, and provided my contact information. The woman told me that she would have someone check the room right away and call me back later in the day. She never called me back. I called again in the evening, and got a man on the phone. He told me that a couple had checked into the room and that they could not find out if the dress was in there until the next day. I called back on Tuesday, and they told me that the couple had checked out, and they would send someone to look for the dress, and then call me back. No call. Then I called a couple hundred more times, to no avail. On Wednesday, I had to leave the country for a week, so I made a last call from the airport, and was told they would check and call me back. Nothing. My girlfriend then called them for me on Friday and Saturday, without success, because another couple had checked in by that time, and apparently it was impossible to find out whether a dress was hanging in the closet before they arrived. Finally, a full week later, I called and got a man named Michael in the Security Department. He got someone to go to the room and look for my dress, which was (unsurprisingly) gone by that point. Michael apologized and told me that his supervisor was out of the office. I then asked to speak to a Customer Service representative. The hotel operator transferred me to a voicemail. When I called back, she transferred me to the front desk, where I spoke with a woman who informed me that the hotel ""doesn't have a Customer Service department"" and hung up on me. I called back one more time, was again transferred to the front desk, where I spoke with a woman named Nikita who told me that the front desk ""handles customer service."" She then transferred me to her supervisor's voicemail (Ms. Cruz), which stated, ""I am in the office all day but unable to take your call."" Is that even a thing? Every single time I called, I was on hold for 10-20 minutes at least. The total disregard for customer service was both ridiculous and time-consuming. I would encourage anyone who wants a smooth experience to avoid this hotel.",N
4645,"Stayed here on my mini-vacay with my OG BFF.  Found a really good deal on Expedia and it only cost $200/each from a Thursday to a Sunday. Situated on the corner of W Huron and N Clarke St, the hotel is in a pretty good location.  A block or 2 away from Hard Rock Cafe, Rainforest Cafe and the BIGGEST double-decker McDonald's (open 24/7 - and I'm not just talking drive-thru) I have ever seen in my entire life!!!  It's several walking blocks away from the Magnificent mile, and other tourist attractions, but completely walkable if you have the right pair of shoes.   Staff are extremely friendly and professional, the hotel lobby is small, but classy and the amenities are nice (no pool though).  As with any major metropolitan city hotel, the rooms run small so I gave it 3 stars, but on the upside they are kept pristinely clean.  They even provide eco-friendly bottled water in the room, but don't drink it or accidentally lose it behind furniture...they will charge you $2.50/bottle upon checkout.  Next time I'm in town, I'll probably stay here again.  =)",N
4399,"I'm going to give Palmer House three stars, due to the fact that our stay there was just over a year ago, and a few things have changed since then (which I just learned of when booking another room for next month).   If you will note the photos that we just uploaded, Palmer House doesn't look like that anymore, nor does the Lockwood Restaurant and Bar look like that anymore.   As they have completely remodeled.   And another thing of note is that Chicago imposed an indoor smoking ban just about a year ago.     While the hotel was most certainly grand, like 3 star (on a scale of 1-3), luxury abounding, I'm not staggeringly impressed by that sort of stuff anymore as I have seen enough of it.    But it's nice if you are with your wife.     We arrived at 11pm and while I had reserved a NON-SMOKING room, apparently they were having a large convention and I suspect they gave away my room.    I had a room number and they gave me a new one.   And what was it?   A smoking room.   I was told that was the last room left (which was likely not true) or they just bumped me as we arrived late in the evening.     I was like ""Oh fuck me...""     And since we didn't feel like trying to find somewhere else to stay, having just valet parked our rental car, we decided to just stay.   Upon entering the room it did in fact smell like a pink sheet trader had been chain smoking stogies.   Revolting.   And I say that as a man that enjoys a cigar after drinks.    It was just stagnant.    Horrible I tell you.   I complained when I checked out, complained on the phone when getting back home a few days later, and Hilton never offered to make amends for this in any way.    And to be honest I don't remember if I called my credit card company or not, I don't think I did, but they probably would have covered me, as this was not what I ordered.   Regardless of this initial bad experience, due to the history and location, we will be staying there again.   But this time I told them that if you stick us in a smoking room again, I ain't paying for it!",N
982,"Stayed here last Tuesday on a business trip. My company booked this hotel so I wasn't too worried on the quality. Def. the pictures on the hotel website looked better than the actual hotel itself. But that's usually the case anyway. The hotel staff was really nice and had offered advice where to go to eat. The location wasn't too exciting - I didn't find to much to do around the hotel, but at least it was safe to walk around at night. The rooms were your average sized rooms. Nothing big and spectacular - the beds were comfy, and I loved the dual shower heads and the aveda products to use. They have a 24 hr business center, free wi-fi in the room, flat screen tv, books, cd's and magazines for you to use in the room, a decent fitness room (3 treadmills, 2 elliptical's, 2 stationary bikes, and free weights), a complimentary happy hour from 5:30-7 which has drinks, snacks that include meats, cheeses, and bread to snack on, continental breakfast in the morning set up by the elevators on every floor, and newspaper delivered to your room every morning. Overall, not a bad hotel. My only complaint I have with the hotel was that the view kinda sucked - it looked out to another building. Not a bad choice if you want to go with something other than the big chain hotels.",N

The location couldn't be more convenient for all your tourist-y out-of-town needs and if you get your room on priceline (meh I don't get paid for this free endorsement) then you can easily score a good deal. ($129/night with two queen beds.) (WHAT?!?!?!) Also, they know you'll forget to bring your iphone charger because it's the last thing you think about after you've packed in all your clothes and crap so they are considerate enough to throw you an iphone/ipod dock charger in your room. Beds are squishy soft. They are totally awesome.",N
4629,"Even though my stay at the Hotel Felix wasn't perfect, I'm still giving it five stars because I know they just had a few brand-new-hotel-kinks to work out. All in all, this place is fantastic - perfect location, close to everything, super-cool ambiance (modern and cozy), really comfortable beds, huge showers, friendly staff and good service and a big eco-friendly emphasis. Three bummers - the restaurant/bar wasn't open yet, the TV movie and check out system didn't work, and the front desk wasn't staffed on a Monday morning to call for check out. But...I'm confident these will all be remedied shortly and when they are, this will be my new favorite hotel in Chicago. Oh...and it was CHEAP! I think my grand total for one night was about $120 INCLUDING $42 valet. Totally worth it.",N
3924,"I could not wait to get home to write this review. I wanted to write this review so bad, I was going to do it from my phone while I was waiting on my flight to go home. One thing that I've learned about reading reviews is it is a review FROM ANOTHER PERSONS PERSPECTIVE. I say this because maybe my upbringing is greatly different from other reviewers. I believe my upbringing helps me b/c I don't go to places I read reviews on and look for the issues that people complain about. I go with ZERO expectations. Some people standards are just too damn high to be honest. You can't go from eating at Brazilian Steakhouses to Applebees and review it the same.....that's just not a fair grading scale. With that being said, I read the reviews about this hotel and how dirty and how old and how dated it was and it kinda shook me up a little bit and almost made me look at another location, but I stuck to my guns and said I need to check it out for myself. I was born and raised in New York City and I believe people who are from older cities with old housing/real estate can see the bigger picture and know that buildings that are several years old is just the norm in older cities. Now to the review: The hotel served it's purpose. I came to town for the Cubs-Yankees baseball series and wanted to be in a prime location since I have never been to Chicago. It was directly across the street from Grant Park and two blocks away from the Harrison Red Line CTA Station, which was awesome. Were there people outside striking like everybody said? Yes. Did they bother me, NO.....I swear, people allow the smallest things to bother them. We got there around 11am, so it was too early to check in, so we were able to leave our bags with the bellboy in the storage room. The people that worked there were really helpful and kind. I stayed in room 691, so the view was in between buildings, but was able to see the Sears (Willis) Tower perfect. The elevators were not slow for me. Didn't have to wait no more than 2 mintues, EVER. Don't know where everybody got that one from. Slow as in speed or slow in having to wait for one? It's only like a 15 story building....how fast are they supposed to go? The room was just fine. It was an older room in an older building, but it was very spacious for three tall guys 6'4, 6'5, and 6'8. It had a TV with a remote, running water to wash up and it was very clean. That's all I ask for in my hotel stays, nothing else. Don't need my towels folded into a little monkey hanging off the doorknob in my room, don't need a mint on my pillow, don't need to get my ass kissed, just good customer service and people that do their jobs. That's pretty much it. I don't stay in hotels to admire the draperies and the paint color schemes.....just to rest my head, shower and the room be clean. In closing, I would stay here again without any hesitation. I think people should use reviews to get a good feel for what you're about to get into, but you shouldn't use them to make your decisions. If it was as unbearable as people have put it out to be, then why are they still in business, especially in the location they're in? You have to meet codes and health guidlines to keep the doors open and obviously they meet them. People just need to grow a pair and stop walking around with their noses in the air",N
3704,"I went this past week for a holiday tea--total let down. The atmosphere is nice and it's decorated beautifully for the holidays. I enjoyed the harpist, but found the roving carolers slightly annoying. They were good, but I would have appreciated them more if they didn't sing over my table every 15 minutes. The tea selection was nice and the service was very good, but the food. Total waste of money. Probably one of the worst teas imaginable. The scones were ROCK hard, totally inedible. I had a similar one on United Airlines recently. The sandwiches were ok, but nothing to save the overall selection. I only tried the strawberry tart among the deserts. I LOVE strawberry tarts, so I was totally disappointed when they managed to mess this one up as well. The strawberries were good but the crust was hard and stale tasting. Also, the champagne they advertise is $30 a glass. They also have one for $11, but they promote the $30 glass--I'm sorry but that's ridiculous. We asked for the wine list and had a glass of wine instead. If you're not picky about food or have not been to a proper tea before, it's a nice experience but for such a first rate hotel I expected more.",N
2461,"Pros: Great location across from Grant Park, easy to get a cab, starbucks across the street under the Blackstone, good food/bar options in the hotel, easily top 5 hotel gyms in the country (huge gym w/ free weights/machines, track around it all, full pool, etc...) Cons: None really, can be pricey, rooms are a little more dated than the rooms across the street at the Blackstone.",N
3431,"For being a very old hotel--this place looks great and they did a fantastic job remodeling. For being as expensive as the room was, my boyfriend and I were displeased with some things, but were generally happy with what we got. Pros: -BIG TV, and I don't know what the person below me is talking about cause there was definitely free TV. -BIG comfy bed -Decent sized room, the bathroom was tiny, but the room was very well laid out -Quick check in -Great location on Michigan Ave. -Bath and Body Works shampoo and conditioner -Nice shower Cons: -You get charged if you use the fridge (I am noticing this a lot in Chicago hotels, starting to tick me off) -View was the fire escape -NO COFFEE MAKER! -Lights had to be manually turned on, no switch -No continental breakfast -Tiny bathroom All and all, not a terrible place by any means. The room is very swanky and the price wasn't terrible, but we would've at least liked free coffee in our room and the ability to use our fridge without a price attached. I had a wonderful dinner at Tavern that I couldn't bring home cause I wasn't about to pay $25 to use a fridge.",N
1368,"I feel like this hotel should be rated much better in hotel class and overall rating than it is. I think very little credit is given where it's due because this is quite a nice place to stay. It has a fantastic location, the rooms are comfortably roomy for a city hotel and the price is literally just right. I was here for a week and I felt absolutely comfortable and happy to stay here. The room service was impeccable and very consistent, the bed was ultra comfortable, the showers were pretty awesome. The only complaint is that their toilets are so high off the ground. You know what I'm talking about ... The staff is friendly, the lobby is small but cozy. The bar at the lobby is nice and they have free wifi in the lobby. The bell men take extra good care of your bags when you need help or to check them in and I only paid a small price for being right around the corner from Louis Vuitton and Gucci every, single, day. I should take that back, I actually ended up losing 90% of my wallet contents inside LV since I saw it every day, day in and day out while I was there, but that's another story. I recommend this as a steps away place to Michigan Ave and a fantastically priced, well located, well amenitie'd hotel in the heart of Chicago.",N
4641,"I was so excited about staying at this cute little hotel, and it did not (really) disappoint. Service: was excellent throughout. The staff was no nice and helpful in directing me to my nearest Starbucks etc. Decor: lobby was gorgeous and adorable. I loved the fire and the things hanging from the ceiling. The little bar/coffee bar is a cute intimate touch. Rooms: were very cute. They're really small, but for one person on a business trip, it was great. There were nice little touches that you don't see in other hotels. Only one tiny window in each room though. Location--EXCELLENT. Other: I hate elevators and the elevators in the hotel were a little bit sketchy. I was afraid they would get stuck. Overall: Love that its LEED certified, love the decor, love the location. Get new elevators and its 5 stars! That said, I'd stay here again!",N
1471,"Complete disappointment. Problems: 1. The alarm clock/stereo thing was broken in my room. It was constantly emitting low, changing hissing noises. Sooo annoying. And there was no off switch on the damn thing. I had to move the bed to unplug it (the outlet was wayyy back, buried behind the big bed). I kept hearing it, and didn't realize what it was, until it had kept me awake for a few hours. 2. The shower was ONLY incredibly hot. Turn it all the way cold...very hot. Turn it to hot, and you get boiling hot. Grrrrreat. So how do I get water that won't scald me? This is very inconvenient early in the morning when you need a shower and are in a hurry, and have to dance into and out of painfully hot water. Good job Omni! 3. Hallway carpets are disgusting and old. Walking around, you'd think you're in a motel 6. And my floor had been flooded or something, and they had box fans running in the hallway, 24/7, to try to dry it out. Talk about an overpriced dump.",N
1238,"Hmm...what can I say about this hotel? What Impressed Me: -Beautiful building (it's pretty tall and elegantly modern inside) -The doorman/valet combo at the main entrance -Four-star treatment by the hotel staff -Plenty of parking -Room design -The double sinks What Didn't Impress Me: -Parking fees (I know it's 4-star, but come onnnn...) -The beds -The view from the room -The location -The jacked up sink So here's the deal. This is a pretty nice hotel--I wouldn't rave and brag about it being 4-star because when I laid my head down to sleep every night, I still felt like I was sleeping in a 3 (or maaaybe 3.5)-star hotel room. My boyfriend and I won 2 nights here through Priceline for a holiday, so we understood that we really weren't in any position to complain about much. However, there were a couple of things that we THOUGHT would be expected, considering that we were still at a supposedly fancy place. 1. The walls are INCREDIBLY thin. If you stayed in that hotel with us that weekend, we could tell you everything that you did. We knew when you went to the bathroom. We knew when you showered. We knew when you fought and cussed out your drunk girlfriend in your hotel room THREE doors down for 2 hours. And we knew that your devilish 5-year-old did NOT want to take a bath, go eat breakfast, or do anything else that you politely asked them to do. Thank GOD nobody around us got laid that weekend (although they probably didn't feel the same way lol) Minus half a star for you! 2. I appreciate the plethora of parking...especially since the hotel is in a major city. But when that doorman told us that daily parking was $33 and valet was $45, we almost had a heart attack. lol Guess that's how yall roll at these fancy schmancy hotels! We didn't complain or anything, but thirty dollars?! lol I guess that's more of a heads up for everyone.  No stars lost, but you get a warning. 3. O.M.G. You'd think that some of the money they're milking out of everyone would go towards the beds, considering that that's really what you're paying for. I know hotels aren't really using real boxsprings anymore, but the things that these mattresses were resting on were horrible! They made noises every time you sat on them.  And the mattresses were just outright uncomfortable. They were cheap, wherever they got them from. We actually spent the next 2 nights at a run-of-the-mill Marriott in Detroit, and their beds--amazing! Felt like I was in a 4-star bed...kinda how I THOUGHT I was going to feel when I slept here. This alone made me want to never stay at this hotel again. Yes, I understand you pay for the name when you stay at these kind of hotels, but I mean, a bed is a STANDARD luxury. If you're going to act like you're a luxury hotel, get a luxury bed! Or at least one that you can sleep in (not ON, in!) Great big fail on this front, guys. Minus one star. 4. I had a sink that took forever to process. lol It kind of annoyed me! You'd think this could be easily fixed with some Drain-o--why don't the housekeepers make note of this kind of stuff, anyway? Not a big deal, but it urked me. Good thing we had two sinks to work from. No points lost here. 5. All in all, it's a beautiful hotel. The decor inside is amazing, and the restaurants looked lovely (we chose to eat inside the city instead of splurging on hotel food). And you'd think with it being as tall as it is, the views would be better, but from our room, it really wasn't much. Maybe it's better from some of the other rooms. Doesn't help that it's not in the best part of Chicago--don't worry, you're not in the hood by any means, but you're definitely not in the thriving bustle of the city. I'll give half a star for trying, I guess. So there you have it! Four star on paper, three star in reality. Will I stay there again? Not if I have a choice! Would I recommend staying there? Only if you have to, or if you're like us, and happened to win it somehow. No need to run from it, but there's no need to run and tell your friends either. lol",N
5261,"In short: the only hotel in downtown Chicago with free parking as far as I know.  Given that hotel parking ranges anywhere from $15-40 in downtown (last I checked) this is an extremely attractive option for motorists.For the real review:I stayed at the hotel for six days, sharing a two bed room with a friend, that came with a bathroom with a shower and a bathtub, sink, small TV, coffee maker, hair dryer, an iron and an ironing board.  Oh, and the heating, which was crucial in the January Chicago.  The location is a few blocks away from the Grand/State metro stop on the Red line, which took about five minutes to walk there.  As much as I appreciated the closeness of it in winter, I am sure people would love it in a fairer weather.  The room was adequate sized, perhaps a bit small for two adults, but the room was mainly for catching some sleep and watching some TV.  The room does have free Wi-Fi, but I had trouble getting the signal, and even when the signal was there, it was not fast.  I think the place has a business center as well, but never tried it.  There is a computer on the lobby for guest use that is fast, but certain sites were off limit, like facebook.  There's both surface and underground parking lots, medium sized and free access to go in and out with a parking pass if you are staying there. The place also has a pool, which I never tried, and also has a pizzeria, which I did not try as well.  The cleaning service is top notch.Is there a better hotel for the price range in downtown Chicago?  Maybe.  This is very much your average hotel, but I'm sure the parking option will attract customers.  The location helps too!",Y
4862,"I absolutely hated this place. Talk about an overpriced, dirty, and uncomfortable stay. If I wasn't so tired upon my arrival, i would have left. I appreciate historical ambiance, but maintain it please.",Y
4229,"No free wireless anywhere in the hotel! Are you kidding me, people?! Given that the main purpose of this impersonal, convention-style hotel is to enable maximum productivity when a person is on the road, one would think that wireless Internet would be a given. As a Chicago native ... well, for a few months, now ... I assumed my time of tangling with the area's lodging spots (refer to my previous Travelodge review) would be distant, repressed memories. I thought wrong, as it turned out my parents were in town in connection with a recent business event that my dad had to attend. Necessarily, I needed to shuttle back and forth between the Hyatt, where they were staying, and my apartment (which, for the record, is lovely and has a fantastic, unlimited access high-speed Internet connection included with my rent). I'll also add that the Starbucks downstairs is a gouging one, that doesn't even have cinnamon or the full array of coffee drinks that I- along with every other traveler/consumer- have come to expect.",N

My boyfriend enjoyed tromping around in the funny leopard/zebra bath robes!  Yeah, the bathroom was weird, with the sink in an awkward spot by the toilet and no room for stuff on the sink, but otherwise, no complaints!  They serve coffee in the morning, drinks during the day, and happy hour cocktails.  Wireless internet is free, which seems to be uncommon these days!  Pretty cool!  I'd go back, for sure!",N
2718,"I went to The James Hotel restaurant for my bday Tuesday nite and ooooh la la, I'm glad I did, as it was a unique dining experience..  I decided to celebrate another bday at this place after changing my mind on where I wanted to go numerous times.  Thanks for being patient with me. The only disappointment, my martinee sucked =-( , I didn'e even finish it.  My favorite martinis are prepared at Wildfire.  If my martini would of been good, I probably would of departed tipsy, ""not drunk"".  =-) We partook in a porterhouse steak, garden salad, twice baked potatoes, tempura green beans and I had the crabcake with a pretzel crust.  Our server suggested the tempura green beans, but they sucked in our opinion; everything else was eclectically prepared and delicious. I wanted to try the red velvet cake but it wasn't sold by the slice and I didn't want my hubby wasting $24 for a ""cake in the pan"" and then me not liking it.  Thus, on the house, our server presented me with a fancy slice of chocolate cake with happy birthday written in chocolate on the plate.  Thank you. It was a unique, celebratory dinner experience at The James Hotel. And to think, I had never heard of The James Hotel.  This place is a gem, and the restroom was unique also, magnificent.",N
1843,"This place is way overrated.  Actually, for a party in the lobby area the place is fantastic and amazing.  But as far as the rooms... and people..  It seems as though they have some severe service/management/upkeep issues.  Well, except Jessica is great! The rooms are small--not ""hotel in the city"" small, but Times Square Hotel in the City Small.  (The room 10' wide and was no more than 160 square feet).  The bathroom was extremely tiny, as I sat on the toilet my foot had to rest on the metal doorstop.  But that's the least of their problems. The shower didn't drain, and I didn't want to take a bath. So I ended up taking a shower in water that got to be over 6"" deep...   I told the maid (who came and knocked on our door at 9, even though we were only staying one day and had requested a late check out--something a good hotel would make note of and not bother interrupting you over) ... they came and fixed it, but still a hassle. There was no room service menu in our room, just a ""Dining In"" book... But then there was a Room Service button on our phone, so I'm pretty sure they did have regular room service.  We ordered breakfast, it took 45 minutes to get our order, then it came and it wasn't correct.  They serve potatoes but didn't bring ketchup.  They serve toast but didn't bring BUTTER?  How can room service not bring butter for toast?  It was $48 for an omelet/potatoes/toast, 2 scrambled eggs/bacon/potatoes/toast, and one orange juice.  And it wasn't even good, neither of us finished eating even half of it. The room wasn't wide enough to have the TV in front of the bed, it was off to the side and didn't really pull out/rotate so you could watch it head on...   (BTW, someone else on here complained about it, but not having FOX News on their channel lineup is a good thing as far as I'm concerned.... ).  If they really were as hip as they think they are, they could have easily put a flat panel TV on the wall in front of the bed... The lobby space is very architecturally pleasing; the hallways are filled with the wafting smell of gardenia, which I like.... The door man didn't bother to open the door for me as I was walking out, he just stood there watching... (maybe I'm being prissy, but he IS a door man, and he wasn't doing anything at the time, and he was standing right in front of the door). We were told wifi Internet was actually $25/day to use (which includes free calls, too... something I could care less about) not $15... Either way it's overpriced. The rooms were very loud.  Every noise in the hallway, upstairs hotel room, adjacent room, outside cars, el, etc were heard.   Parking is $38 which is high but is probably fairly average for hotel rates, even though garages in the area aren't more than $20/day. I'm never staying here again, and will highly recommend against it to anyone who asks.   And if you do go, avoid room 609... As cute as it sounds, it's just bad news!   I hope not all W Hotels are like this one.  Insanity reigns at the W City Center.",N
406,"The Hilton Garden Inn is on the corner of Grand and State, a busy intersection with a Red Line ""L"" station. This is a relatively new hotel, so the rooms are standard-sized but still spacious enough compared to rooms at older hotels.

The Weber Grill restaurant is connected to the lobby on the main level, so the public restrooms are very convenient if you have to go.",N

The customer service was extremely poor, and the management is terrible. In fact, we were hung up on by a manager when calmly inquiring about the new room rate. This was a terrible trip for us, and I do NOT recommend spending your money at a Marriott Hotel!!! They do not follow their core mission and values.",Y
2420,"I want to steal their pillows. I'm used to staying at more budget-friendly hotels, but when planning my short stay in Chicago, this Hilton was actually cheaper than some of the other hotels downtown, so I jumped on it. I really enjoyed my stay here. I was allowed to check in early when I arrived, which was very much appreciated, as I was a hot ass mess from walking and dragging my suitcase the few blocks from the blue line. I asked about a room with a view, but it was another $25/night, so I passed. My room did not have the infamous (?) two bathroom setup, but my one bathroom was just fine. My water pressure was great, even up on the 19th floor, and my fixtures weren't tarnished and looked really nice, unlike what some of the other reviewers experienced. The bed was super comfortable, and I loved how white and crisp the sheets and duvet were. And their pillows - oh my God, I wanted to steal them all, they felt like clouds under my head. The location of the hotel was nice, just a few blocks away from the Harrision red line stop, so it is super convenient to get to/from places pretty quickly. What I really liked was the check out process. Maybe other hotels have this, but I've never experienced it. Not only did I not have to wait in line to check out, like the mass of people that were doing so when I left on Sunday morning, but I was able to print out my boarding pass for free! All I had to do was check out through my TV, then send my boarding pass to their print station in the lobby. Genius, and pain free. When the mood hits me to get back up to Chicago, I will definitely be checking out the Hilton again.",N

939,"I mean its a Red  Roof Inn- your expectations has got to be really really low already but if you stay here- make sure they are even lower than usual.  I'm glad that I was able to stay here for Labor Day weekend for 6 days and only paid a few hundred bucks. My girlfriends and I only there at night to sleep but below are the pros and cons. Pros: - Nice lobby- that needs to transcend to the bedroom- looks like they might be getting there - Free wifi - Cheap - Right across the street from Garret's popcorn - 1 block away from Michigan Avenue and major public transportation - Walking distance to a Dunkin Donuts, 7-11, Corner Bakery, etc. - Able to leave items locked up before checking and after when you have checked out already - A safe, hair dryer, ironing board - Friendly staff Cons: - Excruciatingly small rooms with run down decor and bed spread. Gross - Our 16th floor room had no view whatsoever other than other tall buildings - Super small bathroom- I had to put on makeup with the bigger mirror on the floor lobby - Only 2 elevators and one broke at one point so only one can be used - No full length mirror anywhere :/ - No bathroom in the lobby area Next time I go to Chicago I think it may be worth it to spend a little bit more money to stay at a better place. I'd stay here for something cheaper or free though since the location is spot on. Its right across the street from a Marriot and I'm sure people that stayed there the same amount of time payed 3x as much as we did.",N

We were on the 14th floor and had a beautiful view of Lake Michigan and the Navy Pier.  Now, we didn't understand the swinging wooden doors between the bathroom and the room but it didn't bother us enough to complain about it. We just thought it odd. We were there just to have a girls weekend and when we asked the Whatever Whatever staff on suggestions on night life they were very helpful and sent us to some great shows and made the reservations and arranged a car to take us there!

3710,"Wow. This place just oozes elegance. I've heard of the Drake in movies, and have known some people that have stayed here, but I've never been here myself. And now that I have, anytime I'm invited I will be sure to show up. For a couple reasons. 1) Because you know that the food is going to be good. 2) Anytime you come here especially with a date or on a date I'm pretty sure you're gonna get some just based on general principal. 3) It actually feels good to go somewhere that you pass by so often on LSD, and that has so much historical significance. The restaurant inside is the famous Coq D'or. This is where Joe DiMaggio and Marylin Monroe carved their names into one of the booths. I came here for a little private wedding reception in room 550 which is the Princess Diana suite. And yes it does look fit for a princess. The view is out to lsd and the beach, and the bedroom is just about the same square footage as my last apartment. But when I think about if I would stay here... probably not. It's in an area where gucci and louis vitton are right across the street. So not only will it be a pretty penny, but it will also piss you off when you walk out the door and see an old couple expect you to wait in line behind them just because they have old money. So for the same price you will get a larger room at let's say the wit or the sofitel. But if you're in the area walk into the lobby and go back to the 50's and 60's. You almost feel like an expectation to see Kathleen Turner and Dustin Hoffman to walk through the lobby from the graduate.",N
1594,"Location and view were top-notch, and the lobby at 71 was impressive. Staff was very kind and helpful. However, the facility leaves much to be desired. The large rooms are oddly shaped, leaving lots of space strangely unused. The furniture was a bit dated. Walls are PAPER thin; you can hear all sorts of noise coming from the hallway. Staff put us next to the Fitness Center, which also caused all sorts of noise. Doubt I'd go back for the price.",N

4889,"We stayed in July, 2011 for 3 nights. Okay, meant to say just a few comments and this ended up being much more...I will admit that I was a little worried we were too ""casual"" of a couple to stay there. No need to worry. There was a diverse group of people that stayed there - business travelers, young people, ""my age"" range and thankfully older, people in jeans or shorts or dressed to the nines. We wanted a hotel w/o kids, and found it. I know how that sounds, I have older kids and this was our much deserved getaway so did not want to be surrounded by kids of any age!Location was excellent! It was within walking distance of restaurants, Magnificent Mile, etc. There is a small parking lot right next to the hotel but runs about $40 per night. It is valet parking and unlimited exits w/o extra charges. Very nice hotel, though we didn't get a chance to visit the spa, bar, club or restaurant. Some other reviewers complained about noise from the club, but we didn't hear anything and we were on the 22nd floor. Loved our room! We had the Cozy King, we booked too late to get the Corner King. It didn't matter, the windows are floor to ceiling and it was wonderful, not disappointing. Great views as well. Big fan of the B&W Zeppelin iPod dock! Great addition to the room. Glad to see the hardwood floors in the room (there was carpet as well), perfect for those who are a little eek-ish about walking barefoot in a hotel room. Also loved the bathroom and shower. There is no door on the shower so water does seem to spray everywhere. Not really a gripe, but as we were checking out the fridge and beverages, someone before us had already opened the Voss water and cleverly concealed that it had been opened. We left a note every day we left the room, but no response from housekeeping. There was also a large hole in one of the robes and were hoping we wouldn't get charged for that or the opened Voss water, we never did. There is a workout room and a fantastic locker room! Regular showers along with multi-jet showers. The multi-jet showers did not have great water pressure) and complimentary shampoo, conditioner, etc. They had lockers with washcloths, towels, robe, slippers, toiletries. There were also little baskets  with items you might have forgotten to pack - toothbrushes, feminine products, Q-tips, etc. I felt so special! They left two complimentary conditioners, as if they knew I have long, thick hair! Ha! Just an FYI, it is not soft water so beware for those of you that are used to soft water at home. I used both conditioners on my hair during one shower, because of it.We definitely plan on staying at this hotel again when visiting Chicago, without a doubt. At this point, we plan on returning every summer and won't search for another hotel, we will automatically book a room there for our next stay.",Y

454,"I came to Chicago on business and was initially supposed to stay downtown; however, a colleague recommended this hotel--and I am so glad that they did! The attention to detail and finishing touches in my room are what made this hotel feel like home. Staying in a smaller hotel allowed me to connect with the local Chicago vibe, while simultaneously enjoying exquisite service from the staff, at a fraction of what it might cost to stay in a Magnificent Mile high-rise. Considering the quality, ambiance and charm of this hidden Chicago treasure, it made my trip a memorable experience. Not only was I able to secure a bike rental to avoid the high cost of renting a car, but I also was directed to some of the local galleries in the West Loop by the friendly staff members.",N
5070,"It is currently after 4:00 a.m.  I have been trying to sleep for the past six hours.  In short, this is the worst hotel experience I have ever had.  First, we were moved because we had a room above a night club.  The noise was absolutely awful.  A few minutes ago we were woken up by a party next door,  or should I say in the hallway. This has been a very bad experience and, at TWO HUNDRED PLUS per night a very bad choice.  DON'T STAY HERE.",Y
1177,"When staying in Chicago with friends for Michigan Ave fun, this is my hotel of choice. It is not fancy, but it is clean. It is affordable and parking is free. This is great when you would rather spend your money on a great meal, show or food. We had 3 adults comfortably in our room and cant beat $100 split 3 ways for a night",N
4025,"We stayed here for 2011 Thanksgiving and really enjoyed our stay. When reading some of the reviews you have to be sure to check the date. The hotel has been remodeled and are still planning to remodel other parts of the hotel. We arrived at the hotel to check in. We asked if we could have a city view and were granted it with no extra charge. Our room felt modern and updated. The bathroom was really cool and I loved the lighting. I'm a nurse so I know all the nasty germs lurking around hotels. I am really creeped out when I see other people's hair in the shower or around the toilet. I never once saw someone else's hair! The cleaning staff is great. They cleaned our room, made the bed, replaced our towels and straighted up each day! Nothing ever went missing from our room either. Plus, at alot of hotels the cleaning staff is loud and will barge in even if you have a privacy sign on the door. Nope, not here at the Hyatt. We never heard them cleaning other rooms and they never disturbed us when we had the sign on the door. Kudos! As for location...it was perfect for us! We took the train alot to other parts of the city like out to White Sox Stadium, China town and other parts of the city. Just a few blocks away, you can catch the Red line for $2.25 a ride. Thats much cheaper than a cab! Michigan ave is right up the block too. If you are needing snacks/drinks for your stay there is a grocery store 1 block away. Go out of the side door by the computers and the bistro. Go out those doors, take a left after you walk down the stairs and the store is right down the way. We stocked up on water and crackers to avoid the high prices at the hotel. We would certainly recommend staying at the Hyatt in Chicago!",N
4367,"Grande- with the extra 'e' at the end. Stayed 4 nights. Room: Large. But that might not be what you get. The building is sliced up somewhat asymmetrically. I sprayed the walls with Luminol like on CSI and didn't find any arterial spatter or jizzola. (that would be funny and gross) Clean and tidy except for a squished mosquito on the wall. Quiet despite being right on the main drag AND next to the 'el' train. Staff is professional and helpful. Skip the restaurant for breakfast. And probably skip it for dinner. The Bar and Lounge are the pits. Borrrring alcohol selection. Dullsville. Dog whiz on tap.  A hotel as nice as this serving mass market Scotch is sinful. Pool is a disappointment because 1) it's small, and 2) because the chlorine is so scortchingly strong! I used to have nipples but they got bleached off. Hot tub- Good. I hung out with 8 guys from the American Gay Volleyball Assoc.. They were a little nervous with a straight guy in there, but I told 'em I was from San Francisco and they relaxed right away. Plus I know which pocket not to put the orange handkerchief. That won me some points. If you like to have yourself photographed, this is the place for it. No matter where you stand, you'll look good. Weddings seem to occur every 15 minutes. Cons: - It's big and tall. I forgot my sunglasses in the room and if fell like a 2k run back to get 'em. - The Hilton chain buffed away some of the charm. The sucky bar, the Charfucks in the basement. Stuff like that. - The period this hotel flourished in feels done and gone. They need a jazz trio playing real jazz in the lounge. Bonus tips. The fireplace in the room isn't real. Don't burn your free copy of USA Today in there.",N
1229,"Wrost Experience ever!!  I travel nationwide a lot for business every year, and this Hyatt's service is really bad. Especially their Front desk and sercurity manager who work at night time that give you unbelievable attitude. They are tired so you do not even want to ask them a single question!!! : P OK, You can still try to book your room if you want, but make sure that you would not have any emergency situation happened at night. Good luck~!!",N
5857,"Noise, noise, noise!  Unbelievable!  Between the overly loud music and the tons of loud motorcylces, people screaming - this is ridiculous!",Y
694,"The room we had was VERY clean and the beds were super comfy. The staff was also very accommodating. We thought our room would have a mini fridge, well it didn't so the front desk was nice enough to bring one up at no additional charges. (Sweet) We had a nice city view. Walking distance to all the stores. Just a quick cab ride away from everything else. My friend dished out the $28 for self park. Though Priceline we paid $87 (After taxes) for a room with 2 double beds.",N
4385,"This hotel is BEAUTIFUL!   It's a little weird because at street level you have to take an escalator (around the back) to get to the lobby.  But once you start going up the escalator, you enter the most amazing lobby I have ever seen.  I just kept thinking what a beautiful wedding you could have there!  (But, I don't live in Chicago... and I doubt they have weddings in their lobby). My room is huge - but I heard some of my coworkers complaining about small rooms.  Maybe I just lucked out.  It also has great decor, and the beds are oh so comfortable.  The mirror in the bathroom is lit from the back - so it's excellent for getting ready. The service has been amazing and the restaurant downstairs is delicious!",N
1907,"Love it. Loved the lounge area, and that night they had happy hour or cheap drinks, can't remember but it was nice. The rooms and bathrooms were very nice too, a bit small, but decorated very nicely. Bad view from my room, but I didn't mind since I wasn't staying there very long. Location was perfect, so close to Michigan Avenue, Millennium Park, Union Station, and great restaurants. Every time I visit Chicago I want to stay here, but can't always find a good deal. This is definitely one of my favorite hotels to stay at.",N
4867,"DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!! After we checked in.. They gave us the wrong directions to our room & we got lost finding what we thought was our room, we finely found what we thought was our room only to find out both keys didn't work to the door.. Well unknown to us they have 2 of the same room no#'s. ARGH Then we wait 30 minutes in the hall for them to send up someone with new keys & no one shows up, we get aggravated & went back down to the lobby (that's when we found out they have 2 of the same rooms with the same room no#).. On top of this they didn't have the room I reserved/requested & on top of all this the whole place was terrible, it was old, every thing smelled like curry, it was in terrible shape (the halls, doors, every thing).. Not worth the money & we didn't even get to see the room which we figured was just as bad as every thing else. We just told them to give us our money back & we left. If your looking for a romantic getaway go to the Essence Suites in Orland Park or the Sybaris.. We ended up at the Essence & it was well worth the aggravation... Oh & the hotel was on Strike. They had strikers out front. ARGH Terrible Terrible Hotel.. Will not even try to stay here again....",Y
3479,This is a really nice place right across the street from the Apple Store on Michigan Ave.  The price wasn't that bad and the room is not the biggest; but it was nice and cosy. They have a really classy staff that was very helpful. I'll stay here again.,N
942,"This review is written in consideration of location, price and hotel. Location:  You are less than a block from Michigan Avenue's Magnificent  Mile.  This is the heart of Chicago. A short walk to the L-train station. You are surrounded by numerous restaurants and 4-5 star hotels.  There's even a 24-hour 7-11 down the street. Price:  We stayed here from December 27 to January 3, that's 7 nights. We had the largest hotel room, the suite...with a desk area, small living room (sofa bed), hall bathroom, fridge, microwave, two flat-screen TV's, king bed, and full bath.  All this for:  $632.84 (total price, with tax). Hotel:  This isn't a 5-star hotel stay. Let me explain.  The bathroom doesn't have heat or an air vent. The water pressure in the shower was non-existent. Stains and rips on the furniture. And, expect some street noise. Having said all of this...it wasn't a problem. It wasn't a big deal. One last thing to mention, the staff was extremely friendly. You get what you pay for.  But in this case, we got more than we expected. We would stay here again and recommend it to our friends and family.",N
1551,"Large spacious rooms, beautiful views, but sort of ghetto-ish that they TAPED plastic insulin covering the windows. i expect better than that from a boutique hotel. they have free wireless which even palmerhouse or the W don't offer for free which is nice.",N
62,"I stayed here on my last visit to Chicago... all hotels were booked that weekend, so that was the last resort and my expectations were low. I paid much more than I should have for a place like this one (almost $200 a night), but I think their regular rates are quite a bit cheaper if you book your room in advance. This said, the hotel was actually not bad. It's nothing fancy: very similar to your average Days Inn or Best Western, but the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful, and the room was clean. We even got a free upgrade (larger room). They have free breakfast (kind of crappy, but it's free...), and there is discounted parking at the hotel: $12, which is very cheap by Chicago standards. So... I'd have no problem staying there again, provided I can get a cheaper rate. 3-1/2 stars.",N
2596,"It's alright. I've experienced better. The one thing that turns my nose is the $15 valet charge and $20 cover after 11pm for a club that closes at 2am. The area looks sketchy but its pretty safe. The vibe is good but the music is sub-par. Oh yeah, prices for drinks are through the roof.",N
5280,"The room was less than $60 a night, so I wasn't expecting too much.Then I waited over an hour for the shuttle to pick me up from the airport.Its website presents itself as an upscale hotel: definitely, definitely not. The place is in decent condition but it certainly needs some fixing up.I was particularly annoyed by its lack of central WiFi: there's only WiFi in the lobby.My room was fine but nothing special. There wasn't an iron, alarm clock, or coffee maker, and the curtains couldn't close all of the way. The shower would occasionally get super hot and scald me.I didn't stay too long (less than 12 hours) but one thing to note is the shuttle service: if your destination is in the area, the shuttle driver will take you there. There seems to be rather flexible rules about this; in the morning, the driver said he'd take me whenever, but later in the day, he said he ran it on the half-hour. I obviously know there are other guests who need transport, but I wish he'd told me about the half-hour rule earlier.It really is very close to the airport, so only stay there if you need to be in that vicinity, not downtown.",Y
4527,I think place was overpriced for what I got in return. I felt that the registration counter people were not helpful and not very polite. They failed to mention that the gym cost $18 a day when I called to confirm that they had one. The Starbucks inside the hotel was over priced. It took over 24 hours for them to bring us a cork screw that was requested. They failed to mention that in room Internet was free because of the conference that we were in town for. Be warn the lowest Internet package was $15. The beds were on the small side for full/queen and small sized rooms if you have more than two people staying in the room. I liked the location of the hotel and their maid staff was very friendly but bases that I think I look into another hotel next time I visit.,N
4618,Cool boutique hotel. The room is very well designed and feels quite modern. The room is a little small but isn't uncomfortably small. They have central lighting in the rooms which makes the whole place bright and gives you the feeling they have nothing to hide. There's also free WiFi throughout the hotel which is a very nice plus.,N
5346,"Could NOT be HAPPIER or MORE PLEASED!!!   I'm almost 51 years old and have stayed in many hotels throughout my life; therefore, I have a lot to compare with the Hampton Inn & Suites in Chicago.  My friend and I made reservations for 3 nights to have a little vacation in Downtown Chicago -- seeing shows, the sights, etc.  We stayed our first few nights in another hotel and was SO GLAD you had also made the reservations at the Hampton!  BIG DIFFERENCE!!  Although we received very good service at the Hyatt Regency Downtown and the rooms were very nice, the Hyatt couldn't even compare to the service, location, and amenities that were offered at the Hampton Inn!!  We felt like we were royalty!!  The staff treated us (CONTINUALLY and on EVERY occasion) with kindness, respect, friendliness...making us feel as if we were being catered to in our home.  EVERY member of the staff (from front desk, to housekeeping, maintenance, food service, doormen) smiled, gave well wishes, always remembered to ask if there was anything they could do for us, etc.!!  The rooms were immaculate, and if there was anything that was needed/missing or required attention...there was someone to take care of the need instantly!!  For the price...well, in Downtown Chicago, breakfast alone could cost $20 per person.  But, at the Hampton Inn & Suites Chicago, they put A LOT of effort into the breakfast buffet and ensure that all guests have an enjoyable, relaxing meal.  Each morning, we were also approached by management staff who were asking us about our meal & stay and whether we had everything we needed.  It is clearly evident that they care about the opinions and needs of their guests!!  IMPRESSIVE!!Unfortunately, I became ill while staying at the hotel (had NOTHING to do with the hotel...just came down with a virus).  I had better care from the Hampton's staff than I ever did as a patient in a hospital, and their concern about how I felt physically was touching and heart-warming!!  I had a continuous supply of teas, juices, medicine, whenever needed and more get well wishes than I ever would have expected!!Location -- you can certainly find GREAT and AFFORDABLE restaurants, shops, and entertainment within walking distance!!  (Unfortunately, that was a big problem when we spent our first few nights at the Hyatt Downtown.  The Hyatt Regency Downtown was very expensive and you needed a cab to get to most places.)  I will admit, tho...yes, the Hampton Inn & Suites Chicago is across the street from the fire department, and the noise from the engines can be alarming.  BUT, inside the hotel is a relaxing, peaceful get-a-away;  besides, what big city doesn't have 'city noises'?!A BIG THANK YOU to all of the staff at Hampton Inn & Suites for your welcome, the hospitality, care, concern, assistance, and making us feel that we had a clean, warm, comfortable, and friendly home-away-from-home!!  Keep up the EXCEPTIONAL work!!",Y
5795,"really a 2.5 rounded up to 3. nothing super impressive, but nothing horribly offensive either. the lobby smells a little funny and is not very attractive, but is better than the exterior might suggest. the rooms are the most important part of any hotel, and these ones did not disappoint. surprisingly large for two adults, comfortable beds, functioning tv (with a pretty decent cable package) and air conditioning. the bathroom was fine, but nothing special. shower temperature could have been better, but pressure was good. just don't plan on using the refrigerator to store leftovers - seriously the shallowest mini-fridge i've ever seen. worked just fine for our booze, though. also, wifi is incredibly spotty - i didn't even try after day 1. the breakfast was surprisingly not bad when we ordered room service/went down for the champagne brunch. however, be advised that booze cannot be served until noon in illinois, so you'll have to wait  a bit for that mimosa if you go down as soon as brunch starts. would it be my first choice? most certainly not, but i've certainly stayed in worse hotels. for the price, we were quite content, and its proximity to the #6 bus and free shuttle to and from the loop 4 times a day were very nice surprises.",N
1760,"I love this modern, boutique hotel. Right downtown within walking distance of nice restaurants, shopping and downtown business district. If you're in town on business, try to stay here. MUCH better than staying at a typical conference hotel.",N
1857,"In every way but the service, this is a three-star W.  After staying at the Lakeshore location with its drool-worthy views and conveniently located Bliss spa, the City Center one was just kind of eh.   That said, the staff did everything they could, both before and during my stay, to make sure I was happy.  I e-mailed the manager to ask for a quiet room and request a room upgrade.  Done!  The Spectacular room was definitely a great size for a room in the middle of a big city, and I loved playing with the big squishy plum-shaped pillow. Other pluses: * Fantastic lemon drop in the lobby bar (it was $14, but it came with a pint-size martini shaker full of lemon drop on the side, so it was really more like two $7 martinis) * Super close to the Blue Line El stop (so convenient to O'Hare!) * Better-than-average room service food * Late checkout * iPod sound dock Although I still prefer the Lakeshore for its views and lack of train noise, the City Center was definitely a pleasant surprise based on some of the negative reviews I read here.",N
3062,"Being a big W Hotel fan, I had to stay at this one when I was in Chicago a while back. I loved it. From the bar with wireless access for my laptop to the plush rooms with breathtaking views I was in heaven. Whatever/Whenever is the W Hotel theme and I certainly got that treatment while staying at this luxury spot. The cool thing is that they were doing a promotion when I went so I left the W with 3 DVD movies and an official W hotel blanket. Highly recommend this to the trendy traveler.",N
3761,"I really enjoyed my stay here this past weekend. It was clean, the staff was friendly, and I thought it was a wonderful price for you got. The rooms are big, waterfall showers, and awesome views of the city. My only complaint was that I stayed on the top floor, right below the nightclub ""Vertigo"" on the roof so I did hear some music late at night but it wasn't too bad. Stay below floor 25 and you should be good!",N
4087,"I got a sweet deal on Priceline for this hotel - it cost me the same to stay here as it would have if I'd stayed at the lowest priced hotel in the standard travel websites.  My friends had similar experience, too.  It's totally worth it if you get the priceline amount so bid low and pick that geographic area. It was fairly central for me for work so not a bad experience at all.  They put me in a suite that really was great and comfy, albeit a tad small.   Any hotel that charges for internet access in this day is a little lame in my book though -- especially considering what it normally costs to stay here.",N
1736,"Pricey, big lobby, rooms are small though, nice bathroom, clean, nice TVs, very nice fitness center. Location is good. Would probably try another hotel on our next stay in Chicago though.",N
921,"Discovered this hotel with an online advertisement, we picked to stay at Hotel Burnham because of its convenient location and historic interest. We always liked more boutique-style establishments than their big-name counterparts. Moreover, Kimpton chain's super nice pet policy was an A-plus when we traveled with our dog. Service from front desk to housekeeping was across-the-board attentive, courteous and friendly. The architecture was unique and interior was bohemian. Only did I wish they had a glass of absinthe waiting for me at the bar but they did serve you glasses of red or white wine at the turndown hours. Although the size of the room was relatively smaller, the high ceiling compensated the area and made it feel not as claustrophobic. We loved having a descent restaurant in our hotel and the hotel's Atwood Cafe was fantastic. Food was up to par with some good restaurants. At least we kept going back for several more meals. We had no regrets staying at Burnham and for sure we would look for other Kimpton hotels in other cities too.",N
5852,"I agree with all the complimentary things others have said and have special praise for Ken at the front desk.  That said, I'm disappointed by the noise factor here, which they didn't adequately address when doing the renovations.  Most of the rooms are RIGHT ON Broadway, a very busy, noisy street, requiring that you keep your windows always closed.  The problem is that the double-glazed windows are of a cheapish variety and not up to the task.  Couple that with the fact that I can hear every syllable of my neighbors on the other side of my bedroom wall and every clumping footstep of my overhead neighbors and it makes for an atmosphere that's not as relaxing as it should be or could have been with adequate sound insulation.  The bathrooms are indeed magnificent, but how about those things NOT seen?  The renovators missed a chance to make the place genuinely restful and that's a real shame.",Y
61,"My wife and I stayed here on St. Pats weekend 2009.  The lobby area is nice but I started to get a feeling of doom as we went through the hallway and stepped in the tiny elevator.  I said to my wife, this hotel is small but quaint. Our room was exactly that, small but quaint.  I wasn't expecting huge or modern.  I was expecting current tech with nostalgia.  Our room was fitted with a CRT tv (old style SD tv)  and a small fridge (unstocked).  We had a radiator for heat, purple tile in the bathroom and an old tub with a shower curtain.   The location is excellent for exploring the Wrigleyville area.  Bus 22 will take you up and down Clark for $2 a trip.  (don't be scared of the bus). The Inn offered a nice breakfast included with the fare.  I thought the bed was comfortable and the room temp was fine.  I opened the window before going to sleep, but had to close it by 1AM due to the street noise. The price is a little high for the location, but in a pinch you will not be disappointed.  I will not be back unless the area is booked.",N
1268,It's a great location and the staff is VERY helpful.  Easy to get a cab and an excellent restaurant next door ...... also with helpful and freindly staff.  About a $5 cab ride to McCormick Place Convention Center. My only complaint about the hotel is the Internet connectivity......it sucks.  Best Western needs to work on that issue. Can't say enough good things about Chicago.  I'll be back!,N
5269,"The two stars are for the truly beautiful room.  The missing stars are for the fact that everything else is extra--a LOT extra.  Examples: overnight valet?  That's 51$.  Sending out a pair of socks for washing? 11$.  Want internet?  That will be 15$ per day.  Using the fitness room?  10$/day.  Like a cup of coffee in the morning?  It will be charged to your room.To top it all off, this huge hotel seems to have a customer service staff of no more than 4 people at any one time. As a result, it is extremely impersonal (but, I'm sure, very lucrative for the owners.) In summary, if you like being treated like a giant wallet instead of a valued customer, try the Fairmont--it's super pretty!",Y
2723,"Pros: Amazing service, great amenities, clean and high-end, perfect/accessible location.  One of the better boutique hotels I've seen. Cons: Nothing off the top of my head.  Can be pricey. The service here is fantastic, and that's what I live for.  I really didn't take advantage of it as much as I could have, but down in the lobby, I met some girls from Texas who had the concierge get them Oprah show tickets and waive their $40 cover charges at clubs.  Ha.  The doormen were GREAT.  So nice, always offered to give directions, on the ready to help us with anything and call us cabs.  Really really sweet guys, and they really made an effort to remember who we were. They have turndown service and leave a sweet baked treat on your pillow every night... and housekeeping comes twice everyday.  Excessive for some, but I like things clean.  The rooms are spacious--ours had a little nook for office work.  The bar was great--very well stocked, with the usual amenities and iPod dock, but also with actually good late night snacks (real munchie food) and martini glasses ready for use.  They always left a fresh bucket of ice for us everyday as well, which was very nice.  I think we got room service at some point, but I can't remember, so can't really comment on that.   There's also a really well-stocked gym downstairs.  It's a lot nicer and has more equipment than most hotel gyms.  Fresh towels, lemon water, etc.   Conveniently located in the center of Downtown.  It's right across the street from Trader Joe's, which was awesome.  We picked up champagne and wine there everyday.  Also not far from Second City, and 5 minutes from Blue Chicago (awesome blues club). I would stay here again and again.",N
5012,Awesome Hotel !!! if you go there make sure you check in with MR Ed Pledger he is the best!! I had an amazing experience in here I cant wait to go back my Fiance and I went there for a romantic getaway it was amazing!! Highly recommended,Y
2419,"Want to stay at a hotel that nickel and dimes you for everything?  Stay at the Hilton Towers in the South Loop. Free WiFi?  No...that is $2.50/hour or  $15-20 a day (yes, they do throttle depending on how much you want to spend) Tea or coffee for all in a room for 4?  No, they only leave 2 tea bags and 2 single serving coffees (capresso) in each room. Want to take a relaxing bath?  Not easily done in a 6-inch deep tub. How about chill at the pool?  Not if you don't want to be overrun with kids. Want an easy walk to Chicago nightlife?  You are at the far south end of the Loop, and really need to be further north to make this convenient in the winter. As a romantic getaway from our place (we live in the city) this was not it.  Room service leaves a lot to be desired if you don't want to spend $100.   Don't get me wrong, this place had its hey-day back in the early 90s when renovated.   They could really use to update the place again.  You can tell the Hilton Towers is now designed to efficiently suck every dollar out of the tourists and business people stay here for conventions. 2-stars because the place was clean and they allow you to bring your dog.",N
1721,"We booked our hotel through Hotwire, and I think the price we ended up paying for our room was a fair one. First of all, Hotel Allegro was super convenient, just a few blocks away from the blue line stop where our tired, weary feet emerged late the night of our arrival. The neon blue sign for the hotel was never more welcoming at that moment! The staff were also really helpful, friendly, and courteous and gave us some good recommendations of a place that would deliver to the hotel (it was really late and everything closes SO early in Chicago!). It was very convenient and easy to get to other places in the city from it, making excursions easy and convenient. My first impression of the room was that it was ridiculous. In a good way, mind you, but ridiculous nevertheless. Cream colored wallpaper with bright silver designs, a gigantic distressed glass mirror directly in front of the bed (hmm), which itself was pretty ridiculous with its blue velvet headboard and a large black bureau and minibar, with a huge flatscreen tv. Maybe I'm silly, but I really enjoyed the room. It was just ridiculous enough to be fun, and although all of the furniture took up most of the space, it was decorated loudly enough for a room twice its size. I didn't really mind the smallness of the bathroom either, although if we had been staying longer or for it might have gotten cramped. The bed was comfy, the thermostat adjusted the temperature of the room in a flash, and I felt like the room and bathroom were well cleaned before we arrived. The only bad thing was the room service. The guy who brought it up was pleasant and I guess I should have expected it to be expensive but I was NOT prepared to pay $28 for soggy, gross nachos without any salsa. We only ordered it because it was getting late and we were desperate but YIKES. For $28 they could at least make it a decent plate of nachos. All in all, I'd probably stay again, but I will NEVER use their room service.",N
3534,"4 stars for the cost and location.  Check out expedia and you can get a room for right under $100 a night.  Considering it is about 1/2 block off of Michigan Ave the price is right if thats the area you want to stay in.   Room itself is decent sized, looks just like the pictures and the bed was comfy but nothing amazing.  The bar on the top floor is way overpriced and has a horrible atmosphere.  However, there is a pub connected to the hotel on the bottom floor.  Great food, good drink and a great atmosphere.  Check it out.",N
1371,"This hotel is my new go-to for Chicago.  Not expensive BUT spacious and well appointed.  This location is right off the lake and VERY close to Michigan Avenue shopping etc.  This location is FAB if you want to see the city The bar downstairs was SO much fun AND they have a jazz trio there on the weekends that really gets people in a good mood. The room had a ginat comfortable bed, closet and a SAFE (I saw that one reviewer said their computer was stolen - SO you should put your computer etc in there just to be safe because you never know) Now onto the front desk because THIS is why they lose a star with me.  They said they would authorize my debit card for incidentals at $75 per day. Instead, they authorized $15o per day (double what they said they would).  That was CRAZY, when I called them, they said the ""authorization"" was just a hold and would fall off after 48 hours since nothing was used.  I take issue with this because hotels routinely hold your money whether you are using it for incidentals or not.  There should be an option to block incidentals.",N
2663,"Classy and stylish hotel. Service right up on par with the best of any four-star boutique. Everyone from the bellmen, the front doorman, the concierge, the front desk and the bartenders were SO nice and SO helpful. We had a one-bedroom suite overlooking the corner of East Ontario and Rush with city views and street noise. Man, Chicago is pretty kicking outside in the winter at 4am in the morning! We really couldn't complain though. Flat panel televisions both in the living room and bedroom, and the most well stocked bar....yes, bar and not minibar....I have ever seen.

It was awesome def. Recommend.",N
620,"Cashed some points out and got 2 nights at Doubletree MM. New flat screen HDTV in our room (21st floor being a Hilton Honors floor). We got a ""special needs room"".....you can tell as these rooms have no bathtub just a straight walk in shower. Also there are 2 ""peep holes"" in the door. One for standing folks and an additional peep hole for folks in wheel chairs. Did not eat here but did avail ourselves of the Einstein Bagels. Those $4.50 frozen drinks tasted good. The pool has some nice views: Hancock, Trump, Tribune Tower and that really cool blue top building that I never remember the name of. Great location. Michigan Avenue is 2 blocks away. Navy Pier is 15 minute walk. The only downside was no hot water the first day we were here....quickly fixed by maintenance. Overall a good experience.",N
4055,"I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency for five nights while attending a conference at the hotel. The good: - The hotel was clean, the room was nice and surprisingly quiet, with great views - Great location. Minutes to Millennium Park and the Loop. The bad: - Internet costs $14/day, and even if you pay for it, it doesn't work on the levels where the conference is being held. Ridiculous. No, ridiculous isn't a strong enough word, but I don't think Yelp allows me to use stronger language.  Because the conference rooms were all in the basement levels, cellphone and 4G service for your laptops/tablets was also sketchy at best. - I never ate at any of the hotel restaurants, but I did eat food provided at conference functions, and was thoroughly underwhelmed by all of it. - The Hyatt is currently having a labor dispute with the housekeeping staff. If it makes you feel uncomfortable to walk past picketing workers, or to support a company that doesn't properly compensate their workers, you might not want to stay here (my room was booked before I was made aware of the labor dispute).",N
2781,"We loved our stay.  We have a well trained dog who we enjoy traveling with, but we don't want to compromise on luxury.  The James was exactly what we were looking for - luxury, great location, amazing service, and a friendly, smiling (no way!) staff.  The only draw back was that valet was $50 per day, but we also weren't sure what the market is around that area either.",N
4503,"For one of the most expensive hotels in The Loop, I was very dissatisfied with the way I was treated when I went to check in.  The front desk said ""hello."" However, when he discovered that my reservation was through Priceline for a discounted rate, then the niceties ended.  Immediately he starts to upsell my father and I to suite on the executive level for an extra $80/night with lots of free amenities.  When we declined, he lowered the price to $50/night.  Keep in mind I was already paying $125/night through Priceline.  Knowing that my reservation was 2 persons, he stuck my Dad & I with a single person dorm room.  The room itself was barely bigger than the bed and there were no closets.  To add insult to injury, there were lots of normal sized 2 bed rooms that were empty.  I even verified this with the cleaning staff on the floor.  When I went back to the front desk  and spoke to the same rude person that check us in and asked to speak with a manager.  The manager would not speak to us, but conveyed to the front clerk that miraculously that there was a room with 2 beds available that was handicapped accessible.  The rooms was normal sized, but the windows were on 3 floor with no view because there was some metal structure blocking any daylight from coming into the room.  They also refused to change my room again even when said I give them a bad review online and they basically shrugged.  If you are paying $350/night, they are nice.  If you are paying a Priceline discount rate, they treat you like a second class citizen.",N
3760,"I tried HOTELS TONIGHT, an iPad app for the first time.  Imagine me (if you knew me) going to a city without a hotel reservation.  Well, I gave it a try and came across the Dana Hotel and Spa.  My thoughts. . . Very well located.  Very hip but not in an exclusive way that makes you feel like you shouldn't be there.  Kind of awkward going in because you go into their restaurant, Aja, then take the elevator to the second floor.  You can check in via kiosk or sit down at one of their desks.  Lobby is a bit cozy but they make good use of the space.  The rooms. . .comfortable, modern, clean, very well laid out.  And not that I use the mini bar and snack bar but nice to see it filled with creative snacks.  And the service is VERY friendly.  Like ""let me get you a cab"" before you ask friendly.  Like ""did you have a good day"" and really mean it friendly. A word of warning, the higher up the floor, the louder it will be as there is a hip nightclub on the top floor. Overall. . .I would head back here and pay the $100 more per night that it would cost with a normal reservation. YELP OBSERVATION:  I have seen a couple of reviewers that don't post a fifth star for a place until they have visited more than once.  I think I like that practice.  Any thoughts?",N

1001,"It's weird staying at a hotel in a city you live or used to live in.  ""Am I now one of those tourists who would annoy the hell out of me as I went about my daily life?"" you think to yourself.  Actually, it's kind of cool being a tourist in your own hometown.  It gives you a fresh perspective, as I learned while staying at the Amalfi: 1. There are no patches of grass in River North (only noticeable if you have to walk a dog). 2. There are a lot of hotels in River North (why didn't I notice this when I lived in Chicago?). 3. Despite the fact that it's a tourist trap, the nearby House of Blues hosts some great acts (blues and non-blues). 4. The Chicago River (and the buildings along it) at night is still a damn gorgeous sight to behold. 5. It's fun to be a tourist in a city you know how to get around. Staying at the Amalfi was also a fresh experience, as I had never been at a ""boutique hotel"" before: 1. It has a mod lobby in orange and turquoise.  No floral upholstery here! 2. Hotel staff wear clothing that matches the hotel decor (I'm serious!). 3. Free FRESH breakfast is provided.  I could have stashed a couple of those chocolate croissants and slices of cinnamon bread in my bag. 4. Cleaning staff are friendly.  Actually, this is not a good thing because I hate having someone clean up after me.  So I always clean up before the cleaning staff clean.  No, it does not make sense. 5. No extra fee is charged for having a pet. 6. Free cocktails and appetizers are provided in the evenings.  I'm still dreaming about the skinny breadsticks with sundried tomato and black bean and corn dips. 7. Cost was reasonable.  I always compare to the Federal government per diem rates for lodging, which tend to be on the low side, and the special rates at Amalfi were actually lower.",N
3900,"""jacuzzi"" = small bathtub with jets For a bigger, cheaper room with better amenities and free wifi, go to travelodge across the street instead. They are really accommodating at congress plaza though, they let me switch rooms and cancel pretty leniently and were super nice. That is cool.",N

Julia Chovanec the catering manager was great, professional, warm, friendly and flexible. She spent quality time guiding us through the whole process. The hotel staff was also great and so helpful.  The catering menu was amazing as well as the wedding cake made by Bombon.  The Allerton with its Tip Top Tap ballroom was the perfect place host a downtown wedding celebration, we couldn't have been happier.",N
2081,"The Holiday Inn Mart Plaza is stashed in the upper floors of the Apparel Center, west of the Merchandise Mart. It is a decent hotel, and most of its clientele comes for the trade shows at the Mart. Check in on the 15th floor, and the rooms all are centralized around a courtyard over the lobby. The rooms are standard, with the corner rooms getting some more space. There are no ""low floor"" rooms here. The indoor pool can be very crowded, usually with kids.",N
4495,"We decided to try out the spa and were very disappointed in the staff, the services we received, and the set up. First off we were asked to change our appointment for a scheduling conflict. There was no conflict, there was no one there, we had to wait for staff to arrive. Be warned, if you want to ""steam"" first, the steam room is on another floor, and you may burn yourself if the steam has been turned too high. We both ordered the same service but received different treatments that were not consistent in time or  content. The staff all around could use some training in customer service,  staff were obviously in positions  above their ability, and were not professional about their business.",N
4160,"Stayed here for 3 nights on business during the summer.  Bed was very comfortable, had a nice view, and room was quiet.  Decorations were nice.  Room was pricey at $299 per night, but there were conventions going on which booked up the place and raised the price.  The breakfast downstairs was very good.  But the best part of the Hyatt Regency on Wacker is the location.  Every night we walked to some great places like Andy's Jazz Club, the 14th floor terrace bar at the Trump building, Millenium Park, and a longer walk to Grant Park for Blues Fest, etc.  Lake Shore Drive is just a few blocks away.  The red line subway is a long walk though, but we took cabs mostly.  The bar is a happening place in the evenings, but there are too many guys due to the conventions.",N
1284,"Deca Bar is very nice for a jazzy time in Chi! IJazz Radio has free jazz at the Deca Bar on Friday nights. So you know I had to try it out. Though the bar did not start on time, the place was great, the food was gos food, and the wine was tasty. I tried a new wine line, Dr. Hermann (white); it was sweet, wet, and smooth. The price was a little above what I usually pay for wine ($9), but this was ok. I then tried something on the menu; the pork sliders. This was really good and I enjoyed each bite. I also like that nuts were served with the drinks...thanks for this! The space is so pretty. The were lots of seating around (comfy too). The sound for the music was also good. I liked that even though this bar is close to the hotel restaurant, you really can not hear them on the other side. Staff was good, service was ok. My only improvement would be for the hotel to have some professional signage about were the event was taking place. A few staff members did not know that the even is placing place nor its time. To my knowledge, it is open to the public, so we need to be aware of where we are going. Deca Bar was not listed in the ads by IJazz, so that is something all parties can work on. Other than that, I had a great time here at the Deca Bar and I can still taste those pork sliders...yum!",N
4457,"The hotel in general is a bit of a mixed bag. On the plus side as other reviewers have stated the hotel is absolutely gorgeous and truly reflects the early gilded age luxury it was built for. The staff are friendly and helpful, and the bartenders are more than willing to get a little creative if need be. Unfortunately the luxury aesthetics of the hotel are reflected by its price tag, the rooms start at $200 a night and go up, the food in the restaurant is top-notch but also top-tier, same for the bar and other amenities such as $18/stay internet. Unfortunately there is also no wireless within the rooms and cell phone signal is non-existant within most of the building, both of these are probably factored in by the fact that the building has quite a bit of marble in the interior which will block both of these signals. Staying in downtown chicago I thought there would be a good variety of selection for food, however outside of a pizza place one block away, and a hot dog place 5 blocks away everything consisted of the same recurrent chains every block - you will see at least one of these every 2 blocks: subway, mcdonalds, 7/11, cvs, starbucks - outside of that and the two independently run places i mentioned earlier the closest thing is a trip to the greek section which is about 2 miles away.",N

Clean and comfortable rooms, freindly and helpful staff, a great restaurant just through the lobby for those cold nights you don't want to venture outside in and a nice continental breakfast on each floor.  You can sneak out in your pjs and bring coffee and fresh fruit & pastries back to your room.  Great value for the price.  Will definitely return!",N
534,"It was long pending from my side to review Hampton but somehow it slipped out of my mind. So here it goes.. I stayed here almost an year back for 20 days. -Location: Hampton is located in the heart of downtown. It's just a block away from red line station. It's very near to all the good restaurants and Chicago River Walk.Clubs like Excalibur, Andy's live jazz and restuarants like Shaw Crab house,Braazars,Benny's Steak House are very close. -Room: My room was quite big with all the facilities like a small fridge, microwave,coffee machine,ironing board, iron and flat screen.Bed was very big and comfortable.It had a couch and small table.The room had a very good Wi-Fi connection.Closet with security safe. The bathroom had all the basic amenities and was very clean. -Staff: Staff is very helpful right from the doorman, receptionist and manager. They go all the way to help you out whether it's getting a cab or getting tickets for the local cubs game. -Hotel: It had a business centre which has Internet,printer and fax facility. The pool and jacuzzi area is clean enough to be used.Gym is very basic,they should add some more equimenmts. -Food: The complimentary breakfast was very good.It consisted of waffles,coffee,cakes,eggs,juice machine,fresh fruit, buttermilk biscuits,sausage and different variety of cereals. The bad part is if you are staying too long in the Hotel like I did, one does get bored with the same breakfast daily. I did request them to change their menu.Will have to stay again at Hampton to check if they changed it or not. -Drawbacks: It's very near to fire station so there is a constant disturbance due to fire alarm voice. Even when the windows are closed the sound is quite prominent inside the room.",N
4120,"This place is horrible. Over priced and overrated! I paid too much for the room. Expected. But then I got hit with a $50 parking fee. Then $15 for internet. Ordered some fries and a drink and it took an hour and cost a ridiculous $40. No robes, and overpriced drinks at the bar. If you're independently wealthy and looking to blow your money on a less than average hotel...this is the place to do it!",N
5497,"My fiance and I stayed at the Sutton this past weekend 3/11 - 3/13.  Although the location was great, our biggest issue with Sutton Place was the overall service, and the valet.  There were hardly and bellmen present to help with bags, and doors were not automatic.  When employees at the hotel saw me struggling with my bags and trying to open door, no one offered to help at any point in time even though concierge was present.  As for the Valet, it was a complete disaster.  We would call 15 minutes in advance from our room for our car and be told it'd be ready in 15 minutes.  We come downstairs and ended up waiting 20-30 minutes in addition to the 15 min heads up we gave the concierge.  This happened on 4 occasions throughout the weekend.  Each time we called down for our car, we would end up waiting another 20-30 minutes in the cramped lobby.  I would expect when parking is $45/night, the time it takes to get the car would be more efficient.  We were late for multiple engagements because of the timing of valet even when we gave advance notice.  This seems to be a recurring issue for the hotel as they are not staffed properly in this dept.  Also, the staff that was on hand was not friendly or helpful.  Valets/concierge did not open doors or assist with luggage to and from car.  Overall, our stay at the Sutton place was a stressful and uncomfortable one. Will never stay here again.  Much prefer the Sofitel a few blocks down the street.",N
4376,"Busy, busy, busy.  I think I counted seven large events going on at the Palmer House during the two nights we were there.  Think a medley of professional salsa dancers, junior high cheer squads, and large wedding parties.  I found that most of this activity was contained on the first few floors and didn't really translate to much traffic in our hallway. I agree that the rooms are small - but really, how much room do you actually need to sleep? - There is so much going on right outside the hotel that I find it hard to see why people would want to spend the entirety of their stay indoors. And if they did, the beds in the newly renovated rooms are plush and the shades completely darken the place.   One thing that bugged me was the lack of cell phone reception throughout much of the hotel.  I could hardly get a signal - which either says something about Sprint or something about the bunker-like construction methods used in the 1800s.   Regardless, the rates we paid (via Priceline) were super cheap, about $80 before taxes and fees.  So, I can deal with a small room and having to call for more towels or pillows.  One thing that bugged me was the parking, it was super expensive (about $30 - and that was the special deal).  Anyway, you don't really need a car here because you are steps from the El and a lot of other points of interest are right outside your door. Bottom line: if you get a good price, go for it.",N

The decor is really nice and the service is fantastic! ..,N
697,"I found this hotel surprisingly luxurious. Maybe it's because I had been living in a college dorm the past 7 months, maybe it's because I checked in at midnight and was exhausted, maybe it's because I had been having a stressful few weeks, maybe it's because this was my first time staying alone in my own hotel room and I treasured the privacy and freedom. I don't know, but upon entering my room, I felt almost as if I were at the Ritz. No doubt, however: this _is_ a very upscale Courtyard, despite being no pricier than usual. My room and bathroom were spotless and actually glamorous under the incandescence and the city lights, if that makes any sense. In the daytime, the room would look less relaxing. That's okay; I left early in the morning, anyway. Seriously, for $80 (weekend rate) and a free $15 Visa gift card (Marriott promotion), I was completely blown away.",N
4235,"I wasn't that pleased with this place.  I stayed here last night.  I had stayed here a couple of years ago and would not of again if I had a choice, but I wanted to try priceline, so I entered 4star + for $175 and this is what I got, which really sucks because the online regular rate is like $190.  That's how I ended up here.  It's a total convention hotel.  The service is average to below average.  The place is packed and I think its not well maintained at all.  The hotel room if you look closely is kind of gross.  So what that they have a flat screen and a decent view.  I'd prefer clean sheets and not being afraid to walk without shoes on the carpet.  I mean this would be a perfectly acceptable 2 or 3 star hotel, but four stars??.  I'm in a westin right now which is a middle of the road to bottom level four star hotel and it is wayyy better than this place.  The only positive I will say is that I ordered a breakfast sandwich here this morning and it was expertly prepared.  Don't stay here.  I wouldn't pay $100 a night for this place.  Oh yeah, one last thing $7 for 15 minutes of internet in the biz. center??? Crazy!!!  You would think a hotel that puts itself out there to the business traveler would have a more forgiving policy.",N
5559,"This hotel gets a 5 star rating from me because I don't think a downtown Chicago hotel that is affordable for the average joe can get any better than this.   This place is so clean, with a helpful, friendly staff.  I have stayed several times now, and have not been disappointed once.   The complimentary breakfast is awesome, and not the run of the mill cereal, fruit and toast.  One can enjoy a hearty breakfast before going about the day.   The rooms are not only clean, and new, but are trendy in appearance.  The whole facility is clean and modern.  For the price paid, the atmosphere is so well worth it.",N
3310,"For the money, I don't think you can beat the Hard Rock hotel.  The location is great; right down the street from Millenium Park and walking distance to everything.

I asked for a corner room and I'm glad I did; it had windows all around and a great view.",N
4211,"I actually travel a lot internationally for work so I've stayed in my fair share of hotels & can without a doubt say this is the WORST business floor accommodations I have ever stayed on.  I'm not even sure where to start... My reservations were for the Regency Club floor, two double beds because I was traveling with my dad.  My dad arrived prior to me & I had asked that they let him check in.  He was told there were no rooms with double beds & was moved to a suite with a king bed on the 21st floor & they would gladly give us a roll away bed for free.   When I got to the hotel I told them this wouldn't do I wasn't paying good money to sleep on a roll away bed or not be able to use the amenities of the Regency Club which I was paying for.  They were quick to move us to another room back on the Regency Club level.   I have stayed numerous times on the business floors at the Shangri-La in APAC so I guess I had my expectations set too high.  If anything the Hyatt should go take a class from the Shangri-la when they open in Chicago on how to run a business floor.  Anyway I expected a nice sized room with additional amenities, such as slippers, free internet access, & a nice selection of teas &/or coffee.  The only thing I can say nice about our room was the view.   Let's start in the entrance; there was a closet right when we entered the room however the lighting stunk so you couldn't really see anything in the closet & no slippers.   Next the bathroom, this has got to be the WORST hotel bathroom I have ever seen.  The toilet was like a public restroom & the bar to flush was up under the vanity. When you flushed it, it sounded like a 747 was coming through the wall.  The wall paper in the bathroom was coming off the wall & there were no extra amenities that I have gotten at other hotels on the business floor, such as nail clippers, razor, toothbrush etc.  I am paying good money to stay on this floor & didn't just upgrade when I checked in.  There was 1 bathrobe on the back of the door that I guess all of us are supposed to share.  The hairdryer was a piece of crap that if you used longer than 90 seconds on high it would overheat so to blow dry your hair you had to allow at least 30 minutes of going back & forth waiting for it to cool down.  Now lets continue on to the main bedroom.  The beds were nice & had nice down comforters on them the pillows were great & there were 4 on each bed with one in the closet.  The TV sucked the remote control would only work from one exact location in the room which of course wasn't where you were sitting in your bed.  I was floored to find out we didn't have free internet access in our rooms like many other hotels offer business floor guests.  (I did pay extra for this room right????) We stayed 4 nights at the hotel & only received turn down service two of the 4 nights.  Some days we would only get 1 coffee refill for our coffee pot & other days we would get two.  Some days we would get 1 new washcloth some days we would get three.  It was like playing a game of craps.  The only thing that seemed consistent was the morning paper.   Now let's move on to the Regency Club which offers free continental breakfast, snacks throughout the day, cocktail hour & desert hour.  Breakfast was ok the set up of the room is just terrible they toss a bucket of ice in the bar sink & toss in some yogurts & the milk & juice.  There is 1 trash can in the entire room & you get to drink your coffee from a paper cup.  I thought they would at least have a hot pot or two with oatmeal & some other hot items like MOST business floors do.  Nope... you get your choice of pastries, fresh fruit & little individual boxed cereals.  Not my idea of a great continental breakfast.  I've actually had better at a Holiday Inn.   Cocktail hour this was my favorite... at most hotel when you stay on the business floor they have complimentary cocktails & appetizers for a few hours every evening.  While the appetizers were great the beverage service stunk.  It was a serve yourself honor system $6.50 for a beer & $5.00 for some wine & oh yeah pour it yourself.  Don't have cash then please fill out a card with your room number & we will just charge your room.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? I'm still at this point trying to figure out what the hell we paid extra to stay on this floor.  At this point I've vowed to stay at the Shangri-la next time I'm in Chicago (opens 2009).  Desert hour was ok it's from 8:30-9:30 & was different every night.  Cheesecake, carrot cake, brownies, clairs. I guess all I can say is if you have never stayed on a nice business floor at a really nice hotel then you will be fine staying on the Regency Club Level.  If you have stayed in some really nice hotels with really nice amenities then you are bound to be disappointed with your experience at the Hyatt.  I would highly recommend not upgrading to the Regency Club it's definitely NOT WORTH the extra money.",N
3237,"""Oh and be careful with your mini fridge. It is weight sensitive, so the moment you even partially touch a bottle in there your room will be charged"" and then she ended that phrase with a cheerful, perky, giant **smile** My brother and I were kind of in shock that they do that at the Hard Rock, because I mean if you stay here, you most likely are semi social meaning you would like to have a drink or two, but that phrase alone made my brother and me not even keep our leftover deep dish pizza in the fridge because we were so worried!! Instead we left the boxes on our AC! ha ha But that aside, this hotel is pretty much amazing. We even brought over two friends to see our two queen bed, corner room with a view and they live in Chicago and were quite impressed with my brother's selection of a hotel heh. It has the coolest decorations ever and HUGE bathrooms. Each floor is themed with a famous rock star, our floor the Annie Lennox floor, and there was a giant head shot of her in our lobby and my brother couldn't resist the photo op to pose like she was heh Every room has a flat screen tv and black out curtains and we even had a hallway in our room!! YUP!! a hallway!! And we didn't even have a suite, so I wonder how amazingly spacious and fantastic those rooms are at this place!! ""Ummm adam, I can't see you because I'm in our HALLWAY"" we found ourselves joking about for the night. And of course it is complete with a few full-length mirrors because any rock star has to have a way to check themselves out before leaving for a night on the town!! The downside? Well it isn't cheap. The hard rock cafe is actually located elsewhere in Chicago (but there is a store downstairs for memorabilia) and parking isn't included (valet is $45 a night or something like that!). But you do get free wifi!!! And I mean how could you be a rockstar without free wifi?? I know I couldn't ;-)",N

2251,"Worst hotel I have ever been to... I would have rather stayed in a dinky motel than this place ever again.

The pool closes way too early and that is the only good thing about the hotel. Our room was uncomfortable, they crammed a sofa in there which was a complete waste of space considering we didn't have any leg room between our bed and the sofa. The bathroom was pathetic for a four star hotel and worst of all the toilet seat had brown ""stuff"" on it still ... grossed me out so much. Our tv didn't work so they had to send someone to fix it.... The guy was the only nice person we talked to at the hotel.

5700,"I visited Chicago for 2 nights a couple of weeks ago and spent both of them at the River Hotel. My experience was a positive one. This hotel is located in what i think is a perfect place, right in front of the river, walking distance to lots of places (restaurants, bars, magnificent mile, millennium park).  It is pretty nice, clean, great service.  It has a 24hr lobby service.   Their restaurant is pretty good/not bad.  They have a really good pannini for lunch (brie, with cranberry mayo, smoked turkey and green apple).  Their breakfasts, however, were just okay.  I recommend going to the Coner Bakery just a couple of yards away for breakfast. I really like the fact that they have, on every floor, a filtered water dispenser with empty bottles.  I personally drink plenty of water and not having to buy water during my stay was a plus for me. They also have a 'computer room' with 2 (or was it 3?) pcs with access to internet and printer.  This was great to have and came in handy when i realized we had forgotten to print our boat tour confirmation and needed it that afternoon.  It's also handy if you want to check in before going to the airport.  Ah, the train station is only about 4-5 blocks away.  We actually arrived from South Bend, IN via train and were able to find the hotel fairly quickly. One con:  VERY small rooms.  Very small.  It was 3 of us in one room so it was a bit...  uncomfortable at times; but not so much, really, as we spent most of our time walking around Chicago.  But consider this if you plan to stay here. Free WIfi.  Yes, all over the property.  Huge plus too. Overall, we were all very happy staying at the River Hotel and thus, it gets 5 stars. I recommend it and if back in Chicago, will try to stay here again.",N
1528,"I treated my boyfriend to a night here to show him my favorite city.  I'd made reservations online, and when we got there, our room wasn't quite ready, but the concierge let us check into an ""executive suite"" so we could get in right away.  He said he hoped we ""wouldn't mind"" the fact that the room was a little bigger and there was an attached conference room.... mind?  Ha!  We got into our suite and couldn't believe how much space there was.  The room was gorgeous, immaculate, stylish, and had THE most luxurious bed linens I've ever slept on.  Outstanding views out of both sides of the building, too.   Nothing like an improptu rendition of ""The Apprentice"" in our boardroom-for-a-night.  I don't think The Donald would have approved of our boardroom demeanor, though... The price wasn't too bad ($200) considering we were right downtown Chicago, within walking distance of Michigan Ave, the river, and Millennium Park.  What a great night.",N
5504,"Chicago Insider's tip: Advantage: This Best Western is the BEST and ONLY place to use the bathroom in this part of Lakeview before 7 a.m., when Ann Sather's opens, if when nature calls and last night's Metamucil DEMANDS, you happen to be having coffee at the Starbucks at Roscoe & Broadway, which doesn't have a bathroom. Disadvantage: The bathroom in the lobby is locked, so you have to sweet talk the key from the desk clerk while doing a song-n-""toe dance"" to make the point that you really have to go.",N
1769,"My experience here can pretty much be summed up by the following words: Disorganized, kitschy. I work pretty regularly with the Four Seasons Hotel in SF, so truth be told my expectation level is set pretty high for service and ambiance, but honestly people. The decor was... loud. I actually didn't mind the design clusterf*ck nearly as much as my boyfriend did, but I can see why it hurt his feelings: hot pink, gray, and gold couches with copper tables, and gray geometric wall paper? Please. You either have Special Needs or you're as mentally unstable as a serial killer if you picked that out and thought it looked good. And the service. Oooh gurl: Our reservation was through Priceline or some other 3rd party vendor - so even though we called to let them know we were showing up past Midnight and they assured us that they'd keep our room for us, when our flight was delayed and we showed up much later the room was gone. Fine, whatever, we get it - always book through the hotel. But then they promised to move our luggage for us into a bigger room with two beds, and we show up in the new room and of course they didn't move our stuff. So we call them to explain. Someone in our party had the old room key (which still worked, PS) so we grabbed our stuff ourselves cause it was taking too long, and then like three doormen came by the new room, letting us know our stuff wasn't in the old room, and we explained every time to each new person. Just communicate! There were a few other times something similar happened, so all in all everything got done 2-3 times or not at all. The one redeeming quality? Free wine for happy hour.",N
1364,"One of the best hotel beds I've ever slept in....  amazing sheets, and perfectly padded for your comfort. The showers are also pretty neato too. Not only do you have a rainfall shower on top, but you also have the handheld shower that is propped up on the side, and that my friends, is nothing short of awesome. OH, and if you have room service in the morning, get the french toast with bananas.  And, get a side of bacon.  This is best if you eat it in bed. It's sexy trust me :)",N
1752,I must say that I like the style of this boutique hotel!  It is located right in the Loop and has a very different feel to it than other hotels in the area.  In the lobby you'll see red velvet couches and a bunch of other really funky pieces.  The rooms are adorable- the room I saw was pink/brown and was so cute!  The ballroom is also very nice- they have the most gorgeous chandeliers in the ballroom and it would be such a pretty place for a wedding!,N
3627,"Great North Michigan Ave. location. Had a fantastic corner room with a room of the bay and partial skyline. The room was very well appointed. My biggest negative is that they have no wi-fi access in the rooms, only the lobby area. Although they did have a hard wired internet connection that you could connect to your laptop at the work-desk. The bellmen at the door are fantastic. Always quick to get a cab and help you in and out. The hotel seemed to have been recently refurbished. Very nice condition for such an old historic location. I will definitely be back.",N
2773,I recently had family in town and they stayed at The James.  We went to their rooms several times.  The staff was very friendly.  The work-out is great - they have fresh lemon water -yum!  Very retro modern decor.  Mini bar in room w/ other tempting snacks and a 'mile high kit'.  Rooms have flat screen tvs.  I will recommend any visiting family and friends to stay there in the future.  Room service food was delish.,N
2337,You are definitely paying for location here. I would say that this is a pretty standard hotel that happens to be in the middle of Michigan. I wasn't taken back by the lobby although the lounge was neat when we stayed. It's under renovation now. The rooms aren't over the top and the desk service is hit and miss. I would stay at the Hyatt.,N
861,"Stayed here for a brief Christmas get-away with my son and was very pleasantly surprised. #1 is the staff. From the doorman, to bellman, to desk clerk-- each and every one was above and beyond in courtesy and professionalism. I've stayed at many five star hotels and this staff is second to none. The hotel itself is cute on the inside. I was initially concerned because it's right on the el tracks, but once inside, didn't notice the sound unless I was specifically listening for it. The room was lovely. We had a suite with a king bedroom. The bathroom is enormous. Everything looked new and clean. (FYI, the suite has a double door between the living area and sleeping area, but the wall doesn't go all the way to the ceiling. I think it's to help air circulation. Since my son was on the sofa bed, this was a bit of a concern, but the sound was still muted between the two areas, so you can watch tv without disturbing little ones with early bed times.) There was a mini fridge in the room. The lobby is lovely, but the bar is in the diner restaurant on the first level. I inquired and the desk clerk told me it's fine to bring cocktails from the restaurant to the lobby. I'd recommend that. The restaurant serves comfort food. Nothing outstanding. Location is excellent. Walking distance to everything. A terrific value. We'll go there again.",N
3807,"I had a great one-night stay here.  The room was modern, sexy, clean, and comfortable.  The in-room mini bar was the best I've ever seen!  VERY reasonable pricing, full bottles of wine, and a corkscrew in the room.   The staff was courteous, the gym was clean and well-maintained, and I can't wait to use this hotel for my next romantic Chicago getaway.",N
3835,"First words out of my mouth was wow! I was blind folded all the way up to the penthouse suite by my bridesmaids that had planned an amazing night out. When they took the blindfold off all I could say was ""wow...omg this place is amazing"". We had a great view, Awesome room, and the staff was great! Its not your typical downtown hotel room. Really felt like someones condo. I could totally live there. The shower was an experience. I'm so glad they persuaded me to get in. I didn't want to get out!! You must try their Steak & Eggs for brunchas well! Their amazing!! Perfect place for a weekend getaway. I'm going back for sure!",N
3801,"A fantastically modern hotel set just outside the loop. The place is not the cheepest, but if your looking for modern it is a good hit. Rooms are a bit executive looking, but the modern flair is fun and wow the shower is fantastic. Be sure to bring your ""honey"" almost for the shower alone. It is an all glass rain shower, so not for the kids. The service was very good. I did stay on off days (Sun - Tues), but the doormen to the front desk personnel seemed to know me every time I came through the lobby. They have a nice restaurant in the lobby downstairs open for all meals and a very trendy, almost club like lounge on the top floor with a wonderful view down state street. Overall it was a wonderful hotel.",N
1833,"I love these hotels, comfy soft bouncy beds... lol. Very Clean Very Spacious Rooms, Huge Bathrooms... Great service. Every each one is very elegant and they go from old fashioned to modern interiors. Price is always reasonable and it's always in a nice location, always close to best entertainment & dining spots in the city. All my friends stay at ""The W""  when  they come to Chicago. I highly recommend it.",N
1934,"love it! artsy, great music, great lounge area, great place for drinks.",N
1429,"I wound up staying here recently while attending a conference.  The conference hotel (The Drake) was full, and while there was a Westin just down the street (I usually stay at Westins), the particular Westin in question had horrible reviews. I'm glad I stayed at the Knickerbocker.  The rooms were nicely appointed.  The bed was VERY comfortable (and I'm quite picky about such things). I didn't eat at the restaurant, but I did visit the bar twice.  Both bartenders were really friendly - when I asked if they had a preference for one wine over another, they articulated a preference and then (to my delight) gave me a small pour of their suggestion.  In one case I didn't like the suggested wine and they gave me a taste of a different wine.  They both treated me like I was an old friend/regular.  Very friendly - very laid back.  Exactly what you want after a long day of business. The hotel was a great value relative to the other hotels nearby and the staff were great.",N
5242,"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME with this hotel.  It may be an affordable price and a decent location, but what they gain in location/price, they lose in service and cleanliness.  The specific area of concern is with the on-site restaurant on the first floor of the establishment.  My family and I (two kids) were ignored for 20 minutes due to the server being exasperated (and we were the ONLY ONES in the restaurant).  We were never given so much as a menu, a glass of water, or a smile throughout the entire ordeal. We are still, to this day, wondering why we deserved this cold treatment.My recommendation is to look up the street toward the Michigan/Wacker Drive area along the Chicago River for great restaurants and hotels.  We've stayed and eaten many times at various establishments in this location (Club Quarter, Hyatt Regency, Emerald Loop, etc.) and have been VERY pleased.  And for only $20-$40 more per night, it's definitely worth the cost to have excellent, efficient, and friendly service, not to mention a stellar view of the Magnificent Mile and Chicago River.  Much better than seeing that dump-of-a-train-station on Roosevelt Road.  THAT PLACE IS CREEPY!  Avoid the Grant Park Best Western at all costs.",Y
994,"Ooh, bf and I love the Amalfi. Please don't get too busy and make it harder to get a room here! First off, you're in a really prime location. Quiet street, but an easy walk to Whole Foods, nightlife, and the major conference hotels. Next, the rooms are great. They are immaculate, quiet, and equipped with highly effective ""black-out"" curtains. In addition, you're going to get a solid breakfast and a wonderful happy hour! Each night, on two floors, the bartenders and snackys come out and you can drink to your heart's content. A great idea, and a wonderful start to an evening in expensive Chicago.",N
4466,"My husband and I got a gift certificate for a overnight weekend stay at a charity auction - so I made reservations, confirmed them, get an early check-in, we were all set. When we got their to check-in and they couldn't find our reservation, we realized (when we pulled up the email confirmation on my husband's phone) that I had made reservations at the wrong Hilton downtown!  I was really worried that we'd have to either stay at the other Hilton and pay full-price, because we didn't have a gift certificate for that Hilton... because the Palmer house definitely seemed really busy. The woman at the registration desk was fantastic - she definitely could have just turned us away - the gift certificate said it could only be used with a reservation. Instead, she was super nice about it and called the other Hilton, got our room cancelled there with no cancellation fees, then she booked us a room with an early check-in at the Palmer House and we used our gift certificate. Many other people would have just said, ""sorry I can't help you"" and moved on - she was fantastic! We LOVED the hotel, the restaurant was delicious and the bar at night was fun, although the drinks were pretty pricey, but we expected that being downtown anyways. I adore this place - can't wait to go back!!",N
4418,"I think the Palmer House was once a nice hotel. The main level is gorgeous and the hotel is capable of having top-notch formal events. As a place to stay however, I found it lacking. The place just looks extremely tired. The decor is straight out of the 80's and I think the appointments haven't been updated since. The hotel also does not offer free Wi-Fi, which for the price (this hotel is no bargain), is not acceptable.",N
3123,After having to stay in the chicago suburbs I finally got the chance to stay downtown and was excited to stay here - I usually love W's.  This place sucked.  The staff was snotty. The rooms were small.  And the air conditioning was broken or something - it was so hot and muggy.  The place was packed with snotty 20-somethings.   I will say its a great view.  Next time I'll stay closer to MIchigan - likely the Peninsula.,N
633,"My daughter and I stayed here on Tuesday night while in town visiting another daughter who is moving to DeKalb with her husband.  The Doubletree had a great special mid-week price of $90.  The hotel room was clean and had a lot of extra amenities -- such as Neutragena SPF face cream and cleanser along with the usual shampoo, conditioner and body lotion.  Also, you are greeted upon checkin with warm, fresh chocolate chip cookies. Didn't try the workout room, but it looked very adequate.  The hotel staff is friendly and anxious to please. The parking was expensive - $41 for about 24 hours - but that is expected in Chicago.",N
1938,"I went to a wedding here - simply beautiful - the setup was beautiful and elegant.  The bride said that she worked with the planner there and they were very attentive to the little details that she wnated.  The food was divine.  The rooms were spacious and comfortable.  The bar is a great place to hit up for happy hour in the Loop, too.",N
4480,"The room and hotel itself was nice.  The service was terrific.  All the employee's we talked to were friendly, nice, and very positive.  The service was excellent!",N
4065,"The Hyatt Regency was perfect for our stay in the Windy City. You can't beat the location. Tons of convention people stay here, so be prepared for large groups of people walking around wearing name tags at all hours. The room we stayed in had a great view of the river and Lake Michigan. We were surprised by a fireworks show out the window Saturday night. The decor was modern, yet comfortable. If you are hungry or thirsty, there are plenty of options for food and drink in the hotel 24 hours a day. There's even a snack stand open all the time selling cappuccinos, pastries, picnic supplies, bulk candy, and cold drinks. Check in at the front desk was easy, and we were assisted with automated check out when we departed. The concierge desk was helpful with directions, plus we were able to print our boarding passes from the computers set up there. I only wish they had free wifi in the rooms. But other than that, the Hyatt Regency had everything we could possibly want in a downtown hotel.",N
3319,"Very satisfied with this hotel. Perfect location, view, and price. Room service was lacking, but I blame that on my late night tendencies. Hey, at least they had food for me at 3:30am. I'm sure it is much better during ""normal"" hours. I'll definitely stay here again.",N
4979,"Beautiful renovation on this historic hotel. The lobby is something akin to a W hotel decorated in white and the staff has been incredibly warm and welcoming (even when I arrived at 8am wondering if I could have an early check-in). Rooms have a nod to old-hollywood with whites and creams, crystal and black accents yet retain a modern edge.Some things you need to know:1. The restaurant doesn't serve dinner, but you can get small snacks in the bar until 112. Room service stops at 11 (not so good for night owls like me)3. Free wi-fi in the bar, restaurant and lobby but $10 a day in your room4. No mini-bar in roomMy room was really, really tiny. Boston boutique hotel tiny... but stylish and comfy bed. The bathroom left quite a bit to be desired from the lighting and motel-8 quality towels to the icy marble walls, floor and shower. The best thing about the bathroom are the L'Occtaine products they provide.I did have appetizers and wine in the bar, all were extraordinary. The menu is ambitious and creative and completely delivers. Surveying other plates around me I could see lots of tempting choices! Staff in the bar/lounge were exceptional.Location is excellent for shopping mag mile - it's next door to Neiman Marcus, across the street from Saks and about half way between Macy's @ Watertower Place and Nordstrom.My job is all travel, so I spend many, many nights in hotels. This is a good value for the location and general ambiance. Not high-end luxury, but not budget either. Could work for travel or a fun getaway. Interesting bar to meet coworkers or friends for a drink,  charming restaurant to meet a client for breakfast or coffee; both will leave others with the impression that you know your stuff!I'll definitely stay here again.",Y
3665,"I've lived in Chicago for most of my life, and had never been to the Drake.  Everytime I was driving down Lake Shore Drive, I thought...WOW, one day I'll stay there.  Who would have thought....The best day of my life thus far was at the Drake Hotel.  If you have the opportunity, stay at the Drake in the Presidential Suite.  The room is absolutely amazing, and you will feel like a princess.  The views of Lake Michigan are awesome.  I can't say enough about the room, it was by far bigger than any apartment I've ever lived in.  It's a tad pricey for a night's stay...but OMG it is worth every penny.  Why did I go, the best guy in the world proposed to me there.....I'll never forget it!",N
3136,"I stayed here with my wife and her wedding bands were stolen by the housekeeper! Management handled it terribly. They gave us nothing in return except the phone number of their insurance company which gave us the run around and no compensation. Beware, the staff a this hotel will literally rob you blind, while management looks the other way.",N
3259,"Note this is a review for the lounge. Friday night after work me and a couple friends met up here for some drinks. I expected this to be shotty service and a played out theme. This gem has been calling my name since I moved here but I never answered. I bucked up big Friday and made my move. Now, I'm more of a ""rob roy"" or  ""gin and tonic"" guy. However, I had the pineapple/cilantro martini. Let me just say...what a treat that was. I eneded up with 3 of those and before I know it, i was flying high. The chicken tender appetizer they offer is pretty tasty. I'll go back here for drinks after work again, and maybe for a night cap but this place seems like somewhere to start and end your night rather than spend the whole time here.",N
4423,"Magnificent. Just stunning. I was absolutely taken away with the grandeur of the hotel lobby.  The Palmer House Hilton is a beautiful hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago. It's in a fantastic location -- there are lots of great restaurants in the area; it's within walking distance to many of the city's top must-sees; and there's very easy access to the subway (the Red Line is right outside of the hotel). I arrived in the morning around 10am, which is way early for check-in.  I was planning to store my bags until the afternoon when the rooms would be ready. However, the woman at the front desk was able to find one room ready at that time (the other wasn't ready yet), which was fine by me! How wonderful! It was nice to freshen up and change before heading out to explore the city. The room was ginormous! My friend had told me the last she stayed there her room was tiny were small, so needless to say, I was thrilled when I walked in.  There was enough space to waltz if you wanted to!  Good bath products, excellent water pressure (that is so important to me).  The beds were super comfy.  For someone who doesn't normally sleep well to begin with - much less in a hotel - my head sank into the pillows and I fell asleep right away each night. Just a couple of negatives: cell phone service was very spotty in the hotel. In fact, I had no service at all when I was in the lobby.  F&B service in the lobby wasn't great.  We sat in one of the comfy chairs along the wall, hoping to have one last drink before we flew out that evening.  There was a menu on our table so clearly they do service all the tables. However, the server never walked by us, not even close enough for us to get his attention. Overall, it's a great hotel and I would definitely stay there again!",N
1051,"I am sitting here with sweat dripping off me onto my glasses blurring my view of the screen in the sweltering lobby of the un-air-conditioned Chicago O'Hare Garden Hotel, perhaps the worst hotel I've ever been to and I used to stay at some GHETT-O places during high school for spring break in Panama City Beach, FL in the ""redneck riviera"" Back to the matter at hand.  The walls in the halls are all scratched up and dirty, half the light sconces are broken and the carpets are dirty and beat up.   Not an impressive property, but it sure is cheap.  I was also welcome to some big splotchy stains on my sheets, a toilet paper holder that was barely hanging on for life, and all but one of the lamps weren't even plugged in so I had to plug everything in. Well, I guess this place will make me appreciate every other place I stay at that much more :)",N
3131,"I love the Ws and this one, in particular.  It's comfortable, yet modern. It feels like you are simultaneously in the heart of things but, with its lake view, it's also like being at a vacation resort.  The service is professional and responsive.",N
1389,"I stayed here for a conference.  It would probably not be my first choice. There are a few interesting things about this hotel - it used to be the Playboy Hotel when Playboy was headquartered in Chicago.  If you're into quirky historical places, yay.  It's also within walking distance of Carmines - another quirky historical place.  Frank Sinatra and Al Capone were regulars.  See my review of Carmine's for more info. The hotel itself is a small boutique joint.  The rooms are very small, but clean and the beds are comfortable.  The bathrooms are modern, and have rain showers as well as hand shower wands.  My room did not have a bath tub. As far as food choices at the Knickerbocker go, plan to eat elsewhere.  There is a martini bar in the lobby, but don't ask for a cucumber martini.  You'll get a blank stare.  There is a restaurant - Nix - but don't plan on dinner.  They are only open in the mornings.  Don't even plan on a late lunch there.  They close at 1.   Internet is not complimentary ($9.95/day), and there is a minimum $5 charge to use the business center.  I was also informed (incorrectly, as it turns out) that there was a charge for gym use.  Parking is valet only, and is $53/day (gulp).  There is no pool. If all you need is a comfortable bed, on a quiet street close to Miracle Mile, and you either don't need extras or don't mind paying for them,  this is a great choice for you.",N
2196,"Overall: I just wasn't impressed by the results for what I paid. Pluses: -Very Clean -excellent concierge, front desk and bell staff. Minuses: -I don't mind paying for internet, but this was useless slow internet.  They had 2 tiers.  256 Kbps for 15, and 1 GBps for 18.  The first night, i cheaped out and suffered for it.  The second, I upgraded and still suffered.   -When I travel, I like to unpack and be organized so I can find things.  That way, I can pack my laundry into my suitcase as my trip goes on.  Unfortunately the hotel (at least for my room) is devoid of dressers.",N
4606,"Our first time at this centrally-located boutique hotel.  Parking is outragious in Chicago and I only wish we would have known that they valet hybrids for free, since we took FI's car instead of mine.  (They are a LEED hotel.) Staff was extremely friendly during our 4 day stay, saying hello and goodbye, offering their services and holding doors. The lobby area is beautiful and a great place to enjoy a glass of wine or cup of coffee. Rooms are very small and if you are a light sleeper, you will wake each time one of your neighbors enters or exits their room.  We also found the heat to be really hard to control.  It was always too hot or too cold in the room.  Barely any closet space and found that our suitcases took over the room because of lack of space to put things. Was warned by several people about my safety here, since a homocide happened over a month ago.  I though the location seemed very safe and that the hotel did a great job securing the hotel in the evening hours.  We walked almost everywhere and never felt like we were in a shady area. We got this hotel for a great price on PLN ($85 per night!) and for that price thought it was worth it for the location and hospitality.  Had we paid more, I probably would have expected more.",N
952,We stayed here for $50 a night while in Chicago checking out apartments. It was mostly clean  except for a few hairs around the shower and sink. The wifi is T-mobile and is extremely slow. They have Lodgnet with a physical lock on the connection so you can't plug in a laptop and watch your movies from your macbook. Room was small yet cozy. Staff was friendly. Location wasn't as convenient as the Travelodge I stayed at a few years ago but still a good choice for downtown Chicago.,N
655,"This is probably one of the most beautiful Doubletrees that I have stayed at. The staff are some of the most genuinely friendliest people I have ever met. Mad props to Chase, Ben, Antwan, and Rasheed. Also... LOCATION is AWESOOOME! Not too far and not too close from the main streets of downtown. Also close to the Magnificent Mile so if you ever feel like doing some last minute shopping, it's all within walking distance.",N
1879,"Quick review of the hotel itself - I first stayed here about 3 years ago.  I dig W's because A) I travel alot and W's have a solid theme.  You can walk into the W Dallas or the W Seattle or the W Lakeshore and you immediately more or less know your way around the hotel.  All of a sudden things become more manageable.  B) W's usually have nice gyms.  C)  W's usually have terrific locations. 3 years ago this one almost turned me off of W's forever.  There but for the saving grace of the Lakeshore W - a truly wonderful, friendly home away from home ... However, I was recently in Chicago when the whole darn city seemed to be sold out.  My only option was the City Center W.  I prepared myself for a sour experience.  To my surprise, they have brought things up a bit.  Looks like they have replaced the carpets, fixed up the bathrooms, and upgraded the A/C units (less rattlerattlerattle AIEEE!).  The staff were friendly and smiling at checkin/out.  Things were much better. Better than the Lakeshore?  Oh my no.  That's still my first choice.  But better than 3 years ago?  Yes.  Give them another 3 years and let's see what happens.",N
3707,"I searched long and hard for the perfect wedding venue. I wanted somethign classic and elegant and somewhat moody. This was the place I had my heart set on after we saw it a while back while attending a close friend's wedding. Just to make sure I didn't put my eggs all in one basket, I went to look at several other venues such as the River East Arts Center, The University Club of Chicago, Metropolitan Club, and Spiaggia. Nothing read Chicago elegance like the Drake. Kate Strause was amazing from the day we said we wanted our wedding here, up until the day after our wedding, when she arranged to have some belongings we forgot at the hotel delivered to my brother's house. Every little detail was perfectly in order and made our wedding feel truly 5-star without any ""attitude,"" which was very important to the both of us. She even helped us with our strict kosher requirements and was an excellent liason with Daniziger, our caterer.",N
1633,"well, its hard to beat the price.  location is great too.  For the money, i found the hotel very typical.  Not nice, but for close to $100/night, what do you expect?  As a frequent business traveler, I've paid more for a dive in Fresno...  My room was comfortable.  Front desk, check in was nearly over-formal for the style of the hotel.  The lobby was clean, nicely decorated.  I wouldn't be embarrassed having a business meeting there.  Pleasant doormen.  I had a corner room which was decent sized and had a great view.   There is a free business center which i used to print copies for a meeting.  Free wireless internet throughout the hotel.  I complained about a slow drain in the shower and it was fixed in a jiffy.  Its surprising how many ppl complain about the decor - the leopard chaise was fine - I actually stayed in a VERY high end hotel in Paris with similar color scheme, including a leopard print chair.  I'd have no problem staying here again.  The biggest problem is that it lacks any identity.  If you want identity, wander down to the Peninsula and fork up $600/night.",N
622,"I indeed had sweet dreams last nite at the Doubletree Magnificent Mile. We were there for one night. It took about a minute to check in, we grabbed our delicious chocolate chip cookies and headed to our room, that was clean, spacious and lovely (lots of pillows and a great bed). We used the concierge services to book a tour and they were knowledgeable and friendly. Love the location, right in the middle of all the action and the price we got on Hotwire was very reasonable. Like others have said the parking is $41 but that is actually cheaper than many other hotels in the area. We saw signs advertising close to $60. It's downtown, to be expected. Only disappointing factor was the wifi situation. We wanted to look up some addresses but did not want to pay over $20 for decent internet speed. I was even going to go for the standard grade at $10 for 24 hours but it wouldn't let me charge it to my credit card, only the room (there was an option for it but it wouldn't activate). We stayed at another Doubletree this past week in another city and their internet was free. But that was only a minor disappointment in another wise lovely stay.",N
4759,I just loved everything about this hotel.  The location was perfect for access to everything.There were 2 exceptional waiters at the Lockwood- Steven and Andrew- thanks for a great stay ion Chicago,Y
1115,"Maybe 10 years ago this was the place to be, but not so much anymore.  There were a few highlights of my stay; the great personalities of their bellmen, a terrific waiter that took care of our table in the wine bar as girls came and went for spa services, and of course my girls that spent the weekend in town.  Outside of that, really nothing impressive.   The room was kind of standard and blah.  Our main bathroom door wouldn't close without throwing your weight into it, so thankfully our public bathroom looking toilet had it's own door.  The towels felt like my mom's, no fabric softener and line dried.  I at least got a decent exfoliation out of it that.  And really, over $15 for internet service.  I did get a great deal on the hotel rooms, so I'm not torn up about our stay.  I suppose I would have more to say if I had paid full price.",N
321,"Very cute hotel with close proximity to the red, purple and brown lines. We didn't gear the train that much unless our window was open and the only one that would open was in the bathroom so that wasn't an issue. The two bed rooms were large and had a pull out sleeper sofa. Though I didn't sleep on the sofa bed, the other beds were pretty comfy and relaxing after a long day of shopping on Michigan Ave. There are A TON of adorable local food options mixed in with your corporate options all within walking distance. Overall it's a cute place and a good find.",N
95,I love this hotel. My fiance and I had our engagement party here and everyone loved the food and the atmosphere.  The food is excellent and the service is great. The outdoor seating at Poor Phil's is lovely in the summer. We often ride our bikes here and sit outside for lunch when the weather is nice. We have stayed in their suites a couple of times and love their oversized jacuzzi tub.,N
3754,"We enjoyed a 3 night stay here early Dec 2011.  After some research on the River North hotels, I thought that Dana Hotel would be a good choice.  I was not disappointed! I found this hotel to be trendy, some highlights include full length windows that provided great views of the city (we had a corner room), a rainfall shower, iPod dock.  The hotel staff was super friendly and very eager to please during our stay.  The hotel was also centrally located to what we were doing and everything seemed walking distance.  In the winter months, we also enjoyed the fire on the rooftop lounge with blankets and robes provided for warmth.   The negatives are that during the Christmas season the rooftop lounge was not always avaiable to us.  Also, take note that while the beds are comfortable, the pillows are waaaaaayyyyyyyy too soft.  We did find a firmer pillow in the closet and I have no doubt the hotel staff would have provided firmer pillows, we didn't bother asking.",N
4628,"What does a Do Not Disturb sign on a hotel room door mean to you? To me, it means one of two things: 1. Do not disturb. 2. I don't want my room serviced. Evidently, it does not mean those things to the housekeepers at Hotel Felix. We had several rather unpleasant altercations with the housekeepers at Hotel Felix during our recent trip to Chicago. On our first day, we put the Do Not Disturb sign on our door and they did not come in, only leaving a message on our machine that if we needed new towels just to let them know. On our second day, we kept the sign on our door. Even though it was there and still there when we returned later that afternoon, we found that our room had been serviced. The next morning, the sign was still on the door. Around 7am, my mom and I both awoke to someone trying to get into our room. We sat up and found that housekeeping wanted to service our room...AT SEVEN AM. WTF? You would think that they would catch our drift having that sign on there all the time - we don't want to be disturbed and we don't to have our room serviced. It's a ""green"" hotel right? Why do they want to get in our room so bad? Well, the next morning after that at NINE AM, I answered a knock at the door: Housekeeper: ""I see this sign on your door. Do you want service?"" Me: ""No service. Also, do not disturb."" Housekeeper: ""I see the sign, are you sure you don't want service."" Me: ""I don't want service and I don't want to be disturbed. That is why I put the sign on the door."" Housekeeper: ""Are you sure?"" Me: ""Yes"". Closes door. Finally, they left us alone for the last two days that we were there. It seems strange that I don't want housekeeping, but I don't want to waste resources and I don't like people I don't know touching my stuff. On the day that we were checking out, we were standing in front of the elevators on our floor about to go down to the main desk. A housekeeper stepped out of a room right next to us and asks if we were in room 1107. We responded yes and she rushed right down to our room right away. We hadn't even left for 2 minutes and she already wanted to get down there. Strange. We also witnessed one of the housekeepers vacuuming in the lobby area during the hotel's happy hour, with everyone standing around looking in shock. I dunno what was up, but they have some crazy housekeepers there. The rooms are small and the air conditioners turn on about every 10 minutes, making the rooms frigid. The gym is okay, but closes at 9pm, which is rather early. There are no glasses in the room, which is strange because there is an ice bucket. Isn't it a 4 star hotel? I would expect many more amenities that what we received. Also, they lost our reservations. So we arrived, tired and in a city we had never been to haggling with the concierge for 45 minutes before we finally got our room.",N
4366,"Absolutely gorgeous hotel "" the longest continuously operating hotel in North America"" with lots of stories to tell The bellhop Steve was extremely helpful and a super nice guy... Nicolas, a part of the cleaning staff was very friendly and went far beyond his job duties   He gave me a quick tour of the hotel and shared some of its history with me... the empire room is a sight to see and the lobby should be on any tourists must-see list The rooms are a bit small and like has been said earlier, the walls are thin but I only paid $75 a night on priceline for a hotel that is as centrally located as can be",N
2818,One of the nicer embassy suites I've stayed at. Wish they had better chairs in the large conference room that I had to sit in for 2 weeks! Great location! There is so much to do w/in walking distance!  & starbucks is right next door ;-)  Pops for Champagne (across the street) is a classy must!  Love the heaters at the entryway. Accommodating staff. Free breakfast made to order (although I always ate oatmeal and fruit). No free wifi ($10/day). No free parking.,N
2202,"I attended a wedding here in the Grand Ballroom which was absolutely magnificent...I told my friends that I'm having my wedding reception here!  Everything is so elegant and pristine.

Hopefully, I'll be staying in one of the hotel rooms...Presidential Suite...?   =)",N
1382,"This hotel is getting 3 stars mainly because of the location. Because the customer service is nothing they should be proud of - that's for sure! The room was nice enough, clean and bright but very small, as were the beds. Our bathroom door did not shut properly which was fuckin' irritating. What I want to know is how you can say you have a martini bar with 50+ martinis and not make a cucumber martini? WTF! We stayed here four nights and it wasn't that bad. We got an OK deal on Priceline. But basically I would not CHOOSE this hotel to stay at again and the MAIN reason (HOTEL MANAGERS I HOPE YOU""RE LOOKING AT THIS) is because the check-in staff and front desk staff were incredibly rude, very disorganized and generally not appearing to be that interested in customer service. These people need MAJOR MAJOR training. I had to wait over 25 minutes for them to ""find"" a package which I stood there looking and pointing at the entire time. This was especially not cool because I told them immediately when I asked for the package that I pointed to, I needed to be in my cab outside to head to an event... which I was then late to.",N

2199,"Not your typical InterContinental hotel. Yes, the architecture is nice,  but.... The rooms are tiny There is no furniture to store my clothes The check in staff is grumpy The door staff is MIA I'm there now, and cannot recommend this hotel.",N
353,"I stayed here because this was the hotel the coordinators of the conference I was going to chose for us.  The conference happened at Roosevelt U. just a few blocks away. They will be getting an angry letter from me. I wish I could give this place half a star.  And that's only because it was in a good spot close to the train (we could hear it from our room) and walking distance to some cool stuff.  It's right next to the lake and there's a 24 hour BR across the street which is nice since the hotel has no vending machines with food in them. Reasons why I suggest never staying at this hotel: - Our room was TINY...I think it was meant to be for a queen/king but they shoved two full sized beds in it - There was a 1.5 inch margin between the floor and the bottom of our door...wtf? - The elevators hardly worked and we got to ride the ""fun"" manual elevator whenever the employees got around to it - Nothing was as clean as it should have been - No one knew anything...we were quoted one price and charged another...we had to negotiate for a compromise All around a bad experience!",N
2452,"Great location, close to Museum Campus, Millenium Park and public transportation. A bus runs just outside the door. The hotel itself is a giant historic Art Decoish building with impressive chandeliers and halls. Quite a landmark even though I have to remark that I have been to more inviting looking hotels (it's size makes it a bit borg-cube-like and its all dark bricks). As many hotels in historic buildings it seemed a bit dated to me furnishing wise (a lot of carpet in that place ...) and extremely dated interior-stylewise. Curtains and carpets and all the furniture are dark and kind of Empire-ish. Most people under 40 probably feel as akward entering a room like this as I did - probably a lot of people past their 40s either! Priceline made me stay in this Hilton - would not necessary have chosen this ""grand hotel"" style - helped save the budget though. Still, I had a decent stay here. Staff was friendly, especially the room maides. They asked me and my husband every morning if we had any special wishes apart from regular cleaning. We successfully ordered anti-allergic foam pillows instead of the feathery ones. Bathrooms are spacious and all marble, pretty cool. Shower, TV, Coffeemaker and everything else worked fine. As we came to explore Chicago (in which case the hotel is not at all a bad option as it is great to walk to everywhere from here) we did not spend time in any of the fitness and restaurant facilities of the hotel. Overall very ok experience to stay there but I kind of missed a real ""soul"" of the place - especially as it obviously tries to maintains this ""historic"" image. It is a kind of anonymous atmosphere probably because of the enormous size. I would give it 3.5 or even 4 if it were not for these very dark and carpeted rooms ... the style is just not very appealing to me, therefore it is only 3 stars for the Hilton.",N
5746,"It was my sister's bachelorette party this past weekend and we wanted to stay in a hotel to make it a little more special than crashing at home after the bars.  Let me say that we were not the yellong, screaming annoying, typical bachelorette party.  We just wanted it to be classy and a good time.  No flashing penis' for us! After calling around to what felt like millions hotels, I got ahold of a very friendly call center rep who suggested the Crown Plaza.  I told her that it was a party and that we wanted a suite with a sitting area so some of the girls could  come and have cocktails before dinner.  She was more than helpful and even said she would put a special note that it was a bachelorette party so they would give us special treatment. Special treatment was the very last thing that we recieved!  When I went to the front desk to check in the girl couldn't even crack a smile. Her name is Angela by the way.  When I told her I was checking in and that we were a bachelorette party the very first thing she said was that ""this is a no party hotel, if security gets called we will kicked you out.""  Seriously?  So I politely told her that we were not going to get out of control, it was just a few girls coming to have a drink before dinner.  Without a word she handed me my keys and told me my room number. Once in the room we were unpleasently surprised that there was no sitting area.  The room just has 2 double beds.  I specifically asked for a suite.  So I called down to the front desk and miss Angela answered the phone. When I told her that we did not have the right room, she told me that we were only booked for a double bed room and if we wanted to move it would be $50.  We were already paying $280 for the room, I was not about to cave for another $50.  I tried reasoning with her but she refused to budge.  She never apologized for the inconvience or even tried to be polite.  When I told her that we might have to find another hotel she told me that we already had checked in and would have to be charged the full amount if we left.   I was pissed. So we decided to stay and I would deal with the bitchy lady the next day.  When I went to check out I talked to the girl at the desk ( a different one).  I told her how extremely unhappy I was witht their hotel.  She was a lot better (the only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1).  She told me that I should have had the suite and that they did over charge me for the double room.  She very kindly lowered the bill which I appreciated. She also told me that Angela was a supervisor.  If that is a suporvisor at a 4 star hotel, then I would hate to see one at a 2 star.   There are a lot of hotels in Chicago.  I would not suggest the Crown Plaza.",N
3780,"This is my first yelp review of a hotel. All in all the Dana Hotel and Spa was pretty impressive and that is saying a lot coming from someone who worked as a concierge in the hotel business for the last several years. My hospitality experience set the standard pretty high for hotels to live up to but the Dana really performed. Let me first say that this hotel is not for everyone. It would certainly fall into the category of trendy/contemporary, which some people may not enjoy. Think W hotels, only a little less cheesy and without all the lame lingo. I had a king bed in my room that you could melt in. I don't know what it is like to sleep on a cloud but I would imagine it would be similar to the beds here. The shower is the portion of the room that gets a little weird. It's a spa shower and has a full window that you can look out to the rest of the room while getting so fresh and so clean. Being that I was alone during my stay, I loved this because I was able destank myself while catching a rerun of Real Chance at Love. I also think it would be very cool for a romantic getaway with a special someone, but can imagine an akward situation if I were sharing the room for a business trip or something. It would be difficult to shower in peace wondering if your random roommate, creepy Steve from accounting, was checking you out in the buff. They do have an optional curtain for more privacy, but I toggled with it and it doesn't completely protect from a bi curious George who is dying to check out what your junk looks like. The other thing about the shower that I thought was weird was that there was no door. Literally every time I cleansed myself there was water that sprayed outside the designated shower area. I don't know what is trendy or cool about getting the bathroom floor all wet? They may want to rethink that one. Other than the weird shower, the place is top notch. The location is prime and close to pretty much anything someone visiting Chicago would want to see. They don't really nickel and dime you like many other hotels either. Internet was free as was the gym. They don't have continental breakfast but give vouchers for up to $15 dollars each morning for a la carte items from the restaurant. The food there was very good and in my opinion this blows away any continental breakfast I've ever had. Many times at trendy hotels, I feel like the staff seems almost too cool for school but, I didn't get that here. The service was friendly and approachable from the bellman to the concierge. Overall it is a great place. If your looking for a hotel to hold a company retreat or something along those lines I would recommend more traditional lodging. If I was with someone I felt comfortable being seen in my birthday suit I would definitley stay here.",N
5413,"My husband and I stayed in this hotel on the night of our marriage.  We had actually just booked a small room, but were surprised to find out that they had upgraded us to a penthouse suite at no extra charge.  This was a nice thing for the hotel to do, and not something that you can find at most large hotel chains.  Customer service like that is unique to boutique hotels like the Whitehall, and we will definitely be staying with them again.Thank you,Elyse",Y
4031,"Stayed at the Hyatt this weekend for a getaway with my husband. Didn't really have any crazy expectations since all Chicago hotels are usually fairly nice. I was completely blown away. Upon check-in, we were upgraded to a Junior Suite. Probably the nicest suite I've stayed in to date. BEAUTIFUL furnishings and layout of the room. View from the 26th floor was great. The hotel was very acomodating and even delivered complementary chocolate to the room. Nice touch! Room was joining on both sides and the other occupants were slightly loud, but it didn't bother me because the environment in our room was amazing. I would absolutely stay at the Hyatt in Chicago again and recommend it to anyone looking for a lavish experience.",N
3621,"Being a huge Mission Impossible fan, you can not imagine the excitement I had when I found a room here for a decent rate with my company's corporate discount. Sometimes, we get some awesome deals at great hotels like this. I also was upgraded to an Executive Room and boy was it a treat!!! Of course, the first thing I did was check for the Bible. Unfortuantely, it wasn't lithographed ""Drake Hotel, Chicago, IL"" as in the movie (Instead it was some Baptist Church in TN...disappointing). That being said, the room was phenominal. Quite large with a huge desk, massive king sized bed, free internet, large closets, comfortable desk chair, couch, beautiful paintings on the wall, well stocked mini bar and all of the appointments you'd expect in a top hotel. The best part part about getting an Excutive room is that you get exclusive access to a private dining room overlooking the lake. The breakfast was slightly disappointing, but definitely offset by the open bar and hors d'ouevres until 10 pm every night. Yes, that's right. The only disappointment was the gym, which I found a bit lacking in heavy free weights and size, but it was much better than the usual hotel gyms and adequate for a short stay. I can't wait to go back to Chicago and hope I get the good rate again. Crossing my fingers for another upgrade..... Even if you don't get an upgrade, it's not so bad here either. The rooms are still quite nice (though not as large). The only bummer is that you don't have access to the Executive Lounge with free drinks and breakfast. However, if you do ask, you might get lucky and get a key to it.",N
5711,"Great location!  We were in one of the smallest (advised for 1 - 2 people) rooms and yes, it was small but it was efficiently laid out, had everything we needed and an AMAZING view!  Besides it's Chicago so how long are you in the room anyway.  While our room could have used some general maintenance (crumbly plaster on ceiling), it was clean.",N
857,"I was very pleasantly surprised by the Silversmith. Got a really nice and well-appointed suite-type room on the 8th floor toward the center of the hotel with tall windows. Luckily, the windows were not in the front where the elevated CTA trains run. The hotel was upgrading guests to king suites, and the suite and bathroom were very spacious and tastefully decorated in a masculine classic style: 2 closets, french doors, 2 televisions, upholstered window bench, and loveseat. No noise issues, and housekeeping was also respectful of the 'do not disturb' sign. I actually used the business center computer, which was fast and seemed virus-free, and had the front desk send a fax for me without any hassle or charge. Hotel is really conveniently located 2.5 blocks from the blue line (O'Hare) and right next to other loop trains. It is also about a block from Millenium Park (one of the main reasons to stay here) and Michigan Ave shops. Fantastic location and value for the price! You get the boutique feel with understated elegance.",N
4218,"What a great hotel.  Just returned from a two night stay at the Hyatt Regency.  From the moment we arrived until the moment we left I was impressed.  The hotel staff is very curteous and professional.  The hotel itself is clean.  The location was perfect, three block from the Red Line and walking distance to Navy Pier and some great restaurants! The room we stayed in was very nice, the view was not diserable but the comfy king size bed and flat screen TV made up for it.   I loved having the ipod docking station in the room as well.   We got to the hotel well before check in time and were allowed to keep our luggage in storage until we checked.  It was a smooth easy check in. I will tell you, it was a very very busy hotel with lots of people.  There were over 1600 people checking out on Sunday.  So if you like quiet hotels do not stay here! Next time I visit Chicago, I will be staying at the Hyatt!!!",N
2567,"Yes, it really is a beautiful place and after spending the weekend at the Hotel Victor in South Beach, I think my expectations were not set correctly.   I highly suggest getting a bottle and reserving the area in the center of the main room, that's the best location to see all the action and of course be the center of attention. The music on the nights which I have been has been spotty, sometimes hip and funky, other times latin influenced and there were a couple people breaking down the salsa on the dancefloor. For a good time with a big group and a late night agenda, Victor hotel is a fun place to hang out.  For an intimate night with a special someone, not really the place to be.  Cover charge, what's that?  you're not that cool.....   Get a bottle, jump the line and live in style.. have a limo to transport you... and then you'll really be a rockstar.... xoxo",N

We usually get all dressed up in the room, pre-game it up, and then go out and paint the town Pink! But this past weekend while pre-gaming it in the birthday room, we heard another party going on a few doors down-WOW OMG CRAZY!!! We just walked into the room and everyone in this other room was young and drinking and freaking watching hardcore porn! it was just crazy and i just felt like sharing this place is sooo much fun ta party in!",N
5796,I agree with the first reviewer Celeste. I had a friend stay here and it was OK to me. I have seen better rooms at Holiday Inn but as she said it is cheap and close to the #6 Bus so that is why I gave it an extra star.,N
3311,Great hotel in a great location (right on Michigan Ave.) The only drawback is the hike from the Clark/Lake El Station was pretty long. The price though (my roomate and I paied $180 for 3 nights) was great for the type of hotel. Rooms were cozy and well decorated. Would definetly stay here again if ever in Chicago.,N
4949,"Loved this Chicago hotel When in Chicago, I spent two nights at the Avenue Hotel, and enjoyed it. I got a room on the 20th floor looking over the Magnificent Mile.  Very quiet hotel considering the prime location, and I am sensitive to noise. The room was big for a downtown city hotel and plenty of space for 2 people, even in the bathroom! The room was clean, obviously newly refurbished, and of high standard - love the Zebra chair, what a cool touch!  The staff all around the hotel especially at the entrance were extremely helpful with baggage, ordering taxis, and giving advice on sites to see and restaurants to try. I found the staff refreshing and polite.  The Avenue is situated just steps from the Magnificent Mile and definitely within walking distance (weather pending) from some of downtown Chicago's hot spots.  If the shopping is your first priority, exclusive shops are just around the corner. If I am to visit Chicago again, I would stay at this hotel again",Y
5116,"Location. Location. Location!The rooms are older and rather small, but the beds (and bedding) more than make up for it.   I LOVE their down comforters and the convenience of having your own safe (and in room coffee makers).  The lobby/lounge area is the hotel's best feature.  Many comfortable sofas and chairs, to catch up on your e-mail or have a specialty coffee (or cocktails and lite snacks).  The 4th floor offers a lounge area, that still allowed smoking (on my last visit in early March). You can easily walk to most of the city's main attractions from this hotel.   Which is why it's one of my top choices when coming back ""home"" to visit.{--- Chicago native, currently ""exiled"" in Nebraska ;)",Y

2276,I stayed here for a total of 8 nights during a recent work trip. We had a room block so the rates were decent (around $200/night). The location is really convenient since it's on Magnificent Mile with shops and restaurants within a short walking distance. The rooms are average.  Clean.  Nothing that spectacular.,N
3817,"I really enjoyed staying in this hotel during Lollapalooza.  First of all - cool hotel right in the middle of everything and it's close enough to walk to and from Grant Park. (and rock star sightings!!) Awesome about hotel: 24 hour room service, 2 restaurants, a club upstairs (if you're into that sort of thing), friendly staff - especially Ramsey at the front desk, extremely helpful and friendly.   Beware of:  the bartender at brunch is quite worthless and the service in the kitchen is slow, while the shower is awesome - the one side of the shower is glass which is open to the room; the only thing that covers the glass is a curtain which is not that easy to close and can be opened from outside the shower. Otherwise, excellent location for shopping, bars, food and all the sites!!  I'd recommend this hotel for sure!!",N
2194,"The Intercontinental Hotel is a ""nice"" place to sleep only because there are beds and that is more comfortable than sleeping on the floor.  I know I am being harsh, but for almost $300 a night (and that is with a group discount) the bed best be one that inspire me to sleep as soon as I look at it.  This requirement was not met.  The bed was not comfortable and the pillows are too soft, I could barely sleep the full night without tossing and turning. I am not a picky person when it comes to hotels because my eyes are closed most of the time I am in my room.  When I am not asleep, I am watching television.  This is were the 32-ish inch flat panel screen ""should"" be great, but the feed was standard definition analog stations. When not in my room, I was attending the conference I was in Chicago for.  Most of conference rooms were good, but some seemed to be extra wide hallways.  The reason i did not do anything else in the hotel, like go the gym, is because everything cost extra.  I have never been to a hotel where everything (including the gym) was a la cart. The food provided for the conference was good, but the bar closed too early. So in summary: Too Expensive Everything A La Cart Uncomfortable Beds Good Food Bar Makes for Early Nights",N
4112,"I booked this hotel on Priceline for only $70 per night, much better than the $219 that was posted on their website for the time we were staying. The hotel is a convention center, with a huge lobby and separate elevator banks depending on the floor you're at. It's located directly downtown, close to a myriad of amenities. As usual, hotel food is very expensive, so go outside to get a better price. And overall if you're going to stay in downtown Chicago, leave your car at home! It's extremely expensive to park there. Overall, hotel and room were clean and we received quick service. I would highly recommend the Hyatt for a downtown Chicago stay.",N

5597,"The Westin River North.  It's quite a jolly little cottage.   I love how any schmuck can just waltz into any hotel like he owns the joint and camp out, lounge or even have a bit of a rest stop in the loo.   My cousin was in town for a few days and staying at The Westin River North, so I cabbed over to meet her for a few drinks.  This Westin is pretty swanky and posh.  I walked in, acted like I owned the joint and started being The King.  It's good to be The King.  And it's free. The first thing I noticed upon entry was the smell of the place.  I think they use Drakkar or some other mens' cologne for their mop water or just have guys walking around spritzing it into the air.  I guess there are worse smells in the world.  I just don't like the cheese ball smell of cologne.  The free smells at Jimmy Johns are better. There is a very large and open lobby area with a bar, tables and couches.  This was my destination.  Victoria on tap?  Yes, please.  Thanks, cuz.   As for the lobby loo, it's only alright.  I've seen some seriously fancy hotel loos (hello, Nomi and that palace in Cancun), but this one doesn't quite measure up.  It's better than a Burger King bathroom though.   As for the rooms, they're nice.  I could camp out for a few days in one. After a tour of a few River North joints, my cousin and I came back to the lobby bar and ordered a bacon and chorizo flat bread.  Seriously, how can anyone resist ordering something containing these two ingredients.  Delicious and recommended.   It's not a bad place to hang out for a few quiet drinks or even stay a night or two. Four stars.",N
4044,"The rooms here are pretty nice, however we had some bad luck and got a room right next to the elevator.  Those elevators are very fast and apparently also very loud, because we could hear them all night long.  The view from our room was amazing though....a straight shot of the Hancock Observatory with the river in front. The bar on the 2nd floor was fun and a good view of the river, although drinks were pricey...what you'd expect from a hotel bar I guess. We tried to check out through the TV checkout and it didn't work which was a minor annoyance because we didn't want to have to wait in line downstairs (the hotel was super busy the whole time we were there). Overall just an okay experience.  Nothing stood out, and next time we'd be sure to request a room away from the elevator.",N
369,"If I could give this zero stars, I would. Considering that my last stay here was during the summer and with the spate of conventions in town my only options were a) this place or b) an $800/night room at the Peninsula, frugality won out. The room made me think of that old line from ""Wings"", where Lowell said ""I wonder how many people committed suicide in this dump."" I get that it is an inexpensive hotel, but you would think that with the amount of business it gets and the location the management could have done something to make the place more appealing (hairdryers in the rooms, people, hello?). I might also add that the noise from the elevated train was unbearable and, between that and the flimsy door with equally flimsy deadbolt, I got around 2 hours of sleep the one and only night I stayed there. Save yourselves the money and sleep in the lobby of one of the many swish hotels just up the street.",N
2594,Ok I went here once with a bunch of friend from college.  We had a blast.  You could tell some of the clientele were snobby but we did not care.  I thought it was a nice spot but you could tell it was a renovated factory space.  I knew it wasn't an actual hotel.  But I liked the hotel theme.  Very classy.  The back room was where we spent most of the evening.  I think some of the couches were reserved but no one came and no one moved us so we chilled there.  It's a nice spot to chill but not to dance.  If you're looking for a chill lounge check this place out.,N

4163,"Neat king room layout with the bed in the middle of the room and a desk behind it near the window. I liked the iPod/iPhone speaker/charger dock. The bathroom was very nice, with a large edge-lit mirror that made it seem really upscale. My room had a safe and a mini-bar fridge. The TV was a decent LCD but the channels took forever to change there wasn't much variety. It felt like a 2011 TV with 1992 cable. It looks like all rooms offer a great view. The location is fantastic with lots nearby, including Navy Pier. There are two towers so make sure to go to the main entrance to check in (east tower). A pedestrian bridge connects them.",N
3844,"My wife, who just so happens to be named Dana, spent our first weekend alone since our first child was born eight weeks ago. I researched downtown Chicago hotels for weeks and finally decided on The Dana after reading so many wonderful reviews. I called the hotel about a week ahead of our arrival and asked them for three small requests. 1. We wanted a king bed. This certainly didn't seem like much to ask. It was just my wife and I, so that makes plenty of sense anyway. 2. We need a room with a refrigerator. Since my wife is breast feeding, she needed to keep the milk chilled for the weekend. 3. If possible, an upper level room with a view. Upon arriving at the Dana, we were greeted very pleasantly by the door staff and escorted to the front desk on the second floor. After a very short wait, we were quickly given our room card and headed up to our room. The room was the complete opposite of what we requested: Two double beds, no refrigerator and a 12th floor view of the side of a building. I immediately went back down to the desk and let them know we needed a new room and their response was basically ""We're booked, too bad"". When we explained we needed a refrigerator and we were already told by phone it wouldn't be a problem, their response was again ""Your room doesn't come with a refrigerator, too bad."" I've never experienced a front desk that was so unhelpful. It wasn't exactly the way I wanted to start our weekend. Fortunately, the check-in was the lowlight of the trip. Despite the fact my wife and I slept in separate beds, had to make God knows how many trips to the ice machine (which is hidden in a closet on the fifth floor) and gazed out of our window into an office building, I slowly warmed up to The Dana and eventually left the hotel with a feeling that I might, just maybe, stay there once again. POSITIVES 1. Location. You can't beat staying right in the heart of downtown Chicago within walking distance of everything that makes this city so wonderful. Dining, shopping, beach, nightlife ... You are right in the middle of all of it. 2. Vertigo. The hotel has one of the best rooftop lounges in Chicago. It was packed both nights we were there and the views from 27 stories above were fantastic. The drinks were great. The staff was helpful. Good crowd. Great place. 3. Shower. It's a one-of-a-kind with a rain head spout from the ceiling and glass on both sides separating the bedroom and the bathroom. It's about as nice of a hotel bathroom as you're going to find. 4. Complimentary breakfast. It was so nice to be able to walk downstairs and sit down and be served a perfectly, light meal. They brought a really good fruit bowl with the choice of pastry and quality coffee and juices. It was very simple and very good. 5. Door staff. The guys at the front door go out of their way to make you feel special. Any request was quickly answered and, unlike the front desk staff, they were very pleasant and genuine. NEGATIVES 1. Front desk. I've already covered it all with them. You would think a hotel would employ its most helpful workers for this position, not the opposite. The front desk staff was a joke. Completely clueless and just flat out insulting. 2. Elevator. This might sound like I'm being picky, but I can't tell you how many times I was in the elevator and another person was mumbling expletives as they battled with the elevator. In order to push the button of your floor, you have to very quickly insert your room card and then make your choice. This is much easier said than done. It's almost like trying to feed a crumbled dollar bill into a vending machine under pressure. It's incredibly annoying and if you don't do it quickly, you miss your floor and have to ride the elevator down to the lobby again. I appreciate the security, but I truly believe this is the hotel's way of trying to be hip and in turn just pissing a lot of people off. 3. Thin walls. I had the stereo playing at low volume and within minutes the hotel security was knocking. If you need to sleep, this isn't the hotel for you. 4. Trying too hard. This hotel desperately wants to be young and hip. It's not young by any means and it's not really all that hip. This place is loaded with middle-agers (40-50 crowd) and all of their attempts at being cool kind of fall short. Example: To get into the rooftop club, you have to briefly stand behind a velvet rope even if the damn place is empty. I could probably give you 10 examples of stuff like that. The ceilings in the room are unfinished cement. Trendy or an eye sore? I definitely thought the latter. 5. Ice machine. Call and ask guest services where the ice machine is located. They will tell you it's on the fifth floor. If you can find it in less than 10 minutes, I'll be impressed. There are a lot of things at this hotel where you just scratch your head and think, what the @#$% were they thinking?",N
2148,"Two words. Historic tower. Yes. If you are going to stay at the Intercontinental- you must stay in the historic tower. The Intercontinental Chicago is really two hotels in one. The historic tower was built in 1929 and was originally the Medinah Athletic Club. The ""north tower"" or main building was actually another hotel that was built in 1961 and was acquired by the Intercontinental and joined together. Thus the style differences between the two towers. While the historic tower costs more, in my opinion, it is worth the money. Look for deals (especially if you are staying over a weekend). My room rate was only $99 a night (had a Groupon for one night and found a deal for the other) This cheap rate got me a standard room in the main tower- but after a little dealing upon check in- I was able to get a corner room in the historic tower for a nominal upgrade fee. My room was lovely. A SE corner room with two windows- one looking over the river and one facing east with views of the lake and Navy Pier. Perfect for a getaway weekend. The staff at this hotel was on their game. Late night room service came within the promised 20 minutes. The valet brought my car around in 5 minutes, turn down service was followed up on, and the doorman was quick to take care of my every need. So why not a perfect score? I think they were a little cheap in some areas and as a frequent traveler, I expect alot. I'd rather pay a little more for the room and not be ""nickel and dimed"" to death throughout my stay. For example- they charged $17.95 a day for wi-fi, there were no high end toiletries in the bathroom, they were missing some expected amenities (complimentary water in bottles, q-tips, shower cap and cotton balls) . Even the business center charged for wi-fi- crazy! And the worst thing? Overnight parking in the hotel cost $53 a night. That's highway robbery and the same price is given for the public as those staying in the hotel. My advice? Drop your bags off with the bellman and then park around the corner in one of the cheaper lots. All in all, the Intercontinental is a great hotel and the location can't be beat. Just know before you go that it's the little things that are going to add up during your stay so plan accordingly.",N
5696,"This hotel is fantastic for a traveler there on Business or a couple who is planning on being out site seeing most of the day. Yes, the rooms are small, but they are efficient. I have stayed in much smaller rooms. The room didn't feel cramped at all. We booked a room in the River Hotel(floors 3-10) but we got a room in the Club Quarters(11 and up). Since it was as described, I imagine it was the same accommodations I could expect from the River Hotel, just with a better view. Everyone we spoke to was very nice, and accommodating. There is no Iron in the room, but there is one available on one of the other floors. There are water bottles available that you can fill up, which was fantastic. We ended up getting them for my parents too, because water at their hotel was $8. We didn't get a chance to eat in the restaurant, but it looked very nice, and is highly rated. The outdoor tables are super cute. I think the best thing about this hotel though is the location. It's right on the Chicago River near Michigan Avenue. There is so much that is within walking distance. It is also super close to L stops. The closest one is State/Lake, which has the Red line, and a couple others. A block up at Clark/Lake is the Blue Line that will take you to/from O'Hare. It's easy walking distance to the Magnificent Mile, State St, the Art Institute. There are also easy buses to Lincoln Park Zoo and Navy Pier. There is a Corner Bakery Cafe located right next door too for a cheap, good breakfast, or a lite snack. I also felt very safe at this hotel, after midnight you have to be buzzed in, you also have to use your key to access the Elevator. Apparently this is a Historic Building also. At one time, briefly, it was the tallest Building in Chicago, it is also considering the skinniest Sky Scraper in Chicago. It's a beautiful building! If you are someone who is looking for a small, nice, efficient room close to everything, this place is perfect for you. If you are looking for a big, luxurious room with all sorts of amenities, this place probably isn't for you. Considering its about $75 less a night than most of the surrounding hotels though, it's a fantastic deal! I would definitely stay here again.",N
1620,"For the most part, I enjoyed my stay at Hotel 71. You get two views in this place. There's the adjacent rooftop view with pigeons and industrial objects, or there's the magnificent view with the boats traveling under the bridges below. I had trouble with wireless in my room, so after a very nice technician visited my room, I was upgraded from the already nice room I had with the rooftop view to a much nicer room with a fabulous view of the loop below. As a Wilco fan (you'll only get this as a Wilco fan) I was thrilled to have the cover art for Yankee Hotel Foxtrot right outside my window (The Mariana Towers). The hotel staff were nice and helped create the boutique feel. Nice hotel bar. Nice furnishings. I was happy that in both my suites I had a giant bathtub and a nice rain shower in addition. Both bathrooms had flat screen TVs, so I could watch the news in the morning and relax in the evenings. Convenient to the theaters- we walked to Wicked and it was only a few blocks. My suites both had nice chaise lounges for a little post-work relaxation. I highly recommend this hotel for your next business or pleasure stay.",N
1931,"There are a few things I know for certain about this hotel, one is that I work here and another is that we are a very small hotel with limited staff and a huge clientele. Personally, I know that we go all out for our guests. If you want a view and a bigger room stay at the W Lake Shore. W City Center is exclusively meant for business trips and short stays. The hotel can get pricey up to $400 a night. If you want to stay at a hotel that will go the extra mile, stay here. Talk to the conierge to find out awesome places to go. We add a lot of bonuses here including a courtesy car, guest gifts and an awesome line of bath products! Try the steak panini on the roomservice menu for a tasty sandwich.",N
3916,"I have so many stories of debauchery from this place that need to be told here for your pleasure. The Congress Plaza Hotel is a total crap hole (yes, that is the technical term). Having lived on the south side previously, it's not the neighborhood that gets me. It's the fact that the hotel is full of employees who don't want to be there (scabs, by the way... The real employees have been on strike for years, and they picket in front every day), classless hotel guests, and security personnel who look like the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, complete with the post-being-in-the-saddle waddling they do. I (luckily) only crashed in a friend's hotel room there during the conference I was attending, but I wouldn't have paid for a room there. They're dirty, the views are terrible, and the hallways are oddly-shaped and confusing. It's like a labyrinth when you get inside. At 1AM, I was standing in the lobby with a gin and tonic when all of a sudden a man ran past me gushing blood out of some orifice in his face (It might have been his nose or eye, or a hole that had recently appeared judging by the amount of blood it had pouring out of it). He ran into the elevator, which he then proceeded to cover in blood as well. To ""outrun"" the security guards who were now chasing him around, he got off at around the 8th floor, called the OTHER elevator, then took that one back down to the lobby and ran outside, covering both elevators, as well as the entire hotel lobby with blood. That was the highlight of my evening... Hiking up the 12 flights to get back to the room I was staying in because both elevators were covered in hemoglobin. Last, the security guard from the hotel, having seen me in the lobby during the blood fiasco, figured out which room I was going into and had me LOCKED OUT of it so he could question me when I ran up the stairs. He had to go override the lock to make the keys work again. I think that was probably illegal. That's when I gathered my belongings and took the hour-long train ride home instead of staying with my friend again. The CP hotel tries to be high class, but they really aren't. They're notorious for charging huge amounts for ""amazing suites"" that really aren't that great. For the same money, you could go to a real hotel and not be harassed by the people on strike every time you walk in the front door by someone who's been unemployed and striking for 3 years. If you're under age 50, watch out for the RCMP... They really hate ""them damn college kids."" They'll follow you to your room.",N
4767,"The Palmer House was an enormous disappointment. Sure the lobby is nice, but the room was shabby.  Right in downtown Chicago, Hilton has managed to create the kind of room I'd expect to find in a Motel wedged between a whorehouse and an airport runway deep in a Florida swamp.The room we had was tiny and worn out; the carpet was faded, the wallpaper was peeling, the sink wouldn't drain and the cheap and cheesy  ""Empire"" furniture was stained and scratched. The room was also very noisy. The constant rattle and hum of the building's mechanical systems was on par with a flight on a regional jet. This wheezing symphony of air conditioning and elevators was punctuated occasionally by the three-year-old-with-kettle-drum sound of the showers in the adjacent rooms. Finally, the room was humid. No matter how we set the AC, the room, the sheets, the towels, everything felt damp.If you drive, be prepared to pay their ""specially arranged"" exorbitant parking fee, in our case it was a third the cost of the room, at the garage across the street. No, there's no connecting bridge or walkway between the garage and the hotel.Those are all the ways I can remember that this hot mess of a hotel disappointed us. If I remember any more, I'll be sure to ammend this review.",Y
2415,"This is a very nice hotel, an I got an unexpected bonus. First off in clear violation of the Hilton booking rules, I reserved the cheapest room possible for one person...with the intent of having about 7 people stay in it. We needed a place to crash after a friend's birthday celebration. They either didn't realize when I led the field trip up to the room, or just looked the other way. In either case...cool. I have Hilton Diamond status, so they automatically upgraded me to a lake view room, which was nice. It also had two bathrooms, which was odd, but nice for all the people. The room was nice - very comfortable beds, good sized and with a nice view as well. The lobby was quite impressive, very plush, and staff were incredibly helpful. i was not able to try any of the restaurants, since I was with friends who had other (liquid) dining plans. There was also an interesting goody in the room - a $50 off coupon (with qualifying purchase) at a costume jewelery store in the lobby. I offered it to a friend, and I went down with her since I wanted to get something to munch on later. (Forget paying for the mini-bar stuff) Who do we run in to in the lobby? Fonzie. Seriously. Arthur Winkler. Nice guy, too - I have pictures to prove it. So. Between good service, very nice surroundings, a free upgrade (granted, not just spontaneous, but due to my history), and a celebrity siting, I highly recommend this hotel. Although your personal amount of Fonzie may vary on your next stay.",N
3820,"We pulled up in front of the Dana, one month since our last visit, the Doorman greeted us by name, commented on the fact i was driving a different car this time & welcomed us back!! We didn't book a corner room this time but the Dana upgraded us to a room with a Balcony. Everything i loved before i still love but I'm upgrading the Dana to 5 stars. I will always stay here in Chicago & its is a foodie dream you are within walking distance of almost every great dining establishment in Chicago & the added bonus is some lovely wine bars within stumbling distance. Plus we enjoyed the twice weekly Free wine from 530pm to 630pm. They served Chateau St Jean Merlot & Chardonnay, not half bad for free wine",N
4056,"I come to Chicago for work frequently and typically stay at the McCormick Place Hyatt but they were all booked up for my travel date. I got a reasonably priced room at this location and was quite pleased. Pros: Extremely helpful, attentive, and friendly staff Excellent room service Clean room Comfortable bed Beautifully designed and appointed bathrooms Cons: This hotel is like a labyrinth in terms of layout where the front desk is on the second floor. The room I was put in is smaller than any of the other ones I've stayed in at the McCormick Place location. I'm not a fan of their toiletry products -- I wish they would upgrade them to a more luxurious brand, and while this isn't exactly a dealbreaker, it would increase my love of the Hyatt brand if they stepped it up a bit in this department. I was in the West Tower and had a bizarre view of an office building -- I could see in to their offices and they could see in to my room! But actually, it was fairly interesting...it must be some kind of advertising or creative media floor because it was quite good people watching and there were all manner of visual oddities to ponder (for example, a giant stuffed winnie-the-pooh bear in the middle of one of their hallways that stayed put my whole visit).",N
3872,"We booked a tranquil suite at the Dana for 3 nights last week for our 9 year anniversary and were very pleased.  The room itself was amazing, on the 21st floor, with 2 separate balconies showcasing 2 different views.  The shower was unlike anything I'd ever seen, with the beautiful tile and slate floors, and the incredible rain shower heads.  The lighting in the bathroom was also amazing and I really appreciated the magnified handheld mirror.  The bed was extremely comfortable and I slept like a baby.  Also the round chair in the ""living room"" was so comfortable that I wanted to take it home! We got a couple's harmony massage in the spa, and they were very nice.  Different than other massages we'd had, but still relaxing.  Our  massage therapists Cat and Nicole were very skilled. We had dinner at Aja and Ami, our waiter,  was very accomodating.  The food was delicious and reasonably priced.  In fact, all of the food, including everything in the honor bar (wine, beer, water, soda, snacks) was very reasonably priced.  They provided us with $15 breakfast coupons for each day, but we never got out of the comfy bed in time to partake.  However, we did order breakfast from the room service menu and the food was very good and also reasonably priced. We went to the bar at Aja all 3 nights and each night our bartenders were very friendly and kept the conversation flowing. Being tattoo collectors, we appreciated the fact that most every staff member in the bar/restaurant had tattoos and we were even told by one bartender that we ""fit in well"" :-)  since we sometimes get sideways glances for our lifestyle choices.   We did venture up to Vertigo, just to see the view, but the whole ""night club"" mentality is not our scene so we didn't stick around.   I give the Dana 5 stars for service and friendliness, but do have to note a few cons on our visit, and these are things that I addressed with the sales marketer (when he asked us) and the concierge: *  the towels are not very soft.   For the price of the room, I expected soft, luxurious towels.  These were pretty scratchy.  The robes were nice, but not near as nice/soft as robes on cruise ships we've been on. *  the paper towels in the spa locker room were those brown paper towels you get in bulk for office buildings.  I expected much more from a luxurious spa. * the Dana goes by the ""Honor bar"" system, which is great, but unfortunately, 2 of the bottles of Voss water that we pulled out of the  wine cooler had obviously been opened and re-filled with tap water, which leads me to believe that housekeeping staff is not really checking appropriately.  Although, I do have to say, when I brought those bottles to the concierge they apologized profusely and brought up 2 fresh bottles (and didn't charge us, but we were honest and paid for them). * finally, the 2 person shower was great, but the 3 body jets coming out of the wall are way too powerful and are actually painful, so we didn't utilize them. Overall, I gave this hotel 5 stars because it was an amazing experience and the service was incredible.  I would highly recommend this hotel to others!",N
1302,"I see no reason to give this place any less that 5 stars. Excellent service, clean rooms and comfortable beds. Big props to the concierge for the Il Mulino recommendation. WOW!",N

2486,"Waking up naked in a kingsized bed in soft white sheets, wrapped up in a fluffy goose down comforter, with pillows strown in every direction, looking into hypnotic eyes of sea blue, is just heaven.  This was my mornings at Hilton.  I'm such a lucky girl.  Pampered and adored.  Trust me, this is not my everyday.  Nor, every month.  But for this moment... this moment was just opulent. The Hilton Chicago is very traditional in style.  Not usually my cup of tea but more, his.  Being more of an appreciator of modern / contemporary styles and decor, this would not have been my first choice, but I was won over by the spectacular views of the lake and the decadence of the hotel grounds.  Surprisingly, their room service was extremely tasty!  -1 star for no bathrobes, and another one for making us feel cheap for having to show our room key in the evenings after getting back from our nightly outings.  Very awkward. I wouldn't choose The Hilton myself per se but I'm not going to deny that my stay here was very pleasurable. I love all the spiders and their webs on all the windows.  Strange.  but I like weird.",N
1565,"I stayed at the hotel last year for a business trip. It was also my 1st time in Chicago. I kinda like the hotel tho. The good: The hotel is clean, decor are not bad, located right off public transportation, downtown setting, great view from my room (don't know if this goes for all rooms), closed to everything with walking distance. The bad: Lobby is kinda small. The people talking next door and I could hear. (thank god I didn't hear anything 'else' at night.) Hooking up internet was a pain. Overall, i would go back again.",N
1206,"4.5 stars..... We stayed in a suite at this hotel, and it was one helluva room.  I loved it.  Views cover 2 of the 4 walls in the suites, and the bed feels like a cloud dropped out of heaven.  What more can you ask for? However - - it loses the 1/2 star solely because it's out in the middle of nowhere.  Unless you have reason to be near the Convention Center, which is conveniently located right next to the hotel (attached, actually) then there really is no reason to be at Hyatt McCormick.  (This is the reason we were at this location to begin with, obviously.) To get to ""downtown"" or the more happening areas of Chicago, it will generally be a $10+ cabride there, and then again, on the way back.  After a week there, this can accumulate to quite a sum.    The only plus side to this is that you get to drive up and down Michigan Ave during all times of the day/night, and see what's happening.  This would be nice if you rented a car... but then driving home after a night out will STILL be quite a hike! Many things about the Hyatt McCormick indicate it IS indeed a hotel all about business, and even the staff seem accustomed to dealing with people traveling for business - not pleasure, in that they are rather curt, get the job done, and no small talk, no extra smile, or anything.  Their goal is to get people in, and out as efficiently as possible.  No complaints, but you can tell you're not in California anymore.  :-) Bathrooms were nice - shower was great.  Toiletries - very nice.   There is a general lack of outlets in the room. Television, for the size of the room, was small, but there were two tv's in our suite. There is also a bar area with fridge and cabinets with sink - - no stove though - and no microwave, so it's more for entertaining than preparing food or reheating food. Really beautiful room and breathtaking view.  I wish I had taken photos, but unfortunately, I forgot! If this hotel were located centrally within ""playing distance"", I'd give it a 5-star hands down, but solely for its location -  I can't give it the full 5-stars.  4.5 stars it is.",N
1404,"My review is merely for the 11 hour period we were there between 10 pm and 9 am, but for what it's worth, those were good hours. We needed a rental car for the remainder of our trip, so we picked one up at O'Hare and made the drive here. Finding the hotel was pretty easy. The valet parking? I knew it was coming, and it was still painful. At least I didn't physically see the $53 charge till the next morning. The best part of this hotel, other than the clean, beautiful lines to it, is obviously the location. Just across from the Drake, you're incredibly close to so much that Chicago has to offer. Since we got there late, checking in was a breeze. We had purchased our room through Priceline and there were no problems. We were quickly sent out our way through the tiny elevators to the 9th floor, which had mostly a view of the buildings around it, but through one small opening, you could also see to the lake. Not that you can see much at 10 pm at night anyway, but I digress. The bed and linens were incredibly comfortable and I slept like a baby. The added bonus to the whole 11 hour stay was the concierge who pointed us towards an excellent breakfast just a few quick blocks away at Feast. Head there for a meal if you're staying at the Knickerbocker. You won't be disappointed.",N
190,"Definately, just a-ok. We had a junior suite, with two doubles and a pull out couch, and the 6 of us sharing the space were all very comfortable. The beds were so soft - without being two soft - and I slept so well each night, which is fairly uncommon for me without my own pillow at least. However, the service was less than ok.  We were told we could have a refrigerator brought to our room upon request. So we asked Friday night and were told it would be in our room shortly. Well, three phone calls and 24 hours later, we finally got one. Too bad it was too late for our Friday night leftovers. Also, our rooms were not cleaned until maybe 6pm each day, much later than any other hotel I've been in before. Even when they did clean, they didn't give us a new roll of toilet paper... With 6 people, that's a problem. Also, there were more than a few bugs in the bathroom. The location is great if you want to be really close to the Magnificent Mile, so maybe that helps.",N
5808,"Where do I begin?? There are so many horrible things i want to sayh about this place. I just couldn't believe it. My fiance and I went to a show at a club right down the street from the milshire........we drove 3 hours to see the concert, and wanted to stay the night, and didn't want to drive far to a hotel...... Well, we ended up going home anyway ater exoeriencing this hotel for only about 15 minutes.Absolutely disgusting. I knew it wasn't looking good as we were walking up the stairs to our room. It hadnt looked like the carpet ahd been vacuumed in months. There was a cigarette butt on the step. We paid 52$ for a private room, a single room means you pay 34$, but have to share a bathroom with your neighbor. Who the F@@@ wants to do that.This room was amaller than an efficiency apartment. There were missing tiles in the showers. It was dirty, filthy, and disgusting. The ceiling had a huge crack in it, with rust and paint chipping. There were two roaches in the drawers of the dresser. As i pulled back back the sheets to check them out, I saw cigarette burn holes and stains. THe plate that held a big cup for ice and plastic cups had cigarette burns on it also.The windows had paint chipping on them as well, with graffitti spray painted on two windows.This was the worst hotel I've ever seen. We did not stay the night. We wasted 52$ on some pig stye room. As we left I got the managers business card. i agree with a past review, this place is for hookers ands junkies.....and bums.....Really creepy atmosphere.I've stayed at the Dollar Inn before, and compared to this place, the Dollar Inn is a Hilton.  I don't understand how the Health Department hasn't been called on them. It is not sanitary whatsoever, how can a business be ran in the condition of this measure of nastiness.........I could go on and on about all the horrible things of this hotel, but i think ive said enough.Oh and I had to rate this hotel with at least one star, but it, in no way, deserves even one star......no stars for this place!!!!!!! DO NOT GO!!!!",Y

The bad: - The climate was impossible to control - The nearest CTA station is a fairly brisk walk - The maids were terrible - The restaurants are all impossibly closed for hours at a time - The convention space is limited and spread across several floors The ugly: - The exhibit hall floor was dark and the ceiling was too low - Chicago Burger Company is a disgusting restaurant, way over priced and food poisoning inducing.",N

I don't plan on leaving the house (to go the a doctor's office or hospital) for fear of getting others sick, but I am amazed at how irresponsible the Millenium Knickerbocker Hotel could be to not issue a refund or change my reservation.

I got this hotel room for me and a bunch of my girlfriends after a dinner at Harry Carey's and it was really quite lovely.

The one thing I was a little miffed about was that there was no robe in the room.  At a supposed 4 star hotel, this is something I expect and am not happy to find out otherwise...minus 1 star.",N
3925,"I stayed here in 2006 for a conference. It's a historic hotel, that looks like it's seen better days. It was a swank place back in the 30's, but it's outlived its usefulness. The rooms are old and dated. Standard cable TV. Bathrooms weren't anything special either. Parking was a bit steep at $40 a night. The bar wasn't impressive either. Since I was staying on someone else's dime, the room was charged to a corporate credit card, and I put my personal card down for incidentals. 3-4 months after I checked out, I found a charge for $86 on my credit card from Congress Plaza. I tried calling the business office to see why I'd been charged. I never got a call back. Finally, I got my credit card company to intervene, and we placed a 3 way call to the hotel, which gave us nothing but attitude. I wound up getting the charge reversed, but it was a major pain in the ass. Also, there's picketers outside, and they've been on strike for several years over the hotel's low pay and working conditions. http://www.congresshotel... and http://www.congresshotel... has more on the shithole you'll be staying in (regardless of whether you're pro-union or not, it's still an abortion of a hotel) There's no way in hell I'd stay here again.",N

1395,"A nice spot to park the parents when they're in town!!  Right around the corner from Watertower Place and all the Michigan Ave. fav's, this ideally located hotel has pleasant & friendly front desk and valet/door staff.   The staff was responsive to problems, for example - when my parents' window shade fell off the wall at 10pm, a maintenance guy was there within minutes.   Although their room was small, it was fancifully decorated and clean.  Their friends had a room next to the elevator which was more spacious (b/c it's handicap accessible, the bathroom is at least normal sized and not miniature). The bar isn't really separated from the lobby, it almost feels like one space.  Martinis were on par for the neighborhood ($14) and the bar had a live trio playing one evening. Parking was $44/day, almost 1/2 the room rate - ouch!  (Why do this when you have your lovely daughter who can serve as a shuttle driver between her apartment and your hotel?!)  Room rates were reasonable ($105) by calling the hotel directly, but I'm betting you could get lower by using a service like Priceline.",N
5471,"Poorly organized, ineffective front desk which left my step-brother on a couch the night before his wedding. As for our room, we were promised it would be ready at 12, but it was still not ready at 3:15, and there were 5 of us getting ready in one hotel room for the 5pm wedding. There was no compensation for our inconvenience.",N
2288,"We stay here every year in May for the NRA show. (National restaurant Association) Great location, right downtown. The lobby is huge - lots of activity with people socializing, etc. The rooms are a bit small, but not bothersome. Work out room is good as well. The bar has great appetizers and drinks. And the staff is all very helpful. The Federal Express office could of been better. We had a package we were waiting for, we walked down to see if it had arrived. nope. We tried a few times, nothing. Finally we said we need to put a trace, they said they would. They didn't. So we did. We went back down to the office - a regional fed ex guy was there, heard our story and started to help us. It got delivered to another hotel next door. So he walked over there with us. All is good. we got our package. But then we got a call at 3:00 AM, from fed. express saying they were still looking for our package. So apparently after he left us - he didn't finish up with his own company and let them know we found it. (Maybe more training is needed - all the way up the ladder.) But they are apart from the Marriott - so for this review. We will stay again in this Marriott, just as we have been for the last 10 years.",N
4072,"I like this hotel. Ive stayed there twice even though i live in the city. But you really have to bargain at the front desk for a good room. The first time i stayed there the room was huge, one wall was all floor to ceiling windows, facing north, with the most breathtaking view. The second time i stayed there, for the nye party the other week, we got stuck in a small room, facing east, with a small window and an ""ok"" view. They also didnt honor our request for a smoking room, and had a note on the desk saying there would be a $250 cleaning charge for smoking. But, they are decorated very nice, and the staff at the desk is really nice and patient too. wouldnt go back for the nye party though- it was so huge i spent the whole time walking around trying to find people.",N
111,"Holiday Inn Express is an affordable good enough hotel. I found a deal online and booked this hotel for around $75 a night which is pretty cheap for downtown Chicago. The lobby and the common area are nice. The room is VERY small, but it has a comfortable bed. For me, when you're in downtown Chicago, you're not going to spend a lot of time in your room anyway. They have free wifi which is nice. Their free hot breakfast was also decent too. The rooms are nothing to brag about, but the location and price give this property a 4 star.",N
5555,"All the amenities without the price.  Found a great deal on http://hotels.com at about a 25% discount to the surrounding hotels in the area.  Pool, hot tub, new treadmills, free hot breakfast (waffles!), LCD tv's and free wi-fi jussssst to name a few.  I called ahead and they were fine with me checking in early (9AM).  Free luggage closet service if you decide you want to book an evening flight.  No hassles, great service.  Just a few blocks from the Willis tower (formerly Sears tower)... one block from the Brown, Orange, Purple, Pink Metro.  This is very new hotel, highly recommended.",N
224,"I have been wanting to stay at Hotel Indigo for quite some time now. Last weekend my best friend flew into town from Scottsdale, AZ - Gave me a great excuse to finally check this place out 1st hand. Pros: 1. - LOCATION! - Could walk to Old Town, State/Rush for night life, the beach, even to downtown if you have your comfy shoes. 2. - Decor! - Loved it! - Very unique! They are so proud of their decor, that even have a page in their hotel booklet of things in the room you can take home with you as a souvenir, and how much each item costs. I'll tell you what, that gave us a good laugh!!! 3. Have Aveda Products in the room, that was nice to use instead of typical generic junk. 4. Staff was great! - Very friendly! Cons: 1. Overnight Parking - $36.00 2. Save $40.00 and book online with Expedia/Priceline. I called in the reservation and they added all these taxes and fees that otherwise would not of been there. So I got SCREWED with the bill at checkout. (That $$ otherwise would of paid for the parking.) Would I go there again? Heck yes! - Great for girls weekend!!!! Partied 'Vegas' style!",N
2540,"I kept trying to reassure myself that this place wouldn't be as bad as the reviews here made it to be, especially since we were paying for a ticket and it should be fairly exclusive, right? Wow, Yelp, you were sooooo right and I swear to never doubt you again. THIS PLACE WAS HORRIBLE (and yes, I am breaking internet etiquette to express this statement!) Spent almost $75 a person just to wait. Jokingly we said the club should be called ""The Line"" but honestly, we waited for almost every freaking thing we didn't even want to do anymore. We had an amazing dinner at Thalia Spice (which we also did last year because it was just THAT good), then got to the club around 10pm, thinking most of the line should be gone. Instead, we arrive to find not only is the general admission still waiting, but even the idiots who decided dropping $100s of dollars for VIP was a good idea were still outside. What was even better was their ""so-called"" tickets were business cards with little numbers written on the top - why did I pay so much money for your stupid business card when I could have just taken one, then write scribble on a corner like a third of the people that got in for free? We waited in line for 45 minutes even though we purchased tickets ahead of time. When people started complaining, throwing fits, and demanding refunds, suddenly the line was moving faster... Shocker. It moved so fast we had to then wait in line for drinks for at least 20 minutes (not necessarily a line, but more like a mass of bodies around the only two bars in the entire place). Brilliant idea to put only three bartenders at the larger bar on a night like NYE and one bartender at the bar near the bathroom, which of course smelled like a cess pool. I get that it's an open bar and the bartender really wants tips but it got ridiculous when the bartender only paid attention to people who flashed $20s and titties. Not necessarily in that order, either. No real surprise when people would order six drinks a round for only their consumption when finally given the attention. I myself ordered 4 Coronas for my wasted time. Then, time to climb over more bodies and oh yeah, did I mention the broken glass that littered the floor? I never saw a single staff member moving to clean it up. Nor any puke that random drunk girls decided to produce on the dance floor. Or even the guy that admitted to me in his drunken stupor that he pissed on the main bar because the bathroom was too gross to enter. How magical. So midnight toast, fine - that was well and dandy other than the fact that we didn't get our party favorites or champagne as was to be included in our price (never saw the appetizer that was supposed to be included either, but at that point, nothing surprised me about this crappy place); thankfully people started to leave after the ball dropped. People falling all over themselves, the music was decent at best, and then the DJ or some distant voice in the crowd announces it's last call at 1:30... at 1:32, two whole minutes later, the house lights come on and that same distant voice says the club was closing. Wow, I'm pretty sure the advertisement stated the club would close at 2am. I know I'm not drunk because I never made it back to the bar after hearing about urine possibly being under my shoes. So yet the final line for the coat check. A girl friend of mine was shoved while we waited by some drunken idiot, so she started to shove back just to defend herself. Suddenly, she's getting fondled by security and thrown out of the club while her sister is desperately trying to prevent her from being hurt by testosterone-driven perverts. They literally picked her up by her legs and held her in parts they should not have been touching. Fast-forward to her waiting out in the cold without her jacket because they won't let her back in and guess what I discover? Bleeding scratch marks all over her exposed back. She's too disoriented and intoxicated to care, but her sister is furious and blind with anger. The females of our party were frustrated and completely disappointed with the night, while the males of our party were inebriated and thought it was a riot just to see women fight, even if it was their own friends. Absolutely horrible for NYE. By the way, one of the females will also be writing the General Manager and I am urging my friend who was injured to look into charges, if possible. As I stated in capital letters before, THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE.",N
3107,"I stayed at the W lakefront location.  We arrived at about 5 p.m. and the lobby was just picking up.  I must say the lobby is beautiful; flowers everywhere, lounge area with low sofas, a bar and resturant.  I stayed in a ""Marvelous suite"" (room 2818) that had a great view of Navy Pier and the beach.  It was a little foggy that night but as the fog lifted the view became even more spectacular.  I brought my own booze and had some friends overl.  There was a screaming baby across the hall for about 2 hours.  I was worried some whore of a mother dumped her kid in the room and went to the bar.  I called security but I dont know what happend after that.   My guest and I were having a blast and we turned the volume on the XM radio high.   At 12:40 security came to my room and said ""anyone not assigned to the room must evacuate!""  It was a little loud so my guest left :( Everything that night went pretty smooth, but when I called for my free breakfast in the morning I was rudely asked ""Why would it be free?"" from the hotel staff.  I reserved the room with a 3points+ program that gives me triple room points and breakfast in the morning.  I told him to check the reservation and he put me on hold.  5 minutes later he picks up and says he's only going to comp. 2 EGGS AND A OMLETE!  ""Thanks, I'll go to McDonalds"" was my response.  I mean come on, don't you think breakfast should include juice and toast?! Well at check out I brought this up and the lovely front desk agent and she credited $50 and apologized for the breakfast fiasco. So on Monday I review my charges and there is OBSCENE amounts charged to my account.  I called the accounting dept. and the accountant was extemely apologetic and helpful.  That was all cleared up after about 2 days and now, to restore my faith in the W they offered a free room. The hotel is beautiful, just watch your account activity after you leave.  If you have any problems I am confident the administrative staff will help you out.",N
1060,"This place has a total racket going for students taking their medical licensing exams in Chicago.  They are even listed on the test site website.  Well for 80 bucks a night, I could've bought two rooms at a motel, and I would've got a better shower.  It started with a very strange shuttle ride.  Even though there were at least 2 vans in the lot with official logos, the van that came to get me had a makeshift sign that said ""Garden Inn"" instead of ""Garden Hotel"".  I had my suspicions when I walked down the hallways with green and gold peeling wallpaper.  The water pressure was terrible and every 2 minutes it would get really hot and scald me.  When someone in another room turned on their shower, it squealed at a horrible frequency in my room.  There is a reasonably priced restaurant, but the food is subpar.  I tried it twice.  The first time I had pasta carbonara with a sauce so runny it should've been called soup.  I tried again, this time with a salad so drenched in vinaigrette that I couldn't eat more than a few bites...so I filled up on bread, and it least it was yummy!  There is no place like home.",N

2972,"They try to be top of the line, but fail miserably. Pros: - They now have Wifi.  It's fast enough, but only because I didn't have to pay for it. - Good complimentary breakfast/evening snacks, but only for certain members.  I got lucky because my boss booked the hotel, and he travels a lot, so I got these perks as well. - Clean gym, with sauna, and a pool. No hot tub though. - Nice lobby, with those screens you can play games - Free water bottle in your room every day - Comfortable pillows -Coffee maker in the room Cons: - Internet is $12.95 every 24 hours. -The room does not feel clean.  From the smell, to the look and feel of the carpet, to the stains on the ironing board. - The TV is pretty small, with unimpressive quality. - They charge for the gym. $12/day, or $20 for the stay.  Not worth it.  Oh, the best part? They don't really tell you that you have to pay for it, until you're there.  A guy will walk up to you and ask you to sign in and then either pay cash or charge it to your room.  Good, albeit dirty business ploy because when you're already at the gym, chances stay and finish your workout. - The shampoo sucks; it makes your hair feel like you just washed it with rubber cement. - The showers can't handle any amount of hair. I get it, I have a lot of hair, and it falls out when I wash it, but give me the option to clean out the hair instead of just forcing me to stand ankle deep in shower water. I would not stay here again if I had the choice.",N

3546,"Real Impressed!!!! For this place to be the cheapest hotel package in downtown is a little insane! We were really just looking for a place to crash over the weekend, but we instead got a pretty posh room and outstanding location to Michigan Ave/Rush St/Division St. The beds and pillows are heavenly, so I woke up refreshed (despite the hangover headache). The bathroom has decent shampoo/conditioner/lotions and a nice shower head, but the best part was the actual full-sized blow dryer (none of these travel-sized junkers).  The hotel bar had an interesting array of tap beers. Splash - the pool is on the roof with an amazing view!  The concierge was awesome - we emailed him a few questions before we arrived and he answered them promptly.  The service when we checked in was so-so. Overall, it's it definitely a hotel I would recommend and stay at again.",N

A long, dramatic hallway leads to a spacious suite, perfect for our getting ready for surprises #3 and #4 on the engagement tour, and for popping bottles of champagne in celebration. The staff was gracious and accommodating, and had I known where on earth I was going while I hastily packed my overnight bag, I would have thrown in a swimsuit to take advantage of the killer 1920's-inspired pool area, complete with lunching balconies and ornate blue tiling.

438,"i consider this hotel like the old bait and switch scam. it's called the chicago south loop hotel.  so i assumed it would be somewhere near the loop.  it is about a 15-20 minute bus ride south from the loop.   it claims to be a ""boutique"" hotel, which it is totally nothing like. the first night we rode in on the train and took the bus over to the hotel.  as we got further and further away, we asked a passenger next to us where to hotel was and if we could get something to eat nearby.  he suggested not trying to walk anywhere at that time of day  in that neighborhood and to just order pizza.  our first not so great sign. the hotel itself is like in nowhere land.  there is nothing within like 3 city blocks of this place. on http://hotels.com it is described as 3stars and the amenities included free wifi, continental breakast, a bar and restaurant and a internet/business center.  my friend michelle and i only got to use two of these, the others we found to be missing. the business room was two computers with internet and a copier from 1996.  they even wanted to charge for computer use. the bar was closed at 10pm the first night we arrived and was never open when we wanted to have a cocktail. the only good things we found was the bus stop directly across and chinatown is very close. i would have given more stars, if the website and description wasn't a total lie. because really, the hotel is a little bare bones, but it's fine for cheapness and just sleeping while enjoying the city.  i was really unhappy with the fog and mirrors in the description though. love, juston",N

2164,"Stayed here for my first anniversary and loved it. You really can't beat the location. As other folks have noted, the Intercontinental is really TWO buildings - the historic tower, and the addition, or ""new tower"" (I'm using the term ""new"" loosely), which is just to the north. The main hotel entrance is in the new tower, and that's where you'll check in, visit the concierge, etc. We had a corner room in the new tower, and it was great. Not large, by any means, but clean, comfortable, and tastefully decorated (one window also opened!). Everyone from the bellhop to the check-in counter staff were professional, helpful, and friendly. The water pressure and temperature in the shower was flaky, but not a big deal. That said, the real allure of the Intercontinental is the historic tower. It has charm and history in spades. The first several floors are simply amazing. Each floor is decorated and painted in a medieval or renaissance manner which is astounding in detail. There are several small fountains, murals, nooks and crannies to explore. It's an entirely different experience from the new tower, and I feel sorry for the folks who stay at the hotel and never see the original building. We didn't stop at the hotel bar, but we did check out Eno, which is the wine, cheese and chocolate bar on the ground floor of the historic tower. The place is pricey, but fun if you're feeling indulgent. There are separate reviews of Eno on Yelp as well. The only other drawback was the expensive parking, which was over fifty a night. Keep in mind that parking costs are not included if you're booking the hotel thru a third party travel website.",N
4927,"Tea is a rip-off!Seating in the Palm Court is incredibly uncomfortable. Tiny sandwiches and pastries are mediocre and unmemorable.

This last time we had cocktails and then appetizers and drinks later on in the lounge, and the bar service was professional and spot on.

When I asked for Car service to take me back to the airport, what did the chick do, instead of calling for me, she wrote on a piece of paper the phone # and had me call myself. Asked her to print out my itinerary for my flight, she was having a hard time, since she didn't read the paper correctly to notice that I was flying a different airlines on the way back, she had the nerve to say "" Was this a frequent flyer ticket for free?"" making me sound like I was from the ghetto.

I was a bit confused because I went to check in and wasn't sure really where to go until I got ushered down by the desk staff (the front desk looked more like a bar to me). I felt darn underdressed but was still treated very well. The rooms are very modern. Lots of focus on details. I probably didn't appreciate half of it but it's dang stylish and has a serious euro feel to it. All fixtures and furniture was top notch. High quality leather seats and that square thing you put your feet on, nice desk, lamps, art, etc... There was also a pretty big happy hour crowd in the lobby for all of you who are into that.

Obviously in order to stay here they expect you to show up with at least 25lbs of nickels and dimes. My favorite part of our stay here was the warning I encountered when I tried to put my own bottled water into the mini fridge, ""For the safety of you and your fellow guests, please do not put any additional items into the refrigerator.""

The breakfast that they supply for preferred guests is quite good and their fitness center is impressive with its glassed in panoramic views of the city and lake. The staff was cordial and very helpful, although some people at the front office lost a cheesecake of mine (long story, it was from Eli's though!). A great hotel for the business traveler because of the location and amenities offered. The bar and lobby area are very nice but as with all hotel bars, very overpriced ($11 for a well vodka).

Except those decorative pillows. Those are gross, I pushed them off immediately. I appreciated the curved shower rod which made the tub seem larger. I did not appreciate the ill flushing toilet. Also, 26 floors up and you would think I'd get awesome cell reception, but no. Living within concrete walls for a long weekend did not please my phone. Concierge was helpful, elevator was pretty fast, as long as you weren't stopping on every floor. Hairdryer is found in a black bag hanging in the closet, if you seemed to miss it in the bathroom. Careful though, my friend blew the circuits using it on high and was without power for 30 minutes. I liked the ipod doc, nice touch. Made our preparties a bit more lively. The LCD tv was in theory a good idea, but jeez, the picture on mine looked like I was looking through a fishbowl. Housekeeping knocked on my door at 9am each morning so boo to that. Otherwise, great place for a stay. :)",N
3955,For the price and location of the hotel it is decent. Though as other reviews have suggested. The hotel does need to update its image completely. Stepping into the hotel it will remind you of 1940 opulence but without the glamour. If you are in a pinch this is a decent place to spend a night. Also make sure to get a room facing the park otherwise you will be looking into somebody else's room or into the middle of nothing. If you can afford a little more money I suggest you spend it and get a more comfortable place to stay.,N

1116,"When you walk into the lobby on a cold blistery Chicago night, you're dazzled by the warmth of the lights and the contemporary feel of the bar & the restaurants on the first floor. Their rooms however seem a little cramped and for someone of slightly less than average height as I was not able to reach the cord to close the shades for privacy. Bad planning Fairmont. Yet again bad planning in the bathroom. The shower was a rain shower, which meant having to spend twice as long to rinse my hair and with no angle to the shower head, washing was not as easy as one would like. The bathroom is probably the biggest reason for the low marks. Everything in there seemed cramped and less than functional. While there for an event I experienced one of the ballrooms and the Moulin Rouge room. The ballroom needed some serious updating, everything just felt old and out of date. the catering was also mediocre. While in the Moulin Rouge room, there was an interesting layout with some great wallpaper, though the carpet horribly clashes and is distracting from some of the unique features of the room. Food there was much more interesting & satisfying. I've heard that Aria in the Fairmont is supposedly the best sushi in Chicago, though it's good & I loved that they were willing to make my favorite roll that was not on the menu, it is be no means the best I've ever had. The best thing about the Fairmont? The beds themselves. They were very comforting after a long day of traveling.",N

And even though I was only at Gold SPG member at the time, they upgraded me to a junior suite. Everything's within walking distance (Michigan Ave., Navy Pier, etc.) so that makes things convenient. A good experience overall.",N
5196,"What a place.  Excellent location right in clean downtown and within short walking distance to the ""Magnificent Mile.""   The view from our 32nd Floor River View room was lovely, up and down the river with their recently redone colorful waterfront.  Even with glorious sunsets, and the Trump Tower (the second highest building in North America) is right across. We had lucked out. Booked at a very low rate through an international Internet travel agency, which went belly-up, and we were cancelled.  But an absolutely great customer service lady, Diane Pena, went all out to get us back in with a river view at the originally confirmed price.   Professional and attentive door service.  Truly appreciative of a gratuity.  Very pleasant, cheerful and welcoming reception.  Joelle, one of the best anywhere.  Room and bathroom inviting, large, bright, and clean.  Big comfortable bed.  A fridge you have to ask for in advance.  But...they still use old, electricity-guzzling incandescent bulbs.  No one else does that any more in our extensive travels.  Hey, save electricity and money.Would we come back?  Of course.  Soon.  Altogether, in Mid-September, the hotel added to a dream vacation.",Y
1166,"This place was reasonably price, close to transportation and walking to Navy pier, and very clean.  It is older and could be updated and we were disappointed that our room didn't have a fridge or microwave because we were there for 4 days and had leftovers each day we couldn't keep. The room was small and basic. The staff was friendly, especially Wallace the concierge.  It doesn't have any sort of continental breakfast which is a shame when all you want is just a little bit of cereal and you have to pay 4 bucks for it in the restaurant.  The bar/restaurant did have strong cheap drinks though. :) Lots of little restaurants/pubs nearby too.  We also reserved a room with a king bed but it was definitely a queen bed.  Very clean and quiet overall.  Free Wifi which is important.",N
3904,"First off, I didn't book this place -- work booked it for me. Such a bad experience I don't even want to waste the energy to write about it. Workers have been on strike here for ages. Not sure if that's the reason, but the rooms were not in great condition. (They were reasonably clean, though.) The iron in my room leaked badly. When I called the front desk to ask for a new one, the woman wasn't very friendly. I politely explained that I had to leave for a meeting in a few minutes, but still no iron after 30 minutes. Good thing I didn't really have a meeting, just an educational session I was okay with missing. The lines in the lobby were always bad. We tried to save time on checkout by using the machine, but it didn't work (not even a little).",N
375,Very tired hotel...but great location.,N
2673,"Lots of bad notes about this hotel: - The door wall and the bathroom walls are very thin. If your neighbor takes a shower, it's going to be deafening in your room. If the cleaning service is in the hallway talking you're going to be able to catch their entire conversation. - On the rear (south) facing rooms,  you might be awoken from slumber for 1 HOUR of trash removal. They seem to queue up dumpsters (about 20) in the alley behind the hotel. The trash day seems to be monday. - For a business hotel the Wifi is horrible. Like 20 kbs/s horrible at times (that's dial-up speed). I suspect that this is because of the volume of people this weekend, and i'll let this segway into... - LUKEWARM SHOWERS. I hate capitalize, but this seems outrageous for such a well rated, expensive hotel. - Clogged showers. My shower wouldn't drain properly... they sent a repairman up who promptly removed a large wad of hair from the drain. The service was great, but I feel that this is something that should be tested between occupants. To end on a positive note: The service was excellent, their staff was friendly and well equipped to handle most problems you might encounter while traveling. I had them fedex home some liquids I bought that wouldn't have made it through security.",N
4224,Great location. However their staff needs training. I took a red eye from Los Angeles to Chicago and landed at 5:30 am.  I got to the hotel at 6:30 a.m.   When I checked in I was told by the front desk clerk that my room would not be ready until 3 p.m. I showed her my confirmation for a 6:30a.m. Check in. She repeated herself and tolde there was nothing she could do.  I then asked for the General Manager and he told me he could not do anything but would give me the first room that was cleaned. At 9:02 am I was called on my cell phone and given an upgraded room.   The room was great and the service after the first incident was fine.  The good here is just mediocre. OK for a Hyatt but might look to stay somewhere else next time.   DLR,N
2408,"I would not recommend this venue for any type of professional event or conference.  This review is of my experience as an exhibitor at a professional conference in July 2010. The 3 day conference was held in the Grand Ballroom for over 300 professionals in private equity, investment banking and mergers and acquisitions.   As an exhibitor/vendor at a professional conference, the main goal is to display your product or services to attract the attention of the conference attendees.  For 3 days I was at the hotel from early morning to early evening working as an exhibitor for one of my clients.  Because I am self employed, I brought my own laptop to use at the conference table.  This was to be used to show attendees the web based services that my clients had to offer.  There were over 20 exhibitors in the Grand Ballroom and many of them had laptops, lcd screens and other electronic equipment on their tables.   There was zero communication from the Hilton Chicago to inform us that we should have any concerns when leaving this equipment unattended. On the third and final day of the conference, I had my iPhone plugged into my laptop to charge and spent the morning at the table.  I had gotten up a few times to network around the room, and left the computer on the table, just as I had the previous two days.  Around 10:45am I got up to use the restroom and returned to my exhibitor table to find that in less than five minutes, my laptop and attached cell phone had been taken. I immediately reported this to security.  They were very slow in the process of questioning me and when I asked them about the security cameras, they informed me that the ONE camera they had in the Grand Ballroom does not cover the section of the room where my table was.  This piece of information alone screams DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THE HILTON CHICAGO.  How can a hotel in Chicago on Michigan Ave only have one security camera in their GRAND BALLROOM?  Not smart, not secure, not safe. In most situations I would never EVER leave my belongings unattended.  In a situation where you are in a professional work environment and your equipment is being used for work, there should be a feeling of security.  A person should not have to pack up their electronic equipment every time they need to use the rest room.  After over a month of communication with the hotel security, the only resolution they had was to compensate me for less than half of what it would cost to replace the items.  Their insurance policy stated that the loss was not covered because I was not a guest of the hotel.  (any person who walks into that hotel and pays to walk into that hotel should be considered a guest) I was treated as if I was neglectful and irresponsible yet they offered to partially compensate me to shut me up?  Bad business practice in my opinion.   Unprofessional, unethical and unsecured.  Highly DO NOT RECOMMEND.",N
4546,"The Palmer House is well located and has the feel of an old time Chicago hotel, or at least what I would expect an old time Chicago hotel to feel like. One question I have is, who puts a train line in front of a hotel? Perhaps at some point it seemed like a good idea but the noise can be disturbing. Fortunately, from the rooms you can't really hear the L running by, at least I couldn't from the 10th floor. The lobby area is impressive. The ceiling murals are grand giving it the feel of someplace special. Cell coverage in the lobby area and in other parts of the hotel are very spotty. This hotel seems like a popular place for group gatherings so if you're looking for something intimate, you should look elsewhere. I was there for a wedding and the place was overrun. Apparently there where three other weddings going on at the same time. The rooms have been remodeled. I stayed here a couple years ago and the place was looking its age. Now the rooms have been painted and fixed up. The furniture is more modern. However, the rooms are on the small side. Also the hotel is shaped like a U so some of the rooms are shrouded in darkness. Ask for a room with a view if you like light. I didn't have a minibar in my room which was troubling. I can't complain about the price though. I found a really good rate online at the hilton site and with a AAA membership the total came to $143 a night!",N

SCORE! it's an over the top hotel and very comfortable and accommodating. i HOPE that i will be able to go there again!",N
3134,"I am semi cross posting this with my review for the hotel's restaurant, Wave's, since the major issue of hotel security affects those staying at the hotel as well as dining here. I was recently robbed in the restaurant in the hotel's lobby.  My purse was tucked between my feet under the chair/table, and at some point during the meal, it was stolen.  We later realized that there was a man sitting behind me who had turned his chair around and leaned towards us, and we believe he used his foot or some kind of implement to drag my purse out from under the table unnoticed.  Pretty ridiculous, right?  This is the sort of thing that takes practice.   The hotel management was unhelpful to the point of being actively combative when I reported the theft.  I immediately filed a police report and was met with rudeness and a complete lack of assistance from any of the hotel management.  The security guard especially was purposefully rude, and when I complained about the treatment, as the victim of a crime, to the manager, all he would say was, ""I have no control over the behavior of the security team.""  Um, you are the manager of the hotel, and that does not make any sense.  We eventually got the security manager of the W City Center on the phone, who apologized profusely and began to actually help us, including taking down a description of the suspect from the people who had sat across from me and letting me know how to file a formal complaint with the hotel, which the hotel manager had completely neglected to do.  Even in a less trying situation, this customer service would have been unacceptable, but after being robbed in the hotel, in what now turns out to be a repeated occurrence, it became downright offensive.  It's too bad, because I had been a big fan of W properties, but I would never, ever come back to this restaurant OR hotel again.  Potential future visitors, consider this your official warning. After reporting this story to friends, I found out about several other women who had the exact same thing happen to them at this restaurant over the past year.  That sounds like a really bad pattern to me.  Since this has happened, the police and my insurance company's private investigator have confirmed that this hotel is a very common spot for robberies in Chicago.  The fact that the management evidently does not take this seriously is a huge problem.",N
2880,"We stayed here for two days and it was alright.  We had to upgrade to the club level because they were not going to give us a room with a king sized bed.  Even though we called ahead of time to re-confirm they said they just had a handicap room or double beds.  We've been stuck in both before and now we know better.  We upgraded to club level, and while I enjoyed the extra breakfast and cocktail hour snacks, it's didn't quite make up for the extra $75 price increase.   Also, shockingly, when I woke up after my first night in the Sheraton bed I found my legs covered with an unsightly poison-oak-like rash.  VERY MYSTERIOUS!  I had been on a plane all day the day before, not frolicking in the woods, so I can't say where I picked up this uncomfortable affliction.  Do they use weird laundry prodcuts?  Allow pets in the rooms?  I don't know, but it has made my legs red and bumpy and not too attractive in my skirts and dresses.  Boo.  That and the bathroom in the room is sketchy.  The light hums LOUDLY and the shower has no water pressure.  The sink taps are strangely designed and difficult to turn on and off.  Bad design in there.  Otherwise it was an ok hotel.  Close to Navy Pier and the art museum.",N
4575,"I don't know if I have anything new to add- I agree with almost every statement here to some degree.  The lobby is luxurious and even nicer with Christmas trees in it, the location is great, the room is a bit small but the beds are comfy, the bathroom was a good size.  they do get you with the extra charge for internet and no breakfast.  Total bill was around 400 for 2 nights including parking, which is not bad for NYE in downtown Chicago, although we probably could have done better.  We stayed in a renovated room so the furnishings were fine, and we could hear our neighbors and the El go by, but very quietly, so I didn't think it was an intrusion.  The view wasn't breathtaking, but I could see some skyscrapers and we were high up.  I would have liked a mini-fridge to keep left-overs in.  It was nice that we could stay in the parking garage until 5 even though check-out was at 11.    All in all, a fine place, probably a 3.5 more than a 3.",N

It was quiet, the couches were comfortable, and the food was incredible.  Not to mention the great ambiance.  We were unexpectedly pleased with our meal and experience!",N
2154,"***3.5 Stars*** Ok, maybe it's just me, but when I stay at a hotel with the reputation of the Intercontinental (and the price tag), I expect something special.  This hotel is really quite ordinary.  I stayed here recently for a conference and while the meeting amenities were fantastic, the hotel room itself was only mediocre at best. So, let's start with the mediocre first.  My hotel room was spacious, located in the historic tower  (I guess that's why it seemed that my room hadn't been updated in a very long time).  The bed was not comfortable and the lounge chairs were old and worn.  The rest of the furnishings were old and very used to the point of having drawer fronts askew on the desk and doors that wouldn't open properly on the TV stand.  Like I said, with a hotel of this reputation and price, I expect a comfy bed, some chairs that don't look like they've been around since 1964 and furniture that isn't out of grandma's attic. Then, there's the bathroom.  It's like they may have tried to update it at one point...and then gave up.  I had an impossible time maintaining one water temperature both in my sink and in the shower.  Imagine trading between scalding hot and lukewarm.  Gee, I'm now awake AND I've sustained 3rd degree burns.  AWESOME!  The towels were crustier than sand paper and, come on people, can we please have two-ply toilet paper??  Single ply is what I expect from your much cheaper cousin, the Holiday Inn. The redemption in the hotel room was the large, flat screen TV.  That I did enjoy (along with my $6 bottle of water). Now on to the good stuff...The meeting facilities.  These were simply wonderful.  The staff was courteous and friendly.  They accommodated all of my vegetarian meal requests without blinking an eye.  The breakfast buffet was a breakfast lover's dream - everything imaginable and all of it very tasty.  The banquet lunches were quite good and all the meat eaters enjoyed their entrees.  The rooms where we had our meetings were well maintained and very clean.  Temperature was nicely maintained as well.  I would highly recommend their meetings services and facilities.   Of course, in the end, you're paying for the location.  Yeah, that can't be beat.  It's within walking distance of just about everything the Mag Mile has to offer - great restaurants, bars, shopping...",N
2156,"Yes, it's an Intercontinental, but not quite as nice as other Intercontinentals I've stayed in.  In fact, there were a couple major flaws: (1)  The rooms are NOT soundproof.  At all.  Like I could hear the conversation in the next room.  I could hear people walking around in the hall and doors slamming.  Not great. (2)  The curtains are not lightproof.  Both curtains were drawn and I still awoke from all the light coming into the room at 6am (we were facing east so...). (3)  Crappy towels and no bathrobes. (4)  Comfy bed, but kind of scratchy sheets. (5)  Fancy looking bath products but I didn't really like them. HOWEVER...the location really can't be beat.  Right on Michigan Avenue.  About two blocks from the river.  A ~10 minute walk to most train lines. Also to note:  Breakfast at the hotel is $23 for a buffet.  Not unexpected, but breakfast isn't usually a meal I like to splurge on.  You can order a la carte, but be aware that juice and coffee (which are included with the buffet) are ~$4 EACH.  Breakfast entrees are in the $8-13 range so maybe you DO just want to get the buffet...   I did really like the wine/cheese/chocolate bar located off the lobby.  It was pricey, but very enjoyable.   We hotwire-d the room and I think total (with taxes and everything) it was about $125/night (and actually the next to cheapest hotel we found in the Loop area).  This is a place I would stay again if the price was right, but other than that, I didn't find anything fantastic about it.",N
1885,"I stayed at the city center in December. First the good, big room nice foyer and a bar that's in close proximity to a very cool casual hangout type entrance.

I mean it's not rocket science and the jw marriott accross the street had a GANG of employees that knew how. The ugly, what the fuck is that smell in the front lobby ? Seriously, every night when we stumbled back to the place it was something wretched this way comes.... Other than that, maybe I expect too much.

A bottle of our own wine went missing out of the room. We got it back, but were then very late for a reservation and there was very little apology and NO compensation for something that should not have happened.",N

I was in the historic tower which was nice, but unfortunately they only had 2 elevators to my floor, which made the wait quite bad some days.  The room itself was roomy and clean with a nice bed and tv/entertainment center.  Things were always clean. They charged for internet which was a pain since I was there for so long.  Also, the gym had a $18 one time fee which got you access to the pool (see other reviews...it is historic and nice) and a decent workout room. The service was good but I did not ask too much of them since I used yelp for most of my dining.

4105,"We stayed at the Hyatt Regency for a week while visiting Chicago. Overall our stay at the hotel was pretty good, but there were a few things that really kinda sucked about this hotel. The hotel itself was pretty decent, the rooms were fine, nothing amazing, but fine. My first complaint was that the entire time we were there we consistently were hearing this banging noise, almost like someone was hammering on something. We made a comment about it to the front desk and they told us it would stop and they gave us a $15 coupon for food/drinks. The noise continued throughout the entire week. A second complaint was the TV. No, we were not in Chicago to watch TV, but whenever we did it was terrible. We had about 5 different news channels, 1 channel that showed a 24 hr. infomercial on prosthetic hands, and Russia Today. Really? My third complaint was the lack of wifi. Our first day there we called downstairs and found out that wifi was $13 per 24 hours. Eek!! The entire time we were in Chicago we made daily visits to the Corner Bakery for internet. Don't get me wrong, overall we really enjoyed our stay here, but there were a few things that were less than stellar. The staff was really nice and helpful and although I probably won't stay here again, I'd recommend someone else to stay here.",N

3834,"Starting from the doorman, the staff at the Dana is pretty damn friendly.  The girls at the registration desk were honest, congenial and humorous, even though some white-collar accountant-looking-type was being handcuffed right behind me while checking in.  Seriously.  (Although I never found out what led to that.) The lobby, the lobby bar and the adjacent restaurant are all small and relatively quiet, but definitely have a ton of style.  In fact, the entire hotel was far too cool for me, specifically, and probably too cool for most of humanity. The Tranquility Suite was simply awesome-- 2 rooms (a bedroom and a huge living room), 2 tiny balconies with amazing views (ask for a higher floor unless you have severe vertigo), and a nice bathroom with an unbelievable shower for two.  Seriously, this room offered the best shower imaginable-- complete with 2 rain-style shower heads, 2 benches (for the ladies of course), a set of high-powered jets, and a handheld thingy that spits out mad amounts of water.  This shower is definitely not ""green"", but it's the sort of place that makes you not want to leave.  Finally, the bedding is tremendous-- it's hard to imagine feeling more comfortable in a hotel bed. All in all, the Dana appears to be designed to make you not want to leave your room (or the spa for that matter).",N

The room was bright and modern, not huge by any means but not small either.  The bed was ridiculously comfortable..I didn't want to get out of it.  The bathroom was big with Khiels products, which promptly went into my bag.  The mini bar is unlike any mini bar I've seen.  There weren't just airplane sized bottles, there were large bottles of Grey Goose, Johnny Walker, Patron and more.  And there was a wine opener, martini glasses, and wine glasses which was key as we brought some wine to drink. The service was top notch.  We didn't have a remote for the stereo to listen to our ipod so we called the front desk...the remote was at our door in less than 3 minutes.  Turn down service includes a tasty little cookie and more Khiels products if needed.  I loved that check in and check out was 2pm.  It really allows you to enjoy the room.

59,"Oh man - where to start?  Well, I saw a funny review on Orbitz which expresses my sentiments perfectly, so here's an excerpt... ""The Inn at Lincoln Park is located in one of Chicago's trendiest neighborhood and yet, the hotel itself does not live up to ...  its surroundings. The comforter on the bed looked old and a bit worn and perhaps it was the combination of humidity that made me not want to take my shoes off... Oh, and I didn't feel comfortable sitting on the toilet seat without first covering it with toilet paper... When was the last time they cleaned that bathroom? On the plus side, I found the front desk staff to be very helpful and genuinely concerned about my comfort. It's in an EXCELLENT location and I felt very safe in the neighborhood. With that in mind, one night was enough for me."" So in summary: Pros: * location - lots of shops and food (the walgreens on the corner is closed right now though) * pleasant staff - very accommodating and helpful in my experience Cons: * the rooms - small, uncomfortable, and not clean I don't like to be too negative, so will leave it at that.  Keep in mind that you're paying half or a third of the cost of a nice hotel, so you get what you pay for.  If you've stayed in hostels through europe in your youth and can still stand it, this place is fine.  So I'd say this is the right place if all you care about is having a bed to sleep on and would spend as little time as possible inside the room.  I never realized I had become a hotel snob until I stayed here, so the Inn at Lincoln Park will always have a place in my heart.  Somewhere in the back/bottom...",N

3082,"LOVE this hotel. The boyfriend and I had a late Valentine's Day celebration here by renting a room (staycation i guess? too bad I detest that word). The hotel definitely has unique design, very suave, fun, and modern. Our room was a ""Spectacular"" room with a view of the lakefront. Too bad it was a usual gloom and doom foggy Chicago night. Got drinks at Whiskey Sky on the 33rd floor. Very small, great drinks - would have liked a better view of the city (the view isn't bad, it just can be hard to see it without kneeling on the couch - at least if you're 5'2). Only complaints/notes 1) Parking - $48 for overnight valet parking. Good lord. We just parked on the street a few blocks away and paid like $10 in meter parking. 2) Let it be known that if you are a very private person when it comes to using the bathroom, this might be rough for you. There's a sliding door, but there are also cafe windows into the bathroom that don't *fully* close. Otherwise, absolutely love and recommend this place.

They offered to upgrade our room to a river view for only $10, which we would have done.The hotel was close to a few good restaurants and within walking distance of Trader Joe's, which was a plus!I didn't mind the elevator ride, parking was very easy, and it was a comfortable room. There was a cab always available for us to grab when we needed it, this is a hotel we'd stay in again.",Y
3921,"We ended up choosing this hotel without research because the price was unbelievable. We could not have been more delighted. The hotel makes you feel like you've stepped into the 1920s. The room was really nice and comfortable and made us wish we could stay more than two nights. The hallways were really funny to try to navigate and it was quite an adventure to get to your room if you are staying far from the elevator. The hallways are endless. When I return to Chicago, which I definitely want to in the near future, I would absolutely stay here again.",N
3279,"Hotel was decent, good location but $46 for parking in an insult! This isn't Manhattan.  Raise the price of the room a few dollars and say you have free parking, seems like a much better value.",N
3250,Most of my stars go to the services. I was running late to a meeting and the doorman took my bag and hand my claim ticket quickly. Clerks and room care takers A+. I must say 1. some of the rooms need paint jobs. 2.Ask for a Tub if you want one. 3. Ask or wait for a higher floor level. Nice view 17 or higher.,N
2344,"Wonderfully located to all of the Magnificent Mile shopping and dining, as well as the Rush ST entertainment district.  Easy access to Lake Shore DR or I-94 and the Loop as well.  The valet and bellhops work hard to get you in and out of your car which can be tricky since they only have one lane in their pull-in area.  Yeah, the $48 valet parking is pretty steep, and there are lots of garages nearby, but come on, this is downtown Chicago parking is a bigger bear than those guys playing down at Soldier Field, you may end up spending less with the valet if you want in and out privileges.  The lobby is gorgeous.  Contemporary without feeling cold.  Elevators (at least the high rise ones) are fast and efficient.  Every staff person I came in contact with was courteous and professional.  The rooms aren't huge, but large enough.  Comfy beds.  Shower had great water pressure (pet peeve of mine).   Here's a tip...if you want a great view high up request a feather free bedding room.  We were on the 39th floor on the Michigan AVE side which gave us gorgeous views of the Mag Mile skyline.",N
4483,Excellent hotel in the old school.  Discreet and helpful staff.  Beautiful property.,N
2541,"This place is a bit odd. They are one of those clubs where Friday night is Latino night, Saturday is african american night, and then they tend to switch it up every other week or something?   Last night my friend forwarded me the 'get in free' text from the promoters.  They wouldn't let me in free because it wasn't from the promoter himself. Weird because word-of-mouth marketing is the best way to go. I couldn't believe the money-takers at the front door that night.  I paid $10 to get in there and then I had to put up a fight to go outside for a quick smoke.  He said ""if i let you out, then I have to let everyone out"". I think there should be some kind of law that allows you to go outside for fresh air (or not so fresh air lol). Thought America was a free country but who knows.  I think they missed the whole stamp-on-wrist idea that most clubs do to know who's been in and who hasn't. I then had to beg them again to let me out so I could change my shoes. My feet were literally bleeding from my shoes.  They wouldn't. So I took my shoes off and started walking through the club barefoot. That got their attention and they let me go out and come back in. WOW!  It's odd because every other time I had been there they let people outside. I knew it was because of the dudes at the front taking money.  Who the hell hired them? When it's a popular night they overcrowd the place.  It gets ferociously hot in there.  One time they sent out a burst of cold air through the club. It was the best 20 seconds of the night.  Just a tease though because it went right back to being hot. Ill go back because Im forgiving :)  But I don't like being disrespected by the front door staff.  They are kind of rude to the customers. Sometimes I think people forget that the customers pay for them to have that job. We are the reasons they are there. I don't want them to roll their eyes at me for simple requests.",N
977,"This is one of two hotels my company uses in Chicago, so I stay here a lot. It's fine, and could be really good, but I just wish it would fix some of it's foibles. Pluses: great fitness room with new and high quality equipment. Free wireless. Comfy beds. Good idea: happy hour, with good quality booze. Bad execution: the room only seats about 20 people, and in 15 days here I think I've been able to find a seat twice. Good idea: breakfast set out on each floor, and the coffee is really good. Bad execution: show up at 7:10 instead of 7:01, and it has been raided, with no idea when more might be coming, unless you want to go to a different floor. So-so: River North location. Close to lots of restaurants, but can sometimes be full of loud bar-goers who make noise at night. Just hope your room isn't within shouting distance of Public House. Not good: I think the night desk guy is snotty and not terribly helpful. Weird: room service comes from Harry Caray's. They do at least have salads and sandwiches on the menu in case you don't want a $35 steak for room service. I'd like to like it here, but I've just seen too much of the place's quirks to be really happy with it.",N
4647,"I stayed here a few times for business shortly after it opened. It has a nice location, and it's very modern. The staff was friendly. The restaurant wasn't open yet, but the bar was nice. I didn't spend much time there since it was very expensive and I had a lot of work. The rooms were small but nice. Although I haven't been to Tokyo, it's how I picture hotel rooms there based on my expertise from Lost In Translation. I really didn't mind the small space since it was very well designed and decorated. My main complaint would be the bathroom. There's nowhere to put any of your stuff since the sink is a pedestal with no storage. Also, the shower has a curtain that doesn't stop the water from making a good sized puddle on the shower floor. I'm sure the maids love this. I was very pleased with the great staff and nicely appointed rooms, especially at the comparatively low rates for Chicago.",N
4098,"HUGE HUGE HUGE hotel!!!!  When getting here Friday afternoon, there were a TON of people.  Luckily my party was already checked in, but I can't imagine the line.  All in all the rooms were nice and the bed was comfortable, but whenever you needed anything it took 45-60 minutes to get it.  Also, a room nearby had the smoke alarm go off, so that was a nuisance to figure out what was going on. Oh - don't valet/park your car at the hotel.  It took 50 minutes to get the car back.  Try to find some sort of parking outside the hotel nearby.",N
4845,"I enjoyed my stay here in February, but this place is not without its disadvantages.

Huh?- Food at the restaurant = not cheap- Can sometimes get a little crowdedAll in all, this place is worth checking out.",Y
582,"We had the pleasure of being a guest for the Opening Night event this week and I must say, I was blown away. This is true Ian Schrager style and cool charm without all the glitz and spangles and at a REASONABLE price point! Hotels seem to be reaching the breaking point with their prices for rooms these days.... The food was outstanding and the service was impeccable! EVERY employee, from the door man to the cleaning staff were most knowledgeable about the space, it's history as well as helpful and charming in their own way. Definitely a return spot for us and clients. I TOTALLY disagree with the post by the last person....js",N
3335,"I stayed at the Hard Rock for 2 days and have to say the hotel is nice and has a cool look to it. But like so many people have said it does indeed have dimly lit rooms and equally dim hallways. But as two brothers on a trip to see Chicago it did not bother us. I can see how it would bother a woman trying to do her make up since it is darker than the usual hotel room. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean. Good view of the marina city buildings (aka the corn on the cob twin buildings) from room 811. It is located in a nice area of downtown Chicago with Millennium Park just 5 minutes away and close to many boat tours on Wacker Drive. We were granted a late check out (1pm instead of noon) so that was nice for us since our flight was not until 5pm. The hotel also has free wifi internet which was a nice touch since so many 4 star hotels charge for 24 use of their internet. I used the concierge to check into my airline and print out my boarding passes. They were quick with getting them for me as I checked out. I do agree with the previous post that paying more than $100-$150 a night is not worth it. But then again thats because I got this for $100 a night off of priceline. I could not imagine paying the $250 a night they wanted through their website. Even with the $25 itunes gift card offer thats just too much to pay for a room. I would recommend this hotel to a friend and I would definitely stay here again. But next time I'd prefer the Beatles floor (4th floor), we got stuck with Cheap Trick (8th floor).",N
3193,"Wow...so much to write, let me try to get to the point. I went for New Years. When I walked in it was nice. Nice decor, friendly people, music was great ,a really nice ambiance. Then I went to my room. It was OK I guess. Nothing extravagant but what is up with the bathroom? It has a sliding door that you can't lock and it's made of wood. Then there is a sliding wood window. So if you are squatting to use the bathroom the person outside of the bathroom just slides the window open and peek a boo....they see you! Then it's not like your typical hotel where you will find a bible in the drawer. Nope.... you'll find condoms to purchase and a $13 romantic CD. There is no coffee in the room for your morning coffee. Room service is way overpriced, definitely did not order room service. This hotel is way over prices honestly. I stood there and usually I will park at the hotel and get my ticket validated because I am a guest....nope...$55 when I got my car back for a 24 hour stay. Now lets talk about what happened at night. The elevator door opened at the Lobby at 11:30pm and the smell of weed hit me in the face. There is a lounge/club on the 8th floor that everyone was riding the elevator to get to. It is tiny but yet hundreds of people were going there, way over booked and the people that were going there were all stoned. I guess I had a different impression of this hotel. It is in a classy neighborhood so I did not expect all the craziness that went on that night to be allowed there. I was even surprised when I went to the front desk there were 3 guys chipping in money to get a room. They were putting in $1100.00 for a room, they were arguing because they didn't have enough money and needed to go out to the car to get more. See I didn't even know you can get a room paying cash, I thought a credit card was always required. Needless to say, I won't stay there again but it's a nice place to hang out at the bar on a normal day with friends. Oh....the pool was nice and warm I enjoyed that.",N
3439,"I used hotwire (i love love love hotwire) and booked for a 4 star hotel. Sadly as soon as I stepped into the room I knew this was NOT a 4 star hotel, it was clearly a 3 star. Pros: - FANTASTIC location. my view outside my window was of tiffany's and saks. awesome sight to wake up to =) - comfortable bed (why it was not a 4 star) Cons: - no cable tv! no local network channels either! only pay per view! - no morning newspaper option - TINY room...my college dorm room was bigger - poor bathroom amenities: poor quality towels, no body lotion - housekeeping came at 9am... I'm really not sure why they advertise themselves as a modern boutique hotel because the Allerton is clearly more of a clean budget hotel thats only worth staying at because of the location.",N
1631,"Besides the location and the view, this is by far the most overrated hotel in Chicago,  Our room was severely outdated and literally dirty.  The window had duct tape around the edges (presumably for ""insulation"").  The sink & shower faucets leaked water everywhere (mold is definitely growing behind the scenes).  The linens felt like sandpaper and there were no extra blankets or pillows.  The closets didn't even have hangers in them.  The television (they advertised flat screens) was a Zenith from the early 90's.  Room service was fast, but the food was mediocre and outrageously expensive.  The only thing slower than the elevators is the valet.  You can expect your car 20 to 30 minutes after calling for it, despite the fact that the garage is attached to the hotel.  If you're on a budget, don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a lot for very little with this hotel.  There are plenty of budget hotels in the city that are much, much nicer than Hotel 71.",N
2279,"I spent a week at the Marriott recently for a conference, staying, eating, and drinking here for 5 days. There is a lot about the hotel that is good -- even wonderful. But there are also some downsides. The front desk, concierge, and bell staff are phenomenal. They are friendly, attentive, and move the seemingly endless lines very quickly. They are that same combination of assertive and nice that characterizes most Chicagoans, and they remind me why I fell in love with Chicago in the first place so long ago. The maid staff falls into this category as well, when you run into them, and everyone of these people deserve a hefty tip and a round of applause. The lobby showcases Rush bar, a rushed place that is constantly packed with patrons and guests of the hotel, and the staff flurries about as quickly as possible, slinging overpriced drinks while holding a terse smile and their breath. I can't blame them for their stress, but they need a few extra helpers on hand. The rooms are basic but nice. No flat screens or iPod docks to be found, but the beds are comfortable, and the blankets are plentiful. I asked to be on an upper floor and was given a room on the 39th, with a lake view, which was lovely. However, the windows either don't seal well or are too thin, because it seems there is no sound dampening at all between you and the Magnificently loud Mile at your feet. The detractions I have for the hotel are more on the conference side. The food, while pricey, is supremely bland. I had salmon one night, chicken the next, and a vegetarian dish the following, and they all tasted exactly the same. I found this disturbing, to say the least. In addition, the conference rooms are freezing. When you are sitting on your duff for 8 to 9 hours a day, your circulation needs a bit of help from the temp gauges, and these rooms do not afford it. Bring a coat. Better yet, bring a sleeping bag. I would stay here again, but I would not plan another event here. I recommend it for a pleasure trip to the city. The location can't be beat, and the surrounding shops, restaurants, and walkable places are worth every dime.",N
3600,"I really struggled between rating The Drake with 3 or 4 stars. Having grown up in the surrounding suburbs, I have been made well aware of the prestige and history behind The Drake. When my then boyfriend and I planned our 1 year anniversary, we decided to each plan surprises for one another involving things we saw on our first date - a freezing cold 8 hour day spent exploring different parts the city. When walking by The Drake, I'd told him that it was the finest of the finest (he was from Kentucky and therefore unfamiliar) so for my anniversary I was surprised with a two night stay at this luxurious hotel. Words cannot properly describe the warmth of this debonair lobby with its beautiful rich mahogany toned colors, fine crystal chandeliers, and overwhelming aura of class. While well kept, I wouldn't be surprised if some of the decor was as old as the hotel itself. If not, I tip my hat to the person that recreated the sheer elegance of the 1920's. When I'm not writing about bars or drinking, I can be somewhat of a history nerd, and as dorky as it may sound, I enjoyed feeling like I had stepped in the past. Then I arrived on my floor. Holy Shit when did this become The Overlook Hotel? The second  I walked off the elevator, I became immediately aware that I was in a 90 year old building. The colors were cold and in complete contrast to what I expected from the lobby. It was almost a little creepy. When we arrived in our room, I found it very odly arranged. This may be a little hard to follow, so bear with me. Picture a rectangular room. The bed is against the a long side and faces the other long side with a night stand and desk on either side. The television (if laying in bed) was in the upper right corner of the room. Basically, the television wasn't straight on to the bed and the other long wall that was opposite to the bed was completely bare. The room just seemed very oddly arranged and unfinished. Much like the hallways, it lacked any color and had a slightly spooky vibe. While we were there, the concierge was nice enough to take us on a tour of the Presidential Suite where Princess Diana famously stayed in the early 90's. Once again I was blown away by the elegance of the 1920's being beautifully captured. It was surprisingly stunning to see such luxury up close. Even though our room slightly creeped me out, I still love The Drake Hotel for all that it embodies. Despite being $400 a night, I'm pretty sure our room was the equivalent of second class on the Titanic. I'm not sure we got our money's worth room wise, and if I ever return (I say ever because I have since moved to the city) I would definitely upgrade my room for the full experience. I do however think that every Chicagoian should tour the Presidential Suite. It is BREATH TAKING!",N
3623,"ugh.  love.  i've been dreaming of staying at this hotel since i was young, and was so happy when i was treated with a surprise stay. i was reading through other reviews and my review could be a bit biased because we were so spoiled..  we received a complimentary upgrade from a king suite to a presidential suite, and good lord, was our ""room"" wonderful.  this place was literally larger than my apartment and with the most amazing view of LSD and the lake. the bed was incredibly comfortable.. i don't know how describe it other than i felt as though i was sleeping on clouds.  we had breakfast in bed and the food was actually quite delicious, exceeding my expectations for room service.   my only complaint is that things are of course a bit outdated (which is fine) but could have been cared for a little more closely - i.e. stains on the couch, etc.  however, this was easy to overlook considering the state of the beautiful and a bit over the top suite we were staying in.. yet to try the high tea service, but my friend raves about it. p.s. we googled the princess diana suite, which is where we stayed, and apparently she had stayed in that same suite in the past.",N
5332,"This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed at! Anything that could possibly go wrong did go wrong. We checked in and immediately found peeling paint and mold in our shower which is unacceptable. We changed rooms and later that night I tried to take a shower. I couldn't shower  because the whole handle came off the shower, not to mention we had trouble getting hot water a couple of times. Also most of the hotel staff was incredibly rude and not helpful. The russian doorman were incredibly lazy and I had to tell them what to do. The only two people that were helpful at all were Pablo at the front desk and Rasheed the bell man. Before checking out, we checked the room for anything we might have forgotten. We found a glass under the bed filled with mold. I had been sick all week because I am allergic to mold, and it now makes sense because the Hotel seems to be covered in mold.I will never stay at this hotel again. We were treated like crap, and that is not what we expected when we drop THOUSANDS of dollars to stay there.",Y
5083,"ahh....pretention at its finest....this place is trying way to hard to be cool....service was A++++++++++ though, so I give two starts... And, it looks like shit box hotel from the outside, which is very cool. I know that is what they were going for, so they did a good job there!",Y
3630,"In (the other) Michael S's town for a conference and we're at the Drake.  Desk staff is the reason for the low rating.  F&B staff first rate, housekeeping kept their mocking to themselves.  But concierge and desk service was very uneven. Case in point:  One of my companions had her purse stolen during lunch (in the Drake room).  Desk staff does very little to assist her in getting money, i.d., submitting police report, etc. but focuses on how she'll pay for her (overpriced undersized) room. I cannot emphasize how utterly uninterested these people seemed in the needs of their guests.  Recommended to conference officials that they find another Chicago venue. Thank you for your attention.",N
1891,I came here for a wedding show and while I was waiting in the lobby for my boyfriend to pick me up I noticed that they don't have any plugs for people to use their laptops or to charge up their cell phones in their lounge area. I also have a problem with the fact that their bathrooms were nasty and smelled like a million unwashed &^%$#es and could be better maintained in terms of cleanliness. I am a huge stickler when it comes to nasty stinky bathrooms. It's a nice hotel just needs to be on top of keeping their bathrooms cleaner. I've gone to hotels where the bathrooms are so clean you can walk around barefoot in them. If they just have an area for those who want to charge their cell phones and use their laptops in the lounge area put some plugs in. Overall it's a nice hotel to attend a show or just staying there if you're on vacation or coming for buisness.,N
1837,"I've stayed in a few W's, they've all been very good but the staff at the Chicago W put them over the top. We just 5 days and all interaction with W staff from the front door, check-in and any staff encountered in halls & elevators was wonderful, any requests we made were answered with ""sure, no problem or we'd be happy to"" We were upgraded on arrival and our room was spacious, very well appointed and had a super comfy bed & pillows. The location was perfect for the Marathon, and the hotel really catered to the participants with goodie bags of Gatorade & bananas as well as laying out food & coffee for all in the lobby at 5am the morning of the race. I have to mention the Concierge staff and particularly Vanessa, she was instrumental in making our stay in Chicago a wonderful experience, we really can't say enough about how well we were taken care of. The hotel has a great vibe one of the better W Living Rooms and the location allowed us a few block walk to catch the CTA Blueline to and from ORD. A shout out to @WHotelsofChi we will see you again soon.",N
2459,"I've stayed here many times over the past 25 years, but most recently stayed here on the historic evening of November 4, 2008. We had tickets to the main event at Hutchinson Field in Grant Park and really didn't want to deal with the aftermath of getting home to the north side. So I was surprisingly able to use my Hilton Points to get a free room. Check in went very smooth. The room was nice and has the free coffee maker. Oddly enough, the young republicans and a republic candidate for attorney general of cook county were occupying the ballrooms. Though most of the traffic in the hotel was press and Obama supporters. Anyway, to get back to the hotel, they did a nice job of handling the evening with security and easily getting us back into the hotel. I would recommend staying here. The views of the lake and grant park can be spectactular.",N
1046,"We chose the Amalfi because of it's great  location, reasonable price and small size.   I  read the reviews of  other Yelpers and  after spending  the night there yesterday  here  is my take on this Boutique Hotel.   With the exception of the 2 front desk people , the staff is very friendly and helpful.  The style of the  lobby and common areas are  modern Italian meets Ikea .  The lobby is interesting, but I found  the two desks where you check in  an odd set up.   Our room, although small, was attractive, comfortable and clean.   I had read that some reviewers  found the rooms  run down.  This was not my experience.  The furnishings, wallpaper and linens looked very new.  The bathroom was quite large compared to the room itself.  It had a nice large vanity, make up stool, lighted make up mirror and a wonderful double headed shower.   The provided DVD's and CD's were lost on us, but the magazines and books were nice.     The hotel offers a free breakfast  of pastries and fruit on each floor. This is a nice touch and  very convenient especially  after a late night on the town.  They also offer a free evening  cocktail hour in a "" lounge"" on the 6th. floor.  We went upstairs to have our free drinks, but  found a long line of  people waiting to get inside.  We took a pass on the drinks. Would I stay here again?  Probably not.  Here's why... 1. The room was small and narrow.  It was ok for one night, but too small for more than that. 2. Noise.  Our room faced the alley and we heard garbage trucks , homeless people, hotel workers and people from the building next door all night long. 3. Age.  We are in our 40's and felt VERY old.  The average age seemed to be late 20's to early 30's. 4.VIEW....  The only view we had was that of the building across the alley.  I had read that  the views were bad, but bad is too nice for what you get.  I never thought I would care about views, but this was so awful that if we had planned on staying more than a day, I would have switched hotels.",N
5697,"Dear Lord, Please don't get me started on how HORRIBLE my experience with this place went. Only reason for the one star is free internet and free water bottles to fill up otherewise I would say negative and never coming back here is my answer. First off the employees are rude. We had booked for non smoking but we got smoking in a tiny bedroom that reeked I seriously thought if I stayed there longer than the amount of days I did I would have gotten second hand cancer in no time. I went and asked for the staff to spray it down or do something he just waved me off without even asking for the room number I was staying in. I even went out and bought a can of air freshener after day 2 it ran out from my many attempts to ""freshen"" up the place. There was a DRIED UP BOOGER on one of our towels (gross!). not only that but there was stains all over the carpeting literally looked like someone had took a big dump on the carpeting all over the place. Trust me I will never come back even if its free and suggest people to stay away.",N
1287,"They are super kid friendly at The Ritz-Carlton Chicago, and color me impressed: from check-in to check-out, this Four Seasons Chicago extension felt pitch perfect throughout. And I don't know why this isn't the norm, but it was really amazing to stay at a top flight hotel without feeling like the little one was an extra burden. She went everywhere we went, and they could not have been more accommodating. Some interesting sidebars: as the Ritz is right off Michigan Ave, even though you're in tourist central there's loads of shopping nearby if that's your thing, and some great restaurant options as well. I especially liked the idea that they'll rent an iPad 2 to you for twenty bucks a day if you want some high tech help seeing the city, and were it not for the fact that my face is usually affected by the pallor of my computer screen all too often, I'd have rented one, too. The lounge is spacious, opens up to the panoramic windows besides, and the service was prompt without looming. But in the end, often these stays are about the rooms themselves, and the one we stayed in couldn't have been more comfortable. Request a lake view if you can.",N
3612,"It's hard to do this but I have to take away some stars from The Drake.  Their service just isn't what it once was, unfortunately.   My last experience was horrid.  There was a social event for a group right off the lobby.  It was so loud that I could barely hear the harpist and just heard a group of 50+ people socializing.   Sadly, I won't be coming back to the Drake until they make some major changes.",N
2183,"I stayed at the InterContinental for three nights, I have to admit, if it wasn't for the fact that I booked through Travelocity, which means no adjustments, I would've checked myself into another hotel after the first night. Front desk lady was very friendly however that was the extent of good customer service. I got to my room, waited 45 minutes for my luggage (I only had one);  The Mini Bar was missing in my room so I called the Concierge and was told there will be one coming my way. After nearly an hour and a half, I called the front desk to cancel the Mini Bar delivery b/c it was approaching midnight. The lady simply just said ""Kk.""   I believe the phrase she was looking for was: ""I'm sorry, I'll get that ready for you right away.""  Ordered room service, was told the food would be ready in 30 minutes or less, waited over an hour; again, no apologies from the staff. The best thing about this hotel is the location. It's right on Michigan Avenue, close to lots of shops, restaurants and convenient stores. There's a Nordstrom & tons of other shops right across the street; a Walgreens adjustment to the hotel; Grand Lux Café & Joe's Seafood/Steak restaurant is two blocks down; Fox & Obel grocery & café is four blocks behind the hotel; Bank of America is right across the street; the hotel is within minutes of walking from many attractions;  not to mention there's a Starbucks downstairs. Even though the hotel itself was nice as previously stated, but the rooms are very small (standard sized room), you can barely get the room service cart in through the door! Lack of toiletry. Most importantly, given hotels are supposed to be about hospitality and customer service, I'd have to give my experience a three star and I believe that's plenty generous.",N
4073,"This may very well be the McDonald's of hotels, but staying here is like getting your happy meal from Ronald McDonald himself and finding an extra McNugget! I pricelined a room for 90 bucks for relatives coming to town. Like a reviewer below, we checked in using the handy self check-in machine and little did I know I would end up in a 3rd floor room looking straight at an air-vent covered roof. I think it was a janitor's closet or an excess furniture storage facility. The room had no light, no wallpaper, high, water-spotted ceilings, and the furniture was crammed any way it would fit. No good, I said. I made a quick call to get a room change and ended movin' on up to the east side- literally. I was given a new room on the 29th floor with a dazzling view of the Chicago River and Lake Michigan. The front desk clerk who gave me my new keys, Moji, couldn't have been more pleasant. Plus, the Hyatt is perfect for out of town guests as it equidistant between Millennium Park and the Mag Mile. Hurray for the Hyatt!",N

152,this is a clean hotel with comfy pillows and beds.  Everything was clean and the staff was helpful.  Only weird thing was the service came in and cleaned up the room but didn't leave new toiletries.  Upon request we got all we needed!  The rooms were a good size and we were on the 3rd floor.  Due to some decorative awnings we could only look down out our window to the street.  I would have liked to have been able to look up as well. It's located in a great spot close to everything.  Navy Pier was our farthest walk at almost a mile. I will say the window glass must be pretty thin because there was a bit of street noise. I would rank this hotel somewhere between Holiday Inn & Marriott.  It was a nice place I would go to again and was well worth the 110.00 rate,N
2976,"Ok... I always rely on reviews to help me choose hotels... But usually, Im too lazy to actually write one. However, as a parent, and as a person who thinks customer service should be mandatory and not optional, I feel like I HAVE to warn others about this hotel. Not only is it not child friendly, but its not PEOPLE friendly. I arrived at this hotel on a cold morning with my mom, my daughter, and my heavy luggage. No one as at the door to help with our luggage, and the doors are not automatic. Im a pretty easy going gal, so I helped myself. When we get to the room, its very basic, to say the least. Brown walls, brown floor, no decorations. Just basic. I get ready to make a local phone call and see that its 1.75 , and an additional 50 cents (or around that) per min after the 1st thirty mins. I assumed local phone calls would be included in the $100+ bucks per night I was paying to stay there. The fridge is stocked with vodka and snicker bars. And when I say stocked, I mean good luck trying to put your food in. I suppose this is there cute little way of saying eat the food they supply??? The candy is $4.00 The vodka, I don't know. I ask an employee where I can find a microwave, so I can warm my daughters food. He appears annoyed and tells me to call the front desk. When I call, they inform me they can send me a microwave to rent for $25. I tell her no thanks, but I would like for someone to come and empty the vodka out the fridge. I worry that my very active and curious toddler may get hold of it. She says ok. One day later, no one has come, and I move it myself. When I asked for a tooth brush, im told that I cant pick it up at the front, but they will deliever it. It ends up being a 40 min delivery. I get no apology from the employee who finally brings me one. The employees are arrogant and rude, the food is overpriced, the company itself doesn't seem to respect its customers... I could go on and on about how pissed I was after leaving this hotel. And I didn't even mention the $38 parking fee.....Why the 2 stars? It was clean, and the location is AMAZING. Ta Da. (Much like the several other surrounding hotels Im sure.)",N
3239,"I spent one night here  and had a marvelous stay. We got strawberries and melting chocolate sent to our room because we were celebrating a special occasion, it was a really nice touch! I liked the feel of this hotel, since it is ""rock and roll"" it doesn't feel uppity.. yet it is pretty nice inside. I don't feel like I'm getting stared at for being in my 20s. The rock and rollness of this place really stands our through their interior deco in the rooms mirrors, artwork, etc. The room itself is pretty spacious, with a nice and clean bathroom, wish the tub was a bit bigger though. We also asked for a guitar during check in but were then told that they were doing inventory and didn't have any  left. Then to our surprise there was a knock at our door and one of the bellman brought one up to us so we could rock out. We opted for the free guitar lessons on the TV, but there was no information on how we could access them, we had to call the front desk to find out what we had to do. Once we got on the correct channel, it was just completely blank. I don't know if it was because we missed the time (it only happens every 30 minutes) or whoever told us how to get to it misinformed us. Either way we rocked out for a little while and then we had to get back to our schedule. Either way it is a pretty nice idea and really fun. The only downside to the room is that the windows (although huge) are REALLY drafty,  we kept some of our leftovers from a restaurant on the window sill and it was kept nice and cold--that was how drafty it was! So we had to turn the temperature way up to make it actually feel like it was 73 degrees inside. Good think they had nice huge thick curtains to block some of the draft. They gave us free coupons for a drink at their downstairs bar which unfortunately we didn't get to use. But as we were in and out of the hotel between 8pm-2am , it was packed and poppin like any other club off the street. Pretty sure I saw a couple making out on one of the couches in the bar...! The concierge were really helpful in arranging things for us, leading us in the right direction. Our room was a great deal and overall it was a fun place to stay! I would stay here again!",N
1533,"I stayed here on my recent trip to Chicago based on the recommendations on several yelpers when I asked for a modestly priced boutique-style hotel in a good location. Things that I liked: * Check in took like 4 seconds.  I hate it when the person checking you into the hotel spends like 5 minutes pecking at their computer and making faces to try and check me in.  This was the way it's supposed to be.   * Large room.  Lots of space to spread out and a large window bringing in lots of natural light. * Location.  I had several meetings around Chicago, and because the weather was nice, I was able to comfortably walk to just about everywhere from here. Things that could have been better: * No one serviced my room during the day until it was too late and I was back to my room late in the day.  No biggie, for me, but a bit surprising. * I had to ask 3 times to get a smaller pillow.  They set me up with these gigantic pillows (who sleeps on those?) and I requested a smaller one for my 2nd night but it was like pulling teeth to get it. * They tried to overcharge me when I checked out.  Probably an honest mistake, but if I hadn't looked at my bill, it would have set me back an extra 50 bucks.",N
2354,"We looked at this hotel for our wedding.  We could not get a date that worked otherwise we would have held it here.  We worked with Amy and she was great.  Very responsive and worked with us on price.  The hotel is in a great location, has a decent sized pool, big bar, rooftop deck, and the price for parking was a bit better than the other hotels we looked at.",N
5753,"I stayed here with my new wife for my wedding weekend along with family members and had top-notch service.  Lena Lahart made sure everything was set up perfectly for our wedding party and even cleared up a minor glitch.  She was attentive, flexible, and not just another robot salesperson.  Contact her if you need to stay here for a wedding.",N
2216,"It's a great place to stay for a holiday weekend shopping trip.  The Historic, or south tower is the former Medina Athletic club.  Be sure to check out the junior olympic swimming pool and browse the conference and meeting rooms in the Historic tower The interior decorating in this tower is definitely unique.  Room service, while expensive, is very good.  The lounge is comfortable and the staff is very accommodating.  I'll definitely go back (and not just because I can stay for free)",N
2513,"the good: -they take pets. -the location; There's also a park across the street for Fifi. -there were two TVs in my room. -easy self-parking for $41/day or valet for $45/day. the bad and the ridiculous: -Yes, I know, I know-- the lobby is effin' beautiful already, but is that where you're going to sleep?? Our hotel room was TINYYY and really awkwardly laid out.  As a result, the furniture not only looked oudated but gawdy too.   -The TV was NEXT TO, not in front of, the bed.  Looks like they just tried to cram it in there, because really, there was no space.   -There was no vent in the bathroom, so hot showers meant a cloudy bedroom. -Wifi is available for $12.50 a day, or $3.50 an hour... most hotels offer this service for free.  It's 2008, dude!! -They nickle and dime you... I'm with Adam L on this one.  Yes, $6 for an unrefrigerated bottle of water next to the TV.  I know that the Hilton hotels target people with money, but do they assume they're stupid too? Tee hee-- Speaking of nickels, the Hilton Chicago has these tiny rooms shaped like a ""5"", if drawn solely with straight lines. A squiggly hallway connects the bedroom and living room.  (wags finger) Shame on you for attempting to pass these as rooms!",N
2682,"My choice hotel in Chicago.  Even though my Chicago office is technically in Evanston, I'd always rather stay here and commute out in the morning. One of the best hotel-gym-gyms I've ever used.  That is, when it's too cold to run along the lake (and, trust me, it's often too cold for San Francisco me to run along the lake in wind-blown Chicago).  Good service.  Yummy food.  Nice sized room.  No wires (yea!).  No silly desk that I am never going to use because I always sit on the couch or tap away on my keyboard from bed while watching one of my two flat-screen tvs.  Whole Foods is nearby when I don't want to eat out and I am on city 3 in 3 days and need a little more interaction than the room service guy.",N
1003,"Great location, nice decor, and complimentary breakfast! It's within walking distance to Hubbard street where there are many bars and the shops on Michigan Ave. The complimentary breakfast is on each floor and we had coffee, donuts, and croissants. They also had fruit, bagels, and juice. My friend who forgot her razor and toothbrush, asked the front desk for these items and they promptly provided them. I would definitely stay here again. I booked my room thru Orbitz and got a good deal, they have better rates than the Amalfi website.",N
684,"As always Marriott came correct with the Courtyard Marriott in downtown Chicago! We are relocating there and used points for the weekend and were treated well and there was great service. I had some nice conversations with the good people of Starbucks and the valet guys were a huge help. Strangely enough my parking pass from Indianapolis was working in the garage attached to the hotel so it was free! Otherwise, I think it's a pretty hefty charge and the valets don't accept call ahead requests from the rooms. We were house hunting and so by the evening on Saturday we were dead tired. It was a room service night and the hot wings and cheesecake from Viand totally hit the spot. We're becoming more and more impressed by the Courtyard hotels and this one really was great!",N
1034,This is definitely my favorite hotel!  I love all the decor in the lobby and in the rooms.  The service is always excellent.  The rooms are are really roomy and the bathrooms are huge for a hotel.  The cocktail hour is always nice and I love the Amalfitini!  Continental breakfast the next day is great since I don't usually eat a large breakfast.  The chocolate croissants are my favorite and the coffee is really good!  We'll be going back for sure!,N
217,"I needed a place to stay after moving out of my apartment on my way out of town for a new job.  I lived less than a block away from the Hotel Indigo, and with the Ambassador East under renovation, it was really the only choice in my neighborhood. The normal rates for this place are nuts - $180/night.  If you use Hotwire or Priceline you pay at least half that, but keep in mind you lose the ability to choose your bed type or smoking/non-smoking preferences.  I was placed in a smoking room - at the front desk, they cheerfully told me I could ""upgrade"" to a non-smoking room for $75/night (which basically nullifies the rate I found on Hotwire), and when I showed no interest in that, they brought it down to $40.  Since all I really needed was a bed, and a place to bathe, it wasn't the end of the world, and I declined all their upgrade offers. My room faintly smelled of cigarette smoke, and I could barely even notice it.  The hallway, on the other hand, had a noticeable odor.  Thankfully my room was near the elevators so I was exposed to that for only a few seconds. The room was adequate... I wouldn't define it as tiny but it might feel that way if two people were in the room.  The seashore motif was not that annoying.  The bed, however, was on wheels, and would start rolling away from the headboard (wall-mounted) which was very cumbersome.  Also, a large wooden tray with glasses and an ice bucket is on the bed and there really isn't any convenient place to put it when you're ready to lie down. In terms of other room features: the TV was dated (LodgeNet?  I had to laugh at the welcome screen's voice-over actress: Canadian - ""Welcome to Chicag-OH, and thank you for staying at Hootel Indig-OH"")  but I definitely enjoyed the Keurig coffee brewer, with a cup of tea at night before bed and a cup of coffee first thing in the morning.  The bathroom was only a shower, with a strange showerhead that I eventually figured out, however all the fixtures were new, and the Aveda bath and body products were a nice touch.  The front desk staff were smart enough to give me the WiFi password when I checked in - I always hate getting to my room, pulling out my laptop, and having to call the desk to get the password. That said, the only problem I really had was with the lack of bellhops.  Normally I wouldn't need any help with my luggage, but since I was moving I had six pieces of luggage.  When I arrived, they didn't have anyone available immediately.  I waited about 15 minutes.  (The nice gentleman at the front desk literally had an aneurysm calling for assistance on the radio multiple times.)  The morning I left, I called early and gave them a half-hour's notice that I needed some help.  Nobody showed and I had to take care of everything myself - I was taking an airport shuttle and couldn't risk missing it. All in all, it was a decent place to stay, but just remember, if you book through a discounted booking site, you're not going to get a lot of options from this place.",N
5038,"So much for the W experience! I am so grateful that I did not have to pay out of my own pocket to stay here. They try to make the hotel look trendy, but it doesn't work.To start with, the room itself feels so dirty & cheap. It's so small too. Having the bathroom barely separated with the rest by the wooden windows was a terrible idea. The hall way, the common area, and the whiskey bar all have the same problem: way too dark! Slightly dimmed is cool & make it feel sexy, but this make it feel like a cave! The hotel staffs are way too cocky because they think they work at a cool hotel.  Come on, do your job & accommodate the guests first! The lobby is not as nice as the picture. In fact, it's very chaotic there.I found out this place used to be a Days Inn, go figure!  All that sleezy decor could not cover up what it really is. I was pretty embarrassed that I invited a girl to this hotel with me. The only good thing about it is location - close walking distance to all major attractions.",Y
2703,I stayed at The James Hotel on business in April.  I'm not a fan of the modern IKEA look but was pleasantly surprised but the hotel and it's staff.  Everyone there goes above and beyond to accommodate you.  They are super friendly which to me is important.  There is a restaurant and lounge on the first floor with excellent food.  I was there about a week and ate there twice and both times we had wonderful service and food.  One night we hung out in the lounge and also received great service. The rooms are very clean and the mini bar is by far the best mini bar I've ever seen in a hotel if you are a drinker.  These weren't your sample bottles of booze.  They also have Kheils soaps which I love and they give you new ones everyday.  Turn down service was wonderful it was nice to come back to your room to music playing and soft lighting to help you start to relax.  The beds were super comfy.   I would definitely pick The James as my first choice for hotels in Chicago.  It is worth every penny!,N
1665,"My second Kimpton - the first being the Hotel Monaco a few blocks away earlier this year.  Both times, we've loved the room, the wine reception, and many other nice touches that keep us comfy and happy in Chicago. We haven't had such luck with the services promised for people with pets. At the Hotel Monaco (April 2011)  we checked in late, but not before grilling the phone operator about having pet sitting available for the next day (and booking it). We mentioned it again at check-in and were reassured that all we needed to do was check in with the concierge in the morning. Lo and behold, the concierge gave us one of those looks that the Maitre D' gives Ferris Bueller - raised eyebrow, corners of mouth turned down....Snooty? Snotty! He had no idea. Nothing was booked, and nothing could be on short notice. I love the pet friendly vibe of the Allegro - but we ended up boarding our dog at a nearby place for the night. The pet-sitting service the concierge put us in touch with (Puppy Love) were helpful and accomodating in booking the times we required, but at a price of $360! 2 x 4 hour blocks for $360. So, Rover's down the road at the Mutt Hutt for $35. They were cool too. No in room coffee which makes for a monstrous morning, but all in all I like these hotels. I just hope they can raise their own bar when it comes to people travelling with dogs.",N
2808,"Not as good as other embassy suites we've stayed. More expensive, parking is additional $49 per night, rooms older and a little stale smelling.  Had to get the manager to over-ride billing us twice for room internet use for both my wife and I - also free to members at other embassy suites.  Room lacked power outlets in usable positions.   5.30pm happy hour & snacks is restricted to 1 drink per room key.  Others have never had this restriction and the staff at other hotels friendlier.  We wont stay here again.   At least the Italian restaurant next door is excellent - do go there.",N
1632,"i'm breaking up with this hotel.  we had a really good thing going for a while.  it was my back up when the westin on michigan ave was full.  when you travel as much as i do, you've gotta have a plan B. so we had a few really good nights together.  i asked for exactly what i wanted and the staff would always accomodate me.  i paid they provided service...nothing outrageous. well, the last time i stayed at this multiple personality pensione, they may have been trying to break up with me actually.  i think they were caught off guard cuz i showed up with my 3 offspring and all this homemade italian food in shopping bags which i needed to quickly deliver to my sister.  maybe they thought we were a family on the run and they wanted no part of it.  instead of checking us in they told me they had no record of my reservation.  excuse me, come again, i beg your friggin pardon.  that's fine if you are stupid, i understand not everyone is born with the most useful set of DNA, but come on, i have a confirmation number. so rather than stare at me like you have no idea what to do, just give me a room now so i can unload my crap and get a cab to deliver the now overdue food.  have you ever tried discussing your rights with an idiot?  it just doesn't work.  they don't know the standard rhythm for this sort of thing.  since i was already dealing with the manager, there was really nowhere to go but out on the street.  i finally convinced her disclose their clearly defunct system for online reservations and found the obvious error.  your online reservation is not actually a done deal when you reserve online.  what?!  you mean to tell me if i make a reservation using the website i can't be gauranteed the room i was just confirmed to have been charged for.  yes, that's right folks, you read it correctly.  allegedly, they look at all the online reservations a few times per day so if you happen to have made your reservation after the last time they checked and show up before the next time they check, they actually have no idea why you would be standing at their front desk expecting lodging.  hmm, i wonder if they've ever heard of this new fangled thing called real-time scheduling.  the manager could not have been any more rude, obnoxious, or just plain dumb if she tried.   but finally i did convince her to maybe just to humor me, check the online reservation log and update the reservation file in front of her and lo and behold she found our name.  but the fun didn't end there.  my car which i left out front in a line to be taken away was still there when we went down to get a cab.  their garage was in fact full and they were really sorry but not sorry enough to have a list or directions to any garages that they might have possibly called in advance to make sure there was room and would keep a car overnight.  i guess that was my job.  so now that i made it through hoop number one and actually won a debate with an idiot to get the keys to my room i had another hoop to maneuver.  this could not have sucked more.  i ended up having to drive around for 40 minutes before i found a garage that would take my car overnight that wasn't already full.  this ended up being a giant pain in the neck.  if you ever are forced to stay here and decide to use the internet to make your reservation...you might want to call first to see what time they plan on merging their reservation files and figure out what to do with your car in advance.",N
1876,"Stayed here for a weekend using my points and was upgraded to a Fantastic suite, which was pretty spacious. The room and bathroom were clean and had plenty of space and I have only two complaints about the room: 1) The bathroom sink was really small. Everytime I tried to wash my face or something, I would end up splashing water all over myself and the sink. 2) The toilet was situated in THE most awkward space. It was tucked away in the corner of the bathroom and there was literally only 2 inches of space between the front of the toilet and the wall. So bizarre, considering that the room itself had this big open welcome area that was directly adjacent to the bathroom. Other than those relatively minor complaints, I enjoyed my stay very much. The hotel decor is really trendy and modern...and also very dim. It's not the type of hotel I would typically stay at, but it was definitely fun to spend a weekend here. The staff is helpful and pretty friendly for the most part. A good thing to note is that this location isn't particularly close to anything besides the Willis Tower and Millennium Park, meaning if you're in town and want to go out at night, the W Hotel - Lakeshore is a lot closer to a livelier nightlife. There are also not very many restaurants or other things to do around this location, but it is very close to two CTA stops.",N

1776,"My wife and I got married here.  Three words: Worth every penny. I can't say enough about the Hotel Allegro staff.  Kerry, our events coordinator, made it seems like planning a wedding was a walk in the park.  The wait staff had things ready and gave all 150 of our guests the proper food they ordered.  The chef was very accommodating to special requests.  The wife and I, instead of giving crappy candles or other little trinkets to our guests a favors, decided to give them churros and Jarritos.  The kitchen staff had the Jarritos on ice and they made the churros for a marginal price.   My rave review isn't because I'm still high from having an awesome wedding, it's because Hotel Allegro helped us have an awesome wedding.",N
3260,"I have never actually stayed here, but from what I've heard from people who have, it's awesome. The decor is very modern and chic, which I love. Although it is pretty expensive, but what can you expect in downtown Chicago. My friend and I ate a light dinner at their Base Bar a few years back (we were seniors in high school and were downtown to sing at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for a school thing that night) and thought we were hot because we were chilling out in a hotel lounge (yeah, that's what us suburbanites like to do on Saturday afternoons to make us feel awesome). Anyway, we each ordered the sampler appetizer platter, and the little mini-hamburgers are fantastic, as well as the artichoke hearts - there were two other things included, but I don't remember (it was over 3 years ago). I'm assuming they still offer it. Additionally, the hotel donated an awesome overnight package to Northwestern's Dance Marathon (a huge philanthropy event), and I know they work with a lot of local and suburban businesses, so they get mad props for that. And, when my friend and I went there, the bartender was a former contestant on Big Brother (I think like the 2nd season maybe? The one when they brought everyone's ex-boyfriends on...I think her name was Amanda?)",N

1889,"This review is only for the lounge/bar. We randomly decided to come here on a Saturday night. We were hoping to find a nice quiet place where a group of 8 girls could catch up. This was the perfect place for that. The decor was gorgeous and the service was great. It was pretty much empty so we had no problem finding a place for all of us to sit. The drinks were overpriced, but that's expected for the W. I'll definitely keep this place in mind for a cozy night out.",N
3379,Not what you would expect from a Michigan Ave. hotel. It's an older building and the rooms are just typical hotel rooms. But it is a cheaper alternative if you want to stay in that area.,N
2032,"I used Priceline to find an excellent deal for this hotel (one of their secret deals where they don't tell you who the hotel is until you pay for it.) The hotel is near a few different train stops (brown line is the closest) and within walking distance to shopping and food. The room itself was a normal size room, smallish bathroom and we had a great view of a partial wall and the indoor pool :) I will say, the water pressure in our bathroom was very low. The hotel bar has a fantastic view, and might be one of the best views I have seen in a hotel bar. The drink prices are on par for a hotel as are the room service prices. There is a short indoor walk to a small food court that included a McDonalds, Dunkin Donuts and their famous popcorn place (can't remember the name). Dunkin Donuts came in handy for our morning coffee. Overall an excellent deal and a nice place to stay.",N
194,"I was not impressed at all with the Hilton, It was in a good location but the front desk was not very friendly, My daughter and I were looking for an apartment from California  and I thought I'd treat her to a nice hotel our first night, The room was cozy but very sterile, The view was not what I requested. Internet was $$$$ per day and the water pressure was a drip. But we made the best of it and went to days inn by lincoln park and received FREE internet all 3 days. Free breakfast all 3 days and very helpful front desk help. I can spend my money much wiser at other local hotels.",N
82,"I stayed at the Motor Inn section for one night prior to an interview. Staff was very helpful, prompt, and had a good sense of humor.  There are two parts to the hotel - The Carleton and the Motor Inn sections.  The Motor Inn section was very old timey hotel and reminded me of the ones i've stayed in in northern Wisconsin. I could not find the thermostat in the room but that may be because I'm an idiot... the room was a comfortable temperature anyway so it didn't matter to me. Internet is free but for some reason it didn't work at all.  I had to use the internet at an attached restaurant (also free).  I couldn't pull up directions the next day because they were both down and it was really frustrating. I don't really know what else to say about the place.  There was a big bed, a TV with cable (thank you espnews!) to keep me company.  There was enough soap that I could have showered 183 times and not made a dent in it.  Very spacious room.  Parking was easy (I came back after 11pm and still had a spot).",N
2931,"We stayed here a couple yrs ago and it's a super nice place.  Definitely someplace I'd stay if the Trump was booked.  A little older, but classy, close to everything you'd need (Magnificent Mile, movies, restaurants, etc.).  Has a Shula's in the hotel, which is one of the best steaks I've ever had.  Bottom line, a great hotel I'd surely visit again.",N
5177,I came for a vacation in the city and let me tell you wonderful place to stay at kimpton really trains there staff to go above and beyond the call of duty check in smooth and the front desk agent made us feel very welcomed she informed us that we missed there wine happy hour so she gave us passes to have wine at one of the two bars awesome. I also received a $10 credit for the mini bar for signing up to there email program winning(lol). I recommend the Hotel Allegro to all my yelp friends.,Y
2097,"It has been around for over 30 years.....who knew?!?!   The recent renovation was well done.  Modern look in good taste and the views from the event space on the 15th floor are spectacular.  Cuisine is very good.  Extra stars for the event staff.  They are the most courteous and helpful we have experienced in 20 years working in the industry.   (They even cover parking for wedding/event vendors!!! No other place I know does this! Big kudos for that.).  Forget the ""Holiday Inn"" brand you may be familiar with....as most have said this location is a delightful surprise.  The 15th floor space is great for smaller weddings, but I think the space can be modified for different numbers of guests.",N
5748,"I consider this hotel to be fairly standard. My week-long stay here was adequate, but nothing out of the ordinary. Everything was satisfactorily clean, but I can't think of any outstanding services provided. I've received the same service at Holiday Inn Expresses before. That's not to be insulting, rather I'd expect more complimentary services for the price I was charged. For example, this could include the free breakfast vouchers my colleagues at the conference received (and I didn't) or maybe unlocking the movie channel a couple of times during my stay. Its location is fantastic (near Greektown, etc.), but I would appreciate a better rate for what I get.",N
2556,"I'm a bit of a sucker for the area with all the history and the grittiness of the hood. The positives: The decor is nice and I did like the meat freezer bathroom doors...a nice touch.  From the outside you'd never expect anything like the place you find inside. The negatives:  $10 cover for guys only. Okay...if the place has some people inside. I visited this joint on a Friday night and was a bit  disappointed.  The place was probably about 15% full and the crowd was a bit older/tamer. Maybe I caught the place on a bad night, but I'm going to have to take pass on this place in the future.",N
5141,"We just had our wedding here (Friday, June 18) and we - and all of our guests - loved it! We're still hearing compliments from guests on the food (steak and chicken napoleon with duchess potatoes and steamed vegetables), the cake (the hotel connects you with Alliance Bakery, which does a fabulous job), the amazing views, the nice guest rooms and the excellent service all around. Barbara Martin is an outstanding wedding coordinator - she's organized, knows how to handle brides (and mothers of brides) with ease and she is always happy to provide suggestions, recommendations or advice to help with the wedding planning process. This was the perfect place for a Chicago wedding - you can't beat the city skyline and the river as seen from the windows in the Wolf Point Ballroom! My husband and I highly recommend the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza to anyone looking for a beautiful, service-oriented venue for their wedding or special event.",Y
3139,Well...I understand that most W are known to be trendy hot spots for most Chicago locales and tourist but I'm going to have to disappoint many people by saying this W (on Lake Shore Dr.) isn't a place I'd ever recommend. Let me first start off by saying...it use to be a Days Inn. What Starwood did was slap a coat of paint and added some Ikea like bedding. The service...well I'm not sure if people who work at the W know that they are in the service business. For some reason I find that most people who work there think you own them a thank you. The bars...are awful and over priced. I don't like paying 15 dollars for a drink and a bad one too. The bartenders don't seem to know what they are doing. I'll pass on this W. The one on Adams is top notch!,N
4947,"I will NEVER recommend this hotel after the horrible way the staff there treated my family.While it is a nice hotel and conveniently located off Michigan Avenue, the absolute horrid, disrespectful service has left me and my family with a bitter taste in our mouths for this place.My family traveled from New Orleans for my graduation and stayed at this hotel so they could be in a nice area and in a good location to the tourist attractions they wanted to see.  About a month or two after my dad booked the hotel, he got a call that there was fraudulent activity on the credit card he used to reserve the rooms (even though they were already paid for). My dad canceled that account and alerted the hotel of this in advance, and then when we checked in, he offered to put another credit card on file and the front desk said that wouldn't be a problem. My extended family decided to stay in town for an extra 2 nights, and in advance my dad asked to extend the reservation. He repeatedly went to the front desk to ask if they needed a credit card on file and if they needed to transfer the room into my aunt and uncle's name. The front desk said that would be no problem. When my father checked out, he again confirmed that my family would be staying in the second room and if everything was okay, and the people at the front desk again said no problem.After my family arrived back in New Orleans, they had hysterical voicemails from my aunt because she was locked out of the room. The front desk said the rooms weren't paid for or reserved, so instead of contacting my aunt or my dad -- or even bothering to leave a note on their door, where all of there stuff was -- they just locked my family out. My dad was on the phone for nearly 2 hours between my frantic aunt and the hotel management who blamed my dad for the miscommunication, despite the fact my dad asked the front desk SEVERAL TIMES if the room was reserved for an extended stay and if they needed info on file (turns out, the morons at the front desk never bothered to write anything down). When everything was finally worked out, my dad asked for the hotel to comp him part of the rate for all of the headache and aggravation he went through and for locking my family out of their room without a notice and they said THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO. Um, bull.My dad held his ground and said that it was ridiculous that because of their negligence we had to go through all of this, so they finally gave my aunt 50% off their last 2 nights and 3 breakfast coupons. Took a few hours to get that.Everyone understand that people make mistakes, but the hotel failed by not only refusing to acknowledge that they made one, but then they tried to blame my dad for it instead of own up to the mistake and simply fixing it.I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND STAYING AT THIS HOTEL!",Y
3851,"This is a very chic and unique hotel. There are definite pros and cons. Pros: if you book through the hotel you get breakfast vouchers and even if you find a better deal on any online site they will match the price and maybe even upgrade your room. The restaurant had a very good breakfast menu, everything we got tasted great! We got a comfy King room corner view. It is amazing! The ceiling to floor windows are very unique. Make sure you are aware of your surroundings with the adjacent buildings. Keeping your shades up or down when needed. You'll have a great night view too. The floors are  half wood and carpet which gives it a homey feel. Shower is awesome! Very chic room overall. All the staff are very attentive and friendly. The concierge helped me surprise my husband with chocolate covered strawberries and a nice bottle of champagne delivered to our room for his birthday. Cons: you hear sirens all day and night!! If you're a light sleeper this is quite annoying. But I guess that's what you get visiting a big city. It's definitely worse than NYC. The walls are a little thin of the room but not bad. Over all I was very impressed with the hotel itself, we will definitely return!!",N
649,"Spectacular service and personnel everyone was friendly and accomodating, plus the rates couldn't be beat.",N
4616,"I did not love this place, but it was a fine hotel to stay at for my conference.  The location was within walking distance of most places I went and/or a short cab ride.  Staff was friendly enough, although I wasn't uber impressed with their restaurant recommendations.  And the rooms were a bit of a let down.  Small, cramped and not smartly designed.  Outlets weren't where you needed them, there was no rack for the hand towels- those sort of features that can make a stay easier or annoying.  In addition, we had to switch rooms because the AC unit made very loud rattling noises the first night.  It was less of an issue in our second room, although the problem did still exist. In short, it was a decent price (thanks to priceline) and a decent location- otherwise, I wasn't impressed.",N
1152,"Stayed here for a wedding and enjoyed a regular room with two doubles that was spacious enough that it felt like a suite.  Loved the views, loved the location (right off Millennium Park, walkable to the riverfront, shopping, and shops).  Great service (the front desk found us a pizza place that would deliver at 2am and they also helped us with an emergency wedding toast print out situation).  However, a few quibbles: 1) room service that ends at 10:30pm (not good for those of us arriving late at night from the west coast - hence the needed pizza delivery above), 2) no vending machines anywhere in the hotel,  meaning a bottle of water or a Sprite was nearly impossible to get late at night;  3) business center that closes before 6pm (hence the emergency printout situation above); 4) gym access by payment only - not complimentary for hotel guests; and 5) no in-room coffee maker.  While I appreciate the extra service they provide to make up for some of these amenities, I have travelled quite a lot for both business and pleasure, and I have come to expect the above amenities to be standard.  With this set of services, I imagine that they are targeting leisure travelers only, as this would not be acceptable for business travelers who stay on any frequent basis.",N
1043,"Five stars all the way.  Where to start????   The service is awesome from the valet to the reservations.  From Check in to check out .  One word CLEAN!  Continental breakfast on every floor!  Free drinks and small appetizers from 5:30 to 7.  Location location location... this small boutique hotel is right around the corner form the hustling Hubbard street clubs. One block from the House of Blues, Bin 36, Flatwater, Keefers, 10 Pin etc....  across from Harry Carry's next to Red Fish.  Ten minutes from everything!!!   The bed was so comfortable I didn't want to get out of it.  They have every amenity and when we needed something and had to call for it, it took like two minutes for it to arrive!   There was even a men's bathroom on the floor we were on.  so when the women were in the suite's bathroom, we could go right down the hall and use the facilities.  awesome!  The decor was really hip too!",N
43,"We celebrated our one year anniversary by going downtown Chicago, getting a hotel room, and going to dinner and having drinks. This hotel was by far the worst hotel that I have ever stayed at. The room was cold one second, and than unbearably hot the next. Everything was extremely old, and out of date. The bathtub was very dirty, and the carpet in the room looked like it hasn't been shampooed in over a century. I've stayed at motels that were better than this. The one star that I gave to this hotel is for it's location.",N
3711,I visited the Drake for tea time and dinner before the Symphony.  The hotel has a lot of history and it was a pleasure to walk around and experience the feeling of the place.  There were many things going on that day and the tea room was completely booked.   We were seated quickly a table near the fountain.  The Harpist played as tea was served with find sandwiches and pastries.  The selection was good better than Russian tea room but not better that the Peninsula.   The tea was strong and after a couple cups I felt the caffeine.  I ordered the scallops and the satay.  The scallops were absolutely delicious big and moist and the flavor was one of a kind.  The satay was better than average very good dipping selection for the tea time and the appetizers.  They offer a variety of flavors with every dish.  The service was not as great as we expected.  Mario was our server first we waited quite some time before we were tended to.  It was very busy that Saturday afternoon.  We ordered and then 5 min later he comes back and forgot our order and took  it again.  Every thing was going well until we were ready to order dinner.  We requested the dinner menu we discover this to be the tea menu.  Then 15 min later we have to call him over and get dinner menus in total took about 25 min to order dinner frustrating since we had to be at symphony hall at a certain time.  I still give them 4 stars the Peninsula didn't have much better service the last time I went.  Still looking for a top lever tea service,N
4117,"I had a very enjoyable experience at this hotel.  Booked on Hotwire for an incredible rate; was able to use a kiosk to check in and receive my room key.  Room was spacious and stocked with a mini bar.  Hotel staff were extremely friendly.  Room service was prompt and tasty.  Can't beat the location!!  Had no trouble storing my luggage at the end of my stay.  Got a taxi out front in less than one minute. There's a conveniently located grocery store behind the hotel which stocks juices, salads, and snacks.  I would definitely stay here again!",N
2307,"We stayed at the Marriott Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile while in Chicago on a business trip. The staff was wonderfully friendly and helpful, and the hotel is centrally located ~ step outside the doors and you're right on Chicago's Magnificent Mile. We stayed at the hotel right before the holidays and the lobby was resplendent it it's holiday finery. The tree at the center was absolutely gorgeous! Our room was tastefully done and comfortable and had all the business amenities one might need. The staff was helpful and quick to respond. I would highly recommend this hotel to others.",N
442,"This hotel is located in a total wasteland in the middle of nowhere. There are vacant lots on three out of four sides. There are no businesses  within walking distance in any direction. There is no pedestrian traffic outside at any hour. If you don't believe us, check out Google Street View for this block. It gives you a VERY accurate sense of what this neighborhood is like. The people who work at this hotel seem to fall into two categories: rude+incompetent and nice+overworked+incompetent. The woman who checked us in when we first arrived was screaming at one of the hotel guests on the phone so loudly that it could be heard throughout the first floor. (She seemed to be trying to convey to them that their pizza had arrived. Why this required screaming we're not sure, but the tone she took with them was more than a little inappropriate.) The internet didn't work.  Neither the ethernet nor the Wi-Fi.  Their website advertises that they have free internet in ALL rooms. It was one of the main reasons we chose this hotel since we were here on business and needed it for work . We called down to see if they could resolve the issue. The woman at the front desk said, ""I'm not IT and it's a free service."" At $109/night (still overpriced ""discount"" travelocity rate) we did not think any of the very basic amenities could reasonably be considered ""free""; I mean, the bed was free too, right?  Needless to say she did not resolve the issue, although the next night someone else at the front desk was kind enough to let us test other rooms. Dragging our computers with us from one floor to the next, we tried three separate rooms before we found one where the internet actually worked. We then repacked all of our stuff and switched rooms. When we came back the next evening we were locked out of our new room for some reason and had to go to the front desk to get our keycards reactivated. Apparently this had happened to several other guests as well. So how is the rest of the hotel? One word comes to mind: basic. Industrial-pile carpeting, hard and horribly uncomfortable mattresses that seem to be covered with some sort of plastic underneath very starchy and coarse sheets, lousy water pressure, no place to put your stuff in the bathroom, no full length mirror. We didn't have a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign in our room so housekeeping woke us up at 8:50 am on a Sunday morning. When we sent them away so that we could get dressed before they did up the room, they never came back and consequently we had to do without towels that day. There was such a disconnect between what we experienced with this hotel and what we'd read in some of the reviews that we wondered if maybe people had gotten it confused with some other hotel. The best thing about this hotel by far is the parking. The parking is free and convenient. There are pretty much always spots available. Other than that...",N
3529,"After reading the other glowing reviews, I think I might be at a different hotel. This place has pretentious written all over it. It aspires, and yet, it fails. I've yet to see a ""large"" or ""spacious room."" I was in a Comfort Suites near O'Hare yesterday, and today, the room I'm in at the Avenue (which costs much more) is smaller than most hotel rooms I stay at in 4-to-5-star hotels. My room overlooks the roof of another building. My flat panel TV gets 16 channels, most of which are local/network. Valet parking is either $45 or $49, more than the cost of renting the car for the day. I couldn't get an answer because there was utter chaos at check in. No organization at all. My room wasn't ready when it was supposed to be. I had to wait 45 (!) minutes for a room to become available, so I just surfed the Internet on my laptop while I waited. Did I get anything in compensation? Nope. Even more confusing? My reservation calls this place the Crowne Plaza. Everything else calls it the ""Avenue."" The sign outside says both. Which is it? Not impressed -- and I'm even a Priority Club member. P.S. The ""zebra chairs"" are just a cotton print. You could make one with fabric from Wal-Mart.",N
2877,"I organized our company holiday party at the Sheraton.  The staff was so helpful!  A number of my co-workers and I decided to spend the night at the Sheraton and had mixed reviews.   I loved it.  I was placed in really nice room with a great view of Navy Pier and the lake.  The bed was divine!  I almost wanted to skip the party and stay in my comfy bed.  They also left me a little basket of fruit and nuts along with a bottle of water.  It's good to be a VIP.  ;)   My co-workers complained.  The rooms that they were in were of a very poor quality.  The hotel explained that they are in the process of renovating the rooms on this floor.  Also, one person said that when he entered his room he noticed hair all over the bathroom counter.  EW!!! I'm glad that I was the party planner and could live the ""high life"" while everyone else was stuck in the ""slums.""",N
3362,"i loved my stay here. my company put me up but i really have no complaints. Let me describe the best night i had there. After a hard day of working 11 1/2 hours, I went to their restaurant & bar. I had a Left Hand Brewery Milk Stout while they made me a patty melt with herbed french fries. I then took my patty melt to their 4th floor outdoor garden and ate under the stars while staring at the Sears Tower. It was quiet and relaxing and beautiful. Very good time.",N
4409,"I was here for a conference and if I had a choice, I would never have come back again.  Granted, it had a nice lobby and had a great sense of history to it, but it wasn't worth the 300 a night. I wasn't staying in the lobby, I was staying in some tiny little room that has a television off to the side so you had to strain your neck to watch it.  It had only TWO towels per room (what if we want to take more than one shower a day?).  The pillows were flat and the walls were incredibly thin.  It was hard to fall sleep and stay asleep as the hallways can be really loud.  Also, the maid service knocks on your door at exactly 8 in the morning to try to clean your room.   All this might have been forgivable if they didn't try to nickel and dime you every  moment.  They charged an extra fee for internet service and they charged you 15 dollars to use the gym.  They were also undergoing renovations so there was only one entrance from the street.  Not the greatest hotel experience, but I guess it was slightly better than motel 6.",N
2522,"I've always had a great time here. If you book early, you'll usually find a reasonable rate. The location itself is prime and the service is great. Rooms are clean and well kept. Just don't expect to get a great deal on rooms when big events like Lollapalooza are in town. I'll definitely be back.",N
388,"The entrance to this hotel is literally steps away from a Red Line station, which was a blessing in -30 degree weather. While the hotel gym is small, guests have complimentary access to an actual fitness club near the hotel, so if you're staying in the cooler months, be sure to bring a jacket or sweatshirt to wear over your workout clothes for the brief jaunt outside. The room is a standard Hilton Garden Inn room -- well-appointed, clean, and spacious. Check for the AAA discount, as it saved me $30/night.",N
1475,I Love This hotel.  Best place we stayed with the family.  They really took care of us.,N
340,"Nothing special here... about $110 a night for a queen bed, with $10/night for Wifi, provided by an outside vendor.  Next time I'm there, I think I'll try to stay a bit north of the Loop, but as it was, there was a decent amount of stuff around here, and the Red Line stops a block away.  This is also within walking distance to Museum Campus, Buckingham Fountain, & Millennium Park, so it's got that going for it. The rooms themselves were perfectly clean and everything.  Like I said, nothing particularly special, but perfectly acceptable for my three night stay.",N

We had blocked off some rooms for our wedding guests, and it was fairly easy to set up, and none of our guests had any problems. The hotel is in a great location, it is on a quiet street but very close to Rush St. and Michigan Ave.",N
1176,"Location is centrally located making it easy to walk to most places. Staff was incredibly helpful and nice. For the price and the FREE parking I am very happy with our stay. We had a king deluxe room which was very clean and spacious. It was nice having the mini fridge, living area, and two tvs. There are two negatives for me. The bed was very hard (I checked to make sure it was actually a mattress. Also even with the air on full blast it was quite hot at times (outside temps were high 50s to low 60s). The concierge was very helpful, front desk was courteous, parking attendants were so friendly. This is one of the best staffs I have encountered!",N
5563,"I stayed there one night because I had to take train back to L.A. the next day. Before I made reservations I specifically asked if they had washer and dryer. They assured me that they did...after a two day train trip my first thought when I walked in was to wash my clothes so I would have something to wear on the trip home....I was told the washer and dryer had been removed several weeks prior! I wound up washing what I could in bathroom sink then spent half the night and part of morning trying to blow dry my clothes with a hair dryer! Not good! Also when I checked in I gave my Amtrak card to the gal at front desk to make sure the points go to Amtrak...this was not done! They put my 'points' to their hotel instead even tho I made it clear as I was giving them my card! I then received a e mail  form letter asking about my experience from a Gary Platt...manager,I responded by e mail...no reply...I left two messages...never got a reply....why do they bother???",N
516,"I was offered a free room for a night by someone who could not use it so who am I to say no to a free suite just 2 blocks from my office?!?  I got there just a few minutes before the cocktail hour was ending so I had time to get a drink, go upstairs to my room and go back down for 1 more before they closed for the night.  Cocktail hour(s) also includes some goodies to snack on.  The suite I had was okay, it looked out at the Sheridan and NBC Towers.  The sitting room had a chair and couch that were not all that comfortable and seemed old to me.  The bed was really comfy but I can't stand feather pillows so fortunately there were about 20 pillows on the bed.  The bathroom was an average size, towels were thick but not soft or large and the shower itself was pretty big.  Breakfast is really good.  There is everything from made to order omelets to a hot buffet consisting of eggs, pancakes, sausage, bacon, potatoes but also the cold stuff like bagels, cereal, yogurt, donuts, muffins, etc.  The lobby is really quite big seeing that they have 2 events for guests that require use of the lobby, plenty of tables, chairs, and couches but seemed ""cold"".  I did not get a chance to use the fitness room or indoor pool (which is actually quite small).  Overall, I could not beat the price!",N
55,"I actually got a room for $60, including fees, through the Priceline ""pick your price"" promotion. I was really nervous about staying here because the reviews were so mixed. When we arrived we were relieved because the lobby is a lot nicer than the photos show. The parking was $15 but that was okay because it's expensive to park anywhere in Chicago. The staff were very friendly and quick. We were in town for a show at The Vic which was a short 15 minute walk! We felt safe in the neighborhood and there is a lot to do in the area. We stayed in a room with one double bed. Our room ended up being on the 4th floor in the stairwell (418 to be exact). It was small but it was fine for the two of us. The bathroom was very clean but the door didn't open past the toilet! It wasn't an issue for us but we thought it was a little odd. The room itself was clean except for a few hairs on our pillow cases (luckily we had brought our own). The bed was not the best bed ever but I could fall asleep fairly quickly on it. We thought the art hanging above the bed could stand to be changed and the walls need to be painted or wallpapered or something. Unfortunately there were some other guests that felt the stairwell would be a great place to fight and make noise from about 2:00 am until 6:00am. They were literally 5 feet from our room door. We heard a lot of door slamming and stomping around. I know this isn't the hotels fault but IF YOU STAY HERE REQUEST A DIFFERENT ROOM! We maybe got 3 hours of sleep. The breakfast was nothing special. The bagels were really hard but it was free so we didn't complain. The free wi-fi is very slow and won't work with any apps on a tablet/touch pad, just an internet browser because you have to ""log in"" every time you want to access something. It's not really worth using but will get the job done if you really need it. They also offer free coffee and hot tea in the lobby 24/7. We thought that was nice, especially because we were walking in the cold. Overall for the deal we got and the location it was not bad at all. We'll probably stay here again but just request a room not in the stairwell.",N
5315,"I'm sitting in my room as I type this, right next to the elevator, which has been going non-stop.  Of course, when I came into the room, the fan was on full time, so I didn't realize it until I turned the fan off.  $300/night, I get to hear the elevator running all night.  Can't switch rooms as they're booked full, and won't be able to move us until tomorrow.  Freaking brilliant.The room itself is dated.  Average size, but nothing like the other Westins I've stayed at.  The lake view is obstructed quite well by another building, so even on the top floor, it's kind of a letdown.  Don't get your hopes up.   To top it off, when I checked in, their system was down and the line was 50 deep.  Not exactly a pleasant way to start the weekend, and it's seemingly getting steadily worse.I hope to be able to update this review at a later date with something positive, but as for now, this is a rather gut-wrenching experience from a hotel chain I was once quite fond of.EDIT.  Got worse.  So after my guests arrived and an extremely confusing discussion with the front desk and valet, we were informed that self-park and valet were two completely different things owned by different companies.  Which would have been fine, but by the time we learned this, there were cars backed behind us and we had virtually no option but to pay the $57/night valet.  Further, I was told I'd get a better room the second night, and after calling to confirm in the morning, was informed that there was no other room available.  So, yet another strike against them.  We opt to grin and bear it.  Finally, get back to the hotel later that night, and decide to shower - when dark brown water with black specks comes out of the spout.  After calling the front desk, 30 minutes later an engineer shows up to tell us that they changed a pump and we can go ahead, as things were now ""fine"".  Wonderful, we really wanted to wait until 2 A.M. to brush our teeth.4 star hotel my ass.  I'm no longer staying at Westin until they rectify this.  $700.+ for a two night stay which was no better than a Super 8?  Ridiculous.Forgot one thing - another EDIT - went to the GRILL at Westin for breakfast.  Took over 30 minutes to get our breakfast after ordering.  That's a long time for $15 French Toast.",Y
2515,"This hotel was alright. Didnt deliver as much it promised. It was extremely crowded as well (weddings, etc).

2885,"I would not recommend STAYING at the Sheraton.  First, it's not that close to Michigan Avenue and points of interest.  I would say it's kind of confusing to find since there is an upper and lower street level.  I waited 15 minutes to get service to check in. The lobby is nice but once we got to our room... it was definetely not FOUR STARS.  I would say it was more like a lower 3 star hotel hotel.  The bed was lumpy before anybody slept in it.  The room was tiny... the bathroom was tiny.  I pressed the wake up call button to arrange for one.. NOBODY picked up. I'm sorry.. this is not the characteristics of four star treatment.  Besides the nice lobby.. I wouldn't want to come here again.",N
2573,"There are many, many bars and clubs all around Chicago and I haven't been back at the same place as much as I've been to this place. First, I love the artsy atmosphere. It's decorated like a museum with huge paintings and interesting photography everywhere. I guess I love the minimalistic style. I also love that they have a large area and a bunch of smaller areas so you have option to mingle with strangers or be with your friends. Second, I've been there both Fridays and Saturdays and they seem to have a good selection of DJ's that DJ there on a regular basis. The ceiling in the main room is pretty high so the sound obviously is amplified there but the music selection is great so who cares. Plus, it's a bar so it's supposed to be loud? Third, their bartenders, both female and male, are attractive which I consider to be a huge plus and a draw. Who doesn't need eye candy when they go out to bars? Bartenders and servers were all very friendly and accommodating so that's a major add as well. Even their food was delish!!!!",N
1303,"Our entire experience was perfect. The staff is very helpful and accommodating. The concierge was able to get us a dinner reservation at 7:00 that we would not otherwise got ourselves. The workout facility is very nice, and I especially liked the peppermint infused towels. The room is very clean and spacious. The bed was very comfortable and had one of the best pillows I have ever slept on.  Beautiful hotel and I would stay again the next time I am in Chicago.",N
4816,"Great view, super comfy beds, good service and lots of amenities.  You must go to the rooftop, they have some of the best drinks in town.",Y
2878,"Solid hotel with extra points for consistency of service and quality. My check in was quick and I got some extra amenities for being a Starwood member. Rooms are fairly spacious, clean, and I enjoy their beds and linens. I would suggest placing the ""do not disturb"" sign up if you're not an early riser. I forgot to do so two mornings in a row and I had housekeeping knocking at 7:30am (that's 5:30am PST for me so I was a grumpy face). Their meeting rooms are average but were ALWAYS freezing. However, they quickly came in to adjust the thermostat every time we called. I also don't know if it's because Chicago is such a high union-based city but the rates and charges for the meetings services were MUCH higher than other cities I've worked in. Note to self, budget wisely. This Sheraton has a great location and beautiful views. Their Chi-Bar had tasty cocktails and somewhat of a swanky decor. Overall, I look forward to coming back in March for our event. Let's hope the weather is on our side! :) 3.5 Stars",N
4244,"Poor service and attitude, excellent location. I just stayed in this hotel for 5 nights for a convention. Housekeeping was terrible -- every day they overlooked replenishing basic items like coffee and toilet tissue.  Room service dirty dishes remained in the hall for over 24 hours. We were charged for item from the mini-bar even though we didn't consume any. They base usage on weight changes so if you merely pick an item up and put it back they charge you. The concierge was unaware of the bike rental facility directly across the street. The room was stylish, but the functionality was terrible. Lighting is poorly designed. Very little storage. This hotel is not cheap and they don't even have the basics down, nor do they seem to care when it is brought to their attention.",N
2193,"I was in Chicago on a business trip and stayed a full week at this hotel. From the moment of my arrival, it was clear that the hotel staff were there to cater to my needs. All staff were polite and extremely helpful. Check-in was easy, the room was not big, but it was clean and very comfortable. The views were amazing! The hotel is on the Magnificent Mile which is central to excellent restaurants, night life, transportation and makes exploring the city on foot very easy. I loved it. I'm definitely returning to this hotel.",N
4407,"Gorgeous hotel! I loved staying here - thanks to good ole Priceline bidding for $65/night. Nice. Valet w/ In & Out privileges for $51? Not so nice. But self-parking at their lot is just a few steps away for $36. My dad chose to park a block away for $25 all day/night. Internet is also $15. I'd rate this 3.5, but will give it 4 instead of 3 because it's so pretty inside. I'm easily swooned by this type of decor. We stayed here for the sole purpose of sleeping - I didn't even get a chance to see the pool or anything else. We road tripped from Houston to Chicago to Niagara Falls all within a week! Our room on the 21st floor wasn't small, we were in a corner room so one view was skyscrapers, the other Millennium Park. No complaints regarding room size/view! I didn't realize we were right next to the train tracks, but the sounds didn't really bother us. We got settled in around 9 PM on a weekday, didn't know where to dine or what was open, so we just wandered and hoped to find something. Sadly, most restaurants were closed or closing by then and the few places I had wanted to eat (via Yelp reviews) were too far. I'm definitely researching more in advance next time! The bellhops were all really nice - taking bags to the room once we were settled in, storing our luggage, etc. I saw the receptionist offer everyone else in line bottled water - but didn't offer us any! Concierge was not helpful when we were trying to find information about Chicago Trolley tours. She just said ""wait at CVS and you'll see someone there."" No one was there! Luckily, the Palmer House is one of their stops and we were able to get on when it stopped at the light. The Corner Bakery Cafe is right next to the hotel, so we ate there for breakfast before going on our tour! I don't think I'll be paying $4 for a banana at the hotel restaurant anytime soon.. If you do want to eat at Lockwood & if the bellhop brings your bags up, they should offer you a 20% off coupon to Lockwood. I'm totally in love with Chicago now (visiting in the summer helps) and I would definitely stay here again if I got this deal.",N

4024,"A very solid 4-star stay! Obviously, I have not stayed at too many hotels in Chicago. As a former resident, I never had much need. But on a recent trip, it became a necessity so I set out to find the best priced hotel room downtown. A hotwire search for ""4 stars and above"" near ""downtown"" landed me a $111/night rate at the Hyatt Regency. For Thursday-Sunday! $111/night!? Chicago in the summer!? I feared that this would be a dump due to the price, but was relieved somewhat when I saw their announcement on Yelp detailing their complete renovation of all 2,000+ rooms. Wow, big hotel. Yes, indeed. This is a ""convention"" hotel, with multiple towers, huge convention spaces below and all around. It's massive. As luck would have it, the SoniCare toothbrush convention was here during my stay, so there were a lot of out-of-towners with brilliant smiles bounding around everywhere. Could be worse, right!? When you enter the lobby it actually looks more like an airport or a huge mall. Nonetheless, my check-in was quite smooth and I was on my way up to my room on the 23rd floor. What i found was quite impressive! A small room (1 Queen bed), but very modern, stylish, clean and comfortable. Flat screen TV. Very updated and you can definitely tell the remodel went full force. Things felt crisp and clean, the carpet fresh. It was just a really nice room. And on the 23rd floor...though I didn't have a river view (could've upgraded for $20, but wasn't spending a whole lot of time there!) was looking out over office buildings and Chicagoans bustling around to work and play. Suggestion, if you're here on a weekend and there is a big convention (usually), just ask to be put on those floors. Typically people from Sonicare are not going to be rowdy and loud. 18 years olds on vacation, another story. My room was quiet and peaceful at all times.   The service during my stay was also right on key. Never had an issue. I'd never eat or drink at the lounges/Stetson's with all the wonderful options nearby and in Chicago, but they had a nice snack/bev area for quick snacks. It's not cheap or anything, but it does in a pinch. Parking: You can valet (which is probably a lot) or you can park in one of the underground lots and walk a few blocks to save about half. I think we paid around $20/night. Much better and you don't have to wait in a crazy valet line in the morning! Any complaints? Just one small one. The elevators get super jammed up around the 10-11am hour, and I waited 20 minutes for one to get downtstairs on Saturday morning because all the Sonicare ladies were going somewhere at the same time. Like all 4,000 of them. So, that didn't work so hot, but everything else considered...this was indeed a ""4 star hotel, downtown"" and for $111/night! *Also, free wi-fi. I'd stay again. If I need a hotel in Chicago, that is.",N

1995,"Great stay.  We were in awe over practically everything in this hotel.  Well decorated.  Modern, but still warm and inviting.  Room was clean, which is always a good feeling.  Loved the complimentary coffee & tea maker.  Definitely came in handy in the morning.   It's obvious that they are still working out some kinks, though.  We tried to use our complimentary drinks with our breakfast but after we placed the order they called us back ten minutes later to say they couldn't serve alcohol until 11am.   It took 3 visits to our door to get us some honey that we asked for when we ordered.  Also, they would do well to expand on their room service breakfast menu.   Otherwise, it was a great time.  I'd definitely recommend it!",N
1056,"1. Molds in the bathroom (UNSANITARY..probably the reason why my respiratory system is currently screwed, and my lymph nodes are inflamed) 2. No clock in room 3. Broken lamps 4.

Wi-Fi only works in the lobby 12.  It took almost 30 mins to check, 15 mins from waiting, and about 10 mins to actually check in 13.  Questionable/odd tin man who is one of the cleaners... I guess the moral of the story is you get what you pay for.  I wouldn't recommend staying here unless you ABSOLUTELY have too and have no other choices.  There are NUMEROUS surrounding hotels, so I would book early and check those other hotels out first.",N
158,"A lovely hotel, although the rooms on the higher floors seem to be more recently renovated (it would probably have only gotten three stars if I'd stayed in my friend's room down on the third floor instead of my lofty one with the fluffy comforters and down pillows on the 16th). It's really close to Michigan Avenue shopping and the feeble contemporary art museum, but a bit of a walk to the Art Institute and Millenium Park.",N
5764,"My parents got a room here for the weekend, and they had nothing bad to say about the place.  You get free parking and free breakfast, but otherwise, a basic motel (no clocks in the rooms, but wake up calls available).  It was extremely clean, and everything looked fairly new, so they must have updated the place recently.  My mom said it was probably the cleanest motel she's ever stayed in, and for the price, it can't be beat.  The total charge came in under $200 for the weekend, and if you get a place anywhere downtown, that's about what you'll be paying for one night, plus parking.",N

3080,We stayed at the W last weekend. This was the weekend of the air and water show. The W was the perfect location. The lobby of this hotel is awesome it makes you feel like you are on a beach vacation and not in Chicago. The restaurant is good and not too overpriced. The rooms are spacious and the bathroom is great! We didn't have a view of the lake but the views are amazing because you can see them from the hotel pool and observation deck. We arrived early on Sunday and they allowed us an early check in w/ no problem and a late check out the next day. On  Monday morning I had just missed breakfast by 5 minutes. The waiter asked the chef to make an exception and he did. I did not have to ask him to do this he just did it.  The service was flawless. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Also the hotel is on the lake and only 5 blocks from Michigan Avenue and a 10 minute walk to Navy pier.,N
2780,"M husband, our dog (extra $75) and I stayed at The James for 1 night on Christmas Eve. We understand that the hotel might be running on skeleton crew but these are the things that happened that should not have for $199 a night: 1) Bathtub did not drain, had to call hotel to fix it. They did but left the tub dirty and took away our bath mat without replacing it. 2) Hotel was NOT full at all, but housekeeping left the cleaning supplies cart outside of our room unattended for half the day. 3) We were not told about a complimentary breakfast deal until I picked up a postcard at the front desk. 4) We were provided a comp breakfast card (for a full breakfast) at that time, and was told to redeem it the next morning at the restaurant. BUT found out the next morning that the restaurant is actually closed, after sitting at the restaurant for 10 min waiting. 5) We were then told that the comp breakfast can be ordered to be delivered to our room, but it will be continental only. 6) Breakfast arrived at our room, with $54 on our bill. We called the front desk and they took it off. 7) The milk they gave us was spoiled.",N

Helpful and accommodating...down to every last interaction.  Impeccable.  Forget about redecorating, Hampton Inn.  Take that money and give your awesome staff a big fat raise.

4653,"It's kind of hard to find reasonable boutique hotels in the city.  Or do I not know where to look?  Got married last Saturday.  Down to the wire, we decided to stay in a hotel the night of rather than schlep back home.  Hotel Felix had been written up in Time Out and the look and location fit what we were looking for.  Made my reservation on Expedia, but called to say it was our honeymoon so we wouldn't get stuck in the musty room by the elevator. The rooms ARE small, but when you have an awesome king size bed with a fluffy down comforter, who cares?  What are people doing with all this extra room?  I was worried about noise because of the tight space, but we didn't hear anyone all night.  Had a drink in the hotel bar, which is always funny, because, well, hotel bar.  Blackout curtain is fantastic.  We stayed in the cave until a couples massage at the spa on the 2nd floor.  Great atmosphere and we were treated very nicely there.  Easy check in and check out.  Only thought it was a little weird no one said anything about it being our honeymoon when we arrived.  Despite that, a good experience.",N
1685,"My company booked a block of rooms for all of us because this was within walking distance to the office. When I first got there, the doormen was extremely nice, took my bags and had it sent to the room. I thought it was a little odd that instead of walking in and checking into my room, that I had to take the elevator to the lobby and then I was able to check in. The lobby itself is pretty big, with a grand piano, beautiful staircase, and lots of seats, its actually pretty cozy. The room itself wasn't bad, it was nothing spectacular. The room was big, but the way the room was set up was very odd. Usually the TV is in front of the bed, but mines was way off to the side. The bathroom was tiny! The sink was so small, that you could probably fit like 2 bottles of something and that is all the vanity space you have. Literally if I was on the toilet, I could reach over on the right and wash my hands in the sink or I could take 1 step over to the left and I'd be in the bathtub. Very small bathroom. With all the space in the room, they should really think about making the bathroom just a tad bigger. Bed was a little springy, but it wasn't bad. The comforter was really thin though. Whats with hotels having thin comforters for!? The hotel uses Aveda products so that's a plus. The fitness room was pretty great too - lots of new machines and clean towels. I didn't like that they didn't have a free business center. $6 bux for 15 mins of Internet usage! That's no good considering the other 2 hotels I stayed in Chicago had free 24 hr business center. But the hotel was clean and nice, staff was friendly, and the location was near work.",N
4206,So I ended up staying at this hotel because of Priceline. I think I paid $125 or so for the night. I was kind of worried because I had heard about people getting really crappy rooms off Priceline but was quite happy with the room that I received. It was quite clean and very comfortable. The bathroom was of a good size also. Unfort I did not get a room of a view of the lake but that was ok as the room over all was nice. This is a HUGE hotel that many conventions use to host the events and the guests. It is a bit impersonal compared to the boutique hotels that I have stayed at in Chicago and else where but what it really boils down to is: are the rooms and hotel well maintained and clean and do I feel safe. The answer is yes to both of these and I'd have no complaints if I were to get another room off Priceline or through the hotels website.,N
2467,"Huge hotel. Very nice. Parking situation is a rip off($55 to valet per day or $45 to self park). Our room was large, clean and had all the amenities you'd need. We got a great deal on priceline for a room on a Saturday night of $100(plus another $23 in taxes). If I got a ""deal"" on a room I'd definitely stay here again. Great location in proximity to many restaurants, bars and parks in downtown.",N
944,"I usually travel on a budget, but this Red Roof really drops the ball. Strike one: The rooms are not clean!! That's the most important quality about a hotel. Wouldn't you rather sleep on a slab on concrete in an immaculately clean room than a soft mattress in a room full of dust and dirt? There were large piles of dust in the corners in the bathroom, and the corners of the sink had caked on dirt. The grout on the floor was cracked and stained different colors. Most Motel 6s that I've been in are better maintained/cleaner than this room. Strike two: One of the elevators was broken. According to previous reviews, this is something that happens pretty frequently. For a hotel with 16 floors, you would think that they would have people on call for repairs like this, especially for a spring weekend when there are lots of guests. The rooms are a tight fit, but most rooms in metropolitan areas are going to be small.  The mattress was nearing the end of its life, and yes, the bedspreads are icky.  Our toilet tank was a little leaky, so the toilet would spontaneously flush itself when no one was in the bathroom. This place would have gotten one star if it hadn't been for the EXCELLENT customer service from the front desk. The people working there were patient and polite, even with a constant stream of guests arriving at the desk. We had booked the room through a third-party site, and the woman at the desk made sure that we had two non-smoking rooms next to each other and let us check-in early. They sent up extra pillows to the room when we asked. I was really happy with the service we received. The valet parking guys were really nice, too. Parking was $36 with in/out privileges, which was a better deal than parking in the garage across the street.  TIP:  If you park at that parking garage, the Courtyard Mariott gives out blue parking tickets to give you a discount on the daily rate.  It may be a little dishonest since you are not staying at that hotel, but if you're checking out a review for a Red Roof, then I have a feeling you don't have extra cash burning a hole in your pocket. Even though this is a great location at a good price, I would try to use Priceline or Hotwire to get a better room at a nicer hotel for the same price.",N
3374,"At $120 bucks a night thats a little too steep especially since we just literally slept there. The staff was wonderful and friendly. To get front view of the lake, u have to pay extra so they just moved us to the closest room to the front as possible so we still got a good view of the pier. The wall size window was awesome. It kind of gave a romantic atmosphere. The bed was really soft and everything was clean. Right next to the park and the lake and convenient. It is one block away from this funky bar called Buddy Legend's i think. My boyfriend and I clearly didn't fit with that crowd! But I really do like this hotel :)",N
1461,"My review deals only with the restaurant in the hotel. I stopped here with a friend who wanted to visit the hotel that sponsors Oprah. The restaurant was quite attractive, informal but with an upscale atmosphere. The menu selection was good but I expected more from such a supposedly outstanding Hotel and restaurant. The dessert selection, my highest interest, was also lacking in variety. No doubt it was good. But it wasn't that creative and not one of my ""favorite things"". The service was great, the staff pleasant and the views from the windows were great. It was a good time. I'm not sure Oprah, given her status, would dine here. But she probably thought it good enough for her audience. :-)",N
3278,"REVISED RATING: 2 stars (3 stars too misleading) This place gets a merciful 3-star rating as it minimally meets ""decent.""  If I factor-in overall cost & value (even at $189 for a $799/night room), the rating would drop to 1 star. Cost/value-wise, this is by far the CRAPPIEST hotel I've ever stayed in, and beyond bragging rights of saying you've done the Hard Rock downtown Chicago, there is no reason to choose this hotel when so many others in the city offer TRUE luxury, comfort, and superior amenities for LE$$. Frankly, I've stayed in $89/night hotels that easily blow this one away (and I say that with no exaggeration and based on my staying in Hard Rock's very BEST rooms). My Review: LOBBY LEVEL - 4 STARS: The lobby decor is close to being top-notch - the flat screens by the elevators make for an exceptionally nice touch. The lobby also houses the Base Bar, which becomes a happening spot late evenings and on weekends. (See Base Bar review for more info).  I only wish they had given as much attention to the rooms respective to concept and design. THE ROOMS - 2 STARS (that's very generous): This is where the aesthetics, quality, and prestige fall WAY short.   During all my stays here, I've been fortunate enough to get $500-$799/night king rooms/suites on the limited access 34th floor discounted to $180-200. (How? Booked through http://Priceline.com, then called the hotel directly to confirm my reservation and asked for a complimentary upgrade to the top floor. This works for most hotels, as well as cruise ship cabins - Try It). At first glance, rooms appear to be ""decent"" with the beds being the focal point, visually promising to be soft, plush, and comfy; however, under the deceptively attractive signature Hard Rock bedding, you will find dated, not-so-comfortable firm spring mattresses. Also, the ""feather beds"" the website and brochures rave about are little more than thin comforters.   Hard Rock should really look into upgrading to memory foam or adjustable air-bladder mattresses, like Select Comfort, if they hope to charge an average of $350 per night and expect return guests.  This is the new standard of comfort...even the Raddisons of suburbia have them. The bad news doesn't end with the beds. As you begin to explore the ""amenities"" of the room, noting the Rock-n-Roll theme in the art on the wall and bedsheets, you begin noticing a second theme: FAKE Nothing appealing to your senses is truly what it appears to be when closely examined here. For example, the dressers appear to be made of rare ""Zebra"" wood, but under closer scrutiny are in fact made of compressed wood with zebra wood patterned formica veneers and components of impact resistant plastic. Oh, and the cool-looking trendy single-seat chairs are in fact cheap office-grade furniture upholstered in uncomfortably hard gold/tan vinyl snake/alligator print. Since no one can possibly sit on these chairs for more  than 5 painful minutes at a time, they will undoubtedly last forever! The living room table is cheaper yet! (Look closely at chairs & coffee table in pics above). And the carpet! Before you walk into the room, it looks like standard hotel carpet, but step in and you can almost see your shoes wincing with every step. Take your shoes off and what you feel is harsh industrial strength carpet ""pile""...AH-HA! Now you know why your shoes protested so!  No doubt, this carpet was built for longevity, not comfort...and will be around long after we've journeyed to the other side. THE BATHROOMS - 3 Stars -  Looks like they put 85% of the room budgets (which must not have been a lot to start with) into the bathrooms, which are fairly large and decently appointed with stainless fixtures, tiled floors, and Rock-n-roll pop art. *VERY standard hotel bathroom for NON-standard pricing? Hmmm.... I guess I shouldn't complain too much since I've only ever paid 25-50% of the regular room rates, but even at those prices I couldn't help but wish I were somewhere else like in a Regency Club level room at the Hyatt downtown - now THOSE rooms are TRULY luxurious. RECOMMENDATION: My advice is do the Hard Rock for the experience and bragging rights, but only for ONE night. The other nights, book your stay at Sofitel, Swissotel, W Hotel, or Hyatt Regency (Regency Club floor - limited access uppermost guest floor). All these hotels come with Select Comfort, memory foam, or pillow-top mattresses, thick down-filled feather beds,  REAL WOOD FURNITURE, soft carpet, AMAZING VIEWS from upper-level guest floors, and spared no expense respective to design, decor, and amenities!  They are also less than the Hard Rock's version of the same rooms. Expect $180-$400/night (Priceline/Hotwire/Travelocity) depending on advanced booking and season. NOTE: Other Hard Rock Hotels - (Vegas, Miami, etc) are NICE.",N
1361,"Came to Chicago for a two day meeting and I barely left the hotel. The service was attentive, the food they brought in for many of my meals was good, when I was able to find a veggie option.  Imagine my surprise when two traditional veggie-friendly soups, minestrone and pasta fagioli, had meat in them. The bar was nice, but not separate from the lobby and I prefer a separate room for my hotel bar.  However, the bar at the Drake Hotel across the street is excellent. Many people would like the location as it is so close to many popular areas of Chicago; shopping, Lincoln Park, Zoo, the loop.  Personally, i found it a little soulless.  While the location is a huge plus for many, I do prefer a less glitzy, and more neighborhoody, area. Overall, a good, clean 2 day stay.",N

2444,"This hotel is nearly as old as Chicago itself ... built in the 20's and was the largest hotel in the world when it opened.  And it's grand ... very ornate with lots of wide open spaces and marble, marble, everywhere. The service I experienced was lovely.  Although as per usual I was there on business so everything I needed was utilitarian.  But I was impressed and folks that worked for the hotel were very nice. The weird thing was the set up of the rooms.  I was ""upgraded"" to the executive floor ... 24th Floor!! ... which I thought would be cool but I guess they converted the room from 2 to 1.  There were 2 double beds (not queens) in the room, 2 closets and 2 full bathrooms!  That would have all been ok, I guess, if there had been a King. Our conference was in the main ballroom and if you are looking for a ritzy place to thow a HUGE party, give it a try.  It was fancy.  One of the speakers actually told a story of being a teenager and attending a cotillion there.  That's the kind of fancy I'm talking about. Anyway, good spot!  I'd go back!",N
430,"Casing out hotels for my recent trip, I found out about the Chicago South Loop Hotel and liked the idea of an affordable boutique hotel in an up-and-coming neighborhood.  Unfortunately, the South Loop Hotel has jumped the gun by about five years.  New construction is happening but not in a block-by-block or district manner, but rather on random corners and lots throughout South Chicago.  As a result of this, the neighborhood in which SLH resides is not very walkable and doesn't have any retail shops, cafes or anything really to speak of that SLH guests can easily access.   In order to really experience Chicago while staying here, you'll be forced to cab it.  When staying at the SLH, you will do yourself a favor if you store the Chicago Carriage Cab Company's phone number in your cell phone (312-326-2221).  Their depot is literally one block to the west.  When calling the Carriage Cab folks, they'd arrive within five minutes and I was on my way.  Based on SLH's location, McCormick Place (for conferences) and Chinatown are the biggest draws that are closest...pretty limited pickings of what Chicago has to offer. Aside from its location, SLH is also less than satisfactory.  SLH doesn't promise alot of amenities on their website, but they didn't carry through on some of the things that they did state.  The most annoying of these was their lack of internet access.  According to their website, they have net access, but neither room or business center access existed.   Also, the walls were pretty thin, but this was tempered by the fact that not many guests were staying there.  The west side of the hotel is backed up to the El and the windows did little to reduce the passing train cars' noise.  Over time the El started to sound like a waterfall or a river, not the most bothersome of sounds.  Even their television channel selection was poor.  There are more disappointing things to mention, but the aforementioned are more than enough things to help you make an informed hotel decision.  The only service that was good was their housekeeping staff.  They did a lot of stuff for us that wasn't prompted and asked for, but ended up being really useful for us.   After a couple of days, we moved on to better digs.  While my review may make SLH sound like the worst hotel ever, it's just that I've definitely experienced much better.  If you have a conference coming up and you want to save some dollars on a bare bones hotel, this can fit your bill.  I definitely would not endorse staying here on their regular price.  Get a reservation on Hotwire or something similar.  That way, you can live with yourself for choosing the CSLH.",N

I was supposed to be networking and mingling but I kept grabbing another drink and just going to stand-by the windows with a few friends I had met that evening.

The cute little thing also came in a discreet carrying case, replete with a condom, mini bottle of lube, and the appropriately sized batteries. !!! We giggled uncontrollably, of course, and then promptly called the front desk and ordered eight more, one for each of the ladies in our office.  They brought them up that evening in a nice little gift bag, perfect for my friend to carry back on the plane with her. Honestly, the room could have smelled like sewage at this point and I still would have given the hotel a top rating.  It's these special little touches that are really so important.",N
490,"I usually don't review hotels in YELP (at least not yet) but I figured I would  for this one since I stay here so often. Embassy Suites Lakefront is my 'go-to' hotel when I stay in Chicago. It's in a great location if you need to be downtown. It's short walk to either Navy Pier or Michigan Ave, or just a short cab ride away to most other places in Chi-town. The hotel staff is very friendly across the board. The rooms are all pretty good and the hotel is clean. If you're a Hilton Honors member, be sure to ask if they have any corner rooms available, for they usually have larger living rooms than the traditional rooms. Their morning breakfast buffet is quite good with a lot of variety. Probably one of the best Embassy Suites breakfasts available (trust me, they're not all created equal). The made to order omelets are worth the (short) wait. The evening Happy Hour is also a nice plus and a great place to unwind or congregate before heading out to dinner. If heading to Chicago for a few days, be sure to consider this as an option for your stay.",N

We proceeded to wait for the next 45 minutes, while the desk clerked just kept shrugging and saying the coordinator ""isn't answering his phones."" With plenty of other appointments and options this did not inspire confidence in a possible wedding location. We left and still have gotten no response from the coordinator. Their loss.",N
4933,"Nice hotel, nice staff.  My friend considered having her wedding here because they have so many different ballrooms and it is the quintessential Chicago hotel (and has lake views).  The staff was friendly, especially the sales/banquet team and a woman by the name of Carolyn or something...can't recall.  There is also a Chanel in the hotel...score!",Y
2391,"As Bill B said on 10/20/11, do not waste your money on this place. I paid around $250 a night for a small room with a King sized bed The bathroom was clean Sheets were clean Minimal amenities My room had no mini bar just a half fridge that was empty and not even plugged in. Room service selections are minimal and not too tasty...breakfast faired a bit better because lets be real, scrambled eggs are hard to mess up The absolute WORST was their terrible internet service which they make you pay through the nose for ($8 an HOUR!!!) which kept cutting in an out during a business meeting. I travel to Chicago frequently and I will NOT return to this hotel EVER. This place is a tremendous disappointment and for the money you can stay at a nicer more up to date hotel with better amenities, service, and internet that works. I consider this place a major FAIL",N
4741,"After a long flight in from Philadelphia, I expected to arrive at a four star hotel that would accommodate my every need. When I first arrived at the hotel, there were three hotel staff smoking in front of the building swearing left and right about how much they hate their jobs and their management.  I tried to shrug the rudeness of the staff off and continued to the front desk where a woman seemed to be annoyed by my arrival. She had been speaking with a gentle man at the front desk for my entire entrance from the front door and did not excuse herself from the conversation once I was  in front of her. I checked in fairly fine besides the awkward silence from the girl at the front desk who didn't seem to understand that I was more important than her previous conversation.  I arrived at my closet of a room and could not believe how small it actually was. I had no space to unpack and definitely no space to do my morning exercise. I am usually a very easy going person, but I expect to get great service when I decide to spend a little extra money on a four star hotel.",Y
1387,"I was attending a conference at the Drake and was a bit disappointed to learn that I had been moved over to the Knickerbocker.  My coworkers were all staying at the Drake and I was pretty sure the Knickerbocker would be a step down.  Especially when I walked into the lobby.  I wasn't expecting much, as it is far more understated than the beautiful Drake lobby.   Boy was I in for a surprise.  I soon learned that I had been booked into a suite.  When I stepped into the room, I fell in love.  It had just been remodeled with beautiful furnishings and...drum roll please...the most amazing bathroom.  Brand new, a rain shower, European fixtures and a whirlpool bath.  I'm usually not a bath person.  At all.  But this wasn't one of those scary tubs with the old, gross jets, it was a new bath with the vents in the bottom and an electronic control panel with several different settings.  It was awesome.  I want one for my house. So anyways, if you get the opportunity to stay at the Knickerbocker, jump on it.  I believe they have remodeled many of their rooms, just make sure you get one of them and you will be a happy traveler.",N

4912,This is from my friend Erick Bieger: VISITORS BEWARE! My friends and I stayed at The Drake this past weekend when we came into town for the Notre Dame game. We woke up just before 1am to someone running out of our room after taking the cash from our wallets. The hotel was less than helpful and refused to take responsibility for not checking room keys after midnight which is their stated policy. They wouldn't even call the police for us and refused to check the video cameras until after the holiday weekend. It's sad - we stay there every week for opening game weekend but it looks like that tradition is over.,Y
2971,"okay, it's a pretty hotel.  pretty pricey though and for what reason?  i caught on right away - we were paying for all the pretty things!  last year i had a free hotel stay at a much better hotel (embassy suites) and i decided that me and my guy would have an annual pre-christmas local getaway from now on.  the sheraton seemed like a good idea at the time, but in fact it was not. the bed was the best thing about our stay - very comfortable, no complaints.   the room was clean.  but there was evidence of wear and tear.  i expect that if i'm paying a higher price i get better quality.  not so here. location is decent also if you're a fan of looking at the river.  although michigan avenue is a couple blocks away the hotel's location doesn't make you feel like it is accessible.  it's in a crazy little spot. i do NOT recommend eating in the lb bistro - way too expensive.  we paid $25/person for the breakfast ""buffet"" and it was nothing more than a regular buffet set up in a ""fancy"" way, and a ""fancy"" chef who makes omelets and scrambles eggs.  the food was not even that great.  i don't mind paying $25 for food that tastes great.  but this was not great food. also, there is a shuttle that will take you to macy's - on state or michigan.  this was not well advertised.  i found out by accident when going to catch a taxi and another guest informed me of the shuttle. all in all it wasn't the worst place to stay, but for the money spent i would NOT do it again, not at this sheraton.",N
4777,"I primarily book a room at the Palmer for their exquisite lobby. It is simply a beautiful place to enjoy a few cocktails, particularly during the holiday season.  I could care less however, for the standard guest rooms. They are unbelievably small, and often a room will be booked facing the building next door. The water pressure belonging to the sink and shower head are unusually low (which truly is not a bad thing environmentally as less water is exerted, however, I shared a room with someone that was really irritated by this.)",Y
1905,"I absolutely love this hotel. The location is perfect and the ambiance is very sexy. My room was 600 sq feet of luxury. I almost wept when I had to check out. If you stay here, please try the calamari salad at the bar. It is to die for! The staff is very nice and quite helpful.",N
1660,My boyfriend and I stayed at Hotel Allegro for my birthday weeked. It was wonderful. Check-in was smooth and the clerk was very nice and accomodating. We had the standard king room but the bed felt more like a queen. There wasn't much of a view but the did have plently of sunlight. The rooms are so cute. They are small but there is a lot of detail put into them to make you feel like you are in a much bigger space. The bathroom is super small but the french style doors added a nice touch. While my boyfriend and I were getting settled in there was knock and the door. It was room service. The hotel sent us a bottle of champagne and a small box of chocolates as a birthday gift. That was a very nice touch. I joined the Kimpton InTouch program (which is free) before we arrived and for an added bonus we were given free wifi and $10 credit for the mini bar. The valet service was super fast. Everytime we called for the car they had it waiting for us when we arrived down stairs. Our stay was prefect and for an added touch we were given bottle of water for the trip home. All in all this is was a great stay and we can't to go back.,N

2407,"I didn't stay here, but the Lyric's opera ball was held in the Grand Ballroom of the Hilton Chicago. This is an older building with beautiful architecture.  Ornate accents, grand staircases and beautiful details, the theme is Victorian classic.  The Grand Ballroom is really beautiful and ideal for a bar mitzvah or wedding. The exterior of the hotel is just OK. For hotel food, it was very very good.  We had a petite filet that was cooked perfectly and scalloped potatoes that were superb.  The dessert stole the show.  A dark chocolate and pistachio mousse cake was amazingly rich and delicious.   House champagne was a bit sweet, but decent.",N
3624,"As Kerry J said, it's AFTERNOON Tea...not High Tea.  Somewhere along the line we Americans got the terminology wrong.  Afternoon tea is what upperclass people took in the mid to late afternoon as a bit to tide one over until a later meal, hence the little sandwiches and pastries.  HIGH tea is altogether different.  It was the evening meal which was taken at the HIGH table, or dining room table (instead of a parlor or lounge where afternoon tea was held), by the working classes and was a much more substantial meal.  Any place that serves a proper afternoon tea will never call it high tea!  Too bad we can't get out the habit either.  !end rant! I went with a group of 12 ladies to the Palm Court over the weekend and found it to be a wonderful experience.  The sandwiches were lovely, as were the scones and pastries.  I was disappointed however that they used whipped cream instead of traditional English-style clotted cream.  I would love to have their recipe for the egg salad sandwich.  The tea I chose off of their menu of about 15-20 teas was gorgeous, with just the right amount of cream and one lump!  What a treat.  Sitting there in their comfy chairs, with the harp music and the beautiful surroundings, sipping tea, eating a delicate sandwich made me wish I'd been born in another time and place and class... LOL.   I've not tried afternoon tea at other places in the city so I've nothing ot compare them too (The Four Seasons or Peninsula being also at the top of the list supposedly), so if this is as good as it gets, that's great.  And if the Drake's Tea isn't the best in the city, I can't wait to find the best!!",N

Screw the chicago dog (did I really say that?) Check out the fish n chips.  Btw the Elephant castle is in the Avenue Hotel.  Great place, bought in the package was affordable which equated to more beers at the game.  Me and my buddies were upgraded to a 1 bed room suites which were awesome.  Lots of room.

5306,This was one of the best Hotel experiences we have ever had in Chicago. My husband and I were celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary with a weekend in the city. We were very impressed with first class treatment we received. Upon arrival we were asked by valet if we celebrating anything special that weekend. He told the front desk as we checked in. Emil was welcoming and made us feel like we were old friends. The surprises did not stop there. The room was absolutely gorgeous and the view breathtaking! Within minutes our bags were in the room and we were given a complete run down of the amenities. A few minutes later a bottle of Champagne was delivered to room in celebration of anniversary...WOW! Just when I thought it could not get any better Emil called up to the room to make sure that everything was satisfactory. Not only was the service first class but the Hotel is a visual feast.  The historic ambiance is perfect for a romantic weekend get away.  We will be returning to the The Hotel Burnham and in the future will be looking to stay at a Kimpton Hotel.  A+,Y
4745,"Absolutely fantastic. People that didn't like this place need to take in to account a few things: the price, the location, the service, they fact that it is environmentally friendly. I rate each of those five stars. You get a wonderful location for cheap. Boom. Bargain. Then you arrive there to nothing but great service. The poorer reviews of this place actually annoyed me. Those people must just be habitual complainers. My girlfriend and I wanted tickets to Blue Man Group. We asked the front desk for tickets a few hours before the show and we get PERFECT seats dead center near the front of the stage. The next night, we were thinking early dinner before we caught a show. We wanted to go somewhere romantic, they recommend the Signature Room (great call). With nearly no notice they got us reservations. This place allowed my girlfriend and I to have an amazing vacation. We will stay there next time we go to Chicago, and the next time and so on...",Y
1848,"I arrive at the W late on a Sunday night. Even though the lobby is completely empty, terrible 1996 house music is throbbing full blast through the speakers. The girl at the front desk is half-asleep. Looking rather confused, she checks me in. Everything is tan, beige and eggplant like every other W, completely lost somewhere in the late 90's. Internet bubble 1.0. The lift takes me to my floor. More bad techno plays. The hallways are completely dark, in a failed attempt to set the mood. When I find my room, there is a knife and fork on the carpet in front of my room. Light shines through the crack under the door. My card key works in the lock. I enter to discover a completely wrecked room. bare mattress. sheets on floor. mini-bar items strewn about. shower running! I march back downstairs and explain the situation to the same girl, who apologizes and gives me a new room key. Another elevator ride. Still more techno. Another dark hallway. Finally a clean room. Two minutes later the phone rings. They want to offer me a free breakfast for my trouble. That would be very nice, I say. I order breakfast for the morning, request a wake up call and fall asleep. The next morning, no wake-up call, no breakfast, nothing. No thanks W. I'm never coming back.",N

5455,"We had spent 8 days and 7 nights here at this very peaceful, courteous and tranquil hotel and would probably come back to it the next time we're in town. I'd recommend this place to anyone who wanted a nice mix of people watching but a nice quiet bed to lay their head down on afterwards. Located right by Morton's, Carmine's and Jilly's, it's the perfect place to grab a martini, a nice meal and watch people pass by under the canopies. The staff here are tremendously friendly and really go out of their way to accommodate you. The first night I went on a frantic search looking for the ice machine which I'm used to be in a private room in the corner but after a walk up and down the hall, I finally called the front desk inquiring where such a thing was. Apparently, they really value their quiet here at Sutton Place and room service brings up anything you need at any hour. That a little odd to me but I did notice there was a lack of drunken loud parties, walls thumping and loud music in general which was a plus. The room was comfortable, spacious, had a great view and it was easy to sleep like a baby here. The king size bed was like that of fairy tales and the goose down pillows literally cradled my head. Mmmmm...10 hours of sleep. The bathroom was spacious, full of wonderful bath gels and just right for the business traveler or the leisurely weekend getaway. I'll admit that I'm more of a fan of the Fairmont but it was still lovely for what I consider a boutique hotel.",N
5707,"Not too shabby! Last time we were in Chicago, we stayed at the Conrad. The prices for the rooms were about the same, but the Chicago River Hotel has an awesome location- right by the river and Michigan Ave. We were only a few blocks from Millennium Park, steps away from the shopping, and close to the metro. As I booked the room on their website and made the reservation, it said that the room won't actually be charged to my card until we physically arrive and check-in. However, a couple days before our arrival I noticed the charge to my credit card. When I called in to inquire, the first guy who I spoke with was rather rude, and argued with me, saying that I must not have booked on their site because they don't take the money out until check-in. He put me on hold, and I was connected to a manager, who was extremely nice and apologetic. Seems there was some problem with their site. He assured me that my request for a room with a nice view would be waiting for us upon our arrival. Sooo fast forward a couple days, and we get to the hotel. We check in, I speak with the manager I spoke with on the phone, everything seems fine. We get up to our room and we had problems getting the room key to scan in the door.. this actually happened EVERY single time we wanted to get in. It took on average 5-10 scans before the key would be read each time. Imagine our frustration. Anyway, the room was nice enough and modern, but it was DINKY. Super small. I'm guessing it was this size because it was a corner room, but it was definitely narrow. Our view was nice though, of the river and buildings across the way. One morning when we were heading out, housekeeping was cleaning some of the rooms on our floor. The doors were open, and what we saw were much bigger rooms, but they didn't seem like they were suites. Is it wrong that after the problems with the room charges to my card, I would expect them to do some nice gesture for us to make up for it? I dunno... I think I'd rather pay a little more and get a bigger room somewhere else.",N
4458,"Beautiful and sophisticated hotel located center of Downtown. Great for couples, families, or anyone! Grand entrance doors and staff to provide good 'ol service. The rooms are very spacious. I was accommodated within a one king bed suite and the decor was beautiful: furnished with green, browns and other vibrant colors! Window looked out to Downtown, so it was cool. Has a restaurant in the lobby called 'Lockwood'. Check out my review for that restaurant: http://www.yelp.com/biz/... Also, great shopping accomodations including a friendly lady by the jewlery shop. Awesome discounts!",N
2738,"Great hotel right near Michigan Avenue. The service is outstanding and they really aim to please. The rooms are not big, but nicely decorated and modern. I love the Kiehls bath amenities. The gym is also incredible--heads above most other hotel gyms. I don't love David Burke's--Joes's two blocks away has much better steaks and seafood (and is a little cheaper) but in a pinch it is not awful. The hotel is also dog friendly--a huge plus. You can even bring your pooch (of all sizes) to sit with you in the bar/lounge while you drink and order off the full menu from the restaurant. I tell all of my out of town guests to stay here.",N
3605,"As I walked through this historic hotel, I almost felt like I was a turn of a corner away from running smack dab into a celebrity or royalty from years gone by. A wonderful hotel with all the necessary amentities for a high maintenance traveler along with all the extra classic feel for a sit and stare kind like myself.  Along with that the location is great, staff highly engaged and rooms well suited.  A real pleasure to have stayed and feel like a small piece of something much greater.",N
3496,"Location and price were great, cant really beat it. The common areas of the hotel (lobby, bar, lounge, etc) are pretty nice, although the bar doesnt open until later in the day. Their bloody maries are horrible, def NOT recommended. In order to get to the rooms, you have to use 2 separate elevators which can be just a tad annoying. The rooms are clean yet tiny, bathrooms are excellent offering the usual stuff and a large walk in shower, closets large, and the sound insulation sufficient. I wouldnt recommend this place for business travelers, however for a quick getaway weekend this place fills the need.",N
48,"I arrived at the Tremont this past weekend for one night only. I was staying in Chi Town for 2 nights but due to a convention in town this was the only hotel that had availability for the night and for $155 for the night I was more than willing to stay since I was getting rooms around the area for the rate of $350 and up! Lets just say here you are only paying for location. I ve learned that the ""older"" hotels are just NOT MY THING. The hotel lobby is pretty and leads you to believe the rooms will be the same. The staff was meh and the room, oh God the room. The room was so outdated! We had a one bedroom but for whatever reason it was two rooms combined into one (score!). For just two people it was pretty spacious and with two bathrooms and two tv sets then I guess I cant complain, but really I have to! The room smells like your grandmothers house and with the fixtures to boot! The carpet stunk, the sheets were stiff, the fixtures were old and dusty and lastly the bathrooms were old and falling apart. One of the bathrooms showers had brown water coming out of the faucet for the first 2 min! Since I only stayed a night I guess it could have been worse...thank goodness. - I also wish I can write a review about Ditkas since its downstairs but it was packed the night I wanted to eat there so I guess that says something good!",N
2857,"This review is specifically for the Events and Catering Department.  I had a very poor and drawn out experience which I'll tell you all about: My company contacted Sheraton early July for a dinner reception we're having in October.  The rep we met, Elizabeth, was very friendly, perky and showed us they Mayfair Room, which was just what we were looking for. A slam dunk initial visit.  By July 29th I told her it was a go, and please send over the contracts.  We would love that room. Then I sent a couple more emails with the same request. Called every couple days.  No response. Finally on August 9th she said she'd send the contracts to me ASAP, what name would I like to have on the contracts. I told her mine. Next, no contact, no reply.  Emailed every few days...... called every couple days.......  finally got a hold of her on August 17th, she said she'd get the contracts completed and over to my by Friday (2 days away). Then no contact, no reply.  Emailed a couple more times.  Called several more times.  Left messages.  More messages.  Messages for her assistant.  Finally called her today- August 24th- guess what???  That room will be closed for a DOOR REPAIR the evening of October 5th- when our event will be held.  No can do. Seems to me that most hotels would figure out a door repair so that it wouldn't coincide with an evening thousands-of-dollars dollars reception.  Especially considering they had until October 5th to figure it out.  Guess that door has to be repaired that day, that evening. The room was lovely, my immediate reaction was that this was going to be a slam dunk.  I had to beg and beg and beg them for over a month to let me get a contract for this event so we could do business.  I don't know what the issue was that caused me to get such poor treatment, but this is how it happened.  I do event planning for my company all the time, and having to beg for one month to engage in a contract is not the norm. Probably for the best.  Who knows WHAT kind of time I would have to put in to let them know the menu for the evening. Oiy. Disappointing experience.",N

2094,Took my brother on vacation recently to Chicago. stayed 3 nights. Nice hotel on the river. Our room had a good view. Convenient to places to eat and shop in Mart Plaza. Taxis always available outside. They lose a star for charging so much for parking. I don't care if they all do it. It's BS,N
3833,"So I had high hopes for this hotel, and am only giving it three stars because I paid full price for a tiny room, and they couldn't switch it because the hotel was full. I didn't bother to ask for another room the other three nights I was staying there because I didn't want to pack up my things just to unpack them again. The most irritating things was having to use my room key to GO UP and DOWN the elevator. YUP, in case of emergency, don't use the elevator, because it won't go anywhere without a room key. This was always the talk on the elevator with someone, and an annoyance during my stay there. The location is good, very close to two Starbucks and one block away from Whole Foods. The staff is great, always good-looking, friendly and helpful. I didn't experience much noise, but that was probably because my room was on the end of the hall. Overall I couldn't sink into feeling comfortable  here. Maybe it was something about the overly-mod decor, the layout of the lobby, or the concrete ceilings. I did enjoy using the ipod doc/player a lot. I would recommend it to people who are night owls, want to party,, meet other singles, and who don't mind keying up and down the elevator.",N

782,"The lobby here gives you the impression that this is a fantastic hotel (although a bit cramped). The floor I was on, not so much. The halls looked like they hadn't been renovated in the past 20 years and the room was updated, but not very well-laid out. The bathroom was tiny and the hallway (in the room) was huge, but useless. The tub shower didn't work properly, nor did the ventilation (didn't have any). Now THAT works out nicely if you had a bad meal of spicy Indian food the night before. I also didn't like that they didn't bother to replace the soaps with new ones when they cleaned the room. The bed was very comfortable with down pillows and duvet. It was pretty quiet for a downtown hotel too. Staff was very friendly and had me checked in quickly. The workout room here is fantastic. And the hallways on that floor looked so much better than the floor I was on (9th). So I am wondering if the fact I bought the room through Priceline had anything to do with the room I was put in? Probably.",N

We recently held our wedding at this hotel and only have the best to say about this place.  The food was excellent, the atomosphere was perfect, and the staff was top notch.  The rooftop deck was unique and fun -- great experience for our out of town guests and even our family/friends from Chicago!  We also loved how the event space had floor to ceiling windows with a city view - this was lacking at many of the other hotel spaces we viewed.",Y
1411,"I was at the Knickerbocker for my wedding and I can't sing enough praises of the staff. Each and every person we came in contact with was polite and helpful at every turn.  I couldn't have asked for a better evening. All of my guest were in awe of the beautiful space, delicious food, and 5 star service.  As were hubby and I. The champagne parade was a big hit.  We loved it! My husband was concerned that having our reception at such a luxe location would make him and his family/friends feel uncomfortable or out of place. I assured him otherwise and after 5 minutes of arriving at the cocktail hour he realized there was nothing to worry about.  Upon arriving we were greeted by a waiter and he had champagne in our hands almost instantly. Since there were only about 10 minutes left in the cocktail hour the waiters went out of their way to pick bride and groom out of the crowd so that we could get a taste of the delicous appetizers. Mm-mmmm the mini beef wellington...who knew such a small piece could be so flavorful. The only 'hiccup' occured when we got to Parlor G where the bridesmaids were scheduled to get hair and make-up only to find that many of the outlets in the room weren't working. This was definitely a problem with the hair dryers, curling irons, etc that needed to be plugged in. But about 5 minutes after placing a call to the front desk a maintenance staffer was at the room with extension cords and a power strip to get us by.  Also the internet access is like something out of the '90s...why not just charge it to the room? All in all I will definitely recommend the Knickerbocker to visiting guests or locals who want to get away.  We can't wait to return for our anniversary.",N

3898,"My husband and I checked in and we were very disappointed overall. Our room was in the Buckingham Wing, which was the far south of the hotel. The elevator was the size of closet, which was only able to hold only 4 people. Our room was TINY. It fit a queen bed, and one tiny side table and that was it. I booked it because it looked so nice and spacious. The area where these rooms were was not part of the original hotel. It was a modern add on. The room had a strange funk to it, which we believed it was the curtains that probably needed to be cleaned. I think although it was an older hotel in the Chicago, I expected to have a little quaintness, it was just not up to our expectations. If we stay in the loop again, we are going to be willing to pay a bit extra to have a nicer space.",N

Seriously, do you check your rooms before admitting new guests - you have a fridge but I can't keep anything in it?? *** After making a request for one, you STILL MAKE ME WAIT 30mins plus for it, WTF?!/! 4.  Air Conditioner - OMG!!!  That thing is loud!!  When I said LOUD I mean seriously loud, waking up in the middle of the night loud! 5.  STARCHY Sheets!! I don't understand, some downey wouldn't hurt. 6.  Modern Decor completely misses the ball, the burgundy, green & brown combination was not doing this place justice... (if there was any for this place!!) DON'T STAY HERE!!  It's really not worth it!  I have stayed at many hotels such as Swissotel and Fairmont and NOTHING, I MEAN NOTHING was THIS BAD!!! I wish the management would train their employees to be more friendly, help each other out and remind them that they are their to service their guests!",N
436,"Gah... I booked this place on Hotwire, which says it's a 3 star hotel.  No, it's not.  The restaurant doesn't exist yet (but it will Real Soon Now (tm)!), the coffee shop doesn't keep open the hours they have posted, and the whole place just feel abandoned. Let's talk about the ""services"" that are on their webpage: Continental Breakfast: No sight of it! Day Spa Services: Where? 24 Hour Fitness Center: There's a room with a treadmill and an exercise cycle. Gourmet Coffee Shop: ... There's a place that serves coffee.  Their hours are awful (and disagree with what they post), and the food isn't ""gourmet"" at all.  It's mostly packaged stuff they heat up for you at a premium.  Oh, and if you have any questions about it, the staff will gladly tell you that the coffee shop is a separate company and they have no idea about it. Gift Shoppe / Art Gallery: Worse hours than the coffee shop.  I've been here for three days, and I haven't seen it open yet. Meeting & Banquet Facilities: no idea. 24 Hour Business Center & Free Wi-Fi: There's a room with some computers and some printers.  The wi-fi is free, when it's working.  Unfortunately the staff know less about it than they do the coffee shop, and can only suggest using an ethernet cable (which they will provide, also free) if you have any problems. Limousine Services: They have the number for a limo company up front, yes. Wedding and Tour Packages: I've got nothing. Ample Parking: True.  This is because the place is abandoned, you and the other guest at the hotel have your choice of many spaces. Along with all of that, the staff seem like they're just off their game.  None of the rooms (I've unfortunately seen more than one) are well cleaned, and the hallways and common areas (except for the lobby) are in worse shape than the rooms.  It looks like there's been a fresh coat of paint by someone who lost interest before they finished (areas where the paint just... stops...). At the rate they're charging (~$140/night with tax), there's no way this is worth it.  At the hotwire rate ($60/night including tax), well, it's better. Finally, the area of town it's in is kind of sketchy.  It's close to Chinatown, and I expected to walk there for food and whatnot.  The staff strongly advised me against making that walk in the evenings or night time.  I did once at night, a bunch of times during the day, and it was fine.  However, I'm a large dude, and others might be less comfortable with it.  Once you get into Chinatown it's fine, but between here and there is a bit shady. I get the feeling that this hotel just isn't doing well enough to survive.  I overheard the staff saying that they had something like 50 rooms full this weekend.  That's close to 1/5 full.  Ouch...",N
470,"I'm staying my way through all of the Chicago downtown Hilton properties when I visit, so this Embassy Suites is the latest one!  Convenient to Navy Pier and a variety of shopping and restaurants, it's well-located and transit-accessible.  It's important to specify that this is the Embassy Suites on Columbus when you get a cab, by the way, because there's another on State Street and people get confused!   This is a ""sky hotel,"" meaning that the lobby and rooms are all on floors 6 and higher.  You get some pretty nice views, but it also means that you have to catch more than one elevator to get anywhere!  Luckily, they have enough elevators and they move pretty fast.  The lobby and central ""courtyard"" (like nearly all Embassy Suites have) is really quite spectacular and modern.  The lobby does have a bit of a chlorine funk, either due to the fountains or the hotel pool.  The bar and breakfast area are right by the front desk and very convenient - the hotel offers a free breakfast and nightly ""manager's reception"" like other Embassy Suites properties.   The rooms were a little dim for my tastes, without good lighting at any mirror to do my makeup.  Otherwise, very standard suites.  Living room/dining room area, wet bar, separate bathroom and bedroom.  Three sinks in total... one bar of hand soap.  I'll never get that.  The wifi is free for elite HHonors guests.   I'll keep trying different properties - I think my favorite so far has been the Hilton Garden Inn, followed by the other Embassy Suites on State.",N
3614,"The Drake is one of the most famous hotel institutions located in Downtown Chicago on the Magnificent Mile.  Traditionally and architecturally speaking, I would compare the Drake to the likes of the Waldorf Astoria in NYC. I have personally stayed at the Drake, which I booked for a friend's birthday a couple of years back during Christmas time.  And because of the season, I was very impressed with the decorations throughout. Unfortunately, my last experience with the Drake was definitely sub par. Back in June, I booked a room at the Drake with my points for a real great friend of mine and her husband to celebrate her birthday.  Because it was her birthday, I ordered a platter of cold cuts and meats along with a birthday cake, and even called the hotel and spoke to the catering manager to ensure that the catering department charged MY credit card for these items. When my friends checked in, they were very satisfied with the room, which was great.  However, when they checked out, they charged THEIR credit card for the items I ordered for her birthday.  I did not find this out until I spoke with my friends, and they told me about the incident to ensure we were not double charged for the items. When I inquired with my credit card company, they did not charge me.  What irritated me about this incident is the fact that I had to call the hotel from Florida (I was there for business) to get this entire thing straightened out AFTER I gave them specific instructions on who to charge.  What was even worse is the fact that this is very embarrassing to me in front of my friends. Now, I did contact the Hilton Diamond Desk and let them know about the incident and they conducted an investigation on this, but there were also some serious communication issues within themselves as the hotel told the Diamond Desk they contacted me, when in fact they did not.  I also called the hotel manager regarding this, and it took them 3 days to get back with me. Simply put...I am very disappointed, especially for a hotel of this caliber where I can only expect nothing but the best, especially on the service side.",N
3836,"My boyfriend and I spent this past weekend at the Dana hotel and had the most fabulous time ever! He flew in from Ohio and I flew in from California, and this was my first time visiting chicago, so it was important that we got a little taste of everything. Terrific location first of all, within walking distance of shopping, restaurants/bars. Loved the fashionable, modern vibe the hotel had going on. Room was very clean, beds were sooo comfortable and the shower was huge! Unfortunately we did not get the opportunity to check out the spa. Drew, the bartender at the main lobby bar kept us coming back every night! He had an awesome personality, kept us entertained at the bar, hooked us up with some amazing drinks, and recommended some great places for us to go out and to eat! Rooftop bar was nice as well, very cool concept and great views, more of a relaxed setting as well. The bellman, Caesar was also of great help to us from the minute we arrived at the hotel by assisting us with our luggage to providing us with directions every time we needed to get somewhere! Overall, the service at Dana was great, and the hotel was just what we were looking for! :)",N
275,"We recently stayed at the Seneca for two nights during the week. We got a decent deal online, which is why we chose to stay here. How to describe the Seneca...well, it kind of reminded me of grandma's apartment. Nice, comfortable, functional, but kind of old school. In fact, I believe the rooms are converted studio apartments. At least ours was. The kitchen was fully functional.  It had a refrigerator, range, microwave, plates, glasses, pots, pans, etc. etc. The bathroom was very small, and again resembled and apartment bathroom...not your typical big hotel bathroom. The furnishings were also nice, just dated. Other upsides of this place... The hotel staff was very nice The location is great, just east of the John Hancock So if you are looking for romantic or trendy, this is not your place. But if you want functionality, the Seneca definitely fits the bill.",N
1942,"This is a nightclub with guest rooms (or a small Vegas hotel without a casino). Once inside, you have no idea what time of day it is. Trance and ambient music flows through the public areas and the glowing light is minimal. At first it's cool but then it gets depressing. The staff is friendly and the amenities are useful but you pay quite the price for it.",N
499,"As a loyal Hilton traveller, I would rate this the better of the two Embassy Suites in Chicago. Still, I guess I have a thing with them because I feel like there's a cost you pay for having a suite and having free breakfast. The workout room is slightly above average, the breakfast is pretty good and the staff is quite friendly. Big negative in getting a smoking room, though I didn't mind that much since it didn't smell. Also, negatives for not recognizing my status (yeah, I have it so I'm officially that guy) and for making me pay for the internet. The manager's special is a nice touch, though you only get well drinks and draft beers. The food is slightly edible. I guess I'd come back here, but still want to try other hotels in town first.",N
3291,"Stayed here for my 21st birthday weekend. Check in was fast, and the front desk people were so sweet (Levi was the best). To celebrate my birthday they sent up complimentary wine and strawberries. The beds were very comfortable, and the products in the shower were better then your average hotel, almost Aveda like. The hotel bar was also very fast. I only had one drink down there, and then went out. I had so much fun staying here, and would return in a heartbeat.",N
1464,"We're Chicago suburbanites but decided to stay overnight one weekend after snagging a fairly decent deal on Priceline.  Omni is literally right on Michigan Avenue (although it's probably better if you get a room that doesn't face Michigan Avenue for noise reduction).  Very ideally located if you intend to shop on the Mag Mile. It's a beautiful hotel, although the lobby/reception is technically on the 3rd floor so you have to take 2 elevators to get to your hotel room.  Not a biggie but during busy times, you'll wait a long time for an elevator.  It is a beautiful hotel.  The rooms are modern and beautifully decorated and very clean.  No bed bugs issues either!  LOL.  Bed was pretty comfortable.  Bath amenities are nothing to write home about, but it is a clean, decent bathroom.   We had room 1118, and it is a bit of a bizarre L-shaped room.  Didn't really seem like a suite to me, and the bed didn't seem separate from the living area space.  it wasn't a huge room as some other reviewers reported and we only had one flat screen TV, so maybe we didn't get a true suite.  But it is still a nice room.  hey have a nice turn-down service, too.  But maybe we got 1118 because that's the Priceline special. Only two complaints I have are these:  (1) Parking (valet) costs $49.  There goes the bargain we got on Priceline. (2) The bed in 1118 shares the same wall as the bathroom in the next room.  So whenever the people in the next room go to the bathroom or turn on their shower, that noise blares in your ear.  Loud as hell.  Every time they ran their shower or used the toilet, we heard them.  Also, there is a hell of a lot of door slamming.  Too bad they can't do something to soften the sound of the door.",N
4018,"Visited Chicago for the very first time in my life on December 02 -04, 2011. You could not go wrong with this hotel. Hyatt Regency Chicago is very close to everything like the shopping on Michigan Avenue, Navy Pier, Millennium Park, restaurants, the river, Marilyn Monroe statue, and so much more. It's all a walking distance. There are pictures that I uploaded for reference of what the inside looks like. It's spacious and the customer service provided was spectacular from the beginning to the end. I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants to visit Chicago. The rate I had was $150/day which is not bad at all. It's beautiful inside and out and kept traffic moving so everyone can arrive and leave faster. Great service!",N
706,"I've stayed here twice now and would go back in a heartbeat.  If I'm looking to save money in the city and still stay at a central place in a nice clean hotel, this is it.  The rate was great (around $150 I think).  The restaurant next door (Viand) is connected on the inside and you can bill your meal to the room.  They also do a decent breakfast.  It's close enough to go for a run on Lakeshore and close enough to shop on the MM.  Great restaurants are all walk or short cab ride away.  The room was exactly what you expect from Marriott and perhaps a little nice than some Courtyards I've stayed at in non-urban areas. Always check here before you book a room in the city.",N
4387,"We were sixteen and both in town for a youth conference. We were pretending to be delegates from the United Nations and we had a mock General Assembly with all the ad hoc committees and panels to boot. I was representing the US in the OAS (Organization of American States), and she was Argentina. We shared glances across the room, and as she spoke from the dais, I drooled. Now, I was an early bloomer they would say, and it was proven by my winning the coveted Congeniality Award upon our return from solving the world's problems (later this award would be renamed ""The Corey Hart Award""). Wink wink. Argentina and I had a quick love affair, skipping out of our small conference room to co-author resolutions on Cuba-US treaties and make out. It was in a cold Palmer House stairwell that I made it to second base, and it was in the not so private double room where we sealed the deal. Well, we almost sealed the deal. We were sadly interrupted by the pounding on the big and heavy Palmer House hotel room doors by the chaperone of my group. He was tipped off to the evil goings on inside the room by my roomie sulking outside in the hall. That rat! Well, needless to say, I've had a long long love for this hotel. It's been recently renovated, and through its renovation, never shut down! This they've done before, making it the longest continuously operating hotel in America. The hotel reclaims its older charms with this latest renovation, and the room upgrades were a welcome touch. A walk down the halls and you can see pictures of what the hotel looked like in the past, as well as catch glimpses of what kind of wild parties were going on back in the day. In the ballrooms, in the bars, and in the large large suites. The staff, service, and accompaniments are like any you'd find in a top notch Hilton property, and the location is great. Love blues? Then stay nowhere else, for here you're blocks away from Buddy Guy's Legends, a must visit. You're also close to the Chicago Theater, the landmark Marshall Field's (I refuse to refer to it as Macy's), and head toward the lake for access to parks, museums, and the South Loop's only Panda Express. Visiting in winter for Christmas? Walk West to find the christkindlmarket on Washington between Clark and Dearborn. There you'll find large, bright trees, a beer garden, and dozens of stalls peddling all sorts of Austrian, German, and Bavarian goods, gifts, and foods. I bring everyone I show around Chicago to the Palmer House, and it never disappoints. There's always oooohing, ahhhing, and wows. The majesty of the reception/foyer/seating/lobby area is well... simply timeless and breathless. This is an American icon without a doubt. Tip: steal your girl/guy away into a stairwell for me. And tip the concierge already!",N
1468,"My stay at the Omni Chicago was fantastic during my 5 day 4 night stay in Chicago. The accomodations were all first class and the king size bed was super comfy. Also had a great view of the Hancock building from the room on the 20th floor. Location of hotel is very convinient off Michigan Avenue with a ton of stores to go out shopping and do a lot of sight seeing. Also before my stay here I enrolled in their Select Guest membership. With that I was able to get free Wi-Fi in my room, 2 complimentary beverages every morning, and free Chicago Tribune newspaper. Will stay here again if I'm ever in Chicago. Just had a wonderful time here.",N
3269,"Stayed at the HR over Labor day weekend '10.. and had two different room types. The first night we stayed in a Deluxe King room and it was cozy but nice. We didn't spend a lot of time in the room as we didn't land until 8pm and it took an hour to get to the hotel and then we went to grab a late bite. The balance of the stay (3 nights) we stayed the Platinum King which was a corner room with two views of the city. Things I loved: The front desk was really helpful and remembered us. We didn't have to deal with any messy issues and they called us when our room was ready (we had to change our rooms since they were different levels). They stored our bags (for free - in Vegas; they sometimes charge $1/bag). The concierge called us twice to inform us that our room was ready; I thought that was nice in case we were killing time (which we weren't). The hotel sent us a place of fresh strawberries, chocolate fondue and champagne as we were there for a celebration. I thought that was such a nice touch as other hotels we've stayed at on special occasions did not acknowledge at all (despite being listed on reservation). The bathrooms were nice with upgraded amenities. The smell of sweetgrass still gives me a smile as all the products smelled like it. There were lots of mirrors and comfortable beds. I enjoyed the non-down pillow in the closet (with an additional blanket) as I'm allergic to down pillows. Close location to downtown area with lots nearby to eat and hang out. Train stop is only a block away and can utilize to get around city without large cab fees. Your room key gives you a 15% discount to the Hard Rock Cafe although it is about a mile or so (walking). We walked there but there were no directions to it and we thankfully just used our itouch to get there. Cons: Elevators were a bit confusing as only one bay seemed to be functioning despite having 6. Fridge was weighted and so you were unable to use for personal items. I usually prefer to buy my own water as I like to stay hydrated so we had to just drink room temp so we didn't get charged for moving things around in the fridge. There was only one robe in the room and it wasn't as soft as some hotels we've stayed in. Overall, I was impressed with the Hard Rock. We've stayed at many hotels which were pricier and didn't make us feel special or valued. HR definitely made us feel it was worth the value as well as accomodating. We asked for late check-out and they granted us an additional hour. Check-out was painless and we were able to just walk out and leave keys in the room. Would definitely stay there again the next time we visit.",N
1144,"I've stayed at the Fairmont Chicagoo since the property opened many years ago.  While the service has always been five star, the property needed renovation.  I'm pleased to say that it recently had a big face lift and once again shines as one of Chicago's best hotels.  The bathrooms are upscale.  My room had booth a bath tub and a shower with rain style shower head.  The new decor is quite modern and comfortable.  The lobby is beautiful and the restaurant (Aria, for which I did a separate review) is really good.  The location and view make it a top choice for anyone staying in the heart of downtown Chicago.",N
5450,"Pretty good location being in 'Viagra Triangle' - closing walking distance to Red Line subway, Lake Michigan and N Michigan/Oak shopping.  Hotel is pretty classy and service and decor is top-notch.  There are lots of bars, restaurants and shops nearby - most importantly: it's close to a few CVS/Walgreen's.  But - being in Viagra Triangle, nightlife nearby is mainly for old men and their mistresses.  Then again, I suppose my group wasn't exactly their main clientele. What's hot: - powerful showerheads - good for trying to wash the sins off your filthy body... I know what you have done... - free WiFi if you ask nicely or mention you're a Sutton Club member - got a corner suite facing Lake Michigan - was surprised to find some decent speakers, an amplifier and a DVD player attached to the CRT TV - fast elevators - staff was awesome - friendly, prompt and helpful - terry cloth bath robes What blows: - WiFi connection is extremely weak (at least on the 15th floor) - connection repeatedly dropped on my smartphone and was rocky at best on a laptop - I understood why they were so easily in giving us WiFi for free.  Do not even bother paying for it. - Complimentary ice delivery - there aren't ice machines on the floors, so they deliver it from downstairs.  First couple of times I called front desk, no ice arrived within 15 minutes.  First time, I walked down to grab my own ice... like a peasant.  Second time, I complained to front desk about the '5 minute' promise.  After that - all ice deliveries were at my room lickety-split.  Sorry to be a bitch about this - but when you're an alcoholic, you abhor waiting for ice. Overall - a good hotel with great service overall.  Just give me better WiFi and don't make me wait for ice again.",N
4149,"This hotel is very busy and is operating way beyond their means. Incompetent service. Hotel ran out of hot water by 9am saturday. Elevators were very slow, waited 10 minutes on any given event. Red line trains ran every 10 minutes beneath city streets and you can hear the thunder in your room from them but it shouldnt keep you awake at night. Used my stay toward NW airlines bonus points. Bar was ok. One cup coffee service was awful. No free wireless and no free cable channels. Fridge was 25 bucks a day to use. With http://hotels.com res got it for 65 bucks with tax so what can you expect.?.... Location was superb and cab service was convenient but not enough to outweigh the negatives.",N

2730,"I stayed at The James for the first time earlier this year.  I booked a room through a promotion where rooms were $125 and we received $100 in food credits!  I was expecting the hotel to be a bit budget to provide such a crazy deal but was very pleasantly surprised.   I travel about 1-2 weeks a month and am always looking for well-designed and comfortable hotels.  Basically I look for hotels that don't remind me I am on the road!  I was impressed with the overall service of The James, cleanliness of the rooms, comfort of the bed, Kiehl's products (yay!), deliciousness of food (Prime is a great steak house, the room service menu comes from Prime as well) and location. I went back to The James for a second time (this time not on the promotion)  to see if the first experience was just a fluke - but it wasn't!  They have a large gym with many cardio equipment options and a fantastic spa.  Dawn is a great masseuse.  I also love the access to printers and an easy and open business ""center"". Both my trips have been for business and I look forward to going back to Chicago and staying at The James again.  I see they are opening a hotel in NY as well....",N
338,"Only in your most desperate moments should you book a room here. I mean moments where, in order to survive the night, you should get rid of the gun and the hooker and get your ass to a meeting. Other acceptable circumstances include being a college student who's coming to scope out apartments in Chicago, and who wants to stay in a place that has locks on the doors and a private bath. In that case, one extra star for complimentary breakfast that's at least as good as the food on campus. Bonus: Prominently displayed certificate stating that it is a Most Improved Property. Yeesh.",N
3910,"My husband writes: Here are 5 things that I would rather do than stay at this overpriced  hotel: buy used tampons at a garage sale for my wife, roll around naked in a stinky puddle on Lower Wacker Drive, watch 2 guys and 1 cup, donate to the Cannibal Flesh Donor Program, karate chop a moving train and, drink a cup of coffee made from coffee beans that have been regurgitated by a weasel. Why would I do all those things? Because there is no way that ANYONE should even consider spending the night at the Congress, it's an insult to both decency and intelligence. Sure it's located on Michigan, sure it's right in front of Grant Park but, the room and the service there would make you think you just checked into a roach motel and, for good reasons; let me count the ways: First, we wanted to stay in a non-smoking room. After traveling to the 7th floor we opened a closed corridor, to get to our non-smoking room, and were hit with the ever teasing smell of marijuana. I don't know if someone had just passed through there smoking it or if someone was getting spliffed-out in one of the rooms but, the smell was so strong that we told one of the maids and she said that she would call security. We entered our room and, thank God, there was no smell in there. Instead... ...we found: mold in the bathroom, funky carpet molding that looked like it had been a termite's nesting ground in the 50's, the wallpaper looked like my 7 year old niece put it up using paper-mache, the bathroom door looked like it had been painted over 100 times since the sixties with bits of paint chiping off revealing the several layers of paint underneath like the Grand Canyon.  There was also NO refrigerador in the room, WTF? Come on, even a Super 8 has that and I won't have to pay 3x as much; this fact really sucked since we had just eaten a deep dish pizza and need someplace to store the left overs. And finally, the bathroom itself...let's just say I've seen and used better gas station stalls than the one at the ""presigious"" Congress Plaza Hotel. But wait, there's more! The room was so crappy that we decided to go downstairs and reduce our stay there to just one night - we were extremely tired. We finally made it downstairs,weed smell was being delt with by opening up ONE hallway window btw, and tell the receptionist our take on their hotel. To the Congress' credit she did try to accomodate us by sending a free mini-fridge to our room, seems that the hotel does in fact have them, they just happen to cost $10 extra per night. So, at this point, we just wanted to speak to the manager to let him/her know that we were very disappointed, we did this NOT to be comp'ed, we did this to air our frustration. The manager was at the other end of the reception desk so the reception clerk told us to head down and that she would be with us shortly. I can't really pin point when it was that my wife and I decided, ""fuck this place"" but, it must have occured during the 30 minutes that we were left waiting to speak to the manager. She saw us, she knew exactly why we were standing there, she passed by us several times without ever so much as an, ""I'll be right with you."" We finally spoke with her and quite honestly, she seemed indifferent about the whole matter, I believe her name was Elsa or Elda. She told us that she could refund our money back to our card but that all personal belongings had to be out of the room. So... We head back up stairs through the veil of herb stank and, what do we find in our room? The complimentary mini-fridge that the girl at the front desk sent up to our room, right? WRONG! Appearantly, besided the crumbling decor of the Congress, they must have a real inept or just plain lacadasical staff because instead of having a mini-fridge, they sent up an extra foldable bed which wasn't even placed, say, by the bed against the wall, no sir, it was left haphazardly and smack dab in the middle of the room. What the fuck? That's when I came to the conclusion that it must be the staff that's smoking out in the corridors. We finally make it back down, and we finally get our refund put back on the debit card, it'll of course take 7-10 business days which totally sucks because now we are left with having to find a new hotel -$400. We ended up finding a hotel inside the city proper which met our expectations and fulfilled our quartering needs. So, with all that has been said, STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM THE CONGRESS PLAZA HOTEL!!! LOOK AT THE FUCKIN' REVIEWS (too bad we didn't)!!! The only place that the Congress looks nice is the ground floor were there's more than enough architectural eye-candy  and restaurants to convice you that the place is top-notch and, convince ppl it does; during this whole ordeal, I was amazed at how many ppl were gladly paying money to stay in a craptacular shit hole. Save your money, don't even think about staying here, because the only thing that you're paying for is the location, nothing more.",N
2304,"I am no hotel aficionado, but I had the opportunity to stay in this particular hotel for my first visit to the Windy City.   The location is awesome. Central to plenty of great restaurants, you are walking distance from shopping, and really anything else you may want or need. I even walked to the shore of the lake, it was beautiful. There is a full bar in the lobby, which seemed cool to me at the time, but I never got a great vibe from it. However, the bartender there was very kind and remembered me from the night before. Very tip-able staff. My room was beautiful, and very clean. Plenty of amenities. Kind of a small bathroom and nothing spectacular, but it got the job done. Downsides... No free wi-fi = stupid! The positive to this was that it forced me to learn how to connect via bluetooth through my cell phone... nerd central.   Like other posts have said the valets were a touch on the inattentive side, but they were all right.   One thing that really annoyed me was that most cabbies had no clue where this Marriott was located! There is another Marriott within walking distance so I think it is rather confusing... but really. That isn't the hotel's fault, but it is something worth mentioning. The ball room was great for the awards ceremony I attended, and again the staff was very accommodating. Worth a shot if you want to stay on the mile, and definitely a great place if you are on a business trip.",N
5730,"As I approached this hotel on foot, I lowered my expectations.  The surrounding area is not the most exciting part of Chicago and the exterior of the building is drab - I can't think of a better word to describe it.  However, once I stepped inside, I started feeling better about my hotel selection, as the interior had the updated pseudo-euro feel to it.  This property is part of the Intercontinental chain, so you know it has to be pretty good.  By the time I got up to my room, my spirits were high - clean rooms with updated furniture, bathroom and electronics.  What more could a guy and his roller bag want? Pros: *  comfortable, modern feel (on the inside) *  tv and clock radio were great, including one of those relaxing cds that plays nature sounds, if you're into that stuff (free to buy, $$ to buy) * Greektown is a short walk for food that is....Greek * Metra trains stop nearby at Oglivie and Union stations Cons: * not a great location, unless your imagination allows you to substitute the flow of traffic on the highway below you for the Chicago river (sits right at the Madison St. exit) * dining options limited in the immediate area",N
1221,"I was doing some work for one of the conferences held at the McCormick Place.  The conference host booked me a room at the Hyatt and gave me a confirmation for a late check-in.  My flight was late and I finally made it to the hotel around 10:30 p.m. only to be told they had no rooms available.  I am like WTH?  They offered the guy in line in front of me the option of one or two rooms.  I was pissed and getting no where so I took them craptastic offer of a room at the closest hotel accepting overflow - A Red Roof Inn in Deerfield - a good 45 minute cab ride with no traffic.  That was a little piece of heck being sent to no less than 4 rooms before one was acceptable - one was dirty, one had no electricity, one was occupied by a man who threatened my life for breaking into his room...  Then in the early a.m. I had to take a 90 minute cab ride back to the McCormick Place. What Hyatt Did Right: - Offered to comp the Red Roof Inn room - Gave me $120 in cash for the cab ride - Offered me a guaranteed room the next night at a reduced rate plus all meals comped. - Upgraded my room to a corner suite - Sent me ""I am Sorry"" snacks and form letter like notes of apology from the G.M. and  catering manager. What Hyatt Did Wrong: - Sent me 1 1/2 hours out of my way to stay an an AWFUL hotel. - Gave me $10 too little to cover the cab fare back and forth - BILLED ME IN FULL FOR THE UPGRADE ROOM and FOR THE SNACKS!!!!! I was stupefied by offering all these nice things and then sending me the bill.  Really?!  Do you treat all guests this way???  I guess as a convention site they really don't have to provide quality customer service - they get people regardless.  When I travel, I generally like to stay at nicer hotels - Hyatt has recently been crossed off my list. In the end when I complained about the bill, they did offer an apology again and comp the entire bill.",N
5708,"My stay at the Chicago River hotel was very pleasant. Besides its convenient location to everything I could possibly look for in the city, the staff were all friendly and prompt with service requests. The free wifi and self-serve water bottles in the hallway are added bonus. I stayed at the Intercontinental down the street during the latter part of my visit and they did not have the same perks. The guestroom I was in is set up for business stays-with reading lights and a decent size desk. The bathroom is adequately equipped with magnifying makeup mirror and large shower stall (not bathtub). I deducted a star for the tiny TV monitor mounted on the wall that is barely visible if you were to watch TV from your bed. Also, we requested a queen bed + pull out sofa bed guestroom, but got a queen + roll away bed.",N
3257,"Very nice, comfortable and SPACIOUS rooms... no room for improvement in that area. Service was fine, although the concierge was slightly pretentious. Eww. Hard Rock is at a great location on the Magnificent Mile so its very easy to get around to Millennium Park and all the shops. I wasn't terribly crazy about their bar, however, and found it on the smaller side... also it was filled with fanny pack wearing tourists (i.e., Hard Rock seems to be mostly families who were staying there which I am totally fine with but at 8AM when you hear kids screaming at each other and Mom & Dad yelling at them to shut up next door to your room it's not good...) Overall I was impressed with Hard Rock and would recommend to others who are fine with that...but I'll probably try the James Hotel or the Sofitel Hotel next time.",N
4998,"I loved the Essex.  We came into Chicago for only one night, and this was the cheapest, best located place we could find (right on Grant Park!).  I thought for sure it would be some dirty, creepy hole in the wall, but it turned out to be very clean, friendly, and modern.  The room itself was beautifully decorated, spacious, and clean, and the hotel had a great Art Deco vibe.  The staff was super friendly and really helpful with recommendations for restaurants and directions to different areas of town.My only regret is that I didn't get to swim in that beautiful pool they have.  We were too busy exploring the city to properly enjoy the amenities, but next time I'm in town I'll be sure to make time.",Y
915,Great hotel in a great buiding - award winning renovation.  Great views from the big windows and nice room decor.  The toiletries are top notch too!,N
2855,"Two years ago I probably would have stayed a bit further away to be closer to the heart of the action in the city. But if there's a reason for you to be in this ""a bit out of the way"" location, then this is a great option. It's nicer than the Hilton on the other side of the river and has more amenities than the Sofitel and Fairmont (also on the other side of the river). What I liked about this location that I hadn't previously anticipated was the proximity to Grant Park, the Bean, the Bridge, etc. Being a native Chicagoan, it's embarrassing that I hadn't been before...super cool and super easy walk there. Also, my hubby and kid joined me on this work trip, and they very much liked the proximity to the Children's museum at Navy Pier. There's also a load of great restaurants nearby. This is a conference hotel. So you know it's going to be big, have lots of amentities, and charge for all of them. We paid an additional $15/day for internet, oh well, charged it to work. Rediculous, yes, but standard for the big chains. We didn't park there, but I'm sure that's crazy expensive too. There's a Shula's in the hotel...not my favorite steak chain, but I brought some potato skins up to my room (not paying rediculous room service fees) and they were AWESOME. Even better than the recently departed Boston Blackies' version that used to be down the street. I also ate at the little burger place in the basement...perfect for a quick meal, had a cafeteria feel, easy with kids, reasonable, and served beer...perfect. The room. We had a great view of the river, it was big and comfortable, of course comfortable beds. Since we had a kid, they were very quick in delivering a crib and fridge for her baby food. And when we had a technical issue with the remote/TV, the technition was really sweet about explaining that you have to turn the TV ""on"" for the remote to work (without calling me a total moron). Only downside here was the two towels in the room, and flimsy towels they were. Added bonus, if you're a Starwood Preferred member, as I am, the concierge floor is awesome. It's a double decker room with huge windows serving breakfast, pre-dinner apps and after-dinner snacks and desserts. Free soda and waters all day long. You could eat all your meals up there! :) I would absolutely stay here again if I had to be in this part of town again (and my work is paying for the room). But I'm cheap and wouldn't pay more than $200/night to stay here if I were on my own dime.",N
1914,"I stayed here for a week while on business. The location is great and the hotel is very clean and accomodating while you are there. There was one incident while I was there, where I came back to my room and saw that the pringles from the mini bar selection had been eaten and the cap put back on. I called down to report the problem and was told that a note would be put on my account. After I checked out and returned home, I reviewed my receipt that was sent via email. 2 cans of $6 pringles were on there that I never ate. I've attempted to call the hotel 3 times, only to be directed to a voicemail that either no one checks or to someone who is too lazy to return calls. I would still stay here again, but I would review my receipt while I'm still in the hotel.",N
791,"Excelllent as all westins are! While their beds are the best reason to come here, I also enjoy knowing that the rooms and entire property are going to be spotless! Cant beat the location! We had our 6 month old son so taking public transportation was out of the question so we walked everywhere, which is not hard since you are right in the middle of it all. I didnt like that parking was so expensive, we parked around the corner at some gated lot for 1/3 the price. Other than that i would stay again. We would be staying again during this trip but we decided to check out the omni, i'll let you know how they compare!",N
936,"Is it cheap? Yes. Is it well located? Yes. Are the rooms amazing? Hell No. This is a very budget ""motel"" nicer than I was expecting, but still miles away from something I'd recommend to my picky friends.  I stay here for a number of reasons, the price is awesome.. around 56 bucks a night for a room in downtown Chicago is awesome.  The rooms are smaller, but enough for me... I don't come to Chicago to sit in my hotel room, I sleep here and that's about it. I've never had a problem with check in, the staff has also been very nice, no major issues with the room.  They are quick to address anything that is wrong, for instance during my last trip the iron had some residue from previous use.. I called and it was fixed within 30 minutes.",N
1039,"The rooms are nice.  I want a corner room some time when we stay there again.  Walking distance (meaning within a mile) of so much!  We walked to Navy Pier and the Magnificent mile and even home from Soldier Field but that was more like 2.5 miles.  If you stay here go to the Purple Pig which is 0.4 miles from the hotel.  Get the Eggplant and Goat Cheese Spread.  YUM! YUM! YUM!  They have continental breakfast set up on every floor with is such a brilliant idea and really was a great touch.  Sadly, the pastries are not good.  It is a real shame because there are so many great options in Chicago which I am sure wouldn't be that much more expensive and would leave more of an impression.   The gym has nice sturdy machines which we didn't use because that is not how we vacation.  The bed was wonderful.  We will be staying here again.  $44 a day for valet is a huge negative but we didn't see where it was any cheaper anywhere else in that area.  If somebody knows of a better option/place to leave a car we won't be using all week please send me a message and let me know.  Don't want to pay that bill again.  They did do it fairly though and charged by 24 hours instead of calendar day which we really appreciated.",N
4707,"Great eco-friendly hotel. The rooms are smallish, but not tiny, and they have decorated in such a way as to maximize the space (ex: drawers under the bed instead of a full-size dresser). The only negative for me was the lack of a coffee maker in the room.",N
3684,Best hotel in Chicago!,N
2030,"Good thing this was not my first time..... We stayed here again on a recent weekend visit.  I have to say, if this were my first time here, I would not stay again. We arrived early, but luckily our room was ready so we could get settled.  We were ""upgraded"" to a suite.  I say ""upgraded"" because although the room was big, spacious, and clean, the room was right next to the service elevator.  This made for a very loud banging most of the morning.  As soon as I would fall back to sleep, BANG! another set of doors opening and closing. The bathroom in the suite was awesome as was the quasi living room, but the desk was kind of banged up and the wi-fi password changed between check in time of noon and 7:00 pm.  What's up with that? I will stay here again because the location is convenient and the staff could not be nicer, but I will be specific in my request to not be next to this elevator or any other room that ends in 48.",N
4670,"Found a great deal through 'name your own price' on priceline, which definitely made it worth the trip.  Location is close to major roads and transportation, so you can get around the city when you want to go exploring.  The rooms are not huge, but very comfortable (e.g. with the bed linens and the temperature controlled rooms).  The lobby is inviting with the fireplace and water feature.  The is also a common area on the second floor with a television.  They are a green hotel, which people may love or hate--yet it explains the set-up.  It is cute and worth the trip as long as you know what you are expecting.  Went her on a girlfiends get-away with great customer service and cute quote cards on our way out the door to send us on our merry way!",N
3908,"Here are 5 things that I would rather do than stay at this overpriced  hotel: buy used tampons at a garage sale for my wife, roll around naked in a stinky puddle on Lower Wacker Drive, watch 2 guys and 1 cup, donate to the Cannibal Flesh Donor Program, karate chop a moving train and, drink a cup of coffee made from coffee beans that have been regurgitated by a weasel. Why would I do all those things? Because there is no way that ANYONE should even consider spending the night at the Congress, it's an insult to both decency and intelligence. Sure it's located on Michigan, sure it's right in front of Grant Park but, the room and the service there would make you think you just checked into a roach motel and, for good reasons; let me count the ways: First, we wanted to stay in a non-smoking room. After traveling to the 7th floor we opened a closed corridor, to get to our non-smoking room, and were hit with the ever teasing smell of marijuana. I don't know if someone had just passed through there smoking it or if someone was getting spliffed-out in one of the rooms but, the smell was so strong that we told one of the maids and she said that she would call security. We entered our room and, thank God, there was no smell in there. Instead... ...we found: mold in the bathroom, funky carpet molding that looked like it had been a termite's nesting ground in the 50's, the wallpaper looked like my 7 year old niece put it up using paper-mache, the bathroom door looked like it had been painted over 100 times since the sixties with bits of paint chiping off revealing the several layers of paint underneath like the Grand Canyon.  There was also NO refrigerador in the room, WTF? Come on, even a Super 8 has that and I won't have to pay 3x as much; this fact really sucked since we had just eaten a deep dish pizza and need someplace to store the left overs. And finally, the bathroom itself...let's just say I've seen and used better gas station stalls than the one at the ""presigious"" Congress Plaza Hotel. But wait, there's more! The room was so crappy that we decided to go downstairs and reduce our stay there to just one night - we were extremely tired. We finally made it downstairs,weed smell was being delt with by opening up ONE hallway window btw, and tell the receptionist our take on their hotel. To the Congress' credit she did try to accomodate us by sending a free mini-fridge to our room, seems that the hotel does in fact have them, they just happen to cost $10 extra per night. So, at this point, we just wanted to speak to the manager to let him/her know that we were very disappointed, we did this NOT to be comp'ed, we did this to air our frustration. The manager was at the other end of the reception desk so the reception clerk told us to head down and that she would be with us shortly. I can't really pin point when it was that my wife and I decided, ""fuck this place"" but, it must have occured during the 30 minutes that we were left waiting to speak to the manager. She saw us, she knew exactly why we were standing there, she passed by us several times without ever so much as an, ""I'll be right with you."" We finally spoke with her and quite honestly, she seemed indifferent about the whole matter, I believe her name was Elsa or Elda. She told us that she could refund our money back to our card but that all personal belongings had to be out of the room. So... We head back up stairs through the veil of herb stank and, what do we find in our room? The complimentary mini-fridge that the girl at the front desk sent up to our room, right? WRONG! Appearantly, besided the crumbling decor of the Congress, they must have a real inept or just plain lacadasical staff because instead of having a mini-fridge, they sent up an extra foldable bed which wasn't even placed, say, by the bed against the wall, no sir, it was left haphazardly and smack dab in the middle of the room. What the fuck? That's when I came to the conclusion that it must be the staff that's smoking out in the corridors. We finally make it back down, and we finally get our refund put back on the debit card, it'll of course take 7-10 business days which totally sucks because now we are left with having to find a new hotel -$400. We ended up finding a hotel inside the city proper which met our expectations and fulfilled our quartering needs. So, with all that has been said, STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM THE CONGRESS PLAZA HOTEL!!! LOOK AT THE FUCKIN' REVIEWS (too bad we didn't)!!! The only place that the Congress looks nice is the ground floor were there's more than enough architectural eye-candy  and restaurants to convice you that the place is top-notch and, convince ppl it does; during this whole ordeal, I was amazed at how many ppl were gladly paying money to stay in a craptacular shit hole. Save your money, don't even think about staying here, because the only thing that you're paying for is the location, nothing more.",N
5715,"as a new yorker, i am astonished by the efficiency of this hotel room.  the space is small, but effectively designed, and well laid-out. the location is an easy walk to lots of the touristy stuff, and right near many train lines if you want to go elsewhere.",N
2923,"This hotel has a great location to the magnificent mile and Navy Pier!  My wife and I have stayed here 3 times now, for a night out on the town.  I have had a bad experience my first time, but the hotel manager gave us a free night as consolation.  She was extremely helpful!   I would say that you should try the pomegranate cosmo in the bar downstars adjacent to the lobby, they are our favorite! We can't wait to go back this fall, what a great hotel!!",N
4477,"Wowza.  After their remodel this place looks amazing.  I love the blast from the past glamour: there are black and white photos of Hollywood icons who have performed here in the Empire Room on the walls of the guest floors.  The lobby is amazing - more like a European museum than a hotel lobby.  The peacock touches are right up my alley, and manage to stay somewhat subtle.  The peacock door near the main entrance; the peacock carpets, some more subtle than others - love.   My sleeping room is not the norm (I magically ended up in a suite, which is huge and I can easily entertain a group of at least 5 others so please feel free to stop by), but it is spectacular.  I love that they kept some old pieces (I'm looking at you doorknobs) to mix in with the new. The food has been very, very good.  The service even better (people say hello to you when it would even be reasonable for them not to - but they stop and greet you anyway.  AND it's not even like some canned comment that they clearly ""have to"" say to guests.).  Best chocolate chip cookies in the world. Love the trivia in the elevator (did you know this 1600 room hotel was a WEDDING GIFT for Bertha Palmer from her husband?!  I mean, it's no Taj, but still!).  This hotel is full of history and I am completely smitten. My only little complaint - why oh why can't I just have wireless in my room?  Why do I have to go fill out a form for a thing?  I'm in my jammies already and I just want to watch Glee in bed instead of sitting at the desk; is that too much to ask? I have absolutely had a five star experience here, but because I know that not all rooms are created equal and some are quite small and oddly shaped, and because as a planner all of the union regulations are redonk, I'm incredibly tempted to dock a star.  I can't bring myself to do it, but just buyer beware, okay?",N
1727,"Stayed her for a night a few months back as a sort of mini-vacation.  Dumb reason?  Maybe.  Tacky? Probably.  But whatever, I didn't have any vacation time left! We were very impressed with the friendly, courteous and professional staff.  The room was decked out like a little apartment with seperate dining, living, and bathroom areas, all spotless.  The iPod docks are a cool treat, as well as the double sized whirlpool tub ;-) I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone from out of town or people who are spending an evening downtown from the suburbs, you can consider it as treating yourself!",N
2945,"I got my first view of this place today at a one-day conference... and while the copious amount of food and drink the hotel provided us throughout the course of the day was nicely presented, interesting, and fresh, when we arrived in the morning we were mis-directed to our target location on three separate occasions; apparently my event never made it onto the docket, so rather than owning up to not knowing where to send us, the different employees figured it would be fun to send us on a snipe hunt. The mitigating factor was that all the conference rooms we checked out were very nicely decorated, and all the various escalators we explored were in front of the river-view side of the building, so we were all treated to a (dreary, overcast) view of the river.",N
704,I stayed here once by accident - because I had reserved THIS Courtyard instead of the one on 30 E. Hubbard. The room was fine and the location was fine. I just didn't really like it because it felt like the hotel was in the land that time forgot. Everything just felt old and over startched and not fun.,N
4234,"I spent the last two New Year's at this hotel. They throw a huge party, open bar and food and they give you a hotel room for a pretty good price. The rooms are really nice and some have awesome views! This place gets soo packed and I always have a blast!",N
2648,"Ok 1st things 1st.  the location is hard to beat.  1 block from michigan ave is awesome!  the lobby is small but hip, so thats ok.  the room amenities are pretty BA.  robes for each person and slippers is a great touch.  the wet bar is top notch, and also top notch pricey.  luckily there is a trader joes across the street and they sell pretty good beer/wine.   our 1 and only issues was the street noise.  we were originally on the 4th floor facing the street.  the windows are not the double pane variety, so any noise on the street is very noticeable.  my wife and i could not sleep the first night, so we called down and asked to have  the room changed.  they changed us that night., but we had to switch to two doubles.  they said they would switch us back to a king the next day, but that didnt happen.  for the amount we paid for the room i was expecting alot better service and a sound nights sleep another weird thing was they didnt have any ice machines.  so if u wanted ice, u needed to call the front desk and ask for someone to bring it up.  now in the middle of the day, thats fine, but during prime time, we waited an hour for ice, which is unacceptable.  overall, it was a cute hotel, but i wont stay there again.",N
5714,"A damn nice hotel for a reasonable price.  Rooms were very nice... they seem to have been recently remodeled and were also very clean.   The bathrooms were also nice.  Some have complained that the rooms are small, but they seemed fine to me.  Plus free computers and printing.",N
4916,The Drake is our place. We got married there in 2007 and the service was OUTSTANDING. Living in the city we frequently go there for dinner and recommend our guests to stay there and everyone raves about it.,Y
3535,"GREAT location, but you can definitely find better quality. It's been ""renovated"" but it's like that barely renovated look. (Fresh bed linens but wallpaper curling at the floor type of renovation!) The bathrooms were nice but my door would not stay shut unless slammed.  The rooms had VERY thin walls....do what you want with that information.   The customer service was decent, nothing crazy. The pricing was on point, I went through priceline and paid 159 for New Year's Eve. I wish I would have gone for another option, to be honest. One thing did stick out to me: my husband and I waited (LITERALLY) fifteen minutes for an elevator down. Not cool when your hungry and are wearing 5 inch heels. Overall, great for a weekend trip on a budget when you'll be staying little to no time in your hotel bad for a romantic splurge.",N
2743,"Probably the most COMFORTABLE hotel bed that I have ever slept in.  The overall hotel is modern, yet comfortable.  The service is attentive but not obsequious.  The only downside is the spa.  They are clearly still working out the kinks with the offerings.",N
2706,"I spend three days here for my birthday.This is a really wonderful place to be to just relax and enjoy the downtown location. The beds were incredible, nice clean clean white sheets, clean mattress, down comforters,nice plush pillows and wonderful window view, which by the way you have to request. I could barely get out of my KING size bed because it was so comfortable nor did I want to! :) The lights were wonderful you can dim and adjust the lights just how you want even in the bathroom! real plus for me. It's just such a luxury to have dimmed lights in the bathroom I'm mean simply amazing! staff is very friendly. I only gave three stars because of the food menu prices the hotel offers. Ridiculously high with 18% tax plus 3$ charge for room delivery, with all that you pay to stay  there it should at least be reasonable food prices. I mean how else would you get your food unless they deliver it to you????? so of course you would have to pay. With so many other restaurants in the area within walking distant you will definitely want to dine out!   Overall the stay was nice and relaxing",N
4088,"I think the location is a huge perk for this place.  Great access to the Mag Mile, Millennium Park, Navy Pier, beautiful views along the river of classic Chicago landmarks...Wrigley Building and Tribune Tower, etc. Our room was nicely appointed...contemporary and clean, plus they feature plasma TVs, and ipod alarm clock, so that ups the cool factor. We stayed in the West wing, which was a blessing because a convention was throwing a rager in the atrium, and from what other reviewers have said, Big Bar can get noisy as well.  If you stay here, I might recommend requesting a room in this wing.",N
1846,"After a conference in Chicago, I moved to the W to stay the weekend.  It was an o.k. choice.  It's a great location and the aestetics are very typical for a W hotel.   It's located in a historic building and they juxtapose that with modern design.  The lobby and Lobby Bar are nice with lots of  little niches for your group to have cocktails.  They also have the world's largest table lamps!   The rooms are small, but fine for Chicago.  And, the walls are a VERY thin.  I had to call security on our neighbors who were have ""Dance Party USA"" at 2 a.m.  But, the hotel sent someone up to talk to them right away and it stopped. All in all, the customer service and room were very nice.  We did have a problem when we requested movies for our room...a standard service.  They didn't have any of the four we asked for.  If they are going to offer a service, they need to be able to provide it.   I cashed in points to stay here and would stay here again.",N
1204,"Above average hotel stay for the following reasons. -Down comforter -nice toiletries (wish they were more eco-friendly though) -pool, and sauna -cushy bed down sides -cable tv channel selection.

2256,"My husband was in town for a 2week project and this was the ""recommended"" hotel by his customer base on its location.  He called the hotel to book the reservation and was routed to the 800 reservation desk.  We could get the room for less but ended up paying $40 more per night and was told so we would have free internet and free access to the gym.  When we showed up for our room and learned that there's a promotion going where you paid $25/night  on top of your regular room rate and you would get free internet, free access to the gym, free breakfast and free calls for the entire stay.  We felt we were mislead by the reservation desk and tried to talk to the front desk to add the breakfast to our package.  We were told the 800 reservation center is a third party company they use so whatever the deal we get from them has nothing to do with the hotel.  We were dumb founded by the remarks made by the front desk staff and felt although it is a decent hotel, we would not recommend to anyone.",N

It was a great start to am amazing night. I highly recommend this hotel. Thanks!,N
1023,"I agree, five stars. The staff was very friendly, professional and quick. They had the perfect recommendations for sightseeing, dining and drinking. Hangover cure breakfast @ 1 pm - the Temple Cafe was the right suggestion. The room was modern and sleek, with the most comfortable bed out of any hotel I have stayed at (and I travel for work plenty). Continental breakfast on every floor - thus allowing the guests to sneak out in pjamas, grab delicious fluffy croissants, and run away back to the room. The location was perfect - minutes from the CTA, right next to the river, and walking distance to many sights, Mag Mile, dinning and boozing. Yay Amalfi...thanks for the wonderful time.",N
2565,"Went there a couple of Saturday's ago.  The interior was nice, and even on such a hot night the air felt pretty cool inside. Bottle service sucks, and should be put away.  It just reinforces that while you may be making money, you really aren't the money, since you have to pay for a place to sit.  Conspicuous consumption has never been truly cool.  I don't think I'll ever give a place a review higher then 3 stars if I have to pay to sit down. It was crowded, but I would say the majority of people there were attending a black/white party in the back room.  If it wasn't for that party, I think it would have been empty (except for my friends and I of course).   (edit) Since there was not much else in regards to crowd, even though it was a weekend, I'm going with 2 stars.",N
810,"Have stayed here twice and had nothing but spectacular service. This hotel has a great swanky feel, but the price is just about right.

Even if you're not staying here, take a load off in the cool reception area and people watch.",N
5027,"Customer service was terrible.  The front desk staff of young girls seemed better suited as cocktail waitresses.  They were very unprofessional and first declined my credit card twice (because they entered the wrong exp. date).  They never reviewed the charges with me and our credit card called that they were putting through an extra $200 per night for incidentals as a deposit.  Then, when we paid $400 per night to stay during the Chicago Air & Water show, we were told the 7th floor balcony was closed even to guests unless you pay $25 per person.  After complaining to the manager, there was no follow up on this at all.   In the room our TV remote was broken as were the blinds covering the window; the A/C was loud and the room seemed musty and dirty.  They charge $14.95 for daily internet per device connecting.  People roam the lobby and front lawn with dogs, which just doesn't seem appropriate given the swanky lobby feel.  Surprisingly disappointing for a hip, higher end hotel chain.  Won't stay there again.",Y
439,"I stayed here for a night this past December. The room was OK, fairly clean and pretty spacious. I picked this hotel because of the price (one of the 'best deals' I could find for Chicago area hotel that didn't seem like a complete dump) and the somewhat decent reviews I found on the Internet. I was on the top floor (5th) with a decent view toward the city and McCormick convention center. The neighborhood is not the nicest but I walked around at night and felt fairly safe. There aren't really any restaurants or stores within walking distance. I did walk to a Walgreens and to Chinatown at night but it was quite the walk. Better off taking a cab or hopping on the ""L"" train around there (the train runs parallel to the street right in front of the hotel). The gym/workout room was OK. The Internet in the hotel didn't work several times during my 1 night stay. Nobody had any idea as to when it might be working again. Besides a restaurant and a bar, there is also a small coffee/sandwich place in the building but it was closed several times although the hours shown on the sign said it should've been open. There is also a small store and a salon. A word of advice....stay away from the bar in the hotel! I can't comment on the restaurant across the hallway but the bar (SL Sports Bar & Lounge) is a complete joke...if this place weren't located inside of a hotel, they'd be out of business in no time. I decided to eat there at night because it seemed convenient. Although 2 bartenders, the manger AND the owner were behind the bar, not one of them bothered greeting or even acknowledging me when I walked in or even after I was sitting at the bar for several minutes and the same happend with several customers who came in after me. To order something, it felt like customers had to either beg them for attention or get angry and cause a ruckus, despite the fact that there were 4 people working behind the bar and only about 12 customers in the place. The place really wasn't that busy and by no means trendy enough to have any kind of attitude towards its customers. It was a plain, no frills hotel bar. One lady next to me got so angry about the fact that she was continuously ignored by the employees, including the manager, that she asked to speak to the owner ""Tony,"" who then actually tried to weasel his way out of having to deal with her complaint by telling her he was not the owner, despite the fact that the bartenders had already pointed him out. What a joke...have some pride (or at least the slightest bit of business sense) and try to make things right. After he finally admitted to her that he was in fact the owner, he tried to play ""Mr. Smooth"" with her, asked what the problem was but, at the end of the conversation, still made no actual attempt to rectify the situation. The chicken sandwich I had ordered to take to the room with me sat on the bar counter for close to 10 minutes until I insisted that one of the bartenders check whether that was my order and so, naturally, it was cold by the time I got to the room to eat it. I didn't think you could screw up a simple grilled chicken sandwich but this place still managed to do it. It tasted like somebody had cooked it over a week ago and the fries weren't any better. The chicken breast was partially ""rubbery,"" partially dry and partially burned on the outside. Conclusion...you're better off eating a sandwich out of a vending machine than spending your money in this place.",N
1612,I think it's pretty great.,N
219,"Huge fan of this hotel!!  Does it have the biggest and best rooms I've ever stayed in?  No.  But what it does have is the best staff ever!!  Tom at the front desk was awesome!  I booked the hotel through Hotwire but because I am a Holiday Inn rewards member I got 2 upgrades...yes, that's right...2.   Parking is high but that goes with the territory.  Awesome location, we walked to Mag Mile and to dinner each night. I personally loved the decor, although I know it's not for everyone.  Shower had good pressure.  Beds were comfortable.   Will stay here again in a heartbeat!",N
1684,"Location! Location! Location! Finding a hotel in Chicago for labor day weekend was easy...finding a decent and convenient four star spot under $120 was somewhat of a challenge until we discovered Hotel Allegro. It's located in the perfect area in Chicago's Downtown Loop/Theater District-a block away from the CTA subway station, walkable to Millennium Park/Grant Park and a quick stroll to the Magnificent Mile. It's a cute hotel with it's own unique charm. The staff was GREAT! They were nice enough to let us check-in early and not leave us stranded....just 8 hours early at 7:00am! And even more helpful at 3:00am when we were in search of some late night grub- deep dish pizza delivered to our hotel room. Although the room/bathroom was only average and could use another renovation, it was fine for the weekend. They made up for it with their daily complimentary wine hour at 5pm, free in-room Wi-Fi, goose down comforters, fitness center (cardio equipment with TVs) and endless Aveda toiletries!",N
1093,"Just spent a few days here at a work conference.  I have traveled A LOT for work and have spent plenty of nights in some pretty bad places and some pretty good ones.  Although as far as you know I am making that up.  I am not.  I disgress. Stayed two nights here this past week and was very impressed with everything about the hotel.  Not only is the staff very friendly but they addressed any issues that came up with my stay immediately.  Since I am sure you are curious the two issues were (1) my keys didn't work one night when I came back to the room (they ran two new keys up to my floor while I waited) and (2) I needed something out of my car which I had valet parked.  They also brought it up to my room within 10-15 minutes of my request.  Very impressed. Rooms were clean, modern and very spacious.  Excellent views of the city (from the 23rd floor).  The hotel has a nice spa in the lower level of the hotel.  In addition the hotel is connected to Chicgao's ""pedway"" which is an underground tunnel system connecting man of the buildings to one another.  Thus, I was able to get Starbucks in the morning without having to go outside. The only downside to this hotel was the conference rooms.  As I mentioned I was here for a work conference.  The rooms were cold as hell.  Hmmm...not such a great analogy come to think of it.  Needless to say many people were wearing jackets etc during the conference to stay warm.  It was ridiculous especially since it is April and wasn't warm outside. The only other caution I have for you dear reader is that valet parking is $51/night which even for Chicago seems steep.  I would recommend not parking here if you can find an overnight ramp cheaper.",N
1748,"Wonderful hotel! Beautiful scenery, friendly staff, and free wine/ internet.",N
2099,My room had the awesome view being that the hotel is so high up. I think all the room has a view of the downtown chicago! Rock baby!,N
2606,"I went to the Victor Hotel for the first time for a birthday party otherwise I probably wouldn't ever have stepped foot in there.  We had a private room that was supposed to fit 50 and I doubt anymore than 30 could have if we tried.  Plus, it got really warm in the room so quite a few people ventured and stayed out of the room.  I don't think there would be any reason to go there not having a room honestly.  We didn't have to pay for the room but had to turn around and pay for it with the food and drink.  Champagne ranged from $90-1500 a bottle with other types of alcohol (vodka for example) started in the $200's.  A plate of mini-burgers and a full plate of cheese & fruit cost $30.  The service in the rooms was pretty good I thought, we had our personal server and she brought out all kinds of mixers for the vodka and made everyone their first drink (when it wasn't crowded).  The area kind of scared me walking up in the dark alone.  I got there early b/c I wasn't on the guest list but around 10:00, they were charging $20 to get in.  If you like techno music pounding in your brain, then this is the place for you.  The clientele was very eclectic and by the time I left at 12:30 the place was still more than half empty, lots of room to stand, no sitting and no line outside.",N
3660,"I had high tea with a group of girlfriends today. We were all extremely pleased with the service, food, tea, and atmosphere! The tea was very yummy. We devoured our tea sandwiches and our waiter brought us another plate! The scones, bread and petit fours were very tasty as well. There is also great people watching here!",N
615,"I wanted to steal the pillows.  The best pillows of any hotel I have stayed in to date.  I think they have a site where one can order them.  I have to check it out.   The service was excellent from every person I encountered in the hotel and even from the Einstein's bagel shop which is, oh so conveniently, located in the lobby. The room was clean, comfortable and spacious.  The bathroom was large and the shower provided instant hot water.  There was a nice window seat. Room service was prompt and the food was good.  Beware: the stuffed burger feeds two and will put you in a coma. I did not give all 5 stars, as I did not check out the gym,, the restaurant, etc. The room I had was one of those doubles that has a door leading to the next room: not sound proof.  So, I had to endure an argument of the couple next door.  I let them get it out, and it quieted down nicely.",N
3930,The problem with this hotel is that it is a piece of Americana that has gotten OLD in a country obsessed with NEW. I LOVED the charm of the hotel and would give 5 stars without a thought....EXCEPT hotel experiences always boil down to the bed. The Congress Plaza beds must be original to the building. I'm talking 6 inches with crazy springs and no box springs. Cheap mattresses thrown down on wooden slat platform beds just doesn't cut it. When they get new mattresses- I'll put every one of my out of town visitors here;) EVERYTHING else is great- I felt like I was at Daddy Warbuck's house but he was penny pinching on the bedding.,N
2558,"What a great spot!  I love the decor!  The waitstaff was nice (as they should be with drinks that pricey.)  It was a fantastic, good-looking crowd.  There was a total lack of pretense. It's close to the Fulton Lounge or after dinner on Randolph.",N
2532,"The Chicago Hilton is a fixture in Chicago, with a history almost as old as the city itself. As a resident of Chicago, we were looking for a fun place to celebrate the city for an evening. Although we got an excellent rate on this hotel vs. the rates on their website, they want to nickel and dime you like crazy once you get there. Touting themselves as ""pet friendly"", they charge a $75 NON REFUNDABLE pet fee. Internet access was $25 per day. Even the bottled water that was sitting out on the desk (not in the mini bar) was $6.00. Add on overnight parking for $43, and you're racking up quite a tab for a supposedly 4-star place. The bathroom was tiny, the faucet dripped, and there were fingerprints on the window, even water left in the ice bucket. I am sure this was a grand place in its day, but that day has passed. I was really disappointed when I bid on a hotel for next month and came up with the same place. I can only hope that our experience is better this time, since we can't really do anything about the choice that price line returned. I can say that this is a two and a half to three star place at the very best, and would not suggest it at anywhere close to full price.",N
948,A lot of older relatives and the like stay here when they come to town.  It's a great location and amazing price considering.  They've all been very happy with it and keep going back.,N
2157,"This review is meant to serve as a warning: if you check in to the Intercontinental, and they try to give you a room on the 9th floor, historic tower, just turn around and leave. Now, the qualification: We checked in to the Intercontinental because our friend was having her wedding there, and  we didn't want to have to drive back home after a late night drinking. Plus, I've always wanted to stay there. First bad thing: the front desk gentleman was very pushy about selling their ""Ambassador"" program for $150. I told him we were short on time and needed to be off in a hurry. He actually held our room key in the air out of our grasp while he continued to rattle on for five minutes about the Ambassador program and how he really thought it would be a good idea for us to go ahead and sign up so we'd get a free upgrade to a suite. We were three minutes late to the wedding and had to watch the procession from the rear. So, we put that behind us and enjoyed a nice reception in the Intercontinental ballroom. Nobody can say the hotel isn't beautiful inside. Going back to our room at 11:45 we noticed that the room's  windows overlooked a brick wall - the new tower next door. OK, so no view. I suppose that a view of Michigan avenue runs an extra $100 at least. Fair enough. But the other problem quickly became  apparent - rooms on the 9th floor have a ballroom directly below them. We were able to heard the band talking between numbers, as well as the loud, thumping music. And I mean it was loud. Not acceptable. After a little run-around trying to get a manager, we were offered $100 off. Nope. They couldn't tell us when the music would stop. Finally, begrudgingly they offered to refund our money and let us go home since there were absolutely no rooms available to move us to. (However, I bet if I forked over the $150 for the Ambassador program., a suite upgrade would have magically appeared...) So in the end we would up driving back home, tired and hung over. Shame on us for trying to go to sleep in peace at 11:45pm... Two stars because, come on, this is the Intercontinental Michigan Ave. They should have their shit together and not make me feel that I am some lousy peon who gets the third-class room in steerage because I don't have status. The only nice thing they did was refund the parking fee as well (a $53 charge, mind you), so free parking downtown isn't all bad...",N
5490,"The Sutton Place is fabulous! My husband and I stayed there the day after our wedding and loved it! I have no idea what anyone is taking about with the bathrooms being outdated. The bathroom was very nice. Huge soaking tub and separate shower. In fact, I think the bathroom was bigger than some of the hotel rooms we had on our honeymoon in Italy. Okay, well not really, but it felt like it. My only complaints are that the place was a bit cold and the people at the front desk were less than friendly, but those are two things I am more than willing to deal with.",N
5211,"I have been to Chicago a few times for business, and I have stayed here the last 2 times. I am very pleased with the ammenities this Hotel comes with, and how nice the rooms are. The beds are very comfortable and they even have comforters instead of the basic stiff quilts that are provided at most Hotels.",Y
1440,Omni Hotel was the site of our committee meeting. We have volunteers fly in from across the US so my review is not only of the meeting room space and service but also on the hotel rooms...or at least mine. The Meeting Space: Just fine as far as meeting rooms go. It was clean. The A/V peeps were available to help us with any issues we were having (which not many). The space was set up bright and early every morning for our meetings. The food for the meetings was pretty decent. You know how hotel meeting food can be. They put on quite the spread for our lunch service and we were quite pleased. The banquet and meetings staff were extremely helpful and even loaded up our A/V equipment and other valuables to be locked up with security so we didn't have to lug it back to our rooms. They took care of it all for us without a hitch! The Hotel: Omni is a very nice hotel. It's in a great location for a meeting or a weekend away. It's a little confusing though as the lobby is on the third floor and you have to take different elevators to get to the lobby or meeting spaces vs. the elevators for the rooms. I'm not a fan of this set up but it's not the end of the end of the world or anything.   The Rooms: This is an all suites hotel. I appreciate having a separate living area. My room was clean. The bed was comfortable. The room itself was spacious and they have a nice turn down service. Our volunteers were quite happy with the rooms as well. I would not hesitate to stay here on my own accord and I would most definitely book another meeting here. Some of our volunteers stayed the weekend after our meeting was over to enjoy what Chicago has to offers. It's location is ideal for the out of towner and the service you'll receive is top notch.,N
2977,"The Sheraton Chicago is a great hotel. It's in a great location on the Chicago River blocks away from Navy Pier, Michigan Ave, CTA stations, Grant Park, and much more. You walk in and are greeted to an impressive, expansive lobby. Heading upstairs, we arrived in a clean, updated hotel room. There was a HD LCD TV! On top of that, there was a great view down the Chicago River towards the new Trump Tower. The only complaint I had was the plumbing, which is the reason this is a 4 star review and not a 5 star review. Upon using the bathroom, the sink wouldn't drain and the toilet was acting strange. But once we got the staff up there, everything went smoothly from there on. Back to the lobby. We were told upon check in about the Microsoft Surface tables in the lobby. There are two of them. We were told that the Sheraton Chicago was one of five hotels to have them in the country. I can tell you, they're pretty much awesome, and I don't even like Microsoft. The interface is a little clunky, but it's pretty cool to listen to their catalog of music and discover a little bit about what to do in the city of Chicago on a touchscreen computer built into a coffee table! Be warned though, it wasn't until just before we left that I got to try one out. They're extremely popular. Moving on, there are five restaurants/bars in the hotel, including Shula's Steakhouse and the Java Bar, which serves Starbucks. Shula's has an excellent buffet. For $20, you can have an awesome selection of food, ranging from smoked salmon to bagels to deconstructed parfaits to pastries to pancakes to omelets and everything in between. The steakhouse has a great atmosphere too, although I never had lunch or dinner there. Also, the staff is very friendly and helpful and took care of everything we needed. Overall, if you're looking for a great hotel to stay at in Chicago at a moderate price, the Sheraton is what you're looking for.",N
3902,"I'm sorry but for the price this hotel is an EPIC FAIL on every level.  The rooms smell, I tried two different ones and went for the paint smell over the old furnace smell.  The closet doors did not work.  The lobby feels OLD and TIRED.  I love classic architecture and love some older hotels, but older hotels require maintenance.  This one doesn't cut it. No wireless internet in the room - remember this is a Conference Center Hotel, so it was designed for business travelers.  Seriously I picked up the wireless from across the street at the Travelodge.   I don't know what to say other than do NOT stay here, if your conference is here, stay somewhere else and come for the conference.  The website is very mis-leading.  I have stayed at hotels all over the US and the world, for price performance this is one of the worst ever, not the worst hotel, but for the price and given there are better deals in Chicago.",N
3026,"If you are a hot young thing from the suburbs on the make with no need for good bar service, try the lounge! If you are an adult who travels quite a bit and resents paying a substantial chunk of money to be treated like crap by the staff, try another hotel!",N

Just one night away from the stressors of life with a comfy bed and a down comforter that I don't have to wash. Floor to ceiling windows overlooking the night city skyline, so gorg. Even my boyfriend approved of mini-bar purchases, he was having such a relaxing time. One complaint, they don't have HBO, so we settled on Showtime since the MMA fights were on and boyfriend loves that. Shower was amazing, staff was very friendly and helpful. I would recommend to anyone who is staying in the city for a weekend. You'll enjoy the trendy atmosphere which isn't snobbish.",N
5482,Nice hotel although the rooms are a little cold. The service was good and the rooms are a decent size. 5 stars for the breakfast joint across the street and the doormen that will go out to the corner in blizzard conditions to hail you a cab. Also every room has a killer tub which helps with the whole hangover process.,N
730,"Stayed at Westin Michigan Avenue on my recent visit to Chicago. This hotel is decent, but certainly not great. It is conveniently located on Michigan and Delaware. Right in the Magnificent Mile area and across the street from the John Hancock Center. In terms of location the hotel is great. However, I felt that the hotel was a little dated. It is not as nice as other Westin locations I have visited. Our room did not even have the dual shower heads which Westin is known for. I was also a little disappointed in the service. We had arrived late Friday night and they only had one person working the front desk. Being a SPG Gold Preferred Guest I stood in the line designated for such members. However, the employee working the front desk decided to help other guests prior to me. I'm not even complaining about not getting preferential treatment. They walked in after me. We he finally decided to help me, he wasn't every enthusiastic about his job. Once checked in the employee did not even properly direct me to my room. I had to go back and ask where the elevators were. That's not the way to treat a customer, especially a loyal one! My stay wasn't all that bad. I'd say my initial interaction at checkin is the basis for my rating.",N
4125,"My wife's employer had their annual party at this hotel last night.  Everything was great with the venue.  The service, the food, the views, and bartenders.   We were given a special rate by the hotel, but we didn't take advantage of that since I knew the hotel was available via Priceline.",N
5193,"Awesome hotel!!!  Great location and great rooms!  The views were amazing!  I went there for a meeting in the hotel and we stayed there as well.  All of my 9 colleageus from across the nation had a wonderful time as well and kept on complimenting the hotel in our meetings.  The meeting rooms have great views as well if that is relevant.  On top of all this I requested for a firm pillow because of a bad neck and it was the best pillow I have ever slept on.  I called the executive houskeeper so that I could get the info on the manufacturer and he said ""I'm glad you liked and just keep it!!!""  He gave me the pillow for free....now who does that!.Only downside to the hotel is the elevators are a little slow.Overall just a wonderful experience!",Y
4135,"I enjoyed my stay here (September 2011). The view from our room was jaw dropping. It was right across the street from the river and Magnificent Mile. So many sites and sounds of Chicago right at my fingertips. The parking was a bit hard to find and expensive, but other than that, no other complaints. Oh yeah, SUPER COMFORTABLE bed! Also, great curtains that kept the room nice and dark to help me sleep in. Oh, I think the price was around $125 a night for Sunday-Tuesday.",N

It is noisy from the hospital, but it's downtown I expect noise. Big PEEVE was that they charge a dollar a minute for LOCAL calls. Really? I expect more in a four star. I'm not going to use my cell phone to call and make ticket reservations locally.",N

It was only 10pm or so and there was no one else down there so it was like our own spot!

4951,"We found Avenue hotel on a bargain hotel website for a spur-of-the moment trip to Chicago. We found it to be within walking distance of the Magnificent Mile and a very good rate, so we decided to go for it. Normally we can't afford a decent hotel within the city, but I guess we got lucky. When we arrived at the Avenue hotel we loved the sophisticated but not stuffy decor and we were warmly greeted with a smile and a warm welcome from the doorman, who quickly assisted us with our luggage.  Our room was very clean and well-kept. My husband thought it was a bit small, but in the city, that's to be expected.  I found it to be comfortable and pleasant.  I was excited to try the bed since it seemed that is what every other review mentioned and we were not disappointed at all!  The best darn night of sleep ever.  When staying at the Avenue Hotel you are in walking distance of some really great restaurants and shopping, no need to have a car while staying here. The hotel overall was very impressive, especially for the bargain we got it for.  All in all, I would definitely stay at the Avenue Hotel when visiting Chicago, bargain or no bargain",Y
135,"Historic building with great employees, stellar location, and hard to beat price. 3.75 stars Cost to worth it ratio: 5 (we got this room for an average of ~$130/night including taxes! Four Seasons a few steps away goes for quadruple that.) Highlights: - Location: half a block from the famous Michigan Ave, across the street from Bloomingdale's on one side and the Hancock Tower on the other. Walking distance to most everything and short cab ride to Lincoln Park area. - Service: fantastic. After being checked in, they called a few minutes after we got settled to check how everything was. When we had to take the service elevator, we didn't complain but they apologized and let us take the hotel town car to dinner on them. :-) - Amenities: gym, 24 hr room service, restaurant/bar, wine shop, and mini bar. - Historic: building's been around forever--they have a 3 page story of it in the hotel's info binder. Midlights: - Atmosphere: rooms and lobby isn't anything special, but they're fine. Lowlights: - Only had 2 queen bed room when we checked in - 1 of 2 elevators they had was out the whole time. There are several floors, so that slowed things down quite a bit at times. On the place alone I might not be too impressed, but the price, service and location bumps it up a few notches so I'd consider staying here again.",N
2812,"Quite nice.  We stayed for a night of Christmas lights on Michigan Ave and the thanksgiving parade.  Someone forgot to clean a sink out so that was disturbing.  Beds not great comfort wise..a little to soft for my taste. City view is nice but no way to block out the city view to sleep, a set of interior curtains would help here. Staff was rude at check in.  Not mean, just not nice.",N
2287,"The Marriott had some really great plusses, especially location-wise, but I just wasn't a huge fan given these reasons: 1) Rooms were small with full sized beds. 2) I hated the fact they had two sets elevators - one that went to the higher floors and another set that went from 1-28. I'm sure there is an excellent logistical reason for why they did that, but it was a pain if we wanted to visit other people in our party. 3) No mini-fridge in OUR room at least (we found others had mini-fridges in their rooms) but their rooms had one bed as opposed to two? Perhaps that was the difference? 4) Small bathrooms. Not to mention, our toilet kept running the entire night. 5) We had luke-warm water the last morning we were there. 6) SMALL pool with a smaller fitness center (but the weight room was located in a different location which was quite spacious). Though all in all, the Marriott was a pretty nice place to stay. They had a real Starbucks in their lobby (but its not 24 hour). Free wifi on the 2nd floors and lobby. The food offered in the hotel was also REALLY good. We had a banquet there and the food was exceptional. They utilize farm fresh products and even have beehives on the roof, producing their own honey! Not to mention, the LOCATION was absolutely amazing. We were within walking distance of the art institute of chicago, the bean, as well other great Chicago attractions (ahem the food?!).",N
2672,"Fun hotel, lots of modern furniture, compact, bright, and comfortable. Having David Burke's Primehouse on the bottom floor, with its clubby bar and NY steakhouse feel is a plus. If your company is too cheap to spring for an offsite, try one here in one of their suites. Catering is good too! Haven't stayed here, just attended a meeting, so the four stars does not reflect the quality of the bed.",N
4796,I love this place....when you first walk in I feel like I just took a vacation and went to Miami. The Interior Design of this place was well thought out and inspiring to the creative eye. I went to have drinks with some friends but ended up eating there because the small plates they offer looked so good and taste even better. The wine list they have is a little different from what one might be use to but can be considered a refreshing change.,Y

No locks on doors, no parking, no air conditioning, no way!

They said there was not one in the hotel, when my husband explained the situation, they said they would see what they could do. Shortly after making the phone call, a staff member showed up to our door carrying a microwave which he left in our room for us. I've never experienced such a thing and felt so grateful!",N

5388,"This hotel is 2 doors from the train, and across the street from a 24-hour pancake house that is very popular.  The staff is very helpful.  The rooms are small but clean.  It is an european botique style hotel--small, but big on location and service.   I will definitely be returning",Y
3354,"I always laugh when people choose to stay at the cheapest hotel in a given part of a major city and then write a terrible review when it's not as nice as the other, more expensive hotels.  Do you really think it's cheaper because the owner of the Essex Inn is just a really nice person who doesn't want to make as much money as everyone else? To be frank, the Essex is not terrible, nor is it fantastic.  My room was clean, but small.  If you require a safe place to sleep, the Essex will work.  If you need much more than that, think about spending a little bit more money and finding a different hotel.",N
1766,"A total steal.  In February Kimpton offered $44 off best rate rooms to celebrate the man himself, Obama.  Our room totaled $103/night and despite the reviews, I thought it was spacious enough for a weekend with one other person.  The bathroom was tiny yes, and you can hear *everything* going on in there from the bedroom but hey, it happens.   Aveda Rosemary Mint shampoo and conditioner + bath soup and face bar, beautiful and cozy linens and a very attentive staff as I've come to expect from Kimpton!   Great location -- walking distance to Intelligentsia and a few other key spots, and quiet on the higher floors.  I'll definitely be back if there's another deal!   Otherwise, I'm rather anxious to try the other Kimpton spaces in Chicago.",N
4373,"This hotel is absolutely fantastic! In every possible way. Despite the fact that the main lobby was closed due to the fact that they were completely stripping it and renovating it, I still had an amazing, two-night stay there with my father, my cousins and their 2 dogs. Yep, dogs. They are pet friendly there... The rooms are gorgeous and the beds extremely comfortable. The carpet is dark in the bedrooms which is awesome because it absorbs the light although the marble floors in the bathrooms are really, really cold. The hallways air conditioned to perfection and the elevators are numerous... I counted 11 when I was there two weeks ago. Absolutely nuts, but in a good way. The concierge staff is friendly and the bar is well stocked. Speaking of the bar, the sitting area and the entire bar room is breathtakingly beautiful. Absolutely gorgeous! I cannot wait to return to Chicago and hopefully stay there in the future. This is one of America's fine hotels. And it shows.",N
1585,"I'll keep this short.  The location is good, the rooms are a mixed bag, and the elevators add ten minutes to any trip outside your room.  Additional annoyances are the cleaning personnel knocking on my door at 8am, and the bathtub barely draining.  Not a good value.",N
3577,"This review is specifically for The Palm Court at the Drake Hotel.  The cherubs around the fountain, the live entertainment and elegant ""Powder Room"" are just a few examples of how a classic, elegant old hotel continues its historic heritage. It seems that the Saturday night I was there is the ballroom/social dancing night.  It was wonderful to see the women in their pretty floral dresses and heels, while the men were decked in their jackets. One gentleman brought his dancing shoes in a separate bag, changed from brown and black deck shoes into glossy black dress shoes.  In an instant, he was up and out on the dance floor with a woman - where she came from, I haven't a clue - and was gliding his way around the floor.   It is a civilized evening.  The songstress croons soulfully and the band plays silky, sensual music.  Those who happen to stumble on this event are largely unaware of what is taking place and try to blend in with the regulars.  They take a few brave chances with their dance steps, but soon realize they are neophytes. Perhaps this venue was one of the predecessors to the ""So You Think You Can Dance"" idea!  The dancing moves were amazing! And the ""Powder Room!""  Unlike anything I've ever seen.  I'm a 50-something from Hawaii and have traveled around the world, but I've not been in a magnificent, elegant ladies room such as this.  The sign above the doorway actually says ""Powder Room"" - not ""Women"" or ""Ladies"" or anything else. Each stall is exquisitely decorated and there are even plush velveteen footstools to sit on.  There is even a sink in each stall.  Large handtowels and tissues are generously provided. I love having an after-dinner drink here.  I enjoy people-watching and also use the tie to reflect on my day spent in Chicago.",N
5414,"3 friends and I stayed at this hotel during a recent trip to see a few cubs game.  I was very happy with the choice.Outstanding location.  The best part of the city unless you're here on business in which case something in (or closer to) the loop would be better.  This hotel is also 5 blocks from the red line, which goes straight to wrigley field.I see no downsides to this hotel.  I got a pretty good rate by prepaying via ""expedia.com"".I'd stay again.",Y
2201,"The Intercontinental feels like home to me, considering (that aside from the Convention Center), I've spent the majority of my 72 hours here. The stinging pain of 7 am debriefings is palliated slightly by breakfasts in the majestic Moorish ballroom, with its view of the city skyline. Although my boss will freak at my $35 room service tab for a glass of wine and French onion soup, it was served with Midwestern hospitality (pronounced with a hard ""a""). Personally, I love hotels!  Heaven is ordering room service and watching The Sopranos. I deducted a star only because the water pressure is slighly weak and the loud a/c, which interferes with sleep.",N
4451,"Since the recent major renovation project, Palmer House has looked even more phenomenal than before. Very classy and decadent in it's interior decor, it's a mix of the old with the new. Any personality can take light of the intimacy and nostalgia the lobby brings. A competent bar and restaurant awaits you on both sides of the main lobby, with reception very close by, and an excellent concierge service. Room service will take a toll on your wallet, but at a place like this - you shouldn't be at all surprised. The room rates and size vary according to how much you can pay, so expect to show some franklins if you wish to accommodate a large number of individuals to stay. This definitely isn't a motel six where you can cram a family of five for 80 bucks. My only gripe with the hotel is how the rooms are laid out. It can be a bit of a hassle to reach your final destination - your room. You'd think it was enough to fly, go through security checks, possibly experience the dreaded and inconsistent el from either O'Hare or Midway... but no. It doesn't end when you pick up your room keys. Let's just say I wouldn't want to have a serial killer after me. I'd totally get lost. Overall, an excellent hotel with great customer service, very convenient location (practically in the heart of downtown), and the historical landmark that it is to boot.",N
1163,"It's nothing fancy.  But it's a place to hang your hat while you're in Chicago.  It has free parking, which is huge for out-of-town guests ... especially in this neighborhood (VERY touristy).  The rooms are pretty small, but I've found that for my unassuming family, they don't need The Drake or The Peninsula to make them feel good about themselves.  They'd rather spend the money they save & spend it on their darling daughter (hi ... that's me). Also, yeah, Pizzeria Ora is a heavenly alternative to the big ticket Chicago-style pizza places nearby & it's IN THE BUILDING.  No wait, equally as good 'za, & have I mentioned it's IN THE BUILDING?  Which, if anyone who has every survived a Chicago blizzard knows is HUGE.  Plus, I believe that when you stay there, you get free drink tickets to the bar.  Score!",N
1233,"Rooms were nice and fancy but they charged for every tiny thing.  We were charged $10 for wifi per device, not per room and this was not stated clearly in the instructions.  Really primitive to be using IP address detection instead of user id/password.  Parking was $30 which was reasonable.",N
2592,"Went here for a fashion show last weekend. It was pretty late but when it is all said and done I did have a great time, so I would definitely go back. Drinks were about 8 a piece but they were goooood! There was a mandatory coat check when I was there for 3 dollars. The crowd was slightly ghetto though. There were a bunch of Jersey Shore want to be's there and a fight almost ensued in the bathroom over some stupid, petty crap. I managed to stay out of it though. Overall, a fun time. Cool space too.",N
4952,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for one night and had a great experience. We live in Chicago and occasionally enjoy getting away for a night or two in a hotel downtown. I would consider the Avenue Hotel a chique boutique hotel.  It was modern, and yet extremely comfortable not to mention in an excellent location that is walking distance to everything important like shopping, restaurants, bars etc. The staff was very friendly and gave us an incredible room with a view of the city. No matter how long you live here you never get tired of the skyline at night.  I would definitely recommend coming here!",Y

As I was flying out the door, a third little guy shouted, ""Go back to suburbia!""  Good times.",N

We were provided with a full (open) bar, awesome service (the servers were constantly refilling our wine/champagne, swarming us with hors d'oeuvres, etc), luxe accommodations and an amazing setting. The lounge/ballrooms were tastefully trendy. They have complimentary baskets full of green apples. Bathrooms were labeled as ""WC"" and I got instant flashbacks of Italia. I heart Italia. Anyway, the food, service, ambience, EVERYTHING the W provided during, before and following the reception blew me away. Dub, you are fabulous!",N
803,"I've stayed at this hotel a couple of different times for short stays.  It's a nice spot on Michigan Ave and close to shopping, food, etc.  The gym is very small for this size of hotel, but works.

Um, yeah the hotel workers have been on strike for FIVE years. The owners of the Congress are the only ones in the entire city who will not negotiate w/ the union. That's effed up. But I didn't know that when I booked this super cheap hotel on Michigan Ave for a conference recently. For its location and size, you can tell that the Congress must have been nice in its heyday...now it is pretty dilapidated and has a very strong, persistent Lysol smell. The rooms are pretty minimal and the beds...well, let's just say that you can tell how old they are by how small the double bed size is. Not too much you can even say about service...this place is like a ghost town.  At least it's clean and conveniently located hear Grant Park, the Art Institute, Millennium Park, etc. But even for how cheap it was, I still feel guilt for crossing the picket line (which they still walk EVERY DAY). And that's just not worth it.",N

1479,"Location alone knocks it up a star.  Right smack in the middle of the city and we walked to everything from Millenium Park to Navy Pier to the Hancock Tower and surrounding shops.  (We logged 30 miles walking those few days!)  The bed is super comfy which is such a rarity when we travel.  I always have a wrenched back whether we stay in a hotel or private residence so it was nice to wake up refreshed.  Jackie at the front desk was nice as were the valets and one particular bellman.  Some of the other front desk staff could take some cues from them.  Check in was super fast and we didn't even do the online check in.   The cons:  We wondered why housekeeping had it cranked up to 84 in there when we checked in and we soon found out why.  It was not only cold outside but cold in the bedroom as well.  The headboard is part of this huge uninsulated box that feels like wind is whipping up into it and when it's 20 degrees outside with wind gusts, that makes for some teeth chattering when trying to get some sleep.  I froze the whole time and we had to put the thin extra blanket against the headboard in a vain attempt for relief.  Between the vent directly above the toilet that connects you to your neighbor so you can hear *everything* and they can hear you too (good luck doing #2 without having a complex- one dude would whistle when we went into to bathroom to let us know he was in there. *rolling eyes*) and the adjoining doors between rooms with your other neighbor, I hope you don't value privacy!  We heard every word both neighbors said any time we were in the room so in an attempt to get decent sleep we'd close all of the doors leading to the bedroom.  The french doors and the really loud pocket door to the bathroom that would bang against the wall with every step you took regardless of where you were in the suite.  We had to fold up a paper and pad the bottom of the door.  At one point two different nights we thought someone was in our room but it was the neighbors talking.  FYI- there is a hospital a block across the street so you will hear sirens all day long (but you shouldn't be in your room that much if you're there for pleasure) but at night it's surprisingly quiet for being right on Michigan Ave.  (This could also be because it was 10 degrees at night when we were there)  You also need to close the door to the living room when using the power button in the bedroom or you will be turning on both TV's in the suite not just the one in the room you're in from the waves bouncing around somewhere. All in all, we'd likely stay there again if we couldn't find comparable within 2 blocks or so just because of the location but improving some of those things would be a surefire way to get our repeat business. Before you go, sign up for their free Omni Select Guest program and you'll get free wifi in your room instead of a $10 daily charge.  You'll also get 2 complimentary beverages per person for up to 2 people in the morning.  We got real used to hot cocoa and OJ for breakfast.  They were always right on time.  They also give you these weird little shots of some kind of smoothie that my hubby loved but I thought smelled like clay so I wasn't touchin' that stuff!  So the free program was MORE than worth it!  We also got the parking included package which I think runs between $179-$229 at the time of reviewing depending on the time of year you book.  (We paid the high end because we were there at Christmas)  It was really nice to not have to worry about self parking and we only used the car one time while there and all was well with the car.  No extra miles put on the car ala Ferris Bueller!",N
1540,"I'm not picky about hotels/motels--I've seen my share of holes punched through walls, leaky ceilings, the creative use of duct tape on a front door to make one feel especially secure at night--so when we were planning a trip to Chicago, I was happy to look in the HoJo/Travelodge/maybe-questionable-but-cheap range. And then my sweetheart found some kind of crazy Internet deal for three of us to stay at Hotel 71 for about $80-$90, making my mind boggle when I saw on their Web site that the going range is somewhere in the $200-$250s. Yay. It's huge and modern and the lobby helps you instantly forget the grody motels of travels past--there's art here! And a fireplace! And people at the desk smiling at you, waiting to help! We didn't have any of the mentioned problems re: lackluster desk attendants or elevator slowness, and we were charmed by the size of our room (you could do several cartwheels in both the room and the bathroom!--it was a corner room. Maybe that helped?), quality of the beds, and view. And they have room service that delightfully includes bread pudding ($5!) and sundaes ($6!) that we never got around to ordering. But just knowing it was down there if we wanted it made me sleep a little more sweetly. While there were a few minor bummers (no vent in the bathroom (three people taking showers in quick succession makes things awful steamy), $43 a night valet parking (I know it's the going rate but it bums me out all the same) ), the location and view and overall niceness of the place/lack of duct tape more than made up for it.",N
2566,"Victor is always having different events and different crowds. I wouldn't recommend showing up at random. They do get some really great events and promotions though and the space is beautiful. When you do go, just make sure you get your drinks from the guy bartenders. Much like other venues and clubs, Victor like to put cute girls behind the bar that look good but give really slow service. Last time I was there there were two guys and a pretty blonde. The blonde wasn't ""bad"" so to speak, but the guy bartenders were clearly faster. At least the owners are smart enough to have just one cute slow chick instead of an entire staff of them. Usually parking on the street isn't to hard to find, however they do offer valet service on the busy nights that I have been there.",N
2784,"A wee bit of an oops or two but we LOVED LOVED LOVED this place (is it clear we loved this place :-) ! Hubby and I just returned today from a weekend stay at The James. This place is centrally located just off of Michigan Avenue on Ontario Street and if you look up ""Swanky"" in the dictionary, I'm fairly sure you will find The James featured. Everyone and I mean everyone from the Valet parking staff to front desk professionals were out of their minds friendly and helpful, which is refreshing! We had a room on the 16th floor with a great view of Chicago life below but when we arrived our keys didn't work in our room. A very helpful housekeeper saved the day by immediately calling a supervisor who let us in the room and within 5 minutes we had our keys with numerous apologies.  No cheap room amenities here, Keihl's products galore! Friday night we dined at David Burke's Steakhouse on site which was divine. Dry aged steak was the best I have ever had, martini's reasonable priced and deliciious! Saturday after breakfast at nearby Grand Lux Cafe which I would highly recommend we spent the day shopping on Michigan Avenue, awesome shops including Crate & Barr ell and Tiffany & Co within close walking distance of The James. We arrived back t our room around 3pm and were a bit disappointed that our room had not yet been serviced by housekeeping. Called the front though and immediately got fresh towels and we were happy and when we came back from dinner our room was thoroughly cleaned with their nightly turn down service and cookies, ice bucket filled, dimly lit lights and music playing. It does not get any better than this. We will most definitely absolutely hale yes be returning to The James for another Chi town visit soon!!!",N
2246,"Loved, loved, LOVED our stay!  We are Ambassador members, so we expected a lot from the get-go, but the Intercontinental went well above and beyond.  The location is stellar, of course.  Check in was perfectly smooth, we got a nice upgrade to a bigger room in the historic tower (which meant we had a 27th floor view of the beautiful city), and we were treated to the news that internet would be free for our whole stay.  Hooray!  Housekeeping was great, and I really loved the bath products they provided.  One day, we were chillin' in the room and heard a knock on the door.  Avon calling?  Nope, it was a complimentary bottle of wine (I suspect because we had been having issues with our A/C, which they fixed quickly).  Another night, we returned to our room to find a plate of chocolates and two snifters with Bailey's.  I ordered room service at 4 AM just so they could heat up my pre-marathon food, and they had me ready to go in under 15 minutes.  The only minor glitch was a somewhat inattentive server at the bar during our last night.  I was really sad to leave the Intercontinental - can't wait to go back and stay again!",N
5276,"Indeed all the negative reviews below are correct. I was always skeptical about reviews, but this is the first one I am writing! I HAVE to tell others not to come to this place! I stayed on 2-star hotels before and my expectations were as such. But this one was atrocious! The carpet was so old it is paper-thin in places and holes are about to show up. All the color was gone. The window curtain was broken on one side with a corner hanging down and some metal sticking out. There wall paper was peeling in the bathroom and some wires were visible too. The room was heavily parfumed (I guess it would stink otherwise) I could not breath. I left after I checked in and got another hotel, forget the money I lost. I felt like I was in a hotel in a third world country like Uzbekistan.",Y
1563,"Seriously someone needs to smack the hell out of me for forgetting to share my/our experience here. My memory really sucks! Okay so I booked a last minute room here for a getaway weekend with my guy during March I believe ( ..) (.. ) I forget which month and am too lazy to go and pull up my statement to see......so ANY-way, lol. I got here on a Friday afternoon and much to my surprise the Hotel was actually awaiting my arrival - many hotels I have been to here have always had me waiting for my room to be ""ready."" It was clean and very contemporary yet dark in the lobby. The bellhop was awesome although he gave me a heads up on the slow elevators I was extremely shocked to wait literally 8 minutes for the ONE elevator to SLLLLOOOWWWWLLYYY come down to take us up to the room. The elevator itself took away alot of our motivation out that weekend when deciding where and when we were going anywhere. The room, checking in everything was as pictured however I did for some odd reason think that paying 249.00 a night would have gotten me a little more square footage especially since I upgraded the room to a River View. It really made me wonder what a ""normal"" room size was. The best was the view and the bathroom! I loved it. However by Saturday morning we were callling the front desk thirty times about housekeeping coming to atleast remake the beds and bring tissue to the room! I mean we left that morning at 9:00am and came back at 7:00pm to find our room just as we had left it and without any TISSUE! do you know how frustrating it is to have your body wait for tissue! Although the experience wasn't as great as I wished it would have been considering the very large bill I had to flip, there were little things like the location, valet/parking and view  that earned the stars Edit**** I forgot the convenient bar downstairs in the lounge area....its an hotel employee but they have all the alcohol you can take, you can drink in the lounge and watch the flat screen or take the drinks up to your room! One more star for the alcohol!",N
4049,"Still enjoy the ambiance of this busy hotel.  Checked in on a holiday weekend.  Was headed to a wedding and only had 1 hour when the desk clerk said there would be a wait to check in our room - apparently when you book with priceline the website automatically books for double occupancy, in a 2 bed room.  I asked if a single bed was available and got checked into a King room immediately.  Crisis averted.  Manager was very friendly. Also really like the express check-in/check-out, just swipe your card you used to reserve, punch a few buttons and presto - room keys pop out or your bill is printed.  No waiting in line. Considering how many people were here this past stay, the hotel remained clean and in stock of sundries and snacks.  And you could still get a cab quickly, now that's amazing!",N
4053,"I'm updating this based on the customer service experience we've had since last staying at the hotel.  We're back in Chicago this weekend, and I was thrilled that we were able to book at the Hyatt Regency again! I feel like this hotel really has social marketing down - follow them on Twitter or ""like"" them on Facebook and it opens up a new world of communication.  They're responsive, offer specials on parking and free wi-fi, even drink specials at the bar.  It kind of made my day when I ""checked in"" on Yelp and got a welcome message back through Twitter!   I'm looking forward to our stay this weekend, and the Hyatt Regency is quickly becoming my hotel of choice when I'm in the Windy City.",N
5855,"Sutton Place is a very elegant hotel. The room and staff were excellent.  Room service did a spectacular job cleaning the room while I was away. The bed was a little harder than expected, but still comfortable. If I'm ever in the area again, this would be the hotel I would stay at.",Y
3530,"You can definitely tell the Avenue was renovated.  The elevators, ceilings, walls, and general structure looked pretty old... but whoever manages the property tries really hard to keep the decor modern enough to hide the building's age.   Our room was a suite and had very trendy decor and furnishings.  It even came complete with two matching zebra-printed robes.  The bedroom was large and had a comfortable king bed, a great view of downtown Chicago, and a flat panel TV.  The living room area had a pull out couch, a flat panel TV, an i-home deck, and a bar area.  The staff was always quick to bring towels, bring wine glasses, or assist with luggage as needed.  I also enjoyed the fact that it was a quick walk or taxi ride to the nearest malls, Walgreens, or bars. The only negative thing I could really think of was that the fitness center was pretty weak.  There were like 3 treadmills and 1 didn't work.  They only had a couple other pieces of equipment in there.  It was really bare.   If I ever felt like dealing with the snow and wind of Chi-town again, I wouldn't mind at all booking a room at the Avenue Hotel.",N

3713,"Gorgeous hotel. I work for a wedding planning company and have the same exact review as Neha K. We have worked a handful of weddings at ritzy hotels, and we had great expectations for the drake. However, all the vendors were given a room (the one room without any camera) that we were told would be safe. Towards the end of the night, an iphone goes missing as well as a good chunk of money. We find that our wallets had been opened and were on top of our bags. TALK about feeling violated. This has never ever happened to us before. Guests had no access to the room and we had seen a man in the drake uniform walk in and quickly walk out of the room. It was obviously one of the drake employees, I'm sure they are pretty aware of the fact that they had no cameras in that particular room. Also, the worst part is that when we complained all they did was ""file a report"" and when asked if this has ever happened before the security officer replied ""not really""....what do you mean not really? How disgusting! To make things even worse, he removed himself from taking responsibility of the situation by saying they hire a lot of their staff to work larger events, just sort of freelanced..he made it seem like they hired people off the streets /// do they even do background checks on who they hire? Guests pay A LOT of money for these rooms and I wonder if anything has ever been stolen from the rooms. It is appalling that nothing was done, we weren't reimbursed. They didn't even take the initiative to look into the cameras in the hallway at least to see if anyone had walked in and out of the rooms. I have lost any and ALL respect for this hotel, and we will never recommend clients to this hotel ever again.",N
151,"My mom really loved this place. We arrived at 8AM, wanted to check in really early, and they got us in quite early at 12PM. We just walked around town for a bit, and our room was ready. The valet parking was $45 a night (or for 24 hours) but was convenient and safe. They have free coffee and tea in the morning. Only one downer was that wireless is $9.99 a day, what? Who charges for internet these days? I guess they want to keep that also historic just like their building. You could tell the building wasn't brand new, but the rooms were very clean and neat. Air conditioning worked great and the water pressure was awesome. They have clean down pillows and down comforter which made me feel at home. If it wasn't for the paid wireless internet, I would have given them 5 stars. But it was well worth the $96 I paid through expedia.",N
5560,"I am giving this hotel a full 5-star rating.  While I have stayed at more luxurious hotels, this one really exceeded my expectations.  First, the location: FANTASTIC.  A short walk (less than 2 blocks) to both the metra train station and the Chicago el subway train stop.    Second, the hotel itself is extremely well run.  Nice front desk staff.  Rooms are very clean, and modern.  There is a pool and hot tub on the first floor, which is a nice touch when travelling with kids.  I would have gone with 4 stars but after enjoying the free HOT breakfast every morning, I had to give them the full 5 stars.  Price was unusually low for a Chicago hotel. Tremendous value, and we will only stay at LaQuinta when we return to Chicago next time.",N
5743,"Do not book this hotel using an online site like http://Hotels.com. We booked a King bed non smoking for a one night stay to celebrate our anniversary. Upon arriving a very rude front deck clerk informed us that they""Crowne plaza metro"" did not have to honor our King bed booking because it was made with an online service and instead we were going to get a Double room. If we didnt take it we would lose ALL the money.Final in the room we find two small beds. Im a big guy. So, To make a long story short. After all the planning and money spent, I spent my anniversary sleeping alone! My wife woke the next day with a rash from the detergent they use. (We hope thats what it was) So thank you Crowne plaza Metro for an Anniversary that nether my wife or I will ever forget!",N
5710,"This hotel was amazing.  It sits at a great location, you walk out the door and you get a great view of the river front and buildings all around E Wacker and Michigan.  The amenities inside the hotel are pretty thoughtful too: every floor has a water purifier water and water bottles that you can fill up yourself.  At $139 a night it was a great deal for something with a great view and being inside the loop. P.S. free wifi!",N
4677,"I have yet to stay here, but my best friend took me here for lunch on my birthday, and I have more than good words to shower this place with. The front desk staff was absolutely lovely and inviting. We got seated right away without any hesitation. As soon as we were sat, our awesomely accomandating waitor came by with our drinks. He was humble and friendly in a very professional way.  For my lunch, I ordered a romaine leaf salad whose dressing had just the perfect creaminess, and my friend ordered the steak sandwich which I highly recommend. Portions aren't big but just enough to fill you up.  The chef came out to greet us after we were done eating as well. My experience here was nothing less than excellent. I definitely recommend this as a business lunch place or if you just want to grab drinks they have a cozy bar as well.",N
2053,"Our room was lovely and the view was fantastic. Hotel concierge was suave and the staff was very nice, although at times a bit over-accommodating (they checked on us about three times in our room following check in). The bar has a great view as well but the restaurant Italiasia is not good at all, blah-don't go. (It was a reminder that there are far too many great places to eat in Chicago than to settle for the hotel restaurant). Friendly staff, clean room, great view, great location, good price.",N
2601,"It is what it is. I've been here several times, and cant shake the feeling that it is not as good as it could be. Maybe it's the crowd or the location, but if you have nothing better to do, this should suffice.",N

1090,"I came here for a wedding reception and the hotel did a great job.  They had a room off of the main ballroom for a reception for the guest until the wedding party arrived, then we moved in the ballroom which was very elegant. The staff was great the food was decent.  I would highly recommend this place for a wedding and/or wedding reception.",N
901,"We are Kimpton In Touch members and have stayed in a number of their hotels on both coasts. Hotel Burnham in particular is so well located when it comes to attending Chicago's Jazz Festival. Just two short blocks west of Millennium and Grant Parks. We were fortunate to have a corner room with views of State and Washington Streets. Views of the parks of course, Macy's (world's second largest department store), and the Chicago Theater. Everything is at your foot steps... The Jewelery District, Water Taxi, Magnificent Mile, parks, and museums. Perhaps the most outstanding feature of the visit besides the great jazz was the Chicago skyline of monuments. Our room was extremely comfortable with properly scaled furniture. Velour head board with overhead sheer canopy, matching curtains scripted with Mozart tunes covering the bay windows that were screened with sheer french drop curtains for daytime privacy. Coffee & tea was available each and every morning and on Labor Day, there was an arrangement of donuts, sweets and bagels. That was to make up for the inconvenience of not having the lobby restaurant available. Hotel Burnham is also a designated historical building and once had the pleasure of a visit from Al Capone. Would not ever hesitate to recommend or stay in this hotel again in the future.",N
2321,"I've stayed here twice, once for work and once on vacation.  Overall it's a nice hotel with a great location and I would stay on future trips to Chicago.  Here are the highlights: The Good: Lobby Bar There was a surprising amount of amusing antics in the lobby bar.  It was great to sit back and watch people drop game, especially those that shouldn't be.  It was packed Friday and Saturday night. Starbucks There was a line in the morning, but you can't beat the convenience of having one in the lobby (or one right across the street, or one two doors down.....) Location Walk out the back door, walk down Michigan Avenue...... Staff Nothing but great things to say about the staff.  Everyone that we encountered was just fantastic The Bad: Elevators If you were on floors 29 on up (which we were) there was always a significant wait for the elevators.  There was a bank of eight elevators servicing these floors, but only two were running.  Someone told me that the staff claimed this was temporary, but I had the same issue on both visits, which were eight months apart. Street Noise Maybe I'm just a country bumpkin, but there sure was a lot of street noise coming up to the 37th floor.  It may have just been our particular room, bu it seemed like the seals on our window weren't tight and a lot of outside noise was getting in. Overall it had been a good place to stay and I envision staying there again when I go back in September.",N
4298,"Oh Palmer House, you seductive temptress. Look at this location!  Look at this building!  I want to die every time I go into the lobby it is so beautiful.   Ahh, but this is how they suck you in!  And how it just masks the greatly unfortunate experience from then on. Twice I had someone new at Registration.  And both times, instead of finding out the correct information, they tell me something completely different and wrong and completely waste my time. (1st time was in trying to get approval for me to check in without husband present, whose name was on the reservation.  2nd time I asked about a mailbox, because my letter was too large to fit in the mail chute on my floor. But to be fair, when I went to someone who knew what they were doing about my check in issues, it was fixed immediately.) So check in is at 3, right?  Exhausted,  I get to the room, throw down the bags, and call room service for a pot of coffee. Room service is ""closed"" until four. But the helpful pre-recorded message assures me that the restaurant downstairs, Lockwood, would definitely be able to help me!  I call Lockwood.  The chick on the phone says ""yep, come on down and get your coffee here"".  Oh, OK thanks, but I can just go to Starbucks for that?  Why would you have any service unavailable at the same time you have people checking in?   And speaking of the room.  I was ""upgraded"" because of the mix up at check in. My upgrade was to a small room that would have been beautifully decorated in 1990, complete with a large armoire that held a tube TV.  My view was of a fire escape (and most likely the alley below but I was too high up to see that far down.) Quite a bit different than the rooms they promote on the website.   I decide to check out the fitness center.  This is on a lower level, but when the elevator doors opened you would think you were in a completely different hotel.  Beautiful, modern decor in chocolate, greens and peacock blue.  The fitness center looks like a spa from the outside.  There is a woman at a desk who asks you to sign in.  Just as my pen hovered over the paper she adds ""Oh and by the way there is a $10 charge per day to use the facilities"".  Wait...what?  Are you serious?  Gah!  No thanks.   I just feel like my entire stay was non-stop irritation.  Are hotels the new airlines where the idea of service is dead and you are nickel and dimed to death?  I guess so, at least in the Palmer House.  Such a very serious let down.",N
4799,"This hotel is a joke (and I don't mean a witty joke...I mean a terrible hotel).  Despite the gracious management staff, the front of house staff ranges in age from what looks like 16- 24.  Despite their best efforts, they are all inept at high end customer service.  The door was NEVER opened for me, nor was the elevator ever called, despite FOUR staff standing around at all times to do these very things.  They really just want to hail you a cab and get a tip.The rooms are very small, most the size of the king size bed and a desk.  This is not a Doubletree Suites hotel!!!  The bathroom is strangely enormous, but without any adequate shelf or counter space (I had to move things to the floor).BIG WARNING!!!!  Most of the hotel is facing The Elevated Train and some idiot designed the hotel with NO SOUND PROOFING!!!  Expect to be kept awake all night and awoken early in the morning.  They don't even offer ear plugs.I saw one of the classic Suites (which one expects from the Doubletree) and its only unique feature are bathrobes...which were missing from my room, thus demonstrating they intend on treating people differently based on what you pay.  The price of the suite does not justify what you get, especially considering there are many other hotels near by (where I have happily stayed) with comparable size rooms at lower prices.The strangest part of staying at the hotel was how eager the front desk staff was to tell me this was the most advanced Green hotel in Chicago.  Yet every night of my stay, the maid left some kitschy little plastic toy on my bed with a business card with a clever saying.  What a waste!  After I got a yo-yo and a plastic light bulb I told her to stop!  That's green?!I went up to the roof and was impressed with the view.  But again, some idiot designed the bar without a service station for the staff.  So it's unbearably crowded and hectic all the time.  The tapas like menu served very boring, overpriced food.  Avoid the gimmick.Oh, and I could really do without the recorded loop of seagulls and bells coming from the hallway.Avoid this hotel folks...it's a total rip off!  Trying to be like a W...should tell you everything you need to know.  Beware of Hilton staff coming online and writing rave reviews.  As far as I could tell, the majority of the hotel guests were people who work for the hotel chain!",Y
46,"This hotel is OLD.  Peeling paint, slow creaky elevators, dirty/scuffed baseboards, and ancient light lamps, wallpaper, and decorations. In my room, the walls actually had pretty sizable holes in them under the headboard and desk.  The sheets were rough and I even felt the hard springs inside the mattress poking me a little as I tried to sleep. That said, the location is good (it's close to Michigan Ave and the Chicago Red Line stop), the price is cheap (even last minute), and housekeeping is phenomenal at keeping things immaculate, even if you don't leave your room until the afternoon. There was also free wifi, which improves pretty much any situation.",N
4200,"OK, got a suite for a bachelorette party....lets say its pretty dark and dingy in the suite....I was like where is the lights or the windows in this place.  A friend hooked us up with a good price so really I cant complain.  The room wasnt ready until 230PM...yes, I know check in isnt until 3 but we called to see if we could get in early and they said no problem....it was a different story when we arrived.  The staff is nice, however, there was definitely a communication barrier which made it pretty hard to try to find out about the murphy bed, etc.  Its an ok spot and to be honest, if we would have paid full price, the stars would definitely be lower.  Its a pretty nice location and thats about it.",N
5486,"We had our wedding reception here in May 08 and from Day 1 of the planning (Feb 07), Sutton Place went above & beyond my expectations. Personnel: Paula, the catering manager, was amazing.  She was willing to accommodate any suggestions I had and worked wonderfully with our vendors.  She is so responsive, and truly cared about making the day fun and memorable for everyone. Other hotel staff was very friendly, without being fake (you know the type).  Everyone we encountered, from the wait staff to the valet parking staff, was so courteous. Rooms: We had a penthouse suite (bi-level with fabulous city views) that was a great size and easily fit 10 girls plus hair stylists & a makeup artist getting ready pre-ceremony.  We also had a hotel block here for guests & all were happy with their rooms (small touches like the fresh orchids in the bathroom went a long way!) Logistics: I love the set up of the space (2nd floor cocktail hour with a private bar and 3rd floor dinner/dancing).  The unique shape of the rooms makes it interesting and the floor to ceiling windows offer a great view of the activity on the street.   Food: We received so many raves about our food!  I honestly didn't get a chance to eat much of it (although at the tasting, everything was delicious).  The portion sizes were very generous.",N
206,"This hotel is in the perfect location--next to the John Hancock building and one block from Michigan Avenue.  We booked this hotel through http://Priceline.com and got a fantastic deal for a weekend in June!  We arrived during a torrential downpour and the valet and doormen were right there to assist us with our bags.  We arrived a couple of hours before check-in and were told our room wasn't ready (we were sopping wet and had to hurry to make it to the Cubs game), but the couple behind us got into their room.  We didn't think too much of the front desk staff, not the friendliest.  The doormen and valets were excellent, however! We were very surprised at our room!  We loved that it was a suite with a frig and microwave.  It had a TV in the living room and bedroom.  We had a great view on the 24th floor, too.  For an even better view, go up to the pool on the 30th floor.  You can see for miles and miles up there!  My husband loved the Precor ellipticals in the fitness room. No free breakfast and even a Nutrigrain breakfast bar cost $2!  We didn't go to the restaurant or bar, so I can't comment on that.   I would highly recommend this hotel, and we have stayed at quite a few downtown hotels!",N
128,"I named my own price on Priceline and the Whitehall Hotel was selected. We arrived at Whitehall around midnight for s 5-day stay in Chicago. The hotel is located in the Gold Coast area of downtown Chicago and is only one block from the shopping along Magnificent Mile and Michigan Ave. The doorman took our bags and led us to the counter for check-in. The lady at the counter was friendly and explained the basics of the hotel, such as room service, on-site restaurants, and the business center. Up to the room we went. She then mentioned that we were upgraded to a junior suite...score! Entering the room on the 10th floor, the older decor was an instant eye-catcher, which is a good thing. A few of the artsy fixtures looked like something from medieval times and the bed frame was also old-fashioned (I added a few photos of our room). There is a small bench at the end of the bed which is good for watching TV or looking out of the window. The mattress on the bed was AWESOME, as it was very firm and conformed to my body. Six pillows lined the headboard, all of a somewhat different level of cushion. Closet space is standard, with a set of hangers, an ironing board, and a safe. Lighting was low, even with a ceiling light and five lamps spread throughout the room. I believe they need to add one more adjustable bright lamp, because the darkness is bad on the eyes when watching TV or using the computer. The bathroom was nice! Good power in the shower water, clean and fresh smelling, nice toiletries, and the hand soap was the same clam shell shape as the soap dish. Nice touch! A complimentary newspaper is left at the room door every morning and the soundproofing between rooms is solid. The housekeepers are friendly and if they see you in the halls, they ask if you need your room tended to...little things like this make hotels stand out. Lobby doors are opened for you when you come and go, and catching cab is a breeze as the cabs line up to the left of the building. The hotel is also close to State Street and is within walking distance to many areas around downtown. The hotel provides a number of maps and pamphlets to help you plan you daily activities. Sooo, my only ""gripe"" is the lack of lighting within the room. The hotel was remodeled a number of times and has very unique look compared to the more modern hotels that surround it in the same area. I would definitely stay here again.",N
5237,"I stayed at this place while on a trip to Chicago solely to see major tourist attractions like the Willis (Sears) tower, Shedd Aquarium, Adler Planetarium, Museum, etc. The hotel is walking distance from these places and that way you save time, energy and money. This is a bit further away from O'Hare airport and in early morning rush hour traffic it took us about 2 hours by car. It is connected via train but we did not try that option. The hotel is a bit dated but overall clean and efficient. The rate was very cheap compared to the other top tier hotels in the neighborhood. It is a 2-min walk away from the Roosevelt train station. The front desk clerk Hollie was super nice and let me check in a few hours ahead of check-in time which was super nice of her. Thanks Hollie! She also gave us useful travel tips. The restaurant ""Mei's kitchen"" right in the hotel building was really good as well - we had a sumptous breakfast there for $10/person. Overall, I am very impressed with this hotel given its proximity to tourist attractions, the lower prices, connectivity via trains, and friendly staff. I highly recommend it.",Y
5480,"My mom and I stayed here for three nights. The hotel is situated in a prime location - surrounded by several bars, restaurants (predominantly steakhouses), and shops, and a short walk to the Magnificent Mile/Oak St. Beach. The beds are comfortable and the service is friendly.",N
2182,"If you are looking for a special and memorable place to stay in the Windy City, I don't suggest the Intercontinental. If you are simply looking for a place to rest your head on a business trip, then I do suggest the Intercontinental. That pretty much says it all. There is nothing really wrong with the hotel, its just very corporate and very boring. Nothing amazing, high class, or extraordinary about it. The rooms were just fine, a tad small even for our upgraded room. The bathrooms were nice and big with a separate tub and shower. The service was great, everyone was very friendly. There was just nothing noteworthy or memorable. We got the room for 99 a night on Hot Wire and in retrospect, wish we would have booked something a little grander for our anniversary. There is always next time!",N
2721,"High-end, stylish and mod. The hotel and rooms within are laid out like a Dwell spread; muted opulence garnished with the  preferred comforts demanded by the business traveler.  The decor is a smorgasbord of sleek, clean, contemporary furniture and lines. Straightforward wonderful service, and optimal location in the aorta of Chicago's downtown scene. Launch by foot from the front door or  hop in to a short cab ride to visit and explore Chicago's most notorious and trademark offerings. The bar is magnet, so be sure to bring your own company or be open to others wanting yours. Lastly if you're creatively inclined, there are some photo ops amongst the stacked vintage suitcases and such throughout the hotel. adjust your settings and snap away.",N
4798,"I travel weekly, so finding a home away from home is challenging.  I initially made my reservation in April, before the opening and was skeptical.  When I arrived, I was sent to another hotel for one night due to over booking.  Despite a bit of inconvenience at the beginning, this hotel did an outstanding job of accommodating me when I returned.  The rooms are outstanding.  The service is friendly and professional.  The fitness and yoga studio far exceeded my expectations.I'm booked to go back in October.  This is my Chicago home away from home.",Y
4560,"This place is worth visiting, even if you're not staying to sleep. You can walk up and see the Red Lacquer room, admire the Sistine Chapel-esque architecture and have your picture taken by a gilded statue near the in-hotel bar. Apparently, it's the oldest standing hotel in North America, and every president since Ulysses S Grant has taken rest there. With help from my friend William Shatner (the Priceline Negotiator dontchaknow) I was able to bag a $250 hotel room for $75 a night, and subsequently upgraded (at an $18 a night charge) to a suite with two bathrooms, because we needed two beds as well. I can't vouch for the restaurant (since I am obviously a cheapskate), but the pool and hot tub were great, and never packed since they were tucked away on the 7th floor. And what other hotel is going to have an entire room for elevators? I would recommend this place if you're able to score a comparable deal, both because of the history and location (zoom into downtown Chicago and you'll find this at its epicenter), but couldn't in good conscience tell you to drop the retail price on a place where you're more or less paying for the legacy.",N
4748,"I rented a hotel room for my boyfriends birthday. I got the room last minute at a great price but the hotels service can be much improved. The room was amazing, very clean, the bathroom stylish as can be! However I was running late and needed help decorating the room with roses and candles and when I called the front desk the concierge couldn't do nothing for me other than except flowers I ordered to the hotel which I had no time to do either way as it was late. I asked if they can possibly help put some candles in the room and they stated they were a smoke free hotel. I had to rush to downtown and do everything myself. In the morning I called the front desk to see if they had Advil and the lady said ""Umm no. We have a pharmacy behind the hotel"" very inconvenient I taught for a hotel in the middle of downtown Chicago. As far as how beautiful the hotel is- the decorations are to die for.",Y
5678,"I was very much looking forward to our stay at this hotel, after hearing all the good things about it.  Unfortunately, it was a very underwhelming experience, to say the least.   But let me begin with the things that I do like about the hotel.  First off, it is located my favorite part of Chicago - the leafy, affluent part of town that is Chicago's equivalent of Manhattan's Upper East Side, complete with sidewalks, quiet tree-lined streets, real old-school townhouses (instead of ugly towering monstrosities that are 21st century condominiums), cute boutiques (instead of Gap, Banana Republic and other mainstream mass-produced brands) and, of course, Hermes of Paris (which warrants a separate mention).   I also like the small intimate lobby area with old leather couches, cherry colored wooden furnitures, area rugs and distinct artwork.  The very reason why I always tend to gravitate toward smaller boutique hotels instead of impersonal chains.   I definitely love the room.  While the space issue is not as bad in Chicago as it is in Manhattan, getting a 400-sqft guestroom for our weekend getaway is not an easy task.  So we were delighted to see that our room comes with generous, ample bathroom, double sink, massive king bed AND still enough space to walk around, do a chicken dance, and strut my Herve and Louboutins in.  My only reservation was the lack of natural light - the windows were definitely inadequate to allow sunlight to find its way into our 11th-floor room, but then again Delaware St is not exactly the widest street in town and there are buildings in front of us, so can't have it all! Yet one thing that really disappointed us was the service, or lack thereof.  I mean, seriously.  They don't call it the 'hospitality' industry for no reason.  I did pay a premium to stay in smaller boutique hotels such as this so I do get a service that is a little bit more personalized than the kind that I would be getting from say, a 3000-room Vegas hotel.   First, I called in to reconfirm my reservation.  The lady on the phone was anything but courteous and competent.  First off, she was not able to find my reservation and I was transferred to the front desk staff, to whom I had to explain myself all over again (my pet peeve when it comes to on-the-phone customer service). The person who manned the reception desk was not friendly, nor was he at all competent either.  Case in point - he had to send the slip of paper on which I agree to the nightly rate and duration of stay up to the room after we checked in, which clearly indicated that he must have forgotten when we were actually down there.   But the real kicker was when we ordered room service after arriving - it was about 1AM.  As a general rule, I am never, ever, a big fan of room service, having had my fair share of bad food that they slap 18% gratuity, 10.5% tax (and still expect a tip) on during my days globetrotting on the company's expense account.  Think overcooked steaks, lukewarm soup, bread hard enough to knock someone out, and ice-creams that are already half melted by the time it reaches your suite.  So I really wasn't expecting hotels as small as Talbott to have a 24-hour room service, but lo and behold, they do. I placed an order of chicken BLT, which (to my initial delight) came in within 20 minutes.  Then after the customary of the invoice and the involuntary yet customary tip of $2 on top of the 18% service fee (refer above) I opened the cover only to find something that looked like it was picked up from the garbage bin, microwaved and served on a plate with a bag of Lay's chips (lightly salted flavor).  The bread looked like someone stomped on it, the L and T looked like it was 2 days old, the B was unrecognizable, and the chicken was burnt and cold.  It was pathetic room service at its finest.   We did get the item taken off our bill (rightfully so too) but the front desk person was, instead of apologetic, defiant.  The whole thing was just very upsetting and for a hotel as high-end as this to be able to leave such a bad impression within the first hour of arriving, it's quite an accomplishment in and of itself. We won't be coming back, unfortunately.",N
2903,"Look - with a name like Sheraton you'd expect to get: * Fantastic Service * Clean atmosphere * Modern and updated facilities * Wireless Capabilities * Wired internet INCLUDED in the price Fact of the matter the Sheraton Chicago is a poor excuse of a facility.  It offers none of these things.  The food was bad, the service for the conference was poor and disorganized (plates and forks were dropped repeatedly during our clean up service during our lunch conference meeting - this is both loud and obnoxious.) Seriously... how do you charge me $180 a night for a crumby hotel room with old AC units and then turn around and make me pay $13 for a  WIRED service? Ashtrays inside the bathroom?  What is this, the 1980s? Free WiFi in lobby sucks. The Microsoft Lobby was cool... and so was the access to PCs in the Cafe (that gets you 2 stars...

2413,"Reminiscent of the gradiose hotels of the early 1900s... Beautiful high ceilings, gilt wood, lobby, pool (though it closed early), two smaller hot tubs, work out center, and room with city views. My boyfriend and I recently stayed there on valentine's day (which is a thursday, so...) for only $90 through priceline. The hotel just isn't at capacity in the winter and you can get great rates. We wandered through the spacious, empty lobby and stumbled on a grand ballroom, complete with balconies and elaborate, glass chandeliers. Great space for a wedding. Be aware... parking is almost $50 a night, truly a rip-off!! But the location can't be beat. Other downsides: most of the hotel's restaurants close in winter and Kitty O'Shea's, while open until 11 for food, was just not that good. But extremely affordable! Breakfast menu from room service was the only real disappointment, boring and veerry basic We were placed on the ""Executive Floor"", which I would almost certainly request if you can. They are higher floors with much better views. Little details in the service make a big difference to me. For example, I called to request tea in the morning and they brought up an enormous selection promptly, complete with creamers and to-go cups. I felt like Michael Jackson!! that's what they would give Michael Jackson. People say his star has fallen, but wouldn't you just poop yourself if he was staying in your hotel?? A note - You can buy passes to their gym/pool, not that I would ever work out in a million years. But some might. Some might. A 3-day pass to extensive facilities within walking distance to the Loop was $15, extremely reasonable. Back to the room: Warm colors, dark wood, smallish space, freshly tiled bathroom, white linens and comforter. Cable, but no DVD player. USA Today outside our door in the morning and check-out via phone from the room topped off the night. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. To hell with modern decor!",N

It is located on the north end of Michigan Avenue and convenient to the water.  I was upgraded into a corner room and had a view of Lake Michigan.  Couldn't have been a more amazing room.  Large with four windows overlooking the lake.  There was a chandelier above the bed and it seems like it would be a romantic place (I was there for a work conference, not very romantic).  I was within walking distance of everything.   The only complaint I have is the price for overnight parking, but I know that is an issue anywhere in downtown Chicago.  $50/night for the car made me want to puke!   Definitely recommend The Drake for work or play.  Try and not have a car in the city as you don't need one and it will cost you an arm and a leg...",N

The hotel itself is OK (but very small - it's easy to see it's from a different era). When we checked in, the worker said, ""I'm going to put you in a suite with two beds."" I replied, ""King suite?"" as that's what we had booked, and she said yes. We got up to our room to find they had put us in with two doubles! When we called the front desk, they said that was an ""upgrade"" because the room is slightly larger. Yes, it was, but a double bed is no substitute for a king. Eventually we got a new room. It's a cute boutique hotel, but nothing about it screams luxury to me. The front desk was snotty both at check in and check out, the room service was very limited (although that worker was extremely nice), the bellhop/doorman/valets all wouldn't help us find a taxi, and it took almost 20 minutes for the valet to get us our car!! It wasn't even like it was busy or check out time, and the parking garage is right next door. If you can score a great deal, it's might be worth because it's in a good location, but I would never go back.",N
3943,"The reviews are pretty right on. The location is fantastic, the lobby/architecture is lovely and the elevators were quick and easy. But it's clear where they cut corners to save money. The beds were nice but there were only foam pillows. There were plenty of towels (once we asked) but they were relatively small, very thin and pretty scratchy. The shower curtain was hung on a straight tension rod that was too far INTO the tub - and of course, it came down when I tried to move it away so as not to have the plastic curtain plastered to my, er, behind as I showered. I got it into the right place with the help of my roommate. The rooms are SPACIOUS but the view (on the 5th floor) was of a massive concrete wall - a little ""view"" of brick buildings when you looked straight up. The worst part was the musty smell, and the old-ness. When I went to adjust the thermostat/fan, the little metal ""flap"" revealed filth/stickiness/cobwebs inside, I didn't want to touch the knobs. Our closet (we were in #547) was big and roomy, but our adjoining room (#551) had a weird DOOR that started about 4' off the ground and was probably 3 or 4' tall. Inside (of course we looked!) were old pipes and cobwebs and some trash at the bottom. I believe this was access to plumbing. We think the worst of the smells came from behind that door. So we took everything out of the closet in 551 and moved it to 547, as we had both rooms and the door in between stayed unlocked. There were layers and layers of paint on all of the wood (except the new wood molding along the floor in 551 that had not yet been painted), and much of the paint was peeling. The bathroom was updated but the handicap bar between the sink and the commode was a great place to stub ones toes - it's just in a weird place. The carpet was ornate but old, made me wonder when it was cleaned last. Wish I'd brought my slippers! Other friends had a big ""double room"" on the 13th floor that had no smell. A big room with a king bed, and a separate room with a double bed. The separate room was teeny tiny but it did have a window and it's own flat screen TV, but no furniture, just the bed. I think that room number was 1381/1381A. Haunted? Some of my roommates went on a Chicago Ghost and Red Light District Tour, and found out that the Congress Plaza is the MOST haunted hotel in Chicago (and the 2nd most haunted hotel in the USA!). Cool and yet creepy. We got a great deal at http://hotels.com but probably wouldn't stay there again.",N
1844,"Personally, I am not a fan of the W Hotels.  Personally, they try too hard. They love to deck out their lobbys, put velvet plum pillows on top of beds, adorn their bathrooms with Bliss products, make sure music playing when you get back to your room, and play out all the Hotel Costes chillout-esque music possible in their lounges.  But their service is crap, and you know when the service is crap the hotel's pretty crap also no matter how nice it is.  Which is why it's so ironic they have their infamous ""Whatever. Whenever."" motto.  They don't stand by it.   Anyway, besides that, my stay was nothing special.  Yeah the room's nice but gosh every time you flush the toilet you feel like you're flushing an airplane toilet; talk about high pressure.  Then you wonder if the rooms around you can hear you and you feel bad at the same time if you're going to the bathroom in the middle of the night, which brings me back to the service.  They're so lazy they don't want to bother having plumbers on staff to fix a clogged toilet so they equip each room with the highest pressure toilet they can find.  Genius.",N
1005,"Check-in is a bit weird (one small desk with one or two dudes behind it), but other than that this was a pretty nice place.  Supposedly they offer some high end concierge services but I didn't take advantage. Continental breakfast is meh, but at least it's on every floor.   The main downside of this place is that the damn Harry Caray bar thing is right across the street.  I happened to have the room that looked directly at it.  Freaked me out. I might try the W next time, I dunno.",N
63,"Nice location to stay at. Its close to everything -- plenty of restaurants, shopping places, the lake, the city, and Wrigley! Its a small place with good management.  Its not cheap and not so much because of the excellent amenities, but for the excellent location.",N
4036,"I stayed here a few months ago for a conference for work. The location right on the Riverwalk is great, and it's an easy walk to many of the downtown area restaurants and shopping. It is about a mile to the Navy Pier on foot, which is a lovely walk if the weather is cooperating. The hotel itself is insanely huge with a labyrinth of conference rooms, spanning two buildings and a network of stairs and underground tunnels. The outside is kind of ugly, and looks like an industrial building out of the late 70s/early 80s, but at least the rooms themselves were really nicely decorated and comfortable. The bathrooms, too, were generously sized with great lighting. The extras were also good quality--yes, I am very picky about the soaps and shampoos that are in the room. Not only that, but they also supplied a travel sized toothpaste. A nice touch for travelers who may have forgotten one of the essentials. There is a coffee counter with snacks (serving Starbucks) in the lobby which was nice to have. Regular hotel coffee does not cut it in my opinion. ;)",N
5166,"My experience at the W,  was fantastic.  I went with the suite.  It was AWESOME.  I checked in Thursday afternoon,and the bellhops were super helpful loading and unloading all my luggage.   Parking at the W is a total rip-off  but I so is majority of the chicago hotels.  Getting the car from the valet usually took about 20 minutes so I learned to call ahead.I enjoy the club atmosphere on the first level (and in the elevators).  I thought it was really fun.The drinks are pricey but very good.",Y
4419,"Gorgeous foyer. Clean rooms. SMALL rooms. I prefer River North, except for the proximity to Grant Park and the ArtIC And there's a FANTASTIC Chop House in the same street (Something Chop House and Wine Bar.... hmmm... When I remember it I'll post it back), but seriously, it's in the same street (perpendicular to the lake, not parallel) and it's got THE BEST stuffed mozzarella appetizers. I still drool at them. And evidently they have really good steak.  But again, this comment is lost on me...",N
2501,"The Hilton and Towers is one of the more elegant hotels in town, and it is worthwhile to stroll through the public lobby areas. I have been to many a dinner function here and it is always a filling and fulfilling experience. The hotel is on South Michigan Avenue not too far from Soldier Field and Buckingham Fountain. Rooms with two beds are noted for also featuring two bathrooms as well.",N
491,"I had my wedding here last month and couldn't have been happier.  My contact, Brooke, was a doll.  She was always there to answer questions and made sure everything was the way it was supposed to be on my bid day.  We booked about 25 rooms for the weekend and everyone seemed pleased.  The remodel of the rooms is gorgeous.  They are very nice.  You really can't beat the free breakfast.  Since they don't collect the coupons we joked that we were going to go there every weekend for breakfast.   I deducted one star because we got a free room the night of the wedding. They made it seem like this was some fancy suite and it wasn't much different than the regular rooms and they made a huge deal about getting us into it.  Which I still don't understand.",N
1341,"Many hotels and restaurants receive five stars, but how many live up to expectations.  The Ritz lived up to expectations and ratings in every way.  My wife and had planned on going to the Ritz to spend a romantic evening out to celebrate our fifth anniversary.  When the overnight babysitter fell through we brought our two year old with us.  Who knew the Ritz was so kid friendly?  In every way possible they did what they could to make us and our son comfortable.  When we walked in, a Radio Flyer wagon of toys was brought out to us for him to choose one.  Later that night a friend came to babysit for us while we went out to dinner.  She needed the stroller to take our son for a walk and the staff graciously retrieved the stroller from our car and brought it to our room.  The next morning, his plate for breakfast was a kid friendly one.  In every way imaginable, the Ritz made our stay as comfortable as possibly.  I wish we could afford to stay here more often.  The only criticism I would have it to be careful when ordering room service.  Its definitely beyond expensive.",N
2732,"I have to agree with a few posters here: I can't imagine ever staying at another hotel in Chicago after my stay at to The James. Here, let me give you an example that sums up pretty well the kind of service you're going to get: after checking in at the front desk, my girlfriend and I made our way to the 9th floor (oh yeah, we got upgraded for taking a room on the ""smoking floor,"" even though you would never have known someone smoked in our room). We passed our floor's housekeeping lady, who greeted us with a massive smile and a sweet hello. We get to our door, but our room keys don't seem to be taking in the card slot. I try one or two more times, and then the housekeeping lady (let's just call her Maggie, for no reason whatsoever) comes over to see what's up. We tell her our card isn't working and she replies, ""Hold on, I'll get someone."" She then proceeds to SPRINT DOWN THE HALLWAY to get help. Within 30 seconds, there are two James employees helping us, and we're in. After seeing Maggie sprint down that hallway, I knew this was going to be better than any hotel I'd ever stayed in... and it was, by miles. The rooms were so clean, I was shocked. It looked brand new, and far cleaner than my own home. I can almost guarantee you no one had ever smoked in there; I've stayed in smoking rooms before, and there's usually at least ONE burn, either in the carpet, the couch, the bed, the windowsill, on the bathtub. Nothing. Our bed was massive, comfy and spotless, with crisp white sheets and the most comfortable pillow top mattress I've ever slept on. The bathrooms? Spotless. Big, thick towels. Warm, breathable robes. Kiehls bath products (never thought I'd care, but this stuff is gooood) refilled whenever needed. Great water pressure for the shower, too. The lights? All dimmable, save for the lamp in your room's breakfast nook. Oh yeah, free wireless Internet. A fully stocked bar, including a mini fridge (we bought our own beverages across the street at Trader Joe's). What else? How about The Primehouse, attached in the lobby (it's also the main source for room service... try the steak omelet, delivered with a New York Times and a pot of incredible Primehouse coffee, right to your door in the morning!). Print out your boarding passes in the little office center in the lobby. Get some great tips from the concierge, or visit the James' site for their restaurant, shopping and other recommendations. I heard about Graham Elliot from their site and it wound up being one of the best meals of my life! Not one time during our entire stay did housekeeping accidentally walk in, or even knock to see if they could come in and clean. Nope, we'd just go out for a stroll or a quick brunch and by the time we returned, Maggie had already worked her magic. Oh, and if you leave for a few hours in the evening, expect to come home with your bed turned down, your robe laying out for you, with a couple of complimentary cookies from the Primehouse as a bedtime snack. The ginger snaps are especially yummy. James hotel, you've ruined me for my own home. Do you have a monthly rate?",N
4529,Great place for the price.  $219.00 a night on the executive level floors with two bathrooms and two full size beds.  It also included breakfast and h'deorves in the evening.    The architecture is beautiful but the hotel is dated and doesn't seem to know its true identity.  The new Spa that opened was 4$$$$ expensive for what was received.  Better going to a off site nail salon or massage parlor for real spa treatments at better prices.,N
1416,"The Millennium Knickerbocker is tucked away just about a half-block east of North Michigan Avenue. I like to refer to this hotel as a mini-Drake, as it is in essence a smaller version of the Drake Hotel across the street. The Knickerbocker is an older property, so the rooms are quite elegant but very average in size. The bathrooms have very little shelf space (and I am a guy). Try to have a look around the attractive public spaces, and there is a cozy library-like nook that is around the corner from the piano bar.",N
3638,"Same review as the Palmer House, and must be indicative of all the hilton hotels.  Grand beautiful lobby, nice ballrooms.  But then you get upstairs, and its like the money ran out.  Old dingy carpets, old wallpaper, old tvs, ugly bedspreads and artwork, just all around outdated.  Had a window, but it opened up to a wall of another wing of the hotel.  Bed was comfortable, room was large, and good water pressure in the shower.   Was here for a conference and heard everyone else had nice rooms, so maybe it was just me.",N
1106,"This place disappointing for a high class hotel. Service is only marginal, staff is a little ridiculous and they nickle and dime you along the way. It's definitely nice decor, nice location but while i was trying to have a business phone call in the morning before i checked out, maid came by 4 times throughout the morning (as early as 8.30am) although the checkout is not until 12. I expect a lot more from a hotel of this class.. Also when i got there stuff like coffee, drink glasses and such was missing.. once again a high-class hotel like that does not have second chances when it comes to some of these basics. I would say go to W Lakeshore or Four Seasons if you want a nice place to stay.",N
5675,"So they apparently finished the renovations as I've stayed at the Talbott 3 or 4 times in the last 6 months and everything has been near perfect. The bar is back at the front of the hotel, it's clean, it's attached to the restaurant and they serve a mean Ketel One Martini. We ate at the restaurant a couple of times. Our server, who's name I really wish I could remember, took great care of us. I always ordered something from the nightly specials and it never disappointed...and he always suggested a great wine pairing. From the menu, we had the Beef Carpaccio one night, which was excellent. The best part of the stay, though, was the hotel itself. When I hear boutique hotels, I think small, but the rooms were excellent sized - bigger than the last Marriott I stayed at - and the bathroom is much nicer (and bigger) than the one at my house. Lots of marble, rich fabrics, pillows and one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. Plenty of space for working. Warm and inviting - it was almost as nice as being at home. Reasonably priced for a downtown hotel, within walking distance to a few other restaurants, a Starbucks and my client's office. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat...",N
1340,"During my stay the hotel was under renovation. Overall the service was good and the room was spacious with a great lake view....personnel most of the time attentive. The restaurant quality as it relates to price is not worth. One night the seafood was undercooked and they never took it out from the bill. Three times i had dinner there, and all three times the food  quality and dish execution was different(Good to poor). Not my first choice next time that I am in Chicago..but I would consider it as a second or third.",N
4436,"This is a gorgeous old hotel.  The rooms are somewhat drafty in the winter, and a little less modern and large compared to buildings put up more recently, but you can feel the tradition.  The rooms are also a bit smaller, but I think they're fine.  The lower floors have some of the standard amenities, pool, hot tub, etc., and good dining.  The decor is beautiful. I guess it comes down to the choice between memorable, world-renown, elegant and classic, versus modern and slightly more comfortable.",N
4899,"You get what you pay for at this hotel as far as rooms, service and atmosphere go. My girlfriend got married June 25, not at the Dana but we all stayed there. We needed to check in early that day to have somewhere to get ready (traveling from Detroit) to make it to the church by 3:30 pm. The hotel checked us in early over the phone while we sat traffic (at no extra charge), and when we arrived at the hotel with only minutes to spare (thanks to sitting in traffic for an extra unexpected hour) the front dest attendant not only sensed and acknowledged our urgency but took care of everything for us lickity split (literally, we were in the elevator, on our way up to the room within 45 seconds of walking in the front doors of the hotel... as all of our friends were walking out and getting onto the shuttle to go to the church). And we ended up making it to the church on time. Later that night, when we ordered a (extremely overpriced but well worth it) bottle of Veuve, the guy on the room service end of the phone was super cool and the delivery was very fast, as requested. Same with ordering breakfast the next morning - polite, fun and fast. Not to mention, the rooms are gorgeous and clean - we didn't want to leave but couldn't afford to stay. We really enjoyed our short little stay at the Dana.",Y
2483,"I love this historic hotel! The location on Michigan Avenue acroos from Grant Park and over-looking the lake just can't be beat!  I stayed in a 19th floor corner suite that had lake views. The rooms were standard Hilton-above average quality and cleanliness. The lobby bar was nice for evening cocktails. I liked seating at a table in the window overlooking the Michigan Avenue traffic. However, be prepared to pay around $12.00 per cocktail. The only thing I would change would be the size and quality of the executive floor amenities. The club lounge was tiny and there was always a line for beverages or snacks.  But-let me say, the executive level staff was fantastic! They helped me arrange a dinner meeting at a local restaurant. I can't wait to come back to Chicago and stay at this hotel again.",N
2083,"Can you believe we booked this hotel room for $81 on a Saturday night?!  I never knew a place like this existed in such a good location.  No complaints at all...friendly front desk service, very nice hotel, clean spacious room, good (but pricey) breakfast.  This is place is the exact opposite of the Holiday Inn in Peoria (see my review).  Can you believe it was cheaper too!!??  They even have a list of all the bars in the area at the concierge.  Gotta love Chicago.  If you have family or friends coming in, suggest this hotel....you can't beat it - especially for the price!",N
2219,"Loved it! Ok...it has best location...right on Mich ave right across from the yummiest food place, the Purple Pig.  This was our second time staying here for one of our anniversary. Long line to check in but we got there n checked in. Got our room but found it to be wrong. They upgrade us to historic room. Best deal ever.  We got totally isolated within one corridor, there was just our room and one other.  There were even steps up to our door which had its own personal door bell.  Cute.  Loved the huge entry way and separate shower and bath.  Room was twice as big as the previous room with a great view.  Service was just awesome.  Will have to return next time.  Oh, our room was supposed to be $1500 and we got it for less than $200?  AWESOME!",N
577,"I stayed here recently for a business trip.  Before its OFFICAL opening, I got a great deal on a room.  I was never a devotee of the old Ambassador East Hotel, so I can't speak to the comparison.  What I do know is that I LOVE this hotel.  It works for me as I am a minimalist, modernist and I dig clean, spare spaces. I booked on price line and got a very good deal, but when I showed up, they upgraded me to a one room suite on the 16th floor...which had the MOST amazing view of both the towers and a little picnic table and a cupboard for the dining implementry in a completely different room. The living room was done all in white and was gorgeously appointed.  The bed was a king size, low to the ground and extremely comfortable.  Very Asian in feeling, but Swedish in style. Bathroom was a little bit small, but well turned out.  There were two large flat screen tvs...I don't really watch tv, but I'm sure a sports fan or news junkie would have been pleased. The iPhone/iPod charger didn't seem to work for my 4G, but I didn't try my Nano, so I'm not sure if it was just a compatibility issue. I loved the location.  Only a block or two away from the Zebra Lounge...a funky little piano bar with a tiny space but an excellent vibe.  Also, only blocks away from th Rush/Division bars that stay open all night and on warm nights, which this was, is a place where people congregate outside regularly.  Good people watching. The hotel staff was INCREDIBLY nice and accommodating.  When I called at 12:30 am for a turkey sandwich and chocolate pudding room service delivery, they forgot or messed it up and, not being a very fussy person, I didn't bother to call back to check on it until 4:30am, where they immediately said they were SO sorry and could they please sendit up now, gratis, and also could they buy me breakfast in the morning?  Yes and yes, thanks!  That was the best 5am turkey sandwich ever.  :) I really loved my stay here and will book again in the future.",N
5509,"Great location, friendly staff. My boyfriend is in Chicago for business and I tagged along. We only stayed one night, but the front desk staff were helpful and friendly. Our room was clean, our shower was HUGE (we might have gotten a handicapped room, but that was sweet!) and we got complimentary water bottles. :D Continental breakfast was acceptable -- the cinnamon rolls they had smelled delicious! Only downside to our stay was a noisy neighbor who was yelling curse words for about two hours at midnight...and that we had to pay $22.00 for the day's parking.",N
3881,I stayed at the Dana Hotel and Spa for business two weeks ago.  Staff was great and very helpful especially the concierge - Ben.  The room really was wonderful as well as the shower.  I've stayed at a few hotels in Chicago and would definitely go back to the Dana when I am in Chicago again.,N
5422,I had my wedding reception here in July 2010. It turned out to be an absolutely fabulous venue. The bar and seating area are a great cocktail hour location and the ballroom was perfect for a seated dinner for our 120 people.Annie Parker works hard to make sure your day goes off without a hitch. Extremely affordable and the food and drink were great!Would recommend to anyone looking to get married in Oak Park (where there are just not that many event spaces).,Y

It is beautiful lobby and great layout. the staff is amazing, probably one of the most professional in the city. Great group of people. The rooms are nice too. Great place for a wedding or reception. Starwood (who own the hotels) have specials from time to time so check their website. otherwise just check out drinks in their lobby (called the Living Room)",N
773,"I prefer the Westin River North, but this one on Michigan avenue is great if you need to be on Miracle Mile. The staff and amenities are fine, but the location (and shopping!) I think is what's best about it. There's no spa, sauna, steam room, etc., but they do have an ok gym, and in-room spa where an outside spa company sends a massage therapist or aesthetician to you. I'd always wanted to try this and it was definitely worth it (especially after a long business trip and being sick). The in-room spa probably runs about what you would pay at a regular one.  The price of the rooms are comparable to other Westins and I got upgraded to a very nice room. The hotel restaurant (Grill on the Valley or something like that) was much better than other hotel restaurants and it was very lively.",N

I had a great stay and will come back the next time I'm in Chicago.",N
3165,"Pretty good as far as hotels go. I have to say that the rooms are a little tired and the staff are really helpful and friendly. The guys at the valet were rock stars. A change from many of the NYC W's. The views of the lake are awesome, summer or winter. It's a little bit of a walk to Michigan Ave when it's super cold and icy, but overall, well positioned. I'd give it a 4 star if there were some decent suites and larger rooms. Like all W's it's on the high side $ wise so I think there should be more room for your money. Not everyone is blinded by the bar and tunes.",N
3899,"Our room was clean, roomy and comfortable. The walls were a bit thin so we could hear the neighbors - but they were a group of 20-something boys (yes, boys) so I don't think any hotel would have blocked out the drinker talk of ""helicopter dick"". This is more a reflection on the kids than the hotel. Bathroom was small but just fine - decent water pressure which is important to me. The best part of the hotel - LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. It was perfect. Price was fine though we seemed to be there on a really busy weekend so I bet you can find different hotels for less money at certain times. Really, if you're looking for a place to sleep - this place is not as bad as reviews would have you think (someone complained about 'cheap tiles' in the bathroom? Really?)",N

1086,"This is a really nice hotel.. I don't have too much experience with straight up $$$$ hotels as I usually prefer just a place where I can sleep, change, and clean myself up. This was a sweet holiday gift from my bf's parents as it also allowed us to sleep in Chicago for two nights before heading out to Wisconsin for Christmas. The location of the Fairmont is very nice - just a short 20 minute walk out and you can get around to Navy Pier and lots of other cool locations. Walk out further 20-30 minutes and you can get your way to a sweet bar selling sweet microbrews. Yum. The rooms are really nice especially for a double bed. I can't imagine a room with larger beds or one singular king-sized bed, but I would think that it would be pretty nice! They have lots of dresser space to put your clothes in, really nice pillows and blankets, the beds definitely let your legs dangle in a child-like fashion if you wanted to, the windows don't open up a lot but they do for some air, the heater/ac works accordingly, and the bathroom.. YAY. I love clean bathrooms. And awesome baths. Really nice standing up showers. A little hide-a-seek toilet room. I also frequented the spa downstairs in the basement as well - it's really nice and it was empty, so I could walk around completely naked as I had wished. And I did.",N
4191,"Eh, I received a great deal for $80 a night so really I can't complain. I don't think I would stay again unless I received the same deal. The rooms seems small and so dark.

First I booked two double beds for my friend and I, but when I confirmed I was told I had ""one cozy bed"". The rooms are clean enough but really, really small, like smaller than a dorm room. We didn't have room for our two suitcases, they just had to lay open on the floor and we walked over them. The room was either really hot or really cold and the train and construction is loud so bring ear plugs. Don't expect a view! The worst part was the cleaning. We stayed five nights and our room was only cleaned two times, after we complained. We had to request cups and towels everyday. We ran out of toilet paper and they brought us a half used role! So if you must stay here, bring your own tp, cups, hairdryers, and don't expect a clean room every day! On the bight side, the wifi is free!",Y
21,"My mom stayed here 4 or 5 years ago and loved its quaint charm, so when she met me in Chicago at the tail end of a business trip, we were excited to find that Hotwire had placed us here. Things have apparently changed. No room service, no vending or ice machines on the floors and no in-room coffee. The room was clean but a bit beyond ""charming"" in terms of falling apart. The blinds were broken in the bedroom and there weren't any in the bathroom, so you got to pee and shower in full view of the church below and the adjacent corner of hotel rooms. The water didn't drain out of the tub, so by the time I finished a quick shower, I was already shin-deep in water. SICK. The elevators were terrifying. I am all for old, quaint, authentic and charming but this place has really let itself go. Get me some coffee in my god-damned room and some ice machines so I can keep my champagne cold and I'll stop bitching. Promise.",N
4159,"Let's see ... 1) I was unable to use the Internet, even after I paid the ridiculous $14 fee. I called to report this twice, and each time I was on hold for over 5 minutes. When I did speak to someone (off-location), it took about 15-20 minutes of my time (x2 phone calls) to 'troubleshoot' - which still did nothing. I was told I'd be called back when service was back up. Nothing. 2) The black wiry hairs on the bathroom floor were a BIT easier to stomach than the large broken fingernail on the floor NEXT TO MY BED. I should note it's definitely not mine. These two things put together trump any 'good' I got from the hotel. For the price and name on this hotel, these aforementioned details are NOT excusable. Disgusting!",N
3929,"OH MY GOODNESS... Where to start.  The location for those that want to be in the middle of things - well, you're at the wrong end of Michigan for that.  On the positive side you definitely will get a workout from your walks.   Even though the lobby is wonderful, there is constantly a group of picketers right in front of the enterence.   Our room was small, and ancient., and to to add insult to injury, the toilet was not attached to the floor....I'M NOT KIDDING!!!.   The bathtub backed up and the water pressure was pitiful. The solution....put is in another room, that had no view.  wonderful.    We booked online and the price of $129 a night was ridiculous...NEVER AGAIN.   One bright spot though, was the small smoothy place one block before the hotel...NOW THAT WAS WORTH THE WALK!!! My suggestion - find someplace else to stay.",N
1491,"Nothing knockin' your socks off here...great for the business traveler. No, ""Oh Wow"" factor...but pleasant and comfortable, nice, efficient. Great service. The linens and drapery need to be updated, and the constant changing of the elevators can be a little annoying. Overall, ok...won't plan to stay again.",N
1911,"This W Hotel is definitely intended for people staying on business, but we chose to block rooms at this hotel for our wedding which was around the corner at the Rookery. I have to say that the staff was extremely helpful and pleasant to work with. The decorating is almost eerie and Alice in Wonderland-esque. Definitely strange at times (we had one ceramic white roller skate in our suite) but we found it more entertaining that anything else. The food in the lounge was great. They had free coffee all hours of the day, and I ordered a waffle that was delicious. I wouldn't recommend eating or drinking anything out of the room since the prices on snacks are so inflated. Our suite was really nice. We had a separate living room with two couches, a dining room table and a large flat screen TV. There were closets everywhere. Two large full bathrooms which had awesome Bliss Spa toiletries. The bedroom was large with a King size bed, a really cozy down comforter and another flat screen TV. The only negative to the room was that the lighting was very dim (along with the rest of the hotel) so when it came time to do hair and make-up we called concierge for more lamps. And living up to their ""wherever, whenever"" motto, they brought up 4 table lamps in a jiffy! Overall I think this hotel was perfect for our wedding stay. Mainly because it was so close to our venue, but also because it was clean, comfortable, and the staff was very accommodating.",N
4496,Opulence.  I hazzzz it.,N
711,"I stayed at this hotel tons for business.  I knew the front desk folks by name, and they knew mine, too.  They made an extra effort to make my stays go smoothly (even before I stayed with them often). The Starbucks in the lobby is convenient if not the smoothest running location I've seen.  Remember that Courtyards are for business travel, so there's a concentrated rush in the morning. Viand has to be the best restaurant I've ever seen at a Courtyard.  High quality breakfast foods (sorry, never tried other meals) cooked to order (buffet on weekends I think). The staff are attentive and caring.  If you ask for a dinner recommendation they won't just give you a photocopy sheet like some places (though they do have a brochure)--they'll talk you through what you're in the mood for, and tip you off to newer places if you're into that. This is not a luxury hotel, as CY's are not, but the service is classy! I like that.",N
5458,"I stayed here this past weekend and had a very nice night. My friend was visiting from out of town for Halloween and we wanted to get a hotel for the night. Our plans were a little last minute and I was super worried about finding a reasonably priced hotel. Luckily, Sutton Place was running a $99.00 sale for the night!!! Jackpot! You couldn't ask for a better location. Sutton Place is close to so many restaurants, the bars on Clark and Division, and shopping.  A cab ride from Union Station to the hotel cost around $7.00. Everyone in the hotel was friendly and you could tell they actually cared about our stay. The rooms were so quite, we literally heard zero noise from our neighbors. And, our room was right next to the elevators on our floor and we still heard no noise! Perfectly fluffy beds, I had the best night of sleep. My only complaint is that there are no ice machines. You have to call room service to deliver you your ice. So essentially you have to pay for the ice (since it would be expected for you to tip room service delivery) But, it just get a pain to keep paying for new ice once the ice melts...",N
3764,"This place is very sexy, modern, artsy and much more laid back than most River North hotels - all at the same time. The rooms are actually ... very .... interesting and different.  Like ... the room we had, had a glass wall that separated the shower from the rest of the room (of course there was a curtain that could be closed to hide the shower.)  Kinda kinky, no? If you are a young, hip person (at least at heart) who appreciates a little upscale swank or classy-kink, you would like this place ... a lot. I also hung out at the rooftop bar.  It wasn't completely al-fresco as it was enclosed with full length windows, but no roof.  The seating was cushy and there was a huge fireplace in the middle.  Again, cool, artsy and different, with amazing views, but also practical. BTW, the shrimp and fried rice I ordered from room service was delicious.",N
3770,"Can I say.... SEXIEST SHOWER EVER. This place is beaaauuutiful, the rooms are stunning and the shower is AMAZING... giant room with gorgeous tile, double-headed shower that makes you feel like you're under a waterfall. Super comfortable beds, 2 giant flatscreen tv's, floor to ceiling windows.. 2 small balconies overlooking the city. Upstairs lounge was also super fun, we went on a Thursday and it was more chilled out, older crowd and not so great DJ. On Saturday it was totally opposite... super pumped up crowd, great DJ, lots of energy and lots of sexy young people. A room in the hotel directly across from the club was rented and there was a girl dancing in her shorts and bra in the room for everyone to see... FUN!! The staff working at the Dana were also amazing, very friendly and helpful. The doorman (didn't get his name, young man with braids) was super friendly and cheerful every morning, and our bellhop T.J. was also super friendly and helpful. Great bartenders, friendly receptionists... All around an amazing experience which made my stay in Chicago absolutely special. Gym is nice, small but does the trick. A few treadmills and bikes, and some strength training equipment. The cardio machines have tv's with headphone jacks so I was happy : )",N
2696,"For my bachelorette party my awesome friends rented a suite at the James, it was amazing! They had a hookup on the TV so we could play Wii karaoke and there is a Trader Joe's right accross the street which was perfect for snack/alcohol runs. I love the modern style and furnishings. Our room had a seperate living room area and bar. The bathroom was huge and we all fought over the Kiehl's bath products. I swear everyone who works here is super good looking. We had room service for breakfast the next morning and it was delicious. I HIGHLY recommend booking the James. I am sure we got a little loud and they never complained. Just writing this review makes me want to have another party there!",N
5466,"Renovation: the process of restoring or improving a structure. Whether it's a simple update or a luxurious ""dream spa,"" The bathrooms here scream help!......... Where is the gay extreme makeover team when you need them? What can I say: Im a hotel snob too!",N
1224,"We were extended a complementary stay due to our dissatisfaction with our last visit over Valentines Day. Elizabeth Finifrock in Guest Services went out of her way to make up for our previous disappointment.  We were given the LakeShore Suite on the 31st floor, with amazing views of the lake, the loop and Soldier Field.  The suite was HUGE and luxurious, eminently comfortable and homey.  I think I'm spoiled for all future hotel stays ;). Upon returning from a trip to Shedd, we arrived back in our room to find refreshments waiting for us.  Elizabeth had recommended a restaurant  that proved to be a great choice!  The night was made complete with a complimentary ""sweet tooth"" tray of truffles and cheesecake ""pops""! The whole night - our anniversary btw - was amazing and more than made up for our disastrous visit previously. While I hate to think it takes a negative for a hotel or other service to change its tune, I AM happy to know that the folks @ Hyatt take our feedback seriously.  We had a great time.",N
4696,"Fun and funky decor, impeccably clean and fresh. We loved the Eco conscious amenities and great staff. The rooms are small, but comfortable. Great location. We will definitely come back when in Chicago again!",N
1532,"How can you people be okay with charging 42.00 a night for valet parking when the room was only 149.00 - That's just straight up mean. Anyways. Besides the stupid parking fees, I was pleasantly pleased with this hotel. For the price it's actually pretty great. We upgraded  (for 50 bucks) to a megasuite which is about 5 times bigger than my San Francisco apartment. It had three flat panel TV's, one of which was in the bathroom. Classy. Make sure you get one of the renovated rooms. They're pretty. I'd stay here again, just not in the middle of winter when the temperature is oh 10 degrees. It's not the hotel's fault, but what is that!",N
1729,"I really like the Kimpton hotel chain.  When coming to Chicago, this is a perfect hotel for me.  I like the unusual decorating, it's much better than the boring styles of most hotels.  I have to admit I am a HUGE sucker for the free wine each night.  Obviously, it isn't great wine, but it's free and a good way to start your night. The location was good for us.  We didn't hear the El, like another reviewer mentioned.  It wasn't right on the Mile, but that was fine.  We didn't mind walking a bit.  The conceirge was great about giving us restaurant recommendations that turned out to be winners.   Our room here was VERY small with a small bathroom as well.  It was recently redone and everything was lovely.  The bed was incredibly comfortable with high quality sheets and comfy duvets.   I haven't been back but will probably stay there when we return to Chicago.",N
3245,"This hotel is in the historical Carbide & Carbon Building and has a great location right off of Michigan avenue. The top of the building was actually featured in the movie Wanted, and I think that's pretty neat. The overall stay at the hotel was good with a nice clean room, fun decorations, and a neat overall feel. I enjoyed a drink at the bar and overall had a satisfactory visit. The price is fair for the location, but it is just neat to stay in a Hard Rock Hotel with all the cool memoribilia all around. I've stayed in quite a few hotels in the Loop and most are all comparable. Summary Good Location Good Rooms Fair Price",N
4494,"The Palmer House is so cool.  I stayed there a few months ago and got a great price on Priceline.  The room I stayed in had been updated and was very comfortable and very nice.  The hotel itself is just so old Chicago - historic and beautiful.  Several months ago I went with my daughter-in-law and son to look at the Honore ballroom for their wedding. It was stunning - a huge room with a marble fireplace - so elegant.  The ballroom is right outside of Potter's Lounge, very classy, hip lounge which we would have used for the cocktail hour prior to going to dinner in the ballroom.  You notice I say ""would have"" - so very sad. The wedding coordinator there met with us, showed us everything, provided some initial pricing and then NEVER got back to my daughter-in-law with a proposal.  I could not believe it.  She actually had the nerve to contact me at work about 4 weeks after we met with her to see if we were still interested!  Anyway, as pretty as the Palmer House was, my son and his gorgeous wife just held their reception at the W Lakeshore and it was awesome!   So, great historic hotel - very poor follow-up!",N
272,"I recently stayed here, mostly due to a fantastic deal I found on hotwire.  For the price I paid, it was certainly sufficient, but the rooms definitely could stand to be updated.  Beds were very uncomfortable, especially the pullout sofa bed in the king suite.  Tiles in the bathroom were coming off of the wall, and all appliances in the kitchen were very outdated. The service, however, was excellent.  I interacted with 3 or 4 different people at the front desk during my 2 night stay, and every single one of them was courteous and friendly.  They don't offer extensive concierge services, but they are able to book architecture boat tours through Wendella, which is nice to save you the hassle of getting to the ticket office early and booking a tour. Overall, it's a fairly no frills place but with a very friendly staff.  My main goal in booking was to get a cheap hotel near the mile but without visible bodily fluids or rodents/cockroaches.  Thankfully, I avoided that, but the rooms still could use a face lift.",N
1790,I like it.,N
2170,"I can't figure out how many stars this hotel has? Is it considered a three star or a four star hotel?  If it is considered a four star, its not a very nice one. I was here on business, so I didn't pay for the room (not even sure how much it was) but I found it adequate. I didn't use the pool or the gym, but ate quite a bit hotel food and found it to be about as good as hotel food gets. The bathroom sucked; I found the toilet a little gross--it had one of those handles you push with your foot, and the tub wasn't quite clean enough, the lighting was awful and the bath products smelled awful. As other reviewers noted the televisions are flat screens, but the programming isn't HD. Luckily, the bed was one of the more comfortable hotel beds I've stayed in and I liked the little couch in my room. I was on the 22nd floor of the main tower, but even there most of the views were blocked by adjacent buildings. I found the service to be a little slow, perhaps they are understaffed. However, the concierge was quite knowledgable and helpful. I find it annoying to wait in a line to check-in or check-out. I probably wouldn't stay here again. Compared to other hotels, this one seemed to lack some degree of polish.",N
4892,"We stayed here last weekend for 5 nights and were thouroughly impressed with the service and the amenities.You MUST suck it up and get the corner suite room with floor to ceiling windows!

5101,"For your buck you get a very nice hotel that has an amazing view if you can get lake side. Do yourself a favor and stay out of the mini fridge or you just might be drinking a $7 Evian water. Pretty ridiculous. The downstairs lounge is a nice place to relax and watch a game or the connecting Kitty O'shears Bar has a nice outdoor seating area. The room was very nice and comfortable. The bathroom was immaculate and clean, and the bed was very comfortable. I  usually do not sleep that much, but i just couldn't get out of bed because of the comfort. I also had a late reservation and they accommodated me very well.",Y
2220,"Cannot beat the location, entrance right out to Michigan St. Smiling Doormen made us feel welcome. Beautiful and classy lobby. Check in took awhile, seemed to take about 15 minutes per party but I guess that's just good guest service right? We were in what I believe was the older part of the hotel. Room was very small (which we expect in Chicago), and carpets were worn. Bathroom was very clean and seemed to be more updated than the actual room itself. Old TV (no flat screen). Starbucks in the hotel was convenient. Took forever to get our car from Valet parking but our vehicle eventually arrived without a scratch so all's well that ends well. Planning a return trip to Chicago soon and not planning to stay here. Lots of other places on the Magnificent Mile to try!",N
3520,"I wouldn't say this is a 4 star hotel; but for the price, it is definitely worth 4 out of 5 stars. The best thing about this hotel, is the location--so many places within walking distance!  It's located a block away from the (in)famous Magnificent Mile shops, close to tons of restaurants, near the Gold Coast and close to the ""L"" red line...which helps make even further away neighborhoods easily accessible. The rooms are average but clean, modern and very spacious.  The bathrooms, however, could use some updating.  The door seems to be a tad too big for the doorway (weird, I know), so closing and opening it was a bit of a struggle.  However, I was satisfied with the bath products (Neutrogena). As for the free wireless internet--I'd say it is a plus and at the same time a thumbs down.  Free is always a good thing...but it was insanely slow (I'm assuming bc everyone is using it). Overall, this place is an excellent bang for the buck.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay here, again.",N
2740,"Quite nice option tucked just off Michigan Avenue.  My king room was huge with a cute work table, a playful white pleather barcelona-esque chair with matching ottoman, and a small upholstered bench.  Comfy bed, lots of light from the windows, free wireless, porthole pocket bathroom door, ipod jack and kiehl's bath goodies pretty much sums it up.  The workout equipment is packed into a small space but very up-to-date and there are many machines.  The staff is extremely pleasant.  I, surprisingly, got a great internet rate and for the amount I paid, this was truly an awesome spot for my latest foray into Chi-town.  Extra bonus is having David Burke's Primehouse right downstairs.",N
4809,"This review pertains to actually staying at theWit Doubletree.  As the novelty and shine wears off this hotel (already displaying maintenance UNaddress problems both in rooms and public areas), along with staff that are just doing their jobs; will theWit continue to be rebooked, doubt it.  First and most importantly, theWit should start to realize Diamond Honor Members are the most active loyal REPEAT customer their hotel will book.   If they have no respect for these valuable Hilton members the word will get out and they will go to LOTS of other choices in the city of Chicago.  theWit staff not only turned off this SET of members from ever returning, but makes us question why we are so loyal to Hilton!   We were willing to try to experience what all the buzz was about for a VERY special evening event and theWit TOTALLY let us down from the Front Desk check-in to you name it.  By the way, The Roof bartenders do not know how to make a large variety of drinks correctly, especially for the price.   The wait staff are only interested in serving the younger trying to be hip customers, even to the point of ignoring a hand up in air signal.  Believe us, there are plenty of better views, trendy bars with classy people in attendance!The room size of their regular rooms are nothing to compare to other Chicago hotels.  The square sink is ridiculous and non functional, the shower apparatus needs to be removed and replaced with something that actually functions and gives some water pressure/flow.  Room service is a joke, got order totally wrong after long wait.   Top it off, every hotel we have ever stayed at for a special event has sent some sort of item to room as special touch from management.  This was noted on reservation and called ahead to ask for Honors upgrade was mentioned again.   We will be returning to our tried and true luxurious Chicago Conrad Hilton who knows how to treat loyal Hilton REPEAT members!!! We will not be recommending this hotel to our customers, friends or anyone how asks!",Y
2553,"Ok, if you read the other reviews I'm sure you can get a good feel for the place.  Went there last night for Maryanna's opening and def wasn't disappointed!  Good place to go relax, music was so-so... probably because I'm more into R&B/Rock/Hip-hop and the place played more House than anything else.  Drinks were on par with the scene (Upscale decor... higher prices) . This isn't the place to go if you just want to grab a few drinks with your friends... but is if you want to come out, meet a few people, and have a decent conversation.  The crowd was very diverse (big plus) and friendly (def a good thing).   Will probably go back next week is something is going on. Lata",N
3800,"This is definitely a hotel in its beta launch phase and still needs to figure out some details on their service: In our first room the shower would flood the entire bathroom, but dont worry, they will give you a room with a leakproof shower if you ask for it:-) Our toilet in the first room also did not flush properly. Also, the roof deck they are talking about is not open yet, although promoted on their website & expedia. But these are the only reasons for deducting a star, other than that it was a great experience, especially because they made up in a great way for these little failures. This is what really makes me like them: Great friendly staff, in a very chique hotel (interior is modern & tasty, great coffee in the room), and in the end  mistakes are just human. Admitting and knowing to apologize for them doesnt come naturally to most people and businesses, but they just do it. I also would love it if they had a pool, we had to stare jealously at the roof deck pools of our neighbours :-) But they told us they decided to go for a Spa instead. I think a pool would perfectly complement a Spa like this. The hotel is in a great location, the rooms are comfy, the interior of the rooms as well as the bar/restaurant downstairs is very modern, urban and tasty. Unfortunately we never ate there, its pretty pricey, also for the guests staying at the hotel. As for the hotel: You get great value for the price, if the rate does not exceed 300/night, everything beyond 330 is just too much for what it currently offers and right at the threshold of pain.",N
3625,"The Drake, for all you tourists and business travelers about to visit Chicago, is one of Chicago's classic hotels.  The Drake Hotel sign is clearly visible on the Chicago skyline, so you can't miss it.  I stayed there during a conference (thankfully paid for by my firm, since it's not cheap) and had a very pleasant stay.   While my colleagues were staying at more modern places like the W or the Marriot, I enjoyed the old-school vibe that the Drake had to offer.  No, there is no WiFi connection in the rooms, but the Ethernet jack in my room worked just fine.  I had a large corner room, which overlooked Michigan Ave.  I could have paid a little extra and got a lake view, but decided against it (at least on this trip). The WOW factor was clearly in effect too, since many of my resident Chicago friends were clearly impressed that I was staying at the Drake.   One thing to keep in mind is that the Drake is pretty far from the Convention Center, but getting a cab there took no more than 10-15 minutes.",N
1280,"Service.  It is truly what sets apart the Ritz chain of hotels from other hotels. You see it in the smallest ways.  The front desk clerk coming from behind the counter to personally hand you your key.  The doorman who runs back to your valet parked car to grab a bag you forgot and then brings it to the meeting room you are in.  The staff cleaning the public restrooms who greets you when you enter and says good bye when you leave. All small gestures . . . .but gestures that don't go unnoticed. The rooms are not as opulent as they might have once seemed as other chains have picked up their game but they are nice.  Oh sure, the rooms are over sized, and have a bed with the best  pillows, linens and duvets but they don't feel ""over the top"" as I used to think Ritz hotels were. The bathrooms are adorned with marble and feature L'Occitane products which are always appreciated.  And the deep tub is always welcome in a world of hotel rooms that is quickly becoming a ""shower nation"". Internet is free and there is a small mini bar in the room.  What was missing for me, though, was coffee in the room.  I know I could call and have a pot delivered to me, but i just wanted to slurp down a cup without all the hassle of getting dressed, etc. Many of the meeting rooms have terrific views of the lake and of the city.  Even the staff that work the private banquet functions are super friendly and nice, helping to do whatever you need even before you know that you need it. So I'll end as I began.  At the Ritz, it's all about the service.  And while that model has been copied by many of the high end resorts that I have the privilege to visit, it is still evident in everything that they do here.  And that is much appreciated by this ""road weary"" traveler!",N
3452,"The Allerton has a slick interior and accommodating staff.  Although the building was old, they had obviously  sunk a good amount of money renovating the rooms and lobby areas... if only some of that money had been used to better insulate the rooms. I may be slightly biased because I was stuck in a room directly across from the elevators during a completely sold out weekend... but I could hear every single word of every single conversation every single person had while waiting for the elevator at all hours of the night. Awesome. The rooms were a little small, but compared to a ""boutique"" hotel in, oh let's just say Boston, they were really not bad. Considering the price of the rooms, I feel like they could probably offer free wi-fi but nothing to split hairs over. The gym however, was wonderful. 2 full rooms,  3 treadmills, 2 bikes and a stair machine. 3 weight machines, mats in a mirrored room, free weights and weight benches... all with a nice view of the city. The only complaint is that the two water coolers were empty for the entire 5 days I was there. I would consider staying here again.. if given a different room, I might even be persuaded to give them an additional star.",N
5537,"4 stars for this hotel and all its amenities, pool, ice cream & popscicle dispenser, queen size but full looking beds, wide window facing the street and other businesses across the street. The staff was helpful, continental breakfast offered scrambled eggs and hard boiled on some days they offered sausage patties and bacon, there do it yourself waffle machines were excellent, orange juice, milk, water, and punch all good located everyday before 9am on the second floor rooms are clean, wide glass to view the outside, advertised queens looked like full beds, bathroom fairly large with a walk in glass shower. as for neighbor no loud heckling or jumping from the floor above us like some other spots. definitely would stay here again if I were to come back food **** continental breakfast offered until 9am get there quick before food is gone service **** helpful staff, price $$ standard ambiance **** clean, neat, pool is a tad small so is the jacuzzi only fits 2 at a time pool on the other hand is heated and indoors excellent choice for this quaint hotel",N
1615,"What a great view!  The room and bathroom were spacious... nice lobby... overall the hotel was chic but did not have that ""I'm-trying-too-hard"" feel to it like some other boutique hotels.   The staff was great and very patient with some day-of-arrival schedule changes caused by weather delays and cancellations at the airport.  Good customer service from the desk and door staff (I know it is their job, but they handled it well-- including hailing cabs and making sure we had umbrellas during downpours).   The only downside about the hotel is that the rooms do not have in-room safes.   I'll definitely consider staying again for business or pleasure, especially considering the rates.  It was convenient to the Hyatt and within walking distance of good restaurants, shopping, and the river walk.",N
4501,"Your lobby is georgous, but the table service sucks.  Lounging in the area between Lockwood and Potter's Lounge, I ordered a hot chocolate which arrived quickly enough, but when I tried to pay the lady, she said she'd come back.  She never did, even though other groups got their bills.  Trouble was, I was short on time and didnt have the patience for this shit, so I tried to track her down.  No luck.  Had to get the hostess at Lockwodd to find my bill, which by the way was almost $5.50.  For a small cup of hot chocolate and shitty service.  Go to hell.",N

753,"I'd really give this 3.5 stars if I could.  It was a little better than ""OK"". I'm kind of conflicted with this place.  The location is awesome.  Seriously.  There are plenty of places to eat and shop within a 15 min walk.  The area is very posh and clean - it's the Magnificent Mile for goodness sake! However, a few things kind of rubbed me the wrong way.  Some of them are things that the Westin could improve, others are just things you'd find anywhere in downtown Chicago and I should learn to deal with. First of all, forget self-parking unless you want to park at the Hancock across the street - even then I think you'll pay ~$40/day.   Parking at the Westin is $53/day.  I thought San Francisco was bad at $30 ish/day.  Oh well, that's part of staying downtown and it's not like the Westin is the only one price gouging.  OK, I'll move on. The rooms were small and boring - far too clinical for my taste.  Boring white walls, etc. The beds are awesome - that comes with the territory when you're dealing with Westin or the W. My bathroom had a faulty toilet. There was a TON of mold/mildew built up in the corners of the tub (both outside and inside).  What's disturbing is that they just tried to rub caulking over it rather than actually fix the problem.  I meant to take pictures and forgot.  However, feel free to visit room 949 and you'll get to enjoy it as well.  :p Wireless internet access is pretty awful (when you can get it to work).  It sucks being tethered to the desk but I had no choice most of the time. Room service prices were STUPID. Example: Small Cobb Salad and bowl of soup w/ glass of water.  $40.  WTF?  $5 delivery charge, 5% service charge, etc. They charged me double for parking on one of the days - that's $106 folks!  They fixed it of course. The front desk personnel are great - no issues with them at all.  I really liked the servers at The Grill (during breakfast).  They pretty much rocked and actually had a personality. So, if this Westin was in a worse location, I'd never return.  However, it is in a great location and they do run specials from time to time.  I just can't help but think that there might be better options out there for the money.",N
5637,i hate westin worst service ever. nothing else to say... don't waste your time going to this hotel,N
322,"If you like ""European Style"" hotels (but this one has a bigger and nicer lobby than you usually find in them), this place is for you.   I second David A.'s review right down to the last detail.  There were no issues with noise (or anything else, for that matter).   Tastefully appointed and decorated with contemporary style, but with that ""old building"" charm.   There's a 15 minute unmetered parking zone right in front, to help you get situated.   We left an article in the room on one of our two stays, and sure enough it was turned in and waiting for us at the front desk.  It was a light shell jacket and brand new, so someone in housekeeping would have been tempted to think ""look what I found"" ... but no;  so that's encouraging and consistent with our overall impression of the place. We were in town because a family member had been in an accident and was hospitalized at Illinois Masonic (4 blocks away).   We found out that City Suites has a special rate for that circumstance, so if you are in that situation, be sure to ask. We feel as if we found a ""second home"" in Chicago, and while no nice hotels in the city are inexpensive, this was well within the ""reasonable"" range.   Very relaxing ambience in a hustle-bustle neighborhood  helps to make this a winner, too. Both nights we got the ""last available"" room, so book ahead.  It's not a large property.   In reading others' comments, it appears our room locations must have been advantageous regarding the noise issues.   So ask about that when you book. Finally, the comment about ""quaint"" (including TVs) is puzzling.  They must have been doing some updating in some or all of the rooms.  We had a suite both times, both had sleek flat screens, and the furnishings and linens, etc... were in the category of ""chic"".",N
3033,"An occasional perk of having gainfully employed friends is the occasional business trip to Chicago. Another perk is dinner on them and a chance to inspect swanky hotels (and every now and again, the inspection turns into a mini-bar/chick flick slumber party). Such was the case in this... um...case. There are a few things to know about this particular W. It's hip. Bumpin' hip. Sparkly top hip. The design choices while interesting, are maybe not the most functional. For instance, the shower is half enclosed by glass with no door so you get a wet floor unless you put a towel down. Also, there's a window on the wall that separates the bathroom and the bedroom which is only closed by wooden shutters (as is the door). If you happen to be staying with someone you're not, say, very comfortable with, you may find it difficult to.... well... shy kidneys, ok? Don't make me say it. The flat screen tv is great, the in-house DVD and iPod players are excellent touches and every room encourages a visit to the sky bar with a free drink card (hello, Mr. Blueberry Mojito). The space is gorgeous, with fresh flowers everywhere that scent the lobby remarkably well. The indoor pool is housed in a space which is a bit dark, but is adjacent to a lovely teak-floored outdoor patio with chaise lounges and a lovely view of the Lake. The rooms are small and the popcorn ceiling was really bugging me given the other fancy pants elements (too picky?). My friend is a platinum member and requested a 4pm check out for me so I could sleep in, however at 8am housekeeping knocked and attempted the door (twice). A few hours later I got a call from the front desk inquiring when I was leaving... hmm. Not impressed by that. Overall I would recommend the W, especially to the young and easily impressed.",N
4640,"The bellhops and doorman are super helpful, the place is immaculately clean, smooth, and inviting.  It's a green hotel so I like that social consciousness as well. Lets start with the front desk service.  It needs some serious help in the 'service' department.  Dismissive comments and rolling your eyes doesn't help me when I ask you simple questions like 'Can you direct me to the nearest train stop?' 'Can you tell me how to get to Ukranian Village?""  I apologize, I am not a native of Chicago and yes - I'm a noob.  Thankfully I have an iphone and with an extra 5 minutes of research, yeah I can figure it out I guess - but thoughtI'd leverage the 'service'.    After I learned that lesson..  all was well.. on to the room. The room is super clean, nice, and the bed is amazing.  I mean really comfortable.  The blinds are bad ass.. no light is getting through them. It can be turned into a cave at 2pm with no light getting in.  Drawbacks - sound.  I can hear people coughing in their rooms, brushing their teeth, running the shower, slamming their doors.  The room I had was at the end of the hall way - Yet I could still hear the 'elevator ding' (located in the middle of the hall).   Thankfully I can overcome secondary sounds.. others may not. Overall I'd stay here again - I liked it.  If you have the extra cash, check out the spa - its an AVEDA spa on the 2nd floor.",N
2905,"Got a room for about $95 with tax for a night and it had a great view of Navy Pier and the lake.  The bed was comfy but the room was a bit hot but I could open my windows and enjoy the city sounds while taking a nap.  For the price I got off of Priceline, it was a good deal.   I did think a gun battle was going on around 7pm but turns out it was fireworks.  Needless to say, it's pretty safe around the hotel area although it is a little less populated than staying on Michigan ave.  The lobby area has a good view of a river or canal that is relaxing.",N
517,"For the amount of money we paid, this was a great hotel.  The hotel is located only a couple of blocks from Navy Pier and the Magnificent Mile.  Our suite had a queen size bed in the bedroom, as well as a convertable sofa in the living room.  The living room also had a flat-screen tv.  While all of these amenities were nice, in my opininon, the hotel's best feature is the complimentary manager's reception from 5:30 to 7:30 each night.  For two hours, they offer their guests free well drinks and free domestic draft beer, as well as free chips and salsa to snack on.  Needless to say, we took full advantage of the hotel's generosity during our three night stay.  Depending on what night of the week you are there, there may be a bit of a line for the drinks.  This was the case on a Saturday evening.  We quickly learned that the best way to deal with this was to get our drinks and then get back in line.  By the time we finished our drinks, we were at the front of the line and could order more.  The hotel also offers a complimentary breakfast from 6:30 to 9:30 on weekdays and from 7:00 to 10:30 on weekends.  We never woke up in time to make it to breakfast, but apparently they offer made to order omelettes.  Ironically, I think our taking advantage of the complimentary evening reception may have in part contributed to our inability to make it to the complimentary breakfast.",N
3964,"Congress was a great location and a nice hotel. We were charged $20 extra to have a fridge brought into our room which seemed a little steep. Also, after checking out our credit card was charged $25 additionally for each room we rented (3 rooms) for no reason. They said they would refund that amount but it was completely unnecessary.",N
24,"This is a gem of a hotel just off the Magnificent Mile.  The rooms are nothing to get excited about, but the location and the staff make it great.  If you're looking for the typical big chain hotel room, this isn't it.  If you want a quaint hotel, with comfy beds, hot water, and clean sheets, this is perfect.  Great rates available just check the hotel sites for deals. Ditka's place is right next door for eats, and Starbucks is across the street...perfect!",N
5741,"We had our wedding at this hotel. Overrall, a good experience, but just a few things that were a bit of a turn off. Our wedding coordinator quit 2 months before our wedding; the new one who started (Nicole) was good, but took forever to respond to phone calls & emails. The portion sizes during the tastings were misleading, and were not as large on the actual day...definitely about half the vegetables & potatoes we had initially seen. But overrall, the hotel was beautiful, and our bridal suite was amazing. Would recommend for a wedding, just stay on top of the coordinator!",N
2055,"We've used this hotel for the Chicago(ish) Tweetup 3 times now and they have bent over backwards to help make our stays more than pleasant! There always seems to be more than enough parking. There's convenient access to the brown line, taxis and the shops at the Mart. The rooms are clean and the views are spectacular. Even with conventions and weddings going on, my room has always been a quiet place where it was easy to fall asleep.",N
3756,I was just here for a yelp elite event and the service was wonderful! I had and leg and foot exfoliating treatment and a aromatherapy massage. Both left me feeling simply relaxed and ready to enjoy the day. The service was professional and the facilities are impeccable. Will have to come back and pamper myself on another rainy day!,N
5519,"First I travel 50+ nights a year so I see and experience the full spectrum of hotels. We picked this hotel which is blocks from our house to stay in with our dog while we had some home remodel work done. I have had my mom and aunts stay hear so we have used this before. Staff is nice and the location is great. The down side is the cleaning people do not clean. When we checked in and opened a dresser we were suprised to find condoms,lube and a dirty towel. NEVER ACCEPTABLE. My dog did not want to even stay in this room and we all moved after sticking it out for two nights and were unhappy. Request to stay in the new part of the hotel and experience will be like the higher rated reviews",N
3532,"Squee! I couldn't wait to get home from my visit to Chicago so I could rate this place on Yelp. Wow. Wow. Wow. Absolutely fabulous. Spent four days here, and the service was impeccable; from check-in time to the minute we left the place, every single thing was perfect. I made reservations a month in advance, and when I received my confirmation email a few days before our trip reminding me of my reservation (like I needed a reminder? Thanks anyway!), there was a note at the bottom notifying me of a $20 suite upgrade if I brought in the printout. So I did. I presented it during check in, fully ready to pay the 20 bucks to upgrade for a suite. If I'm staying in Chicago for four days, might as well stay in style, right? Well...I didn't need to present the confirmation form OR pay the 20 dollars -- they upgraded me for free. Wow. The room was amazing. There was plenty of room, and free wireless internet is always a plus. And our view of the city was FANTASTIC. Wow. I couldn't stop taking pictures. We had a few things that we needed to refrigerate, and I noticed in the guest book that they rented out small fridges for $25 a night, so I called housekeeping to get one. I wasn't excited about paying $100 for a fridge, but I needed it. Well, a few minutes later, the front desk attendant called and told me that the fridge was on it's way up to our room, and it would only be a $20 dollar charge for our entire stay. SWEET! I loved the location of the hotel. It was steps away from Michigan avenue, and there were plenty of bus stops around to take us anywhere else we needed to go.  It was 2 blocks from Giordano's! Can't beat that at all! Elephant & Castle is a cool pub connected to the hotel. The service can be slow at times, but the food is terrific. Don't skip out on that. The 40th floor lounge left a lot to be desired. You can get better drinks and atmosphere elsewhere. When I come back to Chicago, there's no doubt in my mind that I will stay at the Avenue again. It was amazing. I miss that place already. Oh, and they never did charge me for the fridge. Awesome! :)",N
4541,"We hesitantly booked through one of those discount hotel websites, boy were we surprised at the outcome. When we arrived we were bumped up to the executive towers, with private express elevators and lounge. The lounge had complimentary hors d'oeuvres each night, non-alcoholic beverages throughout the day, a wonderful breakfast and a private concierge. It has been quite sometime since we have had such an amazing experience at a hotel. The one downside was a pool under renovation.",N
140,"I'm going to start this review by saying that I really do despise boutique hotels. To think that for almost the same money I could stay at the Westin or Four Seasons and have all the ammenities I desire makes me wonder why I ever stay in boutique places at all. I don't care what anybody says, boutique means old. This boutique experience was a work necessity. They picked the hotel. It actually wasn't that bad. The staff when I got there was friendly. The staff when I left was friendly. I was the staff in the middle I didn't really appreciate. I also didn't appreciate the ancient elevator or the fact that I did end up in a lovely penthouse with a view only to wake up in the morning and realize the shower didn't work. After five calls to the front desk asking for a maintenance person to come up they sent the bellman instead to move my bags to another room. ??????? OK.... Anyway, when he moved me had he had the nerve to ask if I'd pulled the knob out! Of course I did! I'm not a freakin idiot. I do shower regularly. And in my showering career, I've definitely used a few different types of faucet. I've got it covered, I think. The bed at this place was actually really comfortable though and the mini bar was well stocked. This spot is walking distance to the best shopping in Chicago and also some great eats. I really enjoyed the close proximity to the Miracle Mile and Viagra Triangle.   The rooms were clean and well appointed. It was also nice to have the bar downstairs even if they did have last call at 11:30.",N
5725,"I was in town on business and was pleasantly surprised when my office booked my room here. This hotel is beautiful and the rooms are nice. Big Plus.... it's in the heart of Greektown, Great food is just a short walk away ( I recommend Greek Islands) Dugan's Irish Pub is across the street on Halsted.  Full bar with a great selection of Beers on tap....  This is a great place for drinks.",N
4893,"Sometimes it's the small touches that go a long way - for example, the very cool shower! I've never experienced a shower like that so there's something to be said for Dana for providing that!!",Y
5459,Huge bed. Loved the shower and tub.  Great for relaxing in after getting drunk. I had driven from California and didn't feel like risking my car out on the street so I paid $45 for each night of parking.  =/ Front desk was friendly and didn't seem to mind me being dressed in just a t-shirt and jeans.,N
5197,"I traveled to Chicago last year and booked here on a cousin's recommendation. The staff couldn't have been friendlier and the location more convenient (at Wacker Drive and Michiagan Avenue). Don't miss the 71 East Cafe, which has great options for lunch and dinner. My room was large, spacious and offered great city views. I snagged a low rate through http://www.getaroom.com. My only gripe was that parking was expensive, but it was to be expected considering the location.",Y
617,"3.5 stars. I want to give this place higher, but a couple of things just didn't cut it. Let's start with the positives, then move to the negatives. Pros - location: near Michigan Street a couple bus stops, which help - cookies: try them & you'll understand - lobby w/ free wi-fi - nice gym (open 24 hours a day) - comfy beds - nice pool Cons - my parents & bro/sis had a hard time getting extra toilet paper - the maid service took all day - a shower leaked/broke and took a while to fix - a charge for wi-fi in the rooms per day Overall we were pleased, but if you take the location away it might just be 3 stars. We got a pretty good price and we weren't in the hotel much anyways. I'm thinking I wouldn't mind staying there again if I visit, but I'd probably take my chances on Priceline and see what I get.",N
5534,"Great location right in the Loop area.   I was able to walk and see most of Chicago other than Lincoln Park/Zoo.  I stayed only for the weekend.  The staff at the desk were really nice.  I was really early so they let me check in my bags as I explored Chicago.  After exploring for several hours, I asked them if it was possible to check in early which they were able to accommodate me.   I like the hardwood floors in the hallway of the room and bathroom.  Room was renovated, clean, and up-to-date.  I was surprised with the nice amenities of a mini fridge and microwave.  LCD TV and free wireless was nice. The toiletries were pretty basic which was fine, facial/body soap bar and small bottle of shampoo/conditioner in one.   The free breakfast was ok.  Just your basic continental breakfast.",N
3607,"Ahh the Drake. I have grown up dreaming about the day I'd grace your presence. Alas...your just a really old hotel. Yes, the wood interior was gorgeous, and the hotel was beautiful...but: that's about it. I have gone to tea time, and that was fantastic! It's an experience you can't leave Chicago without. Staying there though...eh. Pass.",N
5756,"My favorite gay bars are located in Rogers Park (Touche & Jackhammer), so when I come to Chicago, I like to stay somewhere within ""stumbling distance"" to my favorite raunchy leather bars:  Heart O' Chicago fills the bill.  It's a scant 10 minute stroll from the motel to the bars that I like. This is a motel, people!  It's very outdated, but it's CLEAN.  The bathroom appliances (toilet, tub, sink) in my room were all 70's chic gold.   The king size bed was pretty comfortable, and the huge window was an added bonus. The walls are THIN, so you get to hear the dude in the room next to you bang his girlfriend at 6:00 AM -- which is an odd way to wake up.  For me?  I could care less -- it's all about the experience! The breakfast is pretty damn rad -- simple, but good. Oh, and the WiFi is powerful:  I asked the front desk, and their provider is Comcast, so you get uber fast cable Internet.  I'll never stay anywhere else in Chicago",N
4710,"I stayed here the first time I had ever been to Chicago. I came down for a grad school interview. i got this hotel through priceline for $55/night in Feb and I was definitely pleased given what I paid! the hotel isn't bad. I traveled alone so the room was plenty of room for me... it's not huge, but it's not small either. The hotel is very nicely decorated and the staff is very friendly... especially the doormen. I opted to not go to the restaurant downstairs (Elate) because after I looked at the menu, nothing really looked all that appetizing. The don't really have ALOT. But who know, maybe I should have given it a try. There is a fitness center, business center, free internet (which is always good), and free coffee in the morning. Wish I had a coffee maker in the room. My room also has no microwave or mini fridge. For what I paid I definitely feel like i got a VERY good deal. I'd definitely stay here again if I can get another good deal through priceline lol.",N

1741,"Hotel Allegro is the one shining light in my whole Chicago trip.  I knew I could depend on Kimpton to save the day.  As with all Kimpton properties, the hotel is very chic and the rooms have personality.  I booked a double room under a promotional code, so rate was about $119/night, which I think is a great deal for the location.  It's close to the CTA, so traveling around is super easy.  The only negative I can think of is thin walls, but I can live with it since I'm a deep sleeper.",N
146,"This is the best value hotel in Chicago hands down.  And I think it's because of all the renovations that were going on.  I read some other reviews and found that they've been going on for some time.  I always wondered why it was so cheap for a landmark hotel each time I saw it on Orbitz.  I'm sure the prices will go up once they are finished. My room had a sort of old charm.  I originally reserved a kingsize bed, but took the queen just so I could check in early.  Queen beds are pretty small once you've been sleeping in a kingsize for the better part of your life.  But it was sufficient. Minibar, check.  In-room safe, check.  Duvet, check. The location doesn't get much better.  You're a block away from Water Tower Place and everything you need is in walking distance.  If you take a quick trip down the alley adjacent to the hotel, you'll find yourself at a Starbucks, and if you take the alley across the street, you'll find an Einstein Bros. bagel shop.  Both among my favorites. My only complaints: They charged for crappy ""wired"" internet. When I checked in, I told them that my flight wasn't until 7pm on my day of departure and they suggested I book another night--which I did.  Meanwhile, on the insert that my room key came in, they said that for $60, that they can accommodate late check-out up to 6pm.  So I reversed the reservation and told them I'd like to take advantage of their $60 charge instead.  When my check-out time came, I called just to confirm that I would be leaving late and the guy said I could stay until 1pm.  Why would I pay $60 to stay an extra hour when I could have booked another night for a preferential rate of $90?  Finally after a bit of attitude, he agreed to let me stay until 5pm.  I left at 4.",N
4552,"Oldest hotel in North America. Truly Chicago's Landmark! Handpainted ceiling in the lobby by French Artist, all the bronze and crystals bring the charm of 19th Century.

2919,"I have big expectation out of hotels. Especially Sheraton hotels. I have been staying at Sheraton hotels in most of my conferences. They have not done me wrong. This one in particular was as good as the other hotels. However, the little things annoy me a little. For one thing, my door is located perpendicular right next to another room. Why the heck would you do that? I can hear every time someone come in and out of that room, and it would wake me up in the middle of the night. I should really not deduct a star for one particular room because not all the rooms are that way. I guess I'm getting soft... Or I just like Sheraton hotels that much... =P",N
4236,"Nothing special, nothing bad. Nice staff, conveniently located. Not the four seasons or anything. Restaurant service was VERY slow, but food was satisfying.",N
1698,"Why is it that hotels feel they can impress you with a monster lobby and then cram you into a tiny room? I don't know about you, but that just don't seem to add up. In fact, the Allegro doesn't just have one lobby - it has two. You walk in on the ground floor, with a very impressive staircase leading upwards to, wait for it, the real lobby! It's an elegant, gorgeous and spacious room that's well-decorated and filled with people. It actually took me a moment to find the check-in desk, as it was tucked away in the corner of the room. ...or maybe I just got distracted by the free wine bar. As I would later learn, there is a complimentary wine tasting everyday which includes red, white and house sangria. Oh baby. I checked into the hotel, was given my room key, headed upstairs and found - a tiny room. A bed, a TV tucked in the corner and just enough room for a desk and a night table.  When the bathroom doors open, they almost touch the opposite wall. Everything felt cramped in the worst way possible. The room was also decorated with this 1970's wallpaper of a white background with brown circles and squares. I looked at it for a few minutes and actually felt reality start to slip away from me as I slowly began to loose my mind. Thanks Hotel Allegro for that experience. Plus, they had this funky rounded sink that splashed water on me every time I turned it on! Every time! Gah! There was free Internet, which was nice, but you had to first sign up for a really annoying honored guest program to get it. Somehow, I felt less than honored if I had to jump through hoops to get Internet - but that's just me. So, for the splendor and free wine of downstairs, I'm giving a 5, but for the room, I'm giving a 2 - and rounding down to about a 3. And that's what I have to say about that.",N
2514,"Large hotel, small rooms, great housekeeping, but could use some updating and is ridiculously expensive. Don't even consider room service. Valet parking: $55; self parking: $45! Don't buy that it's close to the Bears Stadium either... it is quite a walk.",N
2920,Actually went to the Sheraton Hotel and Towers for a conferance for work. My rating is for the conferance rooms and not the hotel rooms sense I didn't actually stay at the hotel. While I really enjoyed the location of the hotel I felt the conferance rooms were poorly laid out. Some are upstairs some were down stairs. Also the temperature in the conferance rooms was freezing. I mean I had to take a few breaks and go outside because my hands were ready to fall off. The location is very nice however and the guest rooms look like they would have great views. Access to public transportation is also good from here.,N
67,"If you like a hotel that you spend almost $200 to be comfortable DO NOT STAY HERE! Just stayed for one night Sept. 11. Most of the hotels in town were booked and we thought for $200 and discovering a new neighborhood for us in Lincoln par would be fun. I have never dreaded going back to a hotel to sleep for the night. Yes it's old, but apparently that also means dumpy. Postage stamp for an elevator, narrow dark hallways, and dark old rooms with an old TV and an outdated bathroom that really needs some bleach! Our room was a smoking (tried to save $10) and boy did it stink! Our air conditioner didn't actually cool very well, and made a funny noise ALL night. The only thing I felt was clean were the sheets and I was still thinking about the possibility of bed bugs.  The staff were not friendly, saw them give attitude to another guest who did not want to stay once he actually saw the rooms. Next time, stay at the Club Quarters in the loop for the same price.",N
2633,"The James Hotel treated us like money even if we're more like pesos.  From the time we entered the door until the time we checked out, everything about the place was first class.  They helped us celebrate our nine-year anniversary by upgrading our stay to a suite.  They also completely covered the room in rose petals and had a bottle of champagne and chocolate strawberries waiting for us as we entered the room. The hotel's location is great as you're within walking distance to most of the touristy areas in the City and only a block or two away from the red line.  It's a perfect hotel in a perfect location and I'm glad I found the hotel on Yelp before I made a reservation at one of those corporate hotels that don't pay attention to the details.  When I travel I want to feel taken care of and this place did its best to make us feel like we home away from home. This place is so money, it makes me want to party.",N
4528,"Last fall I was at the Palmer House Hilton for a law firm awards dinner in the Grand Ballroom.  The service was speedy and well choreographed, the food was good, and the room itself was ornate and beautiful.  It's a great traditional old-school hotel.  Potter's Lounge at the Palmer House is also a good lounge/bar to go for drinks and appetizers after work.",N
3716,"A very historic looking building.  I have status with Hilton so when I stayed here they upgraded me to an executive floor and a pretty large room.  I tried to request a suite, but they couldn't give it to me.  No matters though I was here with the wife, but I was in town for work and I'd be only at the hotel to sleep anyway.  The room was spacious and there were two bathrooms, which made the morning convenient for us.  The gym has pretty modern equipment and it's decent from what I can remember.  I was working late a l ot of the days so I barely had time to use the gym.  The hotel front desk staff and all other staff were all very friendly and hospitable.  There's always Granny Smiths apples at the front desk which I can grab a couple and eat them later.  I also have access to their club floor to have breakfast and end of the day cocktail hour.  The view from the club floor is sweet.  It overlooks Lake Michigan and you can have your breakfast and enjoy the view.  This place is right by Michigan Ave so you can get to all the shops from here not to mention hop on a bus to get where you need to.  My wife and I took the bus to park during the weekend when the Taste of Chicago was going on.",N
3914,"One star since negative stars are not possible. Please, for your own well being, stay away from this place.  The rooms were hideous, the carpet covered in cigarette butt holes and odd stains, and the bed smelled in the most peculiar way. Stayed in many hotels, motels, inns, etc. and this may have been the worst.",N
4686,Named our price on priceline not knowing what we were going to get and we ended up with a nice hotel. The only reason i am giving 3 stars is because the rooms are so small. The hotel was clean and smelled great but the room was tiny not even a dresser. I had stayed the earlier part of the week at the Swissotel and with the size of the rooms and the views there it is hard to compare the two. The staff was very friendly and the bed was very comfortable. I did like the free wifi and free parking for hybrids which is a big plus in a town where parking is close to $50 a night.,N
1951,"We stayed here during a recent trip to Chicago.  The hotel is located in the heart of downtown Chicago's ""Loop"" and is central to just about everything.  Service was very prompt and courteous during our 5 night stay.  We even got one night free for staying over four nights which was nice considering the room was over $500/night.  The Lobby bar (more like a swanky nightclub/lounge) was very impressive - with vast soaring ceilings, comfortable ultra modern furniture and a live DJ.  Images were being projected all over the walls as we enjoyed top notch drink service.  The restaurant in the Hotel is small but perfect for lunch or an intimate dinner.  The 24/room service catered to us well during the entire stay.  I still can't get over the $9 bottles of water and the lack of free WIFI  - but the room was spacious and the beds were UNBELIEVABLY comfortable.  No real views in the entire hotel (we were on the top floor) because the building is surrounded by taller highrises.  Very few complaints - The ""Acura Experience"" where you make a call to Concierge and have a new Acura SUV as an included car service to escort you around the city at any time was VERY nice!!  Didn't have to take cabs very often.  Overall I would recommend this hotel to those looking to stay in the center of everything.  It is a fun place, and I can't say enough about the gracious staff or exceptional atmosphere!",N
2184,"I have two very embarrassing stories I could print here in relation to the Intercontinental but I will let your little Yelping minds wonder.... Lovely hotel with a lot of nostalgia.  The beds are not so comfy in my opinion (stay at the Wyndham and you will agree) but the decor and the amenities are quite nice.  I'd give the IC more star-power if it weren't for a few things: 1.  Poopy internet in my room and even worse in the meeting rooms 2.  Food that consistently gave me heart-scarring indigestion I hate i didn't get a chance to chillout in Eno, but I am sure I will be seeing the IC again.",N
2756,"There are just a couple of things that hold me back from giving the full five stars. One is that many of the rooms are interior-facing and have absolutely no view [except into other rooms, which may or may not be OK depending on who is occupying them]. The other is the simple fact that the bar for hotels in Chicago is so high, and this place isn't quite as slick as the Peninsula or Four Seasons. That said, it also doesn't cost nearly what those places do, so the value for price is terrific. I'd recommend registering your e-mail with them on-line. I got a great e-mail offer for $129/night with a $50 food-and-beverage credit that was a wonderful bargain. The lobby is long and narrow, with a small lounge to the left just outside David Burke's Primehouse. That restaurant offers amazing lunch bargains, so it's certainly worth checking out midday. Their side of steamed asparagus with shallots is amazing. My great rate was actually for a studio suite--not just the standard room. When I first walked in the room, I wasn't sure about it, but after hanging out a few minutes, I really got to like the layout. The sleeping area is very small, far away from the door. It's really kind of a nook, with just the bed and two wall-mounted shelves that serve as bedside tables. There's also a flat-screen TV there. Most of the space in the studio suites is devoted to living area, which, when you think about it, is really where you want your space. There's also a huge bar with full bottles [not minis] of several liquors and a well-stocked fridge. There's plenty of shelf and counter space included with the bar, as well as an iPod-ready stereo. There's lots of glassware, but only martini glasses and highballs. No wine glasses or swizzle sticks. Oh, and ice is provided by room service. I'm on a campaign to get hotels to put ice machines on each floor. No one wants to have to call and wait. The room decor has a mid-century feel, with low-slung, clean-lined furniture. The color scheme is mostly brown and off-white, with big splashes of red for accent. Most of the lighting is on dimmers, so you can adjust it to your mood. All in all, it's a pretty attractive room. The bathroom is narrow with a tub/shower combo, but plenty of counter space. It's been renovated since it was the Lenox Suites, but there's a little wear and tear showing, such as chips in the bathtub molding and an unraveling robe. This was a quick trip, so I didn't get to check out the spa, gym, or JBar. Next time. Service is of the friendly and efficient type, rather than the formal and polished as at some of the highest-end places in town. Had no issues with getting what I needed, though. Room service breakfast was prompt, tasty, exactly as ordered, and in large portion. Others have commented about problems with the elevators, but I had no long waits at all. They are smallish, though. Location is perfect, two blocks from the Grand Red Line stop, one block from the Mag Mile, across the street from a Trader Joe's, and two blocks from a P. F. Chang's and a Joe's Seafood if you want chain food. If you're a hotel freak like me and want to check out some others, you're in pretty easy walking distance from a huge number worth looking at--Trump, Conrad, Peninsula, Park Hyatt, Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Drake. The Coq d'Or at the Drake is the perfect old-school hotel bar. They started serving ten minutes after Prohibition was repealed and the bartenders all look like they've been there since that day. If price is no object and you must have the best in Chicago, check out the Peninsula. If you're looking for the point where price and quality cross on the grid, look no further than the James.",N
3328,"YouSwoop gave me a $99 deal on this room!  We received two complimentary drinks from the in-house bar, discounts at Hard Rock Cafe if we had chosen to dine there, and just overall a fun night.  The bed was a very comfortable king, the hotel itself is hold but historic, each floor appears to be themed by a different rockstar/band, and the staff is very helpful with any questions that I had. I live in Chicago, mind you, but not in the loop, and just jumped on this YouSwoop when I saw it.  It's like a mini-vacation in your own home city, being pampered a little, so it was totally worth it.  The bar was really awesome, too, and we enjoyed our drink and our time there. I really enjoyed my stay at Hard Rock.  It's in a great location - in between the loop and River North (restaurant central), by all the shops (maybe someday I'll have money to peruse them)! Just wish they had a pool!  But most hotels in Chicago do not due to some city statute or historic building code.",N
2752,The James is a nice joint that has a hip personality. I stayed 2 nights this winter and my only complaint is the highly overpriced and watered down drinks at the bar.,N
1402,"We enjoyed our stay at Millenium Knickerbocker.  Staff was cordial and the place was clean.  Very pretty hotel in a great location off of the Magnificent Mile with shops and eateries close by.  Room was small but, very nice design.  Nice shower in the bathroom.  Room was very cold at night but, changed thermostat in the morning with no problem.  This hotel does put a $75 hold on credit card which I found strange.  Have not had a hotel do that before.  We did not get anything from the bar so the amount was never credited to my account but, it was annoying knowing it was a pending charge for 4 days till it was officially taken off.",N
4448,"Kind of weird interior.  Almost reminded me of a funhouse, all the uneven floors and stuff.  My room was tricky to get to but  huge when I got there.  The light switches and some of the fixtures could be updated to be a little more useful but the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was classy.  I was here for a roller derby tournament and I am not quite sure that they were ready to be invaded by that.  But to their credit, they did quite well at managing both a formal wedding and a large gang of after-party attendees waiting for their party to start. Parking sucks.  30 bucks a day to park yourself, 50 to have them park it.  I wish I had parked somewhere else and taken the train in, every line stops right near there since it is in the loop.",N
4371,"Hotwire landed me here for $75/night.  Since I wanted a Loop hotel that wasn't a hooker hotel but still within my ""work is NOT paying for this"" budget.  So I was not unpleased that I'd be staying here.  My grandparents' best friends had honeymooned here, so it had some third-hand nostalgia going for it.  Throw in a fab location, and I was thrilled when I walked in. If the hotel were a person, it'd be old-money.  (Like the cranky great-aunt you hope to inherit from.)  But like old-money, there's some rust around the edges.  The lobby is amazingly gorgeous.  No hands down.  The guest rooms... kinda small and shabby, for a Hilton.  The closet and bathroom were tiny.  There was only about a foot of clearance betwixt door and dunny in the loo, and that doesn't really work.  There was only about 6"" of vanity space on either side of the sink.  I'm sure this was standard when the place was built, and it's modern standards that have changed.  But still.  It's a bit cramped, and it was just me in the room. Realistically, it's an older building, and a skyscraper at that, which is going to entail lots of structural support to work around.  Revamping the guest rooms would probably entail knocking down walls and re-doing entire floors, which would be disruptive to other guests, a loss of revenue, and there'd be fewer rooms available in the end.  (I think.  I'm a CPA, not an architect, but to my amateur eyes, it does not look like it'd be an easy remodel.)  Sorry.  HGTV moment.  Where was I?   Also like old money, this place can be cheap in irritating ways.  $15 (or more) for internet in your room, and wired at that, so no surfing while sitting in bed.  $7 for an hour for internet in the lobby.  WTF?  On the one hand, if I lived in Chicago, and the lobby had free internet, I'd be inclined to take up space there quite often.  On the other hand, $7 for an hour of internet in the lobby??   I've never been somewhere where internet in the lobby came at a price.   (There was too much stone for my T-Mobile smart phone to get any signal.  Which meant I missed a couple calls.  Grr.) Thanks to Yelp I was forewarned about early check-in fees and late check-out fees.  I was honestly surprised that storing my luggage didn't come with a fee.   I didn't interact much with the staff, but they seemed very professional, especially at the front desk.  (I'd put my hotel room keycard behind the magnet closure in my purse, so I had to get it re-programmed at 1:00am.  They asked for ID, which is reassuring, for safety reasons.) I'm glad I came here, at least once.  The public areas are beautiful, and I like pretty architecture.  I probably wouldn't seek it out again as a place to stay, though.  I would, however, definitely be willing to meet people in the lobby for cocktails.  As long as we didn't expect to use our cell phones to find each other.",N
1745,"As a positive the hotel itself is in a decent location, located in the financial district. Keep in mind that a lot of places roll the carpet up at 9pm because of this location. There is a bar next door to the hotel but it was not open on Sunday...or at least the Sunday I was there. The rooms are very small, the decor is nice and everything was very clean. They do not have a restaurant onsite but to offer limited room service. The rooms are equipped  with stocked mini bar and snacks. Wifi is available as well. All and all a very decent stay especially suited for people who will be out exploring all day.",N
4365,"This gets 4 stars instead of 3 because I am in absolute, mad, historically infused love with the lobby and the building.  This is a grand dame.  The lobby and ballrooms are the stuff of guilded age fantasy-- Tiffany doors, lots of gilding.  I just finished reading ""Devil in the White City"" so I enjoyed the continuing history lesson.   Although I did not partake of the restaurants, the high tea looked adorable and the bars looked elegant and pleasant.  They have a Starbucks downstairs!! The staff was increadably nice and helpful. The beds were very comfortable, piled with high quality pillows and down comforters and laid out with soft, high thread count sheets.  They were wonderful and relaxing.  The room was large, pretty and clean.   The price was not bad-- $118 for a king sized room on New Year's Eve weekend, using our AAA discount. Problems: the noise and the bathrooms.  Our room was near the El, so we enjoyed a muted whoosh every 15 minutes or so.  The windows were double paned, so it sounded like a very heavy gust of wind, rather than a Blues Brothers tenament teeth rattling.  The walls were not soundproof, so I know when our neighbors used the loo or when the maid pulled the cart down the hall.  Also the bathrooms were very small.  Very, very small.  And spartan.  Certainly not fitting with the rest of the place. Also, bring change.  There are no coffee makers, and the $2.50 soda machines don't like dollars.",N
756,"At the end of the day, you get what you pay for. I think in general Westins are the best value for your dollar. The Westin Michigan Ave is no different. Its a solid hotel. If you enjoy your heavanly beds and showers, this is a good hotel for you. Be advised though, this hotel has some of the same problems many older hotels have in Chicago. While this property has definately gone through a facelift to renovate both the public spaces and the rooms, you still have some rooms that are very oversized and not furnished with enough furniture. Our room was no exception. However, they attempted to fill the space by marketing it as a Westin Workout room with a stationary bike and some workout equipment in the room. Overall, this hotel is pretty good. Its not as nice as a the four seasons but not as bad as the Palmer House Hilton.",N

273,"""Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with course and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: 'Is this the condition that I feared?'"" - Seneca the Younger, Ancient Greek Philosopher While Seneca's meditations on the ills of material wealth are inspirational and thought-provoking, they do not give you much solace when you are staying at a hotel which provides fare which can best be described as scanty and cheap.   The service was no exception.  Just one example: I had a reservation for a queen bed, which they would not change to two doubles.  When I arrived, I had in my room what was clearly a full sized bed (smaller than a double sized bed).  When I asked for a room with a queen, or in the alternative, a rollaway bed, the lady at the front tried to argue that it was indeed a queen bed in my room (without looking at it) and refused to bring even a rollaway without a $50 fee.   Seneca would have been proud of the Seneca, but I certainly am not.",N

It's an Added bonus for the suburban people that can just take the L down there and save the $49 a day valet fee.",N
1425,"Wonderful!!! We stayed in the winter time (obviously, very off-season), but we scored the room for $70/ night from Hotwire. It's in a great location, the staff was wonderful, and I found the building to be quite charming. The bed was unbelievably comfortable, and the bathroom was one of the nicest I've ever encountered. I would definitely stay there again!",N
4636,"Stayed here on a recent trip to Chicago.  Chose it because of the location, the price, and the fact that you can valet park your hybrid FOR FREE!  Yeah that last point kind of sold me on it. As for the rooms, yes they are small, but whatever.  They are clean, seem kind of hip, and the bed is totally freakin' amazing.  Like seriously the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in.  And I guess the blackout curtains would have been nice if I didn't have to wake up at the crack of dawn every morning I was in Chicago for a conference... I personally did not have a problem with the sink but I can see how people might, and the shower is wonderful.  Not to mention the H20 brand toiletries, a local Chicago brand, nice touch! On to the service.  The doormen are so nice.  So nice in fact when I saw one of them on the street a few blocks from the Hotel he said hello and wished me a wonderful day.  The front desk staff are another story.  They are baffled by what I would consider normal touristy questions such as ""how do I get to this neighborhood"" etc.  They actually gave us the wrong information.  Good thing we didn't listen to them. Also, the noise level may bother some.  You can hear a lot.  You can hear the elevator ding.  You can hear the shower next door.  You get the picture. But yeah, stay here because of the location, price, FREE parking (if you drive a hybrid), and the eco-consciousness factor.  Ignore bitchy staff.",N
4150,"To close out a week in Chicago we stayed at the Hyatt Regency. This Hotel is HUGE! The fact that they give you a map upon check-in confirmed just how big it was. Great hotel for a last minute stay right in the thick of everything. We were able to walk/shop down Michigan Ave. and relax at the bar. Great atmosphere, nice decor. Not a fan of their shuttle service and the although the bar is SUPER nice the service is SUPER horrible.",N
2768,"Simple, modern and chic. I can't think of a better hotel in Chicago for business or vacay. The gym is excellent and the staff (especially Stephanie Metler in sales) is top notch. I'll definitely be back! The only downsides are the somewhat loud air conditioners in the rooms and a lack of a rooftop pool (like the manhattan James).",N

651,"This DoubleTree did not let us down, it was exactly to the standard that we expected. We did have a bit of a hard time with the room keys which was annoying but the staff was quick to fix any problems or issues we brought up.

My only gripes were that they have a super-ultra-modern theme and big 'ol tube TVs in the rooms from 1990... it might be time to upgrade, oh and the wifi is $10/per day if you want it in your room, it's only free in the lobby, which was pretty blah if you ask me.

Seriously, that was probably the best thing I've ever eaten at a wedding.  I want to go back for more!  It was a pretty big wedding of over 300 people, but I dont think that is an excuse for nothing but exceptional service.  Our corner table was forgotten a few times, and I even had to get up to ask someone to deliver our pasta dish.  All in all, the food was good even if the service wasn't.  Plus, I loved the room the wedding was in.  I'd definitely recommend checking it out for your wedding.",N
4733,"We booked Hotel Felix using Priceline for my family and me. We were shocked when we got this boutique hotel, as we have successfully used priceline in the past for many family outings in the city.  We definitely were hesitant once I read the reviews.  We checked in at 3:30 and they did not have two queen beds available.  We were then told that if we can wait 30 minutes they will have a room ready.  Great!  We took the kids to dinner (and told them we would be back in an hour).  We got back to the hotel a little after 5:00 and the room was still not ready.  We finally got into our room at 5:30.  During our wait, a hotel representative came out and gave us two drink tickets (a glass of wine was $11 each) and two boxes of chocolates for the kids.  This was not a great start since the hotel lobby alone is not kid friendly.  I felt like I had to keep shushing my kids (8, 6, and 3).We finally got into our room with two double beds.  Oh my, this is the SMALLEST room I have ever stayed in.  I stayed in much larger rooms in Europe and New York.  I completely agree with one reviewer that stated it is smaller than a cruise ship room.  We had no more than a few feet between the wall and bed.  I nailed my leg on the bed frame pretty good navigating between kids and luggage and I am sure our hotel neighbors heard me scream.  Again, this is not a kid friendly hotel!  The bed seemed smaller length wise (both my husband and mine were hanging off and we are under six feet tall).  The bathroom was clean, the middle table with the clock and lamp has never been dusted.  The HVAC was loud and rattled throughout the night...a sign that this was an older building with updates.  There was no desk for working - it was a small table with a tiny lamp - not sure how useful that would be.  Although the free wi-fi did work well.In the morning, my husband went down for complimentary coffee and they forgot to refill the pot at 8:30 AM and again at 9:30 - not 4-star service as it's listed on Priceline.This is the first time I have ever done a review.  I cannot stress how disappointed this hotel was labeled 4 stars.",Y
3119,"i love this W Hotel mostly because of location, location, location! i usually visit over long holiday weekends ... twice per year, or so. i lived downtown in Streeterville for many yrs so staying at this W is like a homecoming party to me ... but perhaps, too much party? my big knock on W is inconvenient access ... never ever check-in on a friday or saturday night. last time i arrived 10pm on a friday night, it was a zoo. i roll up in a cab with bags and found a line out the door. W has gotta decide whether to be a club or a hotel, i think. after getting thru the party line (excuse me, pardon me, sorry) i finally reach the front desk for a quick check-in, no problem. but it is still really odd to have partygoers checking you out while you're simply trying to check-in ... a bit disconcerting. had i known, i might have dressed for the check-in?!? (lol) parking fees are expensive because spaces are precious. some streeterville parking spaces can sell for +$50,000!!! so taxi to/from W at all times.  it's cheaper and convenient. you can walk the magnificient mile or pier on nice days too. the food is good.  i love the breakfast menu and the openness of the restaurant - lounge area, garden, lake view - refreshing. the rooms are comfortable, artfully designed, and spacious. i prefer the relaxing lake view but the city view is also good. i do not use the pool or spa but most say they are nice too. i love to run the path that stretches for miles along lake mi. and of course if you wanna party, friday/saturday is rockin! ;)",N
427,"Another non-snarky review from a proletarian Yelper-- The South Loop Hotel is quite a bargain and much nicer than some reviewers might suggest -- it has free parking!  The staff works hard to be pleasant and accommodating.  The desk clerk Kierra was very sociable when I checked in, and within five minutes of getting to my room, she called to be sure everything in the room was acceptable (I've never had that happen before).  At dinner, my waiter, James, was equally nice: when I asked him to wrap up the few remaining mini-corn muffins for later, he threw in a few extra from the kitchen--a great midnight snack.  The other few people with whom I had contact were equally helpful.  The whole staff--clerks, bartenders, waiters --  try hard here.  (And there's free parking!) My room was quite comfortable and spacious, and even though there is an el just a block away, the room was quiet.  The bed was quite firm, which I liked.  But others may find the beds here a little too hard.  The bathroom appeared to have been updated recently.  The bathtubs are rather deep, so be careful stepping in. The hotel is in an isolated part of Chicago, so you can't really walk anywhere.  But then, as I've said--free parking! I paid only $90 for the night.  Yes, I could have paid 2X (or 3X) that for an uptown room with minibar free Starbucks valet service room service in-room pedicures and gilt-edged Bibles in the night-stand.  But all I want when I stay over in Chicago is a room in which I can sleep comfortably and safely. And free parking.  And two hard-boiled eggs.",N

3376,"Overall I think we got what we paid for. I liked the location.  Right on Michigan within reasonable (to my wife and I) walking distances to the museums and loop.  Slightly out of the way for walking to anywhere much north like the Mag Mile or Navy Pier. The rooms were reasonably sized.  They were an odd mixture of very new and modern very old barely maintained fixtures from when the hotel was built in the 60s.  For example, new marble sink counter and newer white bathroom tile with a bathroom door that must have had 12 coats of paint on it. The wireless Internet was pretty annoying.  You had to get a pass code from the front desk for every 24 hour use.  I wish I could have just paid for wireless the entire stay. One day housekeeping took our door tag and I had to get a new one from the front desk.  Another day, our neighbor across the hall took it.   The staff at the front desk was always courteous and willing to help. We stayed for a week and had to play an interesting game of musical rooms.  Before flying out, my wife called to confirm that we'd have our requested king-sized bed.  After we checked in and got into our room, we discovered...two full-sized beds.  We complained and they put us into a very nice corner room with a queen.   We would have loved to have stayed there but there was an incredible banging of pipes, presumably due to the cold weather fighting with the heating.  To get a feel for how this sounded, take a metal pot and start tapping it with a spoon increasingly harder for about 2 minutes.  Stop for 10 minutes.  Repeat.  Imagine sleeping under these conditions.  One desk member acted surprised and another said, ""Yeah, I've heard of people having problems in the corner rooms"". There was no way we could sleep in there another night so we got yet another room but since it was the weekend, all they had were rooms with twin beds.  Given that we couldn't sleep in the other room, we had no choice but were told that the next day they'd have rooms available with king-sized beds. Sure enough they did.  Except the lights on the bed did not work and the toilet seat would not stay up.  At this point I was tired of the moving and wasn't bother by peeing sitting down for the rest of my stay. For a one or two night stay, I wouldn't have any problems returning.  But for any longer, forget it.",N
3918,"Bah.  I didn't realize how much yelp needs 0 stars.  I'd use -1 stars if I could.  This hotel is *awful*, and deserves every bit of my worst review yet. I travel a lot for work.  Like most of the week, most every week.  The fact that I know hotels is a given. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.  (and when I was under 18 working for a small company with no hotel reservation in Houston, there was NO VACANCY anywhere, and I had to stay in a place that rented rooms by 15 minute increments and had mirrors on the ceiling. Not joking.  Horrid.) If I had the option, I would stay in a Motel 6.  I am not kidding.  There just isn't one close enough. I am not sure where to start.  Paint is peeling from everywhere.  Carpets appear to have been stained since the 70's.  Water pressure is low, and showerheads seem to have been made for midgets.  The halls are not even air conditioned.  This is even a problem when it's 60 degress outside and beautiful.  Saying the rooms ""have a smell"" is generous.  They reek.  Bathrooms have warped doors that rarely close, missing tiles from everywhere, stains on the walls/toilets/tubs. The lights dim when you plug a freaking iron in.  *IF* you can find a plug that doesn't appear to want to shock you.  Also, it seems to be impossible to cool the rooms to a reasonable temperature for sleeping. And lo and behold, they have internet access?!  Oh wait.  It's corded and the cord is 3 feet long.  And no desk.  I'm not sure how I am supposed to use this.  And it's $10.  What the frick, can you say table steaks?   I'm down with classic hotels.  I'm in Chicago, of course there are cool old buildings.  However, someone of influence needs to contact the owners of this hotel and let them know that ""old and disgusting"" does not equal ""classic and classy"". I don't like giving bad reviews.  But this place is a stinker. Update: Added a couple pictures of the bathroom in what is actually my nicest room I've been in.",N

Our friend's mixed drink was pretty nasty as well...another one of the worst mixed drinks I've tried...not sure how he choked it down.

531,"I stepped in and felt like I had stepped into the 70s. And the floor was so dirty. We took our shoes off, and after about an hour, the bottoms of our feet were all black. So gross.

An extremely rude manager came up and told us that we were being too loud, he could hear us downstairs, and that there had been 2 complaints. If there was a 3rd complaint, we would have to leave the hotel, which we should have done anyway. First of all, 2 of our friends were resting in the bedroom because they had headaches and barely heard us. We were on the 5th floor. So if they could hear us in the lobby, the construction must be outrageously poor. 5 minutes later, they sent a cop up, who was actually very pleasant. But really, a cop? By then, we were just sitting around, trying to figure out where to go. Not being loud at all. Go spend your money somewhere else. There are plenty of better and cleaner hotels...with more pleasant managers. The only pleasant people we encountered at the hotel were the valets. They were the only ones to get a nice tip.",N
950,"This Red Roof Inn was formerly the Richmont and later a Motel 6. This is one of the few Red Roofs in a downtown location. It is a decent enough place, but the location just a block east of Michigan Avenue is the best thing about this place.",N
4611,"***While the rooms are small, Hotel Felix is a nice hotel with modern and fresh decor, comfortable beds, clean rooms, good room temperature, and good showers; all these advantages plus their very good location make this one to definitely consider if you can get a competitive room rate*** Hotel Felix is an eco-friendly (Silver LEED certification) boutique hotel that has a convenient location in River North.  It is close to one of the subway lines as well as many well-known Chicago restaurants (Ria, Graham Elliot, Rick Bayless' spots) and The Magnificent Mile.  A lot of Chicago is walk-able and staying at Hotel Felix makes the walking part even easier. The hotel exterior (an older, renovated building) stands out with its huge (but not garish) sign.  The inside of the hotel is small--from the elevators to the lobby to the rooms.  I thought my room, which was on the top floor was actually not too small (maybe bigger than what some of the other reviewers had) and provided a decent view of some of the nearby big buildings. The room was very modern with modern but still comfortable furniture and kind of a minimalist approach.  The room was very clean and the bed was nice and comfortable (good linens too).  The bathroom was also nice though the sink was very shallow (you are likely to touch the sink basin as you wash your hands).  The shampoo and soap were provided by a local company (H2O, which you will also see on some United flights). The room featured your standard stuff like TV, room service, iron, ironing board, and ice bucket; complimentary internet access was also provided. In terms of amenities, there was a spa as well as a decent (though small) 24-hour fitness center. Service was good.  The front desk was pleasant and polite.  The bellhops were really good--friendly and very helpful. Room rates are high here though it is about what you would expect to pay for a nice boutique hotel with a good location (though the rooms here might be smaller than other boutique hotels).  You can get deals here though.  I think they did a Yelp discount here once and you can find pretty good room rates on the online sites like Expedia. Hotel Felix is a nice and modern hotel with a very good location.  It also meets my key needs of comfortable bed, comfortable room temperature, clean room, and a good shower.  While the rooms are not huge, the pros far outweigh that one negative and I would definitely consider returning here if I could find a competitive rate. For parking, I think it is pretty expensive--probably $35 or more.  Though to continue with their eco-friendly theme, Hotel Felix provides free parking to guests who drive hybrids.",N
904,"All in all it was a pretty good stay, the rooms clean and they pride themselves on being green, so that's A-OK. The front desk staff pretty friendly, but they did shove a overnight parking bill under my door with no explanation - I did not drive here!     But the irksome thing was the construction noise, even after changing rooms the noise at night was bothersome, so caveat emptor!",N
1666,"Very nicely updated hotel in Chicago's Loop area (near the theater district). Close to the Clark/Lake stop on the ""L"", especially convenient if youre coming from O'Hare. Rooms are spacious, considering that the place was built probably close to 100 years ago. Beds were comfy, and the front desk staff was helpful to a point. One particular staff member, Katie, was AWESOME. She was totally helpful to our group who was in town for a bachelor party, hooking us up with late checkouts and just being helpful with area knowledge, etc. Also really helpful was concierce extrodinare Anthony, hooking us up with free admission to a couple clubs, etc. (The other concierge never offered this, even though there were stacks of passes in the top drawer of the concierge desk...weird). My only real complaint was that when checking in, the front desk person (not Katie) steered us towards breakfast at the attached restaurant (312), and sort of mixed it in with all the complimentary services offered by the hotel (coffee in the morning, wine hour in the late afternoon, etc), so it sort of made it seem like breakfast was complimentary too. It definitely wasnt, in fact, it was really overpriced and awful. I'd definitely stay at Allegro again, I'd just be sure to steer clear of the restaurant.",N

1332,"I was thoroughly impressed with a recent business conference at The Ritz.   The banquet staff were plentiful and professional.  They fed us constantly - from a breakfast buffet in the morning, cheeses and fruits at snack time, buffet lunch, afternoon sweets and popcorn, and a buffet dinner.  The bars at dinnertime were outfitted with top shelf liquor.  The minute you put down an empty plate it was whisked away as if by magic.  The conference room for daytime meetings was transformed into a dining room and stage for the evening festivities.  Bravo, Ritz.",N

I've experienced better. The 'great selection' of jazz disks, consisted of one beat-up easy listening CD. And the books in the room to read were ""Night Shift"" by Steven King and another title that was obviously forgettable. Nothing like staying contemporary. The room was whatever. No big deal. The continental breakfast was good only because it was 10 feet away from my room near the elevator, but it was lackluster. Although I will say for a place that's crankin' out a lot of coffee, theirs was actually pretty good. Another let down was the free happy hour with cocktails and food (which appeared to be cold cuts) in the 'lounge' -- which in reality was a windowless room with one TV, and a kitchen area cut into the wall. Not much vibe. But the best was that I actually ran out of HOT WATER. In a hotel. I repeat, my hotel room shower, ran...out...of...hot...water. Overall, it was clean, the people were nice and it was close to my clients' office, but it was definitely a let down. Sorry Amalfi.",N
4077,The setup: From Chicago but needed a hotel for some home improvements.   Pros: (1)  Excellent customer service at the desk.   (2) Free upgrade to a bigger room with a better view; (3) Room was updated and very modern. (4) Mostly clean (but see important exception). Cons:  (1) Wine stains on our sheets (ICK - and deducting points); (2) mediocre water pressure; (3) split opinion as to the bed being comfortable; (4) Long waits for the elevators; (5) Hotel lobby packed with a kid's convention; (6) $15/day for internet Overall: Overrated.,N

222,"I snagged a great rate on Hotwire to stay at the Indigo for one night on a recent stay.  The location was very convenient from Midway airport.  I hopped right on the orange line, transferred at Roosevelt to the Red Line, and walked from the Division stop.  Very easy!  I also liked the neighborhood, which was a more upscale, residential part of Chicago I hadn't seen before.  I felt safe walking here by myself after dark.  It is also a few steps from the Third Coast cafe, which is one of my new favorite places in Chicago. The rooms at the Indigo are brightly colored and I couldn't help but get a little giggly at the boardwalk decor.  It was slightly on the schmaltzy side, but I still liked it.  The bed was comfy and the room was larger than I expected. I would definitely stay at the Indigo again, especially if I can get a good rate.",N
3590,"Nice hotel and a great location. However, for the price, I think there are more unique and fun places. The bed was exceptionally comfortable with really nice sheets and cozy pillows, but was pretty generic in decor. Although I was just there for a short time (in at 9pm, out at 11:30am the next), the staff was friendly and helpful. My friend brought some deep dish pizza over, and I called room service to ask for some plates and utensils. They arrived within 10 minutes! Now that's service :) Would recommend it but I'd rather try some other hotels before returning...",N

5138,"I don't know why you would have your wedding reception at any other Chicago location!  The value was incredible.  We were treated like rock stars all night....from April (You rock, April) taking care of us during the reception to the amazing comped bridal suite and parents' rooms. The view is breathtaking (we didn't need to spend any money decorating the room because the view takes care of it all)  The food is very good.  I thought the prime rib was a tad peppery but the guests I talked to thought it was delicious.Many of our guests said it was the best wedding they have ever been too (see my other reviews - Toast and Jam DJ, Alliance Bakery, and Peter Coombs Photography) and HICMP had a lot to do with it.Barbara Martin, the event planner, was so cool and helpful during the planning process.  She exudes calm and confidence.  We didn't need to worry about a thing because she had it all covered.  I can't say enough nice things about Barbara.The only drawback....and it is easily fixed if you ""deal"" with it ahead of time is getting out of town guests, who are driving, to the hotel.  Our guests who were using a GPS to navigate to the hotel were directed in circles.  I got the word out with acutal driving instructions and that did the trick.  (so funny that out of town guests have no clue what the Merchandise Mart is or where the Sun Times building is).",Y
3265,"3.5 stars Like many others have mentioned, I too secured my stay at the Hard Rock Hotel after stumbling across a knockout rate. For the location, I found very few other options in the same price range. I arrived at the hotel several hours before check in time, but the concierge happily stored my bags went out for a few hours. I utilized the service again after check out. Overall the service from both the front desk and the concierge station were dripping with eagerness, but the competency level was a bit lacking. The lines at the front desk were frustratingly slow whether one employee or three were behind the counter. The room is what made the hotel for me. It was huge, and by my standards, could have been two save for the single bathroom. I took showers while relishing a view of Millennium Park. I chased indulgent nights away with coffee from the Keurig maker. I fell asleep in the comfy bed while watching the oversized TV. Some small complaints I had included the previously mentioned, slow as molasses front desk. Also, the bed was stacked with all down pillows. I hate that so much. Seriously, a girl needs a little support sometimes. And well,  I might be reaching here, but this one puzzled me: The room was stocked with more varieties of decaf coffee than caffeinated. It was a good thing my roommate didn't drink coffee, or there might have been an epic morning battle over the second cup. All in all, a good place to rest my weary mind and wobbly body after long days spent eating, drinking, exploring, and indulging my inner tourist.",N
5604,"This place is fabulous and the reason why is because you'll be poor after your stay. You know the old attage about saving a penny every day? You probably need to save like $5 a day to afford this place. Yes, very posh very nice but the location is not everything because you can walk about 4 blocks and get to the Marriott. The hotel is a little off its rocker when it thinks you WANT to get your eyes ripped out of your head just to stay there, but it's probably one of those places that the boss gets to stay at with the family while we toil in the mines. At least this place didn't stick me with ridiculous charges. I earned those badboys.",N
307,"City Suites is simply awesome. Quaint, friendly, safe and with a delicious and fully stocked continental breakfast, this is one of the most conveniently located and accommodating hotels I've ever stayed in. There are a lot of restaurants and cafes around the area so you're set to eat/buy anything you might need. The front desk people were usually all friendly (especially the guy who works the graveyard shift. We loved him!) The shuttle drivers who were taking us back and forth from De Paul were also so friendly. The rooms are great and the beds come with lots of pillows (not sure why that's so fun to me but it is). The hotel has Wi-Fi (score! though it can be slow sometimes) and fortunately we were on the opposite side of the train station so didn't hear the opening and closing of the doors every five minutes. They have nice cushy bathrobes and nice smelling lotions and shampoos--good quality ones that you wish were a take home size! The only annoyance was that eventually at night the room overheated to feel like a sauna. And because the windows couldn't open I had to turn on the A/C to balance out the Mojave Desert. There's only four floors to the hotel (and only three people to the elevator) so if you want to have a more personalized experience City Suites will suit all your needs. The downstairs common area is so nice and they've got a fire going most of the time. So sweet. And there's always coffee and tea out and sometimes a basket of cookies. I don't think I've ever had a hotel feel so much like a cozy home.",N
142,"The hotel is in a great location and the rooms are clean.  However, the service is horrendous and they slyly charge an extra  $100 ""standard incidental fee"" at check out.  The fee isn't listed on the final bill you sign, so it's a hidden fee that in this day seems a$$ backwards.  So be forewarned that while you may have only authorized x amount, you'll see a charge on your account for x + $100 instead.  Completely aggravating.         The hotel is still under renovation and has plastic covering the hallways, so it's a little dingy.  The rooms are quiet, the bed is actually really comfy, and if you're a hobbit who enjoys waking up to frigid water in the dead of Winter you'll love the shower height and water temp.  There isn't a coffee maker or fridge in the room, so plan on running to a cafe for your morning fix and don't bother with leftovers if you eat out.  We mistakenly ordered a pot of coffee the 1st morning and had to wait 40 minutes for it to show up.  Also, skip Fornetto Mei downstairs--we stopped in for drinks before dinner and waited 20 minutes before leaving because no one took our order :( Forget about staying here when there are so many other better options where you will actually get basic hotel services and not get ripped off. Update: fyi the extra fee I was charged was removed a few days later.",N

They gushed about the decor and the eventhough they thought the room was a little small, they took photos of it and sent them to me because they they liked it so much! Parents are weird. They ate at the 312 restaurant and said they liked the food. The hotel is near the Cadillac theatre and they took in a show on a Saturday night. So... my parents approve.",Y

BYO shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, hairdryer,etc.  And be sure to coordinate your PJ's with 70s yellow. Stayed there in Aug and the AC kept it totally cool, but was crazy loud.   It's not a luxury retreat, but it's also under $100/night for a king-sized room.  Would definitely stay here again.",N

Since it was summer time, we were comfortably able to walk just about anywhere we wanted to go; their location is great.  There are lots of  restaurants and excellent shopping all in close proximity. There are so many small details that obviously someone has given a lot of thought to.  The ambiance and the room amenities are hard to beat.  It was almost like having a little place of our own in the City.  The whole experience was just very, very comfortable and welcoming.  Everyone at The James went out of their way to be helpful and service oriented. If you like boutique hotels and want to stay in the River North area during your Chicago visit, put The James at the top of your list.",N

The room was average, like what you see at a Hilton. I was not happy overall--I wouldn't stay at the Embassy Suites again.",Y
474,"Really loved my stay here especially after my stay at the Sheraton across the street.  The rooms are newly renovated so they are fairly new and set up like an apartment with a living/dining room and separate bedroom.  There is also a microwave, sink, and fridge which has lots of room for you to buy snacks or drinks, etc. and not full of overpriced liquors you don't want to buy.  There is also a Dominick's/Safeway right across the street so there is no reason not to stock your fridge.  There are tv's in both rooms so I'd be great for a small family to have some room to spread out. The atrium in the middle of the hotel brings in a lot of light and the glass railings are both cool and scary!  The extras that they throw in are what made me love my 3-day stay.  Free breakfast buffet, free happy hour from 5-7, a free US weekly newspaper at your door in the morning, and really nice Crabtree and Evelyn shampoos and soaps (this seems basic, but lots of hotels don't give you free shampoos anymore). Oh and they have an internet room that has free printing so you can check-in to your flights or check email.  All of this for less than what I paid for a single room at the Sheraton which was decent, but nothing special.  (No free anything at Sheraton!  Not even good soap!)   I have to admit I didn't have the breakfast here as I was too busy, but the fact that it is offered is a total plus in my book!  Yes there were lots of people in line during breakfast, but I asked a couple how the food was and they said the make your own omelets and fresh fruits were good.   The bell hops and valets downstairs are also curteous and friendly.  They will help you with your bags or get you a cab in a second.   One tip -- get your hotel on http://priceline.com for the best deal ever!",N

3474,"I found The Allerton via a web special on http://Hotels.com.  The location at Michigan and Huron (two blocks south of the Water Tower and about five blocks north of the Chicago River) was perfect.  The room was small; it felt like a room full of doors where the front door, closet door, and bathroom door all came together in a tangled mess.  Otherwise, the room was clean and well-appointed, and the bed was quite comfortable. Boo!  Hiss!  For charging a minimum of $9.95 per day for in-room internet service (even more dough for faster speeds).  You can get free Wi-Fi in the Second Floor lounge if you would prefer to surf in public. I was on the 9th floor with a western view of Michigan Avenue, so there was nothing to shout about there.  My friend was on a higher floor on a corner and enjoyed her combo view west and north. Room service was always prompt and courteous.  Skip the bar on the Second Floor.  It is dead, dead, dead.  But, if you want to grab a bite to take back to your room, the $5 sliders and $5 quesadilla are a good value. The gym on the 25th floor was well stocked with all the equipment one would expect, and was never busy. There is free coffee on the Second Floor each morning, and you can also use a computer kiosk there to check in for your flight home.",N
2970,"Stayed here recently for a convention. Location great. Food on site is dismal, but there's lots nearby in the neighborhood, and a grocery down the block for in-room eating. The main thing is the mattress. It's like sinking into a big tub of warm jello. I really didn't like it, needing a firm mattress for my back. Once sunken in I found it hard to turn over, and even harder to sit up. The chain seems quite proud of these mattresses, and i bet they cost a fortune, but I found them really annoying.",N

3330,"My second night in Chicago was spent at the Hard Rock Hotel and it couldn't have been a better choice!  The gilded art deco building itself is beautiful.  I felt like I was walking into a gold bank vault.  Much like a W Hotel, the Hard Rock has very chic rooms that make them stand out compared to the average cookie cutter hotel room.  Having artwork of David Bowie on the walls is a nice change from the norm.  Aveda products in the bathroom to keep me smelling nice and free wifi throughout the hotel to keep me connected were also added bonuses.  The staff from check-in, to housekeeping, to the guy who fixed my broken stereo in my room were friendly and quick to get anything I wanted done.  I was very impressed with how attentive they were.  Honestly, I don't have a single thing to complain about it.  Sure it is a little on the expensive side but having stayed at the Hyatt my first night for only  about $40 less, I can say it is worth the extra cash.",N
3371,"Well, its over priced compared to the Hilton next door. Our room was dirty, the bathroom was small, there is no heater or air conditioner for the room, but rather a fan where it should be.

I think you get the picture, so if I were you, I wouldn't stay here.",N

All of the photos on the walls are of naked folk in very odd positions. You can't really tell unless you are standing very close but it is odd none the less. I would be willing to go back but won't take the advice of any dapper appearing gents asking you to look at a large woman's naked backside.",N
900,"This hotel was everything I wanted and more. The girlfriend tasked me with planning a date where we got all dressed up all fancy and such. Yelp led me here and as always it did not disappoint. Check-in and check-out were relatively quick and hassle free. One thing I really liked about this place is the fact that they have done everything to retain the old world looks (we got actual keys for our room!) The doors were either original or very reproductions, I loved the hinges on them. The accents throughout the building and our room reflect the exterior of the building and its charm. While marble stairs worn from years of use, just awesome. I also loved the phone they had in the hallway styled to look old world. If you have a chance you might want to visit the Atwood Cafe, after a night out we decided to stop by and get some drinks. They dont skimp on the alcohol and we struck up a good conversation with the bartender (he previously worked at the place we went for dinner that night). Funny story, on our way back up in the elevator from the Atwood Cafe we ended up sharing the elevator with a member of the hotels management, he asked me to hit floor 11... I asked him for one of the bottles of Chianti he had hands full of. He was quick to inform me.... ""ask and ye shall receive"", that simple gesture made our night even better. We had a good laugh over it and enjoyed the bottle later. Great way to end a good night on the town. Great place to stay, the management is helpful and the amenities are generous. OH! And I forgot to add, we stayed in room 1503, its as high as you can go and has great views of State and Washington, see for yourself from my pictures.",N

The hotel did not have our reservation (that was paid in full through Hot Wire.  Luckily I had my confirmation e-mail.) 3.  We were not told we had to use our key card to work the elevator and stood there looking very foolish. 4.  Wall covering was peeling off and taped up with scotch tape-very tacky 5.  The room had no information about the hotel (nothing telling us about restaurants, if there was a pool, if there was room service, etc.).  We never ate at the hotel because we could not get information about what was offered. 6.  Had to call at least four times for 1. a second bathrobe 2. a coffee maker 3. hotel information (which they never brought) 4.  bathtub flooded and the repair man had to come 7.  The bathroom door/shutter allowed people in the room to hear EVERYTHING-very awkward! 8.  Ice bucket was the size of a coffee mug-had to make several trips and eventually just ended up using the trash can 9.  Leaving for dinner the doormen would not help us.  They made comments to us like a bunch of construction workers but never got us a cab.  We ended up walking to the cab stand across the street. 10.  Terrible service on all levels.  Even though our second night was pre-paid we moved to another hotel for a much better experience.",N

Check out the hotel's website because they may be offering some specials that are way cheaper than the other travel sites.  Front desk was accommodating - the power went out just as we were checking in so we had to wait about 10 mintues, but they gave us free internet for the inconvenience (and we weren't even upset about the wait).  It's right across from the famous Gibson's & there's a nice ""park"" area just across from the hotel where you can sit & get coffee in the morning & people watch.  We pretty much walked everywhere from the hotel, great view of the city, rooms were actually quite large & bed was very comfortable.   I'd definitely stay here again!!!!",N
2807,"I sometimes want to go back and wish I had my wedding here because the atrium has a really nice, beautiful feel to it.  It has the perfect ambiance for cocktails as well as for pictures. In addition, Osteria Via Stato is in the building if you want a place to have rehearsal dinner and all your guests are staying in this hotel.  A great spot if you plan to have alot of out of towners at your wedding because it is SOO convenient. Compared the other downtown hotels, the price-per-plate was very affordable at about $86 for a chicken dish, moving up to get a steak would be about $105.00.   The wedding coordinator was very helpful and very organized, even ensuring that the dining room had a table set up so you could see what the table arrangements would look like complete with linens and china.  She even gave me a giant wedding planning book to help me out. Alas, after negotiating for quite sometime, we realized that we didn't have enough people on our guest list to meet their minimum requirement of $15,000 (which is negotiable...depending on when your wedding is).  We only had about 75 people for our wedding and there was no way we could meet that minimum. But no regrets as I had an AMAZING wedding at the Doubletree on Ohio St instead.

783,"I love you priceline! I was a little disappointed as I booked my flight to Chicago to spend a weekend away with my boyfriend as he had to go for a few days for work- there was a gigantic city-wide convention  in town and all the hotels were booked or $300+ to stay anywhere decent. I have been lucky with priceline before- and since I could cancel my Best Western reservation up until 6pm the night of arrival I thought that I would gamble and see what I could get. Luckily we got this place for $100 a night instead of its $369 rack rate. Wooohooo! We were happy with the location as it was right on Michigan Avenue in the thick of things. The room was spacious and clean, but since we got in so late because of our American Airlines flight (we flew them in the middle of all the drama of canceled flights) we could only get a room with two beds that seemed like they were full size. We picked possibly the worst weekend to go as it was pouring rain, windy and freezing the whole time, but we were happy to be able to come back to nap and stay warm in a really nice hotel,",N
2559,"For a place that's 'see and be seen', I expected people to be a little bit more fashionable.  The night I went, I wore a new D&G dress and a ridiculous pair of heels... and saw guys in jeans and women in their Wet Seal best. I guess after the hype, I was expecting something a bit more authentic. Instead, I found a typical 'Ooh, this is so New York' kinda vibe, from people who've probably never set foot in TriBeCa or NoLita. The space itself is fabulous - very art deco, ultra modern and industrial, space that would be fabulous for a gallery.  A bit on the cliche side, actually, but fabulous. The prices are high, as is par for the course for this type of joint.   The appetizers are decent, but nothing special. I'm guess I'm beyond over the whole 'stand around, look fabulous and be utterly bored by it all' thing... especially since I've done it better in Manhattan.",N
5363,"For a person that spends so much of her life living in and out of hotels, it is easy for me to say that this place is totally out of the ordinary. It is super conveneintly located to where I do most of my business when visiting Chicago and since I left, I keep thinking about how I cannot wait to come back and visit this hotel again. What really got me excited was the interior design and overall elegance that the entire place had.  I am looking forward to the next room I will get at the hotel--all of them are designed and decorated in unique ways with totally different decor. Plus the staff that helped me during my stay could not have been nicer or more thoughtful with basic things like directions.  The only downside to this hotel is that I wish I had known about it sooner!!! Years of coming to Chicago and staying in generic places that are not worth the money at all is a total letdown when you find places like Wheeler mansion that has so much personality and charm! If i was from around here, I would probably come take a look at this place from time to time just for the visual appeal and woodwork, hand carved and hand painted ceilings, stained glass ceiling, etc.  You will be blown away by the elegance and attention to detail that this hotel has as soon as you walk in.",Y

5336,"Stayed here for 2 nights and absolutely loved it.   Would go back again.  Nice, big comfortable rooms with nice beds.  My daughter loved the ""sweet dreams"" pillows on the bed.  We were on the 21st floor and had a great view, and could even see Lake Michigan.   Very nice!  Plus there is a restaurant, an Einstein Brothers bagel place, an indoor and outdoor pool.   Great location also -- within walking distance of the Magnificant Mile, Navy Pier, etc.",Y
2575,"This is the letter I sent to the club based NYE 2010. It was terrible. Don't ever go during NYE! fiancé and I attended your New Year's eve celebration and left feeling frustrated and disappointed. We arrived at the club at 10pm and ended waiting in line for 45 minutes. I even came to the club the night before to pick up my tickets so I could avoid the line. It wasn't until some guests waiting in line complained to Cameron that we were finally moved inside. Once inside, we ended up waiting in another long line for the bar, which took at least 45 minutes to get drinks. It was ridiculous to see one bartender on the side bar and three bartenders at the main bar serving over 700 people. The club was extremely crowded; there was hardly any space to move. Numerous times I shoved violently by other guests at the club; My fiancé was worried for my safety. The floor was wet and had assorted broken bottles and glasses on the floor. I understand it is New Year's eve and the place can get crowded. What added to the  disappointment was the number of people talking about getting in the club without buying tickets. I saw Cameron at the door handing out tickets without checking a list of people who had purchased them. I spent $150 for a set of tickets expecting to get according to your advertisement: ""complimentary passed hors d'oeuvres and appetizers...a midnight champagne toast...party favors and noise makers"". None of which was available once in the club. Based on my experiences, I will never visit the club again. If anyone asks me my opinion of the Victor Hotel, I will tell them adamantly not to go",N

4885,GREAT hotel!  I LOVED walking into my room and seeing beautiful wood floors and a huge shower with a full length window into the room.... too bad my roomate is a coworker!,Y
5370,"I booked my room through Hotwire, so the hotel staff refused to give me a king size bed.  I was told the rate guaranteed me a room, but not a specific bed type.  It wasn't until Hotwire phoned the hotel, that I receive a room with a king size bed. Also, I called and requested a bottle opener.  I was told I had to come to the front desk to use it.  The room was very warm because of the outdated ac unit.  The walls were paper thin.  The pool and location was nice.  You get what you pay for.",Y
2742,"Overrated, overhyped hotel.  The hotel bar is small, spartan.  The hallways have dark brown carpet that looks really old, dirty and shabby, and I think this is supposed to be a new hotel??  The halls are dark, narrow and have low ceilings.  The elevator is oldish and small, which kinda tells you the real age of the building.   The rooms are small, so small that there's a sliding door between the room and the bathroom because -- the room is too small to have a regular door!  The funny thing is that bathroom door has a porthole of a window, reminding you that your room isn't much bigger than a room on a cruiseship.  (Probably a subconscious slip on the designer's part.)  And that sliding door falls off its rails -- cheap!  Only one person can fit in the bathroom.  You step in and are immediately in front of the mirror, toilet and shower, with no room to move about!  The toilet was cheap quality -- I remember something breaking but easily fixable by me, but I forget, as this review is four months after my trip. Yes, there's a flat screen, and people like to mention that.  Really?  So what!  There's a funky chair and a funky table that looks like a tree stump.  For a while I thought that tree stump was a stool and had an argument with a friend as to what it was -- table or stool.  I guess it can be both, but officially, it's a table.  You know why I thought it was a stool?  Because there's not enough places to sit! There's no computer chair and no table.  So, you're going to put your laptop on that funky stump.  And who wants to crouch over and read their email? Sure, the bed linens look fluffy, but I stayed at the holiday inn express up in portland, and they had the same fluffy white linen/comforter!  Anyhow, the room is dark because of the brown carpet, and the walls are bare, except for black/white photographs, which makes the room look colder and more depressing.  Because as you look up at the walls and ceiling, you can tell this was probably once something I would describe as a residency hotel.  Or just a barebones, nothing special apartment I had in college.   So, I have no idea why this hotel is featured in magazines at all!  I guess people are easily fooled into staying because of how they showcase their suites.  Chicago's expensive, even in winter -- go figure, so figuring that in and the hotel's location, I'd pay no more than $130.  But for that price, I'd still feel ripped off!  I wouldn't bother with this hotel at all -- it's both cold feeling and shabby/dreary -- like drunks probably died in here 70 years ago. And there's wasn't much a view, just the building across the street.",N
2728,"Best hotel I've ever stayed at.  It's certainly not the most expensive, but it is the best in terms of service, amenities, and location. The lobby is smaller, but it is very stylish, elegant, and well-kept.  J-bar (the hotel bar) offers great Grey Goose cocktails at reasonable prices. The decor of the rooms is super modern, elegant, and comfortable.  The beds are piled with plush pillows and super soft bleach white cotton sheets and duvet covers which must be 600 thread count (yes!  no crusty bed spreads!  all cotton!). The service and amenities are phenomenal.  Room service is super fast.  If you ask for towels at 3 in the morning, someone will be there in a few minutes.  Details such as free New York Times newspapers, free office center usage (including a flat-screen Mac computer), free late check in, free access to the equally stylish gym, robes, and free top of the line toiletries  that you find at Neiman Marcus is what sets this hotel apart from the others. There is a chef concierge and a entertainment concierge.  Enough said.  They are more than willing to figure out your likes and dislikes to find out the best places for you.  They make last minute reservations for you at places where most people have to wait two weeks to get in. I stayed at this hotel on NYE for only 150 for a standard.  The room was spacious and had a nice office nook, a sexy red patent leather recliner chair, and a bar that boasted patron, grey goose, etc, with a lot of counter space.  The marble bathrooms provide superb luxury. The downfall:  the only mirror is in the bathroom, which makes it hard for a bunch of girls to get ready.  Lighting could be better.  Parking is 50 for valet or you're on your own with the public garage that charges you 17 dollars for the first 1/2 hour.",N
1917,"I definitely prefer having drinks at the W on lakeshore over this W, but I was in a suite here last night and this was a very impressive room. There were at least 25-30 people in this suite and while there wasn't a lot of room to move around it was still spacious.  The trendy room was very elegant and had everything you could possibly need....however, I'm sure you pay plenty for all of it.",N
5606,"Walking about a Chicago winter you quickly learn - jeans do not keep out the cold, girls can still walk around in boots without slipping on the ice, -1 is not a freaking temperature, and exposed skin will freeze and fall off. Other then that Chicago ain't bad in the winter on a clear sunny day. Staying at the Westin also makes it so much more pleasant. Especially at the Club level. The door man is bundled warmly and the front desk are very helpful and the concierge was nice enough to recommend a 'walk about' route. The Club level room is palatial with a sitting area and an abundance of hot water for a bath after your 'walk about'. I gotta find out where the doorman gets his hat. I would stay here again for a Chicago winter.",N
1123,"This is a first-class hotel all the way. We stayed here and I got engaged to the fabulous Kate C. at the Fairmont Chicago. I'm just going to dock it one star for their false billing. They billed me for 5 drinks from the mini-bar and I didn't even have a key to it.When I called down to dispute it they were quick to apologize and ""we'll take it right off your bill."" Made me wonder if that's just standard operating procedure to sneak it by the unsuspecting few. I doubt it is but buyer beware. Anyway, outside of that everything was first-rate. We had drinks and delicious cheese at the lobby bar. They have a cheese flight to go along with an extensive wine list. It wasn't cheap, but, hey, it's the Fairmont. The rooms were spacious with full-HD tv's. Internet was extra but we didn't use it so, who cares. Oh yeah, no in-room coffee maker was also a negative. You'd think they could provide that if they're doling out robes and rain showers. The bathrooms, btw, were some of the best I've ever been in in a hotel. We will absolutely go back here...and they better not bill me for those drinks.",N
85,"I actually live real close to the Carleton but recently had a one night's stay the day before my wedding. I was lucky to stay in the hotel (instead of the motel section) which had a HUGE whirlpool tube. I would recommend staying at this hotel just to enjoy it. The staff was extremely helpful when my makeup artist needed a special chair to do makeup and they also were nice enough to let me stay a little after check out time. When I was in a rush at the last minute to leave, they checked me out without me having to wait. Thank you so much! The only down side: I left my bridal gown bag at the hotel (in fact I saw it but was in a rush to leave but didn't have time to go back). I called later that night but the maid service claimed nothing was found. The bag was pretty expensive, but I know it's my fault. My only recommendation is don't leave anything behind by accident.",N
1587,"Nice enough hotel I guess...but...and this is a big but, when we made our reservation we requested a crib, no problem....until we arrived and expected a crib, because we were told no crib available. Do our 14 month old did not enjoy his stay, nor did we. We will not be coming back.",N
5755,"i can't really comment on the rooms since i was just here for a graduation banquet...we had one of the conf rooms for the night. it was clean and nicely decorated. it started with an open bar that wasn't too shabby and the drinks were pretty good. the bartender was nice and patient as we tried to figure out what we would like. as for the food it was just ok, not anything to write home about. i thought the salad was a little small as it looked like they just spread it out over the plate so it would look like more than what it actually was...lol...i had the stuffed chicken breast (prosciutto, spinach, and cheese) and it was pretty good....i tried the risotto and the fish both of those were good too. the red velvet cake was just alright. overall it was good food added to a great night.",N

1678,"I enjoy the Kimpton Hotel chain- I feel like I know what I am getting, and am rarely disappointed.   Thanks to Yelp - I knew in advance that my room would be teeny tiny- and in the Loop, I wasn't expecting much more.  The room was fully functional for what it was.  The decor was a little interesting - my husband joked that the TV stand/mini-bar looked like they gave a 2 year old a marker and let them go to town.  Bathroom was super small, but had everything I needed and was actually the best decorated part of the room.  Our bathroom sink had an extended counter where there was room for toiletries unlike some of the other reviewers rooms.  We did not have a noise problem in our room whatsoever - I never heard a thing in the hallway or on the other side of the wall.  Wi-Fi is free if you sign up for Kimpton In Touch membership. The lobby is fantastic, especially the hidden sitting room behind the fireplace wall.  I enjoy the Kimpton's hour long wine reception btw 5 and 6.  A perfect starter before heading out into the city for dinner.  They also have a Wii in the lobby which is a great distraction for the younger travelers.  There is both a restaurant and bar in the building as well. The elevator situation is less than ideal - long waits and overcrowded.  I suppose this is to be expected in any tall building - What can you do?  Location in the Loop is nice, and located not too far from access to the El and the subway. My husband gets the government rate - so if you book early enough, can't complain for $158 a night.  It was also an anniversay trip, so the hotel sent a bottle of champagne up to our room free of charge. The only negative at this point - I made a local call from the hotel room - and got charged $1.50.  Not the end of the world, but since when are there charges for local calls??",N

2446,"I stayed here a couple of weeks ago for a conference. The room was very nice, with two bathrooms in the double rooms. The restaurants are pretty good, too. I had breakfast at the buffet, which was good. The bar (Kitty O'Sheas) had much better food than I expected.   The staff is very helpful. Especially the concierge desk, which got me preferred seating at a several really nice restaurants. I just told them what I was in the mood for and they got me all set up. They were much more helpful than many other concierge desks in other hotels.",N
3675,"The Drake is one of the classic hotels in Chicago. Nowadays people seem to like modern hotels with large rooms, but for a touch of old-fashioned class and elegance the Drake is where it's at. It is basically the northernmost point of the Magnificent Mile. It faces Oak Street Beach with its well-known signage. The interiors are very ornate so there is no mistaking this as an average place to stay. The banquet rooms are magnificent settings for dinner parties and receptions.",N
363,"Never Again! This hotel needs a serious makeover. It is dingy and gross looking. The rooms have old beds, gross looking carpet, and just look old.

4103,"The location is actually quite good although it's not on Magnificent Mile.  At check-in, we were asked if we wanted to upgrade for $39 (I think) a night.  What does this mean?  A bigger room on a higer floor - what the hell, it's my birthday!  First room we got on the (30th or 31st) floor, it was near the end of the hall BUT it was right across from the ice machine and that machine was cranky and noisy!  A strong smell of stale smoke was overwhelming when we walked inside the room and the bed was oddly placed - great view of Navy Pier but...I know the noise and the smell will drive me crazy.  Called front desk - yes, there's another room on the same floor.  Switched - it's closer to the elevator lobby but the room felt much better.  View is an office building - it's kind of amusing to watch others work while we relaxed :) Service was ok at best.  It was very busy when we got there - nobody bothered to help w/ luggage and we have to hail our own cab when we left.   I guess that's the best you can expect from Hyatt...",N
4999,"If you're looking for a good price, decent location and terrible customer service, the essex is the place for you. Room was decent and clean. Everyone who worked there went out of that extra mile to be as rude as possible. The shuttle they advertise wasn't running almost the entire time we were there and they were absolutely unapologetic about it. Also there was a  #$%^&%^&  jackhammer running directly over our heads at ten in the morning which would have been nice to know about before we made our reservations. But, if it's the best deal in town for the location I would think of staying there again.",Y
2003,"Love this place!!  Had a huge corner room w/ wrap around balcony w/ views of millenium park.  Smells new, very clean, which is a huge plus!  Husband and I just stayed the night and used almost all the amenities.  Drinks in the lounge area, next to the gorgeous fireplce...very relaxing.  Dessert in the filini bar, then hot tubbing in the pool area.  I also used the gym in the morning, and thought it was the best hotel gym i have ever used!  Very reasonably priced, even w/o the groupon price we paid.  Also, we parked @ MIllenium garage, which is literally a block and a half away, for only $24, instead of the hotels $46. Would love to return someday",N
1673,"Very tasteful and ""funky"" decor.  Staff was super nice.  Wine hour is a wonderful touch.  Rooms were a little on the small side, but larger than I was expecting for a downtown ""historic"" hotel. We had no noise problems (maybe we were the ones making noise for others though?! LOL) Cabs readily available.  Walking distance to Union station and Ogilvie transportation center - and madison st. water taxi.   Overall, nothing was amazingly outstanding, but everything was very nice.",N
2228,"Yeah, the room decor is outdated - but the room size compensates. The customer service was wonderful. I dont know how much the employees are getting paid, but it must be enough to act like they genuinely want you to be there, and they want to wait on you. Do yourself a favor and just explore the hotel. The architecture is amazing; beautiful Victorian marble water fountains are in hallways, and I understand all of the architecture is original. If I had to complain, my one complaint would be the food in the hotel restaurant. Overpriced and not delicious. Overall, though, I would definitely recommend the intercontinental - and of course stay again.",N
3442,"For hotel reviews, I like to keep it simple, and useful. Great location - right in the center / walking distance of shopping, movie theatres, parks, museums, and restaurants.  For the more indie/local neighborhoods and bars though, you will likely need a cab. Great service, very polite and helpful. Really pretty on the inside - marble, and very cute restaurant and bar.  The place has character - it's not one of those generic, boring eyesores that make me sick. Our room - kind of small, but not uncomfortably so. Bathroom - nice shower / good water pressure.  No bathtub - but I think  that in the larger rooms, that may not be the case.  L'Occitane brand (and great smelling) shower products. If you want to use internet in your room, you have to pay $10 a day, otherwise, take your laptop down to the lobby for a free connection. Everything was clean. The rooms come with an i-pod docking station so you can play your music on speakers / charge it - great perk! Try not to use the bathroom at night if you're sharing a room - the toilet's flush is loud enough to wake the dead. Nice gym with little flat screen TVs on most of their equipment. I think that this hotel generally is expensive, but I went through Orbitz, booked it as a package with my flight, and only paid around $260 for 3 nights...if you split that with who you're staying with, it's a steal. Overall - excellent place.",N
3594,"I stayed in The Drake while I was taking the bar exam. I didn't want to have to deal with cabs or waking up even earlier for the test, so I just booked a room. My key did not work. I went to get another key. It worked once. Each time I had to enter the room, I had to go back down to the lobby to get a new key. It was so irritating. Additionally - no internet in the rooms. What. The. F.? I get the idea that the only people using the Drake anymore are business men who want to rack up Hilton points and businesses who schedule conferences here. Thus, you NEED internet in the rooms. Additionally, it costs $7.50 / hr to log into WiFi in the lobby. That's absurd. There are three things in this place that say luxury: the huge floral arrangement in the lobby, an excess of crystal light fixtures, and the bedding. Otherwise, this is a totally average hotel with tiny rooms and tiny bathrooms. Our bathroom had a magnification mirror that was affixed to the wall a good foot over my head. Useless.",N
505,"Thanks to Chicago yelpers, we were here last week. You get a 2 rooms suite with free breakfast and free drinks at night. The breakfast is a good spread and it is the same menu everyday. You have the choice of 1 line with cooked to order omelets and biscuit with gravy or 2 lines with already made tray of scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, home fries potatoes and pancake. You can also get oatmeal, dry cold cereal, english muffin,toast, small danishes, donuts,oranges, banana, yogurt,coffee, tea, orange juice, cranberry juice or apple juice. The drinks at night is from 5:30 to 7:30 PM. The snack items are the same every night: nacho chips with salsa, peanuts, yogurt pretzels, raisins, banana chips, trail mix. and  sesame sticks. The kiddis drinks every night is cherry sprite, lemonade,sweet tea or orange slices in water. The place was packed with kids. It is nice to have 2 TV sets and an extra room. It is about 6 blocks to the CTA station. You have to check in on the 5th floor. PJ Clarke is right on the property. Walgreens is down the street. Dominicks is right across the street. Close to everything but not near anything. We were down for breakfast before 8 AM and never had to wait.",N

2940,"Stayed here for a conference so I had no choice in the matter. Despite everything being fully paid for, I would not stay here again even if my stay was paid for OR if you paid me to stay here. I'm not going to be drastic - there were no bugs in my bed, the floors were clean-ish and to their credit, the cleaning staff was incredibly nice. It's not like this place is a dump. However, it just didn't feel like a nice hotel (which, at the rate they charge, it really should be). I've stayed at Four Points which are nicer than this place in both hospitality and cleanliness. Let's talk about the hospitality. The front desk people here are RUDE! Almost downright insulting rude. The first day I came in to check in the guy at the front desk asked me in a very accusing way ""are you here to check in or what do you want?"". UHM why else would I be standing in the registration line? Then I asked if I could apply my Starwoods number to the stay and he said sure and handed me a Gold key. I was excited because sometimes conference don't let you apply your starwoods numbers to get credit. PLUS, I am one night away from Platinum and was excited to make Platinum. So off I go into my room. Like other reviewers said, no upgrades unless you're platinum. I didn't hear anything about a concierge level or ANY benefits that the hotel provided (probably because there are none that are free). NOBODY asked me if I needed help with my bags, nobody wished me a good day. Nobody told me where my conference registration was. And this is just check-in. Check out was worse. I got a voicemail saying I will be getting a bill under my door in the morning. I woke up at 8am, no bill. I went downstairs to check that I made platinum (I was one night away) and also to check out, and get a bill (I like to have a copy of these things). The woman at the front desk was terse and curt with me. She said that no, I was still Gold, that no points or stays will be added to my stay because it was a conference. Man, I wish the guy who checked in had told me that instead of getting my hopes up. She then said that she could not provide me with a bill of any sort because it was being paid for by the conference even though I know for a fact that extra expenses are not paid for by the conference. She offered no explanation and treated me with no respect. I left feeling very upset at not having made platinum after being such a long standing SPG member (and frequent traveler) and having offered no consolation. I asked where the Java Lounge storage room was and she said ""downstairs"". Well ladies and gentlemen, she was wrong. I finally found the luggage storage area which was not downstairs but was on the same level and was SCOLDED by a Sheraton staff member for not wearing my conference name tag. By now I was both upset at my conference and with Starwoods for providing such an upsetting experience. I know this review sounds more like ""I'm upset because I didn't make Platinum"" instead of ""This place sucks"" but I would say that there is a right way to approach customers and a wrong way to approach customers and I would say that the front desk and members of the staff here (cleaning staff excluded) were the rudest hotel staff members I have ever experienced at ANY Starwoods hotel. I thought for a minute it was because I'm a Southerner in Chicago but then realized that no, I have stayed at the W City Center in Chicago before and everyone who works there (from the guy who opens the door for you to the people who check you in) are more than accommodating, nice, and a fresh breath of air when you are away from home. I will end this review with a review on the catering here. The vegetarian options are good, the cookies are hard and way too huge, pound cake and any baked goods are always dry, and there is a wider variety of soda than water. Oh, and the beds were not comfortable. Please don't even book this place as your wedding hotel as you will probably be more upset than me with your experience.",N
1859,"""Whatever, whenever!""  What a lovely motto for a hotel chain! I'm loving my stay here, it's one of the few bright spots of the week.  At first I was incredibly nervous, I had booked this place for a dozen executives and lawyers and I was afraid that it would be a little too funky for them.   The lobby, while very cool, is like walking into a night club.  It didn't make the greatest first impression on the people I needed to impress.  But that was the only speed bump.  From that moment on, the absolute attention to service and detail has been amazing.  Literally, pick up a ""whatever, whenever phone"" and they'll ""grant your wish"" as soon as possible.  The staff at this hotel has made all of our stays wonderful.  They've taken a lot of stress out of my life, and I'm grateful for that. If you're a lawyer coming into the area, the W is also incredibly close to the Federal Court House, which is why I picked the hotel.  We've been able to get back to our hotel, have lunch and a little breather during the short lunches and breaks that we've had throughout the week. Great location and excellent service, hands down. As for the lobby / nightclub.  While my bosses may have thought it was ""too distracting"" I was very happy to stroll through there every evening.  Made me feel like I was taking a short break from all the craziness.  And the waitresses...  (sigh)",N
4879,"My Boyfriend and I came here last weekend for the 4th of July events held in Chicago. Our stay was average, despite reading the reviews, it was not that bad, we were only there to sleep and rest. They're were strikers outside but that didnt change my mind. I had a ""do not disturb"" tag outside our room and someone knocked on the door at 130 am on a saturday night, they asked if we needed new blankets.. I thought that was rude. Other than that. everything good. The hauntings.. The closet door slighlty openedmoments after I closed it. The phone rang once at 8 in the morning which woke us up.

2489,"I have had a few conferences and events here now, and I'm always impressed by the interior and meeting spaces.   Never did stay here, but a great place to enjoy boring power point slides.   Only downside was a dank must basement exhibition space.  The tower suite is amazing, overlooking the lake and Grant park.  Also, save yourself the 300% markup and don't buy any food here, just walk down the street to the other chains surrounding.",N
2506,"Bad experience. Just bad. Arrived at midnight after a long flight. I had booked a room the month before. Was told that they were overbooked, so I had a choice of a ""parlor room"" or a smoking room for the first night (then get moved for the next two), since no non-smoking rooms were left. The parlor room was supposed to be ""better"" and have a bed that was ""closer to the ground"" (??) and they offered to discount my rate. Fine. I get to the room and my key doesn't work. Go downstairs to get a second key. Also doesn't work. Finally they send someone from security to meet me there to let me in. When I get in, I realize that the room. Has. No. Bed. They had given me the living room half of an executive suite (kitchen with sofas). I called downstairs about this and they offered to bring in a roll-away. Incredible. Had a long call with the manager on duty who kept insisting that they had no more non-smoking rooms for the night. After a while, he caved and let me have a non-smoking room from a block of rooms that some other group had reserved which was not being used. So they had extra non-smoking rooms all along? Why the charade? So this new room was fine. Of course, I had to move for the next two nights. To try to make up for the issue the first night, the next morning's manager promised that they had given me a ""really nice room"". It turned out to be a corner room with great views. But. The heater didn't work. (I didn't try to change rooms again.) After all that, when I was checking out, they had charged me the original rate for all three nights! The person checking me out asked how my stay was. I said, ""Well..."" and then they comped me for one night. I spoke with some other people staying in the hotel, and apparently the issue with the heaters was widespread. In the middle of winter in Chicago, they have broken heaters...",N
4332,"Beautiful lobby with impressive ceiling.. Great Location.  (next to 2 train lines) Superb toiletries..  Can we say Peter Thomas Roth?  And yes, I'll confess,  I helped myself (stole) a few hand lotions from the maid's cart.. Comfy bed.  Not the heavenly but the kind you can sink into nevertheless. Vent-less bathroom..  My biggest gripe..  Put it this way, bathroom is right next to the bed..  Husband takes care of business and opens door. Omg, shoot me!  Now!",N

2235,"Classy, clean and just all around excellent service. I stayed at this hotel on the magnificent mile. What can I say just wonderful things about it. It is quiet yet sits on a street where there is great shopping to be had, lovely restaurants and abundance of bars to wet your whistle. They got a nice pool that cooled me down in that hot, muggy weather. I got to say this is a real nice hotel.",N
4127,"I booked a room at the Hyatt for my girlfriend's birthday.  Even though we're from Chicago and we actually don't live that far away from the Hyatt, I still thought it'd be a nice thing to do.  And of course, I could partly be blame for the room, because in general, Priceline has been consistent in giving me high quality hotels.  For example, I got a stay at the Fairmont last year and for the most part, that hotel was fantastic.   The Hyatt though?  For the price that I paid, it was nothing spectacular.  For the price that I paid + having to listen to cars and trucks rumble along lower Wacker/Columbus for the night?  Absolutely horrid.  I'll try to point out some of the highlights and shortcomings here - categorically, per usual. Location: 5 out of 5 Can't really beat it if you're a tourist.  Conveniently located and within walking distance to multiple attractions.  Cabs and shuttles know where it is too so if you're flying in, you won't be stuck trying to explain where it is. Customer Service: 3 out of 5 Caveat here.  You know who the friendliest people were at this hotel?  The people working the front door either greeting guests as they arrived, or hailing the cabs.   I really didn't get a good feel from anyone else working at the hotel.  They all seemed preoccupied with something else, and honestly, I really didn't care since it was only for one night.   Even the automatic check in kiosk was disappointing.  I ALWAYS go for the kiosks if they're available because it saves me time and I don't have to wait for any doofuses.  This kiosk though - wow, slow as dirt.  It may be the one time when checking in with the actual people behind the desk would have been faster.  Anyway. Quality of Room: 3 out of 5 No real complaints - spacious, comfortable, boutique'ish toiletries.  Like I mentioned earlier, if you get stuck facing the wrong way, you'll hearing cars and trucks rumbling throughout the night.  Since I'm a pretty heavy sleeper, I didn't notice it too much, but if you're trying to watch TV, it can be a real pain in the ass. Price: 3 out of 5 Sure, I Priceline'd it, but honestly, I expected just a little bit more than what was offered.  Before you comment and say, ""It's a great hotel, look at all the amenities!"" hear me out.  When you really strip away everything that overwhelms you when you first walk in and look at it piecewise instead of as one big picture - you'll be underwhelmed.  Glass ceilings, little pond with fountains, an ""open aired"" dining area, the escalators - get past all of that and when you do, the hotel becomes above average and not any more than that. Overall: 3 out of 5 I guess bidders can't be choosers.  Not a terrible hotel, but not really anything to write home about either.  Unless you're here on yelp.",N
2542,"I was out with some friends the other night and suddenly I turned into Alice in Wonderland and fell through a rabbit hole.  At the bottom of that rabbit hole was the Victor Hotel.   I don't understand this place, but I really don't understand clubs in general.  Am I supposed to be impressed with the velvet ropes?  The $20 cover charge?  The 15 people that were there at 1am on a Friday night?  The ""reserved"" tables that no one was sitting at?  I wasn't.   I don't think I'll ever go back to Victor.  Ever.",N
4490,"I stayed here for business, and I was assigned an oversized closet of a room with a full bed. It was the smallest room ever. I complained to the front desk and so they gave me a double room instead, which was considerably larger. I stayed here while they were renovating so the rooms were outdated and weren't the best.",N
4621,"The Hotel Felix rates comfortably between a Kimpton Hotel and the W. The single rooms are nicely appointed, but do not include a refrigerator, which I needed during Snowapocalypse 2011. Highlights: - The elevators are fast, which is atypical for a boutique hotel - The room service is quick and courteous - The rooms look like the inside of a West Elm store - The water pressure is very good - Each room has plenty of towels - There is a safe in the room - The fitness center has treadmills, elliptical machines and free weight dumbbells - The toiletries are a nice quality and plentiful - There is a bar and good restaurant, Elate, on the first floor My only complaint is that the single room is very small. The bedroom area is 12' x 12' and fits a bed and 1 - 2 moderately-sized humans. There is also a small desk that holds a laptop and not much else. That said, the spacious shower balances out the lack of square footage in the bedroom area. Net-net, I'd recommend and stay at the Hotel Felix anytime.",N
4411,"My last name is Palmer so this place had me from hello. You walk in and the old time flare hits you immediately. Honestly, everything inside is stunningly beautiful.  The hotel is located in downtown  Chicago with entrances on state street ( a nice shopping area), so you really just can't go wrong with it. There is a starbucks and convenience store inside, very nice bar, convention center, and impeccable rooms.   It's also one block down from DePaul University. My room had two double beds with a ""lounge"" space with two chairs and one ottoman. My only complaint about the room was the slightly crammed bathroom. I could have used an extra foot or two. This place is pricey, but definitely worth it. The staff were top notch and they catered to my every need.",N
5468,Sutton place has got it all (except for the CRT Tv).  This hotel has an amazingly friendly staff.  They will help you get anything you need as fast as they can.  The location is unbeatable and the views (wether the lake or the Viagra Triangle) are great.  The rooms are spacious and the bathroom has separate tubes and showers.  The tube is a little small but it's nice.  Some of the best dinning in Chicago is at the entrance of the hotel. I would totally recommend this place to anyone staying in Chicago.,N
2057,"We just had our wedding here and it was awesome.  You are in awesome hands with Barbara.  We wouldn't change one thing about the wedding, how it was handled, how organized it was, etc.  It was perfect.  We had some complicated details and everything was set-up perfect.  The food was awesome, the cake got a ton of compliments, the views are incredible, the newly renovated rooms were nice. All in all, a great experience. Highly recommend Holiday Inn Mart Plaza for any event/wedding.",N
3599,"Okay, I am a Hilton point whore, but that aside, I still love this hotel.  In fact, I love it so much that the fella and I came right after we got married to celebrate! Usual great service at check in (being a HH Diamond probably helps) and congratulations on the nuptials.  We had a beautiful room overlooking the lake and there was a bottle of chilled champagne and a box of chocolates with a note from the manager waiting for us in our room.  In fact, they later sent a second bottle of champagne up! Yes, the Drake will get you drunk as hell on your wedding day, how very thoughtful! Good restaurants, nice bar with hilarious bartenders, great staff, wonderful (recently redone) rooms, ambiance, ambiance, ambiance.  They went above and beyond to make sure we had a great stay, we'll definitely be back every year on our anniversary. It's a Chicago classic, period.",N
3039,"THE GOOD: GREAT lighting in the bathrooms (this is something that Ws seem to struggle with) Terrific lobby/living room Bliss spa!  Love! Comfy rooms Good service Location.  You're right on the lake, which provides some beautiful views, especially from the Bliss Spa. THE NOT-SO-GOOD: Location.  What with it being on the lake, it's a bit hard to get to places.  Not impossible, as there are always cabs out front, but not as easy as other hotels in the city, either.",N
2058,"Decent place to stay in, but the views were fantastic. It was really nice to stay in and just enjoy the Chicago city view! At night, it was quite enchanting. Rooms were somewhat small which was expected, the restroom was even smaller. Cleaning service was good. Pools were always packed with kids and families (which wasnt a problem for us because we were always out anyways). But the restaurant in the Inn was super great. Food was very delicious, best steak I ever had. We had a great chef, that was why. Nice place. I would not mind booking here again.",N
4836,"This was my first time in Chicago and this hotel helped make the visit a very pleasurable one.  I was attending a conference held in the hotel....the place is huge!  The location couldn't have been better.  My window overlooked the Chicago River (more like a canal).  It was a beautiful area...clean, full of nice restaurants and shopping.  The architecture of the surrounding buildings was spectacular.My room was very comfortable.  The bed was nice.  I had a large flat-screen TV and a nice comfy chair and not-so-comfy couch.  But hey, no real complaints here.  My only real complaint was that the closet was a bit small and the doors make it difficult to get clothes in and out.  (It's almost not worth mentioning!)  The hotel staff were all very nice and helpful.  I received top-notch service.I hope to stay at this hotel the next time I visit Chicago.  (Hopefully not in connection with a conference, rather strictly for play!)  If you're holding a conference here, please be aware that the food is less than desireable.  But the meeting space is wonderful.I highly recommend this for families, business travelers, conventions or singles looking for a good time.",Y
5000,"Business center my A$$...I chose this hotel because of the location, price, and because it purported to have a business center with a fax machine, copier, etc. The ""business center"" was a tiny tiny room with 2 desktops, one workstation with an Ethernet jack, and a printer. NO fax. NO copier. If you wanted anything faxed or copied you had to ask at the front desk and although the staff was reasonably accommodating about it. It was a PAIN. Talk about false advertising. This is the exact quote from their website:""Our business center is equipped with all the comforts of your office - computer workstations, high-speed Internet access, printers, fax machines, copiers, and supplies - and plenty of quiet workspace. It's conveniently located on the first floor and is open 24 hours a day.""Straight. Up. Lie.",Y
3959,"Shame on me as a yelper, because I should have checked on yelp prior to booking.  I did this solely because NACS recommended them on their list of hotels.  We paid $190 per night and stayed for five nights.  For this price, we didnt have hot shower, warm meals which we ordered through room service.  I didnt have to go into details as most reviews here already explained the condition of the hotel.  To my surprise, this condition was dated back as far as 2006.  Interestingly enough, the only hotel around the loop with PICKETERS!  I think Motel 6 could have been a better choice.  By far, this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at!  I wish I could give them a ZERO star!",N
5419,Its a great location for a hotel- right off Michigan Ave. And it was incredibly cheap. I booked through Hotwire and it turned out to be about $70 a night including tax and fees.The rooms are small but nice. Wifi is free and worked great for me. I had no problems with the staff- everyone was friendly and polite. The one thing that keeps this from being a 5 star review is that my room was freezing! I was on the top floor which probably contributed to the cold. I punched the thermostat up to 80 degrees but the room itself never got anywhere near that warm.,Y
2243,"Great location!  I used to walk by here all the time when I lived in Chi-town.  For those of you who love their Starbucks, the chain store has displaced the former Zest.  I was shocked, but I guess Starbucks turns more tables and makes more money than your average hotel restaurant.  Last year we stayed here and had a lake view.   That room and bathroom was larger.  This year, we got room 941 which is a corner room facing Michigan and Wacker in the distance.    Lovely view, esp. at night when the top of the Tribune tower changes color.  The bathroom is smaller than I remember it to be, but no matter.  We are usually out and about.  My only complaint is that the bathroom doesn't have an exhaust fan.  Love the huge mirror in the bedroom- if I could only get one for my home.  The elevators are a PAIN, esp. during a busy, holiday weekend.  The pool is a must visit because it is gorgeous.  The bath products are now Floris (wonderful herbal scents, made in France, from the UK).",N
5510,"Being first-timers in Chicago, we had no idea where to stay. A friend of ours recommended this Best Western. At first, we were like, really? Now we know why... It's located right in Boystown and is walking distance to Wrigley Field, Lincoln Park, the red ""L"" line and some express buses on Lakeshore Drive. Nice restaurants, bars and shops are in walking distance and its easy to get to other neighborhoods. We got a regular room with a queen-sized bed. It was very comfortable. Lots of nice amenities: flat screen TV, free wi-fi, coffee maker and mini-fridge where you can store your own food. There's a free continental breakfast every morning until 10am. There's a gym on site (although I never used it -- we spent most of our time exploring the city.) On top of it all, the prices were very reasonable. I would stay here again in the future.",N
1700,"I've stayed at several Kimpton hotels and I'm a big Kimpton fan.  This one had good service, nice lobby and they quickly brought a yoga mat after I requested it.   The room and decor seem a little long in the tooth, very small and some of the snacks in the minibar (you get 2 up to $10 free when you're an in touch member) were out of date (blech!) Not my favorite Kimpton, but they definitely had the lowest price of the Kimptons in Chicago while I was visiting.",N
3480,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for a short weekend getaway last month. The hotel is beautiful... a perfect mix of vintage charm and modern convenience. The rooms, as noted in other reviews, are on the small side - but this really wasn't a concern for us as we spent most of our time out enjoying the city. Hotel staff was top-notch - very friendly and accommodating. The hotel is situated right on Michigan Avenue - location could not have been better for us. We were in walking distance of everything we could possibly need and more. You just can't beat the value and quality of this hotel... we would definitely stay again next time we visit!",N
2568,"I had never heard of Victor Hotel prior to being invited to celebrate my cousin's birthday here. I was excited to spend a great night with family to celebrate a milestone birthday. However, as soon as I arrived at this place with my sister and brother, our excitement quickly waned. There were so many things that ruined the night that I do not know where to begin, so I will just list them. 1. The valet cost $20. Whenever I get raped like that for parking, I am usually attending an event like a concert not going to a dive that thinks it's a hip club. 2. The line Despite informing the dude at the door that we were attending a birthday party in one of the ""private"" rooms, we were made to wait with others outside in an unnecessary line. The place wasn't even full, so the line was uncalled for and absolutely ridiculous. When the line finally started moving, one of the door guys was going to separate our three-party group by making me wait and letting my brother and sister go ahead. I had to ask him if he was seriously going to separate me from my twin sister! He then let me go with them. We waited in line for 20 minutes! I am over 30. The only time I ever wait in line is for a Prince concert. So, I was not feeling this ""velvet rope"" thing at all! 3. Mandatory coat check Once we finally made it into the club after my brother being frisked and my sister and I having our purses searched, we were informed that we HAD to check our coats! I have never been anywhere that REQUIRED a coat check. After all, we were attending a party in a ""private room,"" so why the need to coat check? The coat check was $4 and we were not allowed to check our three light coats together. Just another rip off and annoyance. 4. The cover charge I have been to some great clubs in Chicago and NYC. I do not mind paying a hefty cover for a legendary DJ like Frankie Knuckles in a nice club or lounge. However, NOTHING about Victor Hotel is great - not the venue, the decor, the crowd or the music! Nothing warranted a cover charge of $30 for men and $20 for women. NOTHING!!! The cover was a another rip off! 5. The customer service The overall attitude of the people who ""work"" at this dump was terrible. The first guy I talked to at the door was a jerk who thought he was important because he was working the door at a third-rate club in the meat packing district that is obviously frequented by people who do not know that there are FAR BETTER places to spend your time and money. When I  tried to ask whether we had to stand in line as guests of a party in a private room, he was very curt and just dismissed me to the line. The second door guy who was going to separate me from my group was also a jerk who joked that I was going to cry if he separated us. It wasn't that serious, but who does that? It is basic club etiquette to let a group enter together, especially a group of three people!!! The cashier had the worst attitude of all. After my brother paid the ridiculous $70 cover for the three of us, she, with a very stank attitude said, ""He needs to give me another $10."" I informed her that 30+20+20 = the $70 he had just given her, and she just said, ""Oh, ok."" Then let my sister and me through. I will say the security guard at the front door who frisked and searched us was cool, as was the lady working the valet at the end of the night. The wait staff for the party did a good job. However, overall the attitude of the main workers was awful and enough alone to make me never return. 6. The ""private"" room The party was in a ""private"" room in the back of the club. However, other club patrons continuously walked through the party. There was no rope or security to stop people from entering the party. I have never experienced anything like it. At times, I could not figure out who belonged and who did not. There was NOTHING spectacular about what I could see of the decor. It looked like a basement with chairs. There was no real ambiance. The lighting was terrible. The room was so dark that we could barely see each other. The music was so loud that we had to shout to be heard in a whisper. 7. The music The DJ was horrendous. There are far better bedroom DJs around Chicago than whoever was spinning. For a Saturday night this was pathetic. The DJ played endless Jeezy, Gucci and Weezy peppered with played out tracks from Justin Timberlake (Rock Your Body) and Usher (Bad Girl). Those songs might have been popular five years ago, but in 2011? Really? The music was far too loud. The blends were non-existent and the overall playlist was a Rap/R&B/Pop hodgepodge that sounded like someone's iPod on random. The only positive thing about this rat trap is its proximity to the expressway because as soon as I arrived, I wanted to go back to my car, hit 90/94 and go home! This was my first and last time going to Victor Hotel.",N
702,"Great location right off the Magnificent Mile. Very comfortable hotel! Staff are great, love the room service options from Viand (restaurant next door). Beds are FIRM, much more so than most Marriott properties (me likie!). I'd definitely stay again.",N

2417,"My fiancee and I stayed here for a conference that she was attending in the building.  I was expecting a certain level of service that goes with the Hilton name.  Unfortunately that wasn't the case.  Our non-smoking room that we booked over a month in advance was not available so we got stuck in a stinky smoking room.  However, we were told that someone would be in within 2 hours to provide an ionizing service to get rid of the smell.  Three and a half hours later, no one showed up and we were ready to go to sleep. In addition to this, I was shocked that we were charged for Internet.  We had stayed at a Comfort Inn earlier in the year and we got free Internet.  Here we were at the friggin' Hilton and we had to pay $4 an hour to use the Internet or $0.69 a MINUTE to use the system downstairs?  Ugh.  You've got to be kidding me. To make matters worse, our smoking room was to be changed to a non-smoking room the next day.  After making arrangements with the concierge, I was told that someone would be up within 15 minutes to bring me the keys to our new room.  An hour goes by and no one shows up.  I finally storm down to the desk to find out what happened and get it straightened out. The rooms weren't even that great.  They were pretty average and still had old CRT TVs.  Like I said, I expected a certain level of service from the Hilton and it just did not deliver.  If I'm paying this much for a room, I expect it to be worth it.  This was not.  Needless to say, we'll never stay in a Hilton hotel again.",N

2127,"Okay, unless you throw down a lot of money for a room, you really are treated like lower class.  Even my upgrade didn't net me a nicer room.  The hallway had scrapes and scratches on the paint and doors.  The carpets looked like they hadn't been cleaned since the building was built and the hallways and my room smelled like dust.   Granted they were remodeling the restaurant downstairs but still.....my allergies went nuts and I ended up leaving early because I couldn't stop sneezing.   Also, nickel and dime you do death because they list themselves as a luxury hotel.  Well, again, if you aren't throwing down some major cash on the best rooms you'll pay 15 bucks for access to the fitness facility and have to pay for internet access.  boo. Good notes, the bathrooms are beautiful.  The air conditioning works well. Will not stay here again.",N
3409,"First, the good news---the Allerton is clean and it's in a good location. Here's the rest of it. The poor service started with the bellman bringing the bags up--which took about 45 min plus a phone call. They had no idea where the bags were, someone would be ""right up"" etc.  We eventually got the bags, went to dinner, came back and hit the sack. It felt like there was something in the bed---like sand or something sharper. Weird. The next day we came back at 4pm, and housekeeping still hadn't shown up. I called downstairs and they told me ""they have until 6pm.""  Needed towels.  ""They are on their way"" No towels ever came.  I grabbed some off the cart in the hall.  Came back from dinner around 9, called for towels again, stopped by the lobby, asked for towels, and left my business card with night clerk and asked for the manager to call me the next day. No one ever called. Eventually--after a about 30 min, some  towels came. The second night I inspected the bed a little more closely. The mattress covers are made out of some sort of woven plastic, and a handful of the fibers stick through the sheet---they are so sharp they stick right through the sheet. The effect is like sleeping on a tack. Other issues---tiny/slow elevators.  No coffee maker in the room, so all the guests are going to the lobby in the AM for coffee, then waiting in lines to get back on elevators. Bartender surly; couldn't take cash. ""No change."" Way, way overpriced for the level of service and comfort.",N

Apparently they ran out, but what happened to the fact that I reserved it?  Room is rather cramped. - Didn't inform me about the bed situation at the desk when I picked up my keys.  Upon actually getting into the room I had to call them.  I was then told that they ran out and they can move me tomorrow if I don't unpack.  Since I'm only staying for 2 days, that's pretty much pointless. - Desk is stuck in a dark corner with no lights.   - Radio/iPhone/iPod dock is broken - it has trouble connecting my iPhone, the connection is loose - Makeup mirror is loose and won't stay in place - Front desk when called not very friendly - The view from outside my window is a dark alley.... - Didn't provide internet passcode at the desk when I'm getting the keys. - The light switch to the bathroom is broken off at the end (still functional thankfully!)

4381,"I stayed here over the weekend while in town for the Dave Matthews Caravan.  I noticed that rooms were going for 200+ a night, however, my friend got an amazing deal on Priceline for 90 bucks/night. When you walked into the room, instantly, I knew why the room was so inexpensive.  They gave us a queen size bed after informing us that they were all out of king sizes (we had a late check-in).  The bed seemed to take up the entire room.  When I looked out  the window, my ""view"" consisted of brick walls and the windows of other rooms.  I now realized why other rooms had their curtains drawn. The bathroom was fairly large, however, we couldn't get the stopper to stay up and keep the bathtub from filling with water, not to mention the fact that the the bathroom had no ventilation of any kind, which makes for a pretty stinky deal, if you catch my drift (pun intended). All in all, the room served its purpose: Sleeping, showering and changing for a very short stint in Chicago.  If I were on ""vacation"", I would have definitely opted to upgrade to a suite for a more comfortable stay.   The pros of the hotel: Nice bar, lobby/lounge area, Starbucks is conveniently located downstars.  It was conveniently central to everything: Millennium Park, Grant Park, a few blocks walking distance from Magnificent Mile. However, the best part about this hotel: It had a UPS connected to one of its South entrances, which was open on Sunday!  I ended up getting stamps and sending postcards to family, as well as mailed a t-shirt I had purchased for my niece.  That UPS was the saving grace of my trip.  Had it not been open, I'm sure the t-shirt would still be sitting in the corner of my room, a miserable heap, begging to be shipped to a pretty princess in San Diego.",N
