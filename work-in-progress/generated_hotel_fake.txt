hotel on the 60th floor (17th floor) and have a view of the Plaza for free :)A Friendly & very friendly staff. Very helpful, very responsive. I am extremely impressed with our city and want to encourage all our visitors to head up to the Fire Museum! we have the longest elevator in the world, and the room is very small. I would like to get this place on every city check-in.Best recommendation - $25/night! Awesome hotel, free shuttle to our Chicago hotel and lobby! Thank you everyone!!!!!!If you have any problems, please drop us a line at howmanyhotels@yahoo.com
Cobra Entertainment and Auction House & Hotel is available for reservations through our website. The National/International Directory, listed by Hotel International Inc., says that they have 100 hotel rooms for deposit, and I had about a week's worth of hotel stays there when I stayed there. It was worth every dollar for a room/room.
hotel-wellness, I hope they've given me a try.
I definitely recommend the Smart Bathroom and I really do find this area to be one of the top hotels in Baltimore. The location is so beautiful the views is spectacular, and to warm me up a bit I thought of my sister. I was unable to even stay at this hotel until after the hurricane to save a little money.
This place is great. Wonderful bathrooms, double standard spa, awesome location.
I found this to be a good job location. I would give it a 5. Well worth it.A great location for guys looking for new jobs. It wasn't a bad location but it was definitely not the "best" location I had ever been to. I even asked for a free office and the room was full. The whole room was small and loud but worth the hassle. The spacious free desk is perfectly decorated and as I understand it, doesn't make you feel like you're carrying a

This was my first time going anywhere, thank you so much! Great party!
The atmosphere for my next night's experience was warm. The restaurant has a full bar with food and drink options. The king of the seat was their Artistic Director. Mr. Johnson and I greeted him and were seated next to him. He was very friendly and accommodating and did not have any issues. The staff was very helpful, always bringing our drink of choice at our table to make sure to include our drink. The prices at the bar were reasonable, hard to find until you had to bring a steaming cup. Staff was really friendly, friendly, and everyone seemed to be chipper for a variety of drinks.
Awesome atmosphere. I've been coming here a lot.  We're not used to

All accommodations are available upon request for a booking through the Hotel Customer Service App. However, guests who wish to use the hotel are urged to use a lobby near the plaza and grab them by the lock.

This location would be better served by parking. It's cozy in the style of an independent-looking bar area, yet easy to use. There's lots of options to get to the hotel, and they have plenty of delicious food, plenty of coffee and soft drinks in most of the rooms. There are no service issues here. The just 9 doors of the building make for easy access, and you can check in in at the front desk at 6AM for entry (not included). Keep an eye out for nudes, however, as they are very popular in the hotel. Rooms have amenities, such as piano and toiletry. However, most people at this hotel have trouble finding beds for their dead bodies. The only restaurants to come to this location are old stalwarts in South Park, a chicago restaurant called That Nice American, and their other nearby restaurant On Al Ave., a
hotel restaurant on the east side of Fairmount, is located at 111 Third Avenue and Gage Street. We was at the breakfast buffet but our waitress was more than happy to give us a small base to let us grab a couple items.We were hoping to find a room nearby for a night at the restaurant and had to come in 5pm to book one of our rooms. At first, the receptionist said we could not find a room at the hotel but later they offered to show us to the staff for $2 per person, discounted breakfast prices, and even some free rides. The first two nights in stay at this hotel were very cold and the party was slow as we watched them go by, but the third night was pleasantly peaceful and I am truly glad to say that with the hotel built on the fringes of cities we use them for any nightlife. There are just not a lot of choices here and besides that, a coffee maker was very tasty in every table area and
hotel, wineclub, and spa. "It's one of our rooms!" exclaims one visitor. "Thank you for the service & services! We're at a good location and I'd recommend this place to any loved ones!"
I booked to pick this hotel this morning and ended up booked just after 9:00 pm. The hotel offers great service, pleasant atmosphere, a huge breakfast room and a room decorated with posters that say "Honeymoon" everywhere you look! The hotel has a huge library so I had a quick reading to take, even though I didn't go over to it. Our room was our dearest...PAST!!  We've been here a few times...we always had great customer service...I believe the Littleroom Hotel is among the best. I'll definitely go again.
Absolutely loved the place. The main lobby is pretty nice and by and large its pretty large but plenty of book clubs and photographers as well as some over the counter
hotel.com who did a full review of the hotel. The Room was very comfortable and stayed extremely well. The staff were extremely attentive to their customers and they were very helpful and helpful with our business concerns. The arrival time was VERY quick, almost no more than 5 minutes after the booking window closed (waiting until 3:30). Service was good, helpful, and concierge friendly. After booking our guest booked an express travel account we were told that we were to bring another four night stay. We were supposed to stay the night and then be back to my room which was not confirmed with my boss. We arrived at the hotel about 4:30pm after picking up a couple customers for a table reservation which we were supposed to arrive at 2:00pm. The entire time I was waiting for the hallway to open it was at 4:20pm, around 3:00pm, when it finally took off to the elevator. The arrival time of the elevator was extremely slow
hotel "Stuck in a Large Hall"

*Need to go back for a night out (pick up with the Boy Scout membership, before bed!)

We booked this location out early, and it was close to our house, so we called the hotel and waited in line to get ready. During the wait, the door opened and the two of us finally found ourselves in Room 158, but they were not there to stay. We waited 24 hours for a hotel to start speaking to us. As we were leaving, another bus arrived to help us, and this time we found a room that was different. The room we were in was the old Orange House Hotel and I had picked this room up, so I didn't know it was the one we used, but it was my boyfriend's only room of our choice at the time. We were all too impressed with this hotel, especially the magnificent bed with "nemesis-esque back-glazing." We absolutely loved
hotel showers available on 12/30-4/7, and include complimentary spa items including our own unique cleanliness. Also we have a show room that has a large desk and dinner and is clean and spacious. Security guard was terrible.
They are not nice, but we had absolutely nothing. So glad I got there and the hotel is so welcoming and friendly. I spoke to a guy on my line on an over a weekend and while he said, "well what you did to your business was pretty egregious and stupid!", I was pretty shamed.The closest place is our bar and it's filthy and is just a beautiful place to go for a layover on the dancefloor. The cool atmosphere reminds me of iced coffee, but we really do need to stay here a couple times for breakfast. The city is beautiful and bustling, you can catch our train all day long to get to Riverdale and the Ellipsoids after dark.
This was our first visit to
hotel at the Palet head desk, which turned out to be a welcome sight. There were only two glasses of wine at the table, they even had a small selection of salads, sodas, and teas. And if there's a compromise on this mix of craft and mass appeal, it's this one.
Traditional Swiss Rollers and Bequest Room
Crafty Italian cream chocolate with blackened flowers and blueberry chocolate and just enough light that not everyone (but maybe a couple dozen) will notice a difference. The whole unit is extremely clean and the seat itself is so comfortable that the room will almost never sit open.
The Bar/Hotel is in a converted Italian Intercontinental Center and is home to 30 catering, 2 bed super small rooms,  the piano play area, a video studio, webcast, internet, and mail order desk and toilets are large in nature; and though not as elegant as some on yore, it still has a hotel feel
hotel and the 5 is so cozy!
I took my trip to the Gold River Marina on my return. So, I got on the train, went to the west end of the subway and continued from there down to the hotel. We stayed in a hotel on the Temple and Wines St.-Fraternity. I have been waiting years for this hotel to open to the public.
I booked a suite that included a massage room, deluxe suite, shower, kitchen, bed. Did not get home on time and the room was completely cleaned. Had no problems in those few minutes and it would have been nice to have a bathtub in the bathroom. This would have been the perfect hotel for my birthday.  I could have spent much more.  I was so excited to see so many details about the rooms, and the facilities they have...and everyone else that I met up with was great!Great room with all the bars in the area! Location here is also
hotel/bagels, the bakery and the bar. Food was pretty good. My husband had a restaurant on the block that I could see from the hotel, the place was good, but the bar and coffee weren't the best they could have been. Overall, they didn't have anything for the good for the bad. The ip-address (ack) is a little far from the hotel, but there are plenty of other inns that go within a few blocks. Rooms on the block called Outlet/Park together, so you can use the flight out there if you're in Chicago. As for the whiskey, yummy, yummy? Really!.
We spent almost two days in my own room at the W club, not once, because of the drink list, and never again because I knew it could be called a lo-fi haunt/hobby.We stayed in the whole hotel, with their 15-minute drive from IHOP and 2-3
hotel across the street from Chef Fred Korn. I had yet to book the evening with Chef Korn, who is known for his highly-rated Thanksgiving menu, but I still felt like a guest.The very one complimentary drive on Top East of Baltimore Park was great, especially the free pickup service. The drive to the Chef's was fun, which I felt like was a really good thing. With just this one right at the top of Park, we could experience the BEST night of our lives, and that one day could be the LAST. Only thing to note: If you stay at the restaurant, avoid going over the top at the beginning. That's definitely not going to happen, though. Go check out Yancy's live jazz table, along with Salsa and a delicious chicken run. It's a fantastic place!
Simply wonderful! It's a wonderful and nightlife inducing place that never fails to bring you great, modern and fun. The location of the bar at Robert
hotel, Starbucks, and the sleek front desk you should expect.

Great place to stay if you're looking to try out new restaurant's in the area.

I stayed here just before we took our business trip and all of my previous friends have stayed at The Walking Cafe. As it is right next to Broad Street we came into our room and I felt like I was hit with the cold. It was very cold as a fridge sink blew. What a move. I don't think I would have ever stayed there again.
This is a fantastic location to visit anytime you are looking to try out new restaurants, right across the street from the Towne Plaza. This apartment has the look and feel of a second floor dining room, perfect for a quick trip or when you need that quick look at a new location. Priced at $24,000.00 a night and having indoor/outdoor room service, this is a very good value for a club.
It
hotel with a rice noodle and cheese. What are you waiting for in this crazy place?
Our hotel is packed, so we made a reservation for 2x4 from our hotel as a reservation only. We received the housework and cleaning daily and were completely satisfied. We ended up staying with others and their luggage over 6 blocks back. Don't waste your room anytime. The food was also perfect, the room was actually in the back garden but the staff are great - though there were issues with the meat. It's not my hotel, but you can bet that we had a bad day there - so if you can catch a cab or a bus you can go back to your room!
Thank you tepco, I won't be back here again! Thank you for being a nice hotel staff friend and good business suggestion for your stay here.  We saw the "joker" on the tv that gave us the room we were staying in. The resort floor is
hotel and restaurant marks 14 years in the making. They offer a large variety of sauces, and they also feature half a small check. Call our restaurant ahead of time for local catering. Our price was $7.50 per night (in half the price of typical hotels). Also at the North Park Hotel, they have some other excellent restaurants out there!
My two favorite spots in Philly. I love the morning's bites, when you get a local music act all in one night. The Blue & Gray Closet is amazing.  The Park Cafe are solid, so be sure to bring your own snack. When I moved to Philly from New York, I stayed at another hotel and it was totally a crime to not stay at the Millennium Hotel because of the Black Hawk Boxe hotel.   It wasn't my stay and what greeted me immediately was the endearing decor that you find there! They had free parking so no chaperones please. They were nice and helpful,
hotel-standard). Yet I was still watching a TV show in my room as I was reading out the Red Book on the touch screen. I can only imagine how you could have in a hotel. The staff at the Red Book should have even gone in to this and offered suggestions, and improved how my wife and I was treated. The flatmates didn't let us sleep in without a chair, which is unprofessional at best. As with all the hotel's rooms I have stayed here, it is very uncomfortable because of the hotels' feel, as well as the fact that it was so close to a train station.The service on the platform is fantastic, not bad at all, so if you are in a rush you may want to use the bathroom first. Just don't go at the library! The toilets are super hot, just like the hotel you are staying at. A recommended hotel massage service is provided for free, and if you get tired late it will make your mind up
hoteloo. This place is really awesome. I've stayed here many times throughout my 20+ years in Brazil so...I have never felt this hoteloo, and would not recommend to anyone. It is just fantastic. I'll definitely come back.
I ordered a La Vida Hotel on Yelp.It's good. The hotel is fantastic. You have bed, breakfast, bedding and breakfast decor... and the living room is great. Not the middle of nowhere. I also recommend this area when traveling.
Stayed in El Camino the last weekend after the stroller opened up so I could spend a night or two with my boyfriend and a friend. We also stayed in a luxurious hotel - both rooms were better than my old but was not terrible. The staff are friendly and really helpful. No tearaways either.Hotel rooms are quite comfortable. They are very tidy and the aero beds are convenient. There are breakfast counters at my hotel that bring up all of
hotelus can dress itself up and show off their thikix on the floor. Our partner and business partner decided to give us a rest day, and we got very excited! Best of all, there was nothing else to do on the flight. We didn't notice anything about the room you can't see in the hallway or ceiling. The only time we went to the bathroom was when we were sleeping. The bed was extremely comfortable and one of the best pillows available. There was a good portion of staff that were very friendly and helpful. We have been to a lot of professional basketball balling matches, and we enjoyed it. My book, My Bed and Breakfast & Lunch For $14 - The Best Place to stay Was the World-Class Ballroom Restaurant on the Flatiron, however there are a few drawbacks, because the chandelier does not heat up quickly enough and a couple of great wifi/LATEST TASER options also do not get like this. We
hotel in Westminster over the weekend, having checked his name for spelling work before he checked in for a suite to "look at the mansion."

"I knew it wasn't, so I asked if he could come check in after the suite that night," Little said. "He said it would be fine, but when we walked by, his car was almost completely empty."

"I said, 'OK,'" Little said. "He said, 'Do you really want to check this out?'"

The hotel cannot afford the renovations, which can, in general, be pricey for a small studio on a property such as London's Notch. Which said, Little had been impressed with how many other recently purchased suites were done in front of his valet.

Although the hotel is located in a parking lot, Little said he was able to get a spot in the lobby, just a few feet away from his room.

But because his sister was also a
hotel that is easily taken down in a few minutes. The bar too is pretty busy, but a bit comfy. Doable access is available by parking on the I-70 freeways from First and Second Sts. Nearby hotels (Venetian) are in the picture below for parking here. Parking is a bit pricey here (our regular shuttle costs more than double!). Still, there is a good hanging pool in the lobby. On its own, this wouldn't be a place to stay, but some of the rooms were tastefully decorated and a visit is very welcome. Our Dining Room was beautifully decorated with smoky decor and the rooms were clean and well-nourished. Staff is friendly and professional and you'll always be able to find good staff. The Restaurant is a gem, but have a really nice location nearby to walk to. A nice amount of parking is available at all five downtown hotels, too. There are about 20 more restaurants open up now and
hotel up and free breakfast on Sunday, March 11. (The booking page does not say when this will be. It is at 10:30am & Monday when you arrive at the hotel.) I left the room at 11:45AM in about 3 hours so I figured I'd use it until then to get ready for the next event I had going on (black Saturday).My 7 year old son had played for most of the night and with no one to care for him we stayed the night. I thought the little pads were cool, but nothing was going on in our room either. Our rooms also had a big shower, in addition to the shower I had built. The bed is great and the bed felt great. I have never slept in the bathroom of an  mansion before. A budget  would suit my needs! I'm sure you'll like it too.I really enjoyed my trip backpacking through California in July. While the hotel was a little bit sp
hotel, the three-star hotel, has at least one room for rent, including room-sized marble marble, a room at the 8th floor in a brick office building, a bedroom upstairs in a wooden garage. John Humphry's most popular popular rooms are in extraordinary rooms, dark, single rooms, and ever-changing terraces of indoor ceiling tiles. I've heard of at least three rooms upstairs in Hyatt.
Valerie Stroeve (7368 E. 40th St.) - fabulous location. Lovely decor, but still awful people, nice rooms. I heard of several people being moved across to the elevators.  The elevator to 10th Street is heavy but not crazy expensive.  Thanks for the view, Fahrenheit needs to make it to the next floor, not it.
My oldest son put the grapefruit pie I received at the bar in the fridge on me! I don't usually like that so I thought I would review the
hotel here on the Westin Loch Hotel and booked 1 of 2 nights. I stayed there on Wednesdays (Y1 and 1/4 hrs) of the month on 2/4 and Wife (y 3 hours) on 2/4. 8 PM Was a shopping trip the difference of 2 balls and wasn't disappointed. O'Neal/Brooks was very friendly. The hotel is a pretty good deal at a reasonable price but not outstanding.
The renovated hotel is a lot better than the building it replaced. Not a hit or miss from management, but not the worst experience I've had at Target.  It's larger than the Loch, less furniture, and offers hotels less.  While they do all of the right things, they are not as popular in some areas as they could be. The rooms were nice and clean, but you couldn't tell they were waiting for a key.  Their staff never make a fuss about how good

Pros: Okay in one room

Room spot is small and doesn't feel cramped. Best room to go to in L.A. area

Good job hotel, comfortable atmosphere

The location is nice but the staff are not friendly. I liked the bathroom as it was easy to walk outside when in the sun. Not every guest and room is fancy, but it is spacious, I find that it can handle all the guests most have to spend a weekend there and the staff are nice and polite. The rooms are all over the place and the beds are small too. The fact that they make mattresses is an embarrassment. The lobby looks fancy but is not recommended.

This hotel is fantastic. Although it is a smaller and a little less expensive, they are there and have everything on offer. I am an American traveler and come for a place to spend your free time. I can't recommend hotel enough,
hotel at an amazing price.

I am going to stay here and will be putting it in the archives for a while. I stayed for the 2012 Expo and I have noticed that the staff is super nice and would recommend it to anyone. The water supply room is awesome. The bartenders do not disappoint, what is not to love. I am in the middle of the night and just want to call you if I'm up for a martini and you are doing it wrong. It is difficult but I am not afraid to do so if I am traveling.
Did not disappoint! Absolutely fantastic bartenders and I never would have thought a night at the Marriott would last as long as it did, especially when booked in the Marriott lobby. The hotel was a bit light at times, but stayed as advertised. It was a great room which you will never forget. The place was really clean though, the hotels quality stuff was not the best.
Wow, so much done for the
hotel room, there are so many inviting options. But if you're not a convention party or get in early, you're not going to enjoy the view. My son and his partner stayed at my hotel on the shopping floor for that evening. He and his girl stayed at our hotel in her basement for about 5 days. We had our change at least 4 times per night. This hotel is much more comfy than hotels in Westchester, NY or Chicago. The suite was stunning, huge, and being in the middle of the evening is very relaxing. We will always stay here for that night's hotel experience. I would strongly recommend staying here again if you're looking to enjoy some drinks at local bars, no matter where you are.
Good thing my friend & I got married just one night ago so we stayed there. The wedding was fantastic and took place in the beautiful temple of the Star of Cocybe. I am sure it will be the only married wedding in the world

In addition to the architecture set-up, chairs, couches, kitchen and all the amazing amenities, the place also offers one of the area's best family-friendly bar/restaurant options - our bar is open every night!

Love the small town views. With the main back door in the very low back corner, you have a view of Lake Michigan. The nice lobby views don't beat the cold and rainy weather, either.

I'm more a Westside girl than a dude. This was a fun room. Great selection of attractions, great environment.
Where else can you expect to find a great coffee or tea? It's right across the street from some of my favorite bars, bars and restaurants!I came here to visit my grandpa, dad and sister, and my grandma spent some time and money on cleaning up

Came to Cleanup, escorted to bar, and later to check out...there's a lot to see and do. The place is worth every penny and is incredibly cool!
Beautiful hotel but very expensive. The place had the king of san francisco right next door to it. The staff was gorgeous and we were able to pay our hotel rates for the bar, parking and food we ordered. The staff was SUPER friendly and very professional. The food was super tasty and fresh, and the alcohol was very strong.  
hotel In Belgium The Bihongo's is your gateway to modern Brazilian cuisine. Good value for a bargain price. The restaurant is comfortable and comfortable if you are looking to stay. When you arrive, the staff is attentive, reasonable and helpful. The rooms are really well organized and the bar is really clean. This is a restaurant that you must stay at once, or at least be able to stay in a club for $5 per night. We definitely stay there every week, and we recommend the company of staff. Highly recommended!
Really perfect location! And super small! My 3 year old son attended from school, stayed there for 2 days. The front desk was full in the room, which was nice for business meetings when children are visiting. Nice fact that the people that we stayed with were super nice (at the time). And they seemed to have a BONUS experience, (since i was married, but I have a two year old) because the entrance fee was the
hotel chain restaurants in Chicago, Kentucky and New York city that have had increased staffing and use. All of those restaurants receive a 100% credit.

I've been really pleased with the Kitchen's selection. I believe that everyone we've had in the last 10 months (and you must have met people) is already awesome at this place. The $20-a-night box office is big, well organized, and pretty convenient. The food is just incredible!
This place IS THE HIGHLY BEST. Not on the list of any or all of my favorite food in the city, but make sure you check out the entire thing. There's only one price point for the rest of the reviews. I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala which is VERY tasty and as promised, took 4 shots, didn't hit every steak and gave away any or all. BUT the 5 stars is with the temp guy who gave us 10 star because of the warm weather & ever grateful customer service
hotel, and the $200 charge came very close to charging me half the price of my hotel. A triple agent or I wanted to know if there was a double agent agent in the room and if so, but when I finally spoke to them (who answered my phone later that morning), I was told that I hadn't been given an advance by a double agent, which then made things worse. The coffee was in four small cups (not extra-large) but got about two more.  In fact, half a jar of half-a-cup butter was in the room.  They did not give me much advice as to how to handle my hassle, they even promised me to never use that coffee again. I called back again in the morning and the girl who arrived at my hotel sent me the entire package.  She didn't even bother to explain the more complicated details to me.  My grandma told me I should give her a quick trip to Phoenix
hotel shopping cart for a few thousand dollars. You can pick him up at the airport too.
When you get there they are in a taxi. Not as awesome.
Really nice and comfortable hotel, lovely staff. Pretty knowledgeable staff and fantastic prices. Staff is real nice, though! Really nice place to stay.
I was back for vacation I booked our hotel from Facebook and looked around on sites and the check in was okay. I'm sure all the reviewers I have listed are still on here, and not helpful. The pay was pretty low, but it was actually quite cool that everything went smoothly. The rate was right and I think the room had free wi-fi. Also the hotel is located above pool but does have a cable station to connect over to it. There are also a lot of couches that are really nice.
This was an amazing hotel, but instead of the beautiful rooms, the rooms on the floors were horrible. There were about 2,000 people
hotel

a very classy and contemporary room. 24+ Rooms available. Health and safety is outstanding.

This hotel has a wonderful view of the bay, the park, etc.. Beautiful views! The ocean is a fantastic choice for playing in the pool or for outdoor activities.
I just thought it was nice of the staff to stay here...but every place is worth your money. The river is fantastic. The Hotel is just amazing, amazing, and amazing. So much better than others I have stayed in the past. The hotel is small but they have small rooms that are very nice. I have booked on 5 occasions, plus a hotel stay to stay in the future. Good place to stay with friends and family.
My guest room was excellent and was clean and modern. All the rooms are small, loud, and it is the neighbor's only room in our house. It was clean, modern, and even decorated with quite a few rooms to choose from. It has
hoteliner, in an upstairs room at my local O'Shea's. The bathroom provided by either restaurant was just right for a delicious breakfast.
Bar There were times when we did not even want to think about parking our cars. We use a side garage and that was okay. Anyway we had a nice old limousine parked on the third floor with a 6-roller- - 5A with lots of options to park your vehicle in. The building had nice stone wood-panelled walls but it still lacked some nice views from the windows. From what I heard, it is a nice, I guess comfortable place to park.
I love making breakfast. If you're looking for a place to stay or a spot to stay an hour away, I think yours is right at lower back back. One trip to my friend's for a delicious breakfast for both our spouses is worth it. However if you're looking for more options, stay there. Just a few blocks away
hotel-minneapolis coffeehouse. This doesn't include the used-book facilities, but what can I say - they were so fun. I'd definitely recommend this location for any downtown Chicago location.
I love Minneapolis. This is the most unique place I've ever been to but I still miss it. Great coffee with a few dishes on the menu. Great parking is awesome. Parking is very slow and it takes up quite a bit of space in the building. To get into the building it took my sister and I a whole week to find a pick up spot near a marina that I was ambushed by...but we got a quick "hey, we know this is where we're going, let's get in".  We didn't want to wait that long!  However, there were so many parking lots, restaurants and bars nearby - if we stayed there, we could've woken up in 10 minutes from our own town.  Parking and at
hotel.

This boutique, with a hotel lobby, cozy hotel, and waterfall, is definitely worth a visit!

I don't know how many people know about Hui Bird. Its style of luxury that's great.

I can't say enough good things about this place. We stayed there because they got the location right. The hotel was nice, but in a need of some fresh air. It is a nice little hotel. A small restaurant also has a good menu. The room is comfortable, but not comfortable. People on occasion could see smoke coming out of the hotel, but the pool is more cozy, so they do not have to worry about that. The beds are a bit thin. It is a bit clean, but doesn't feel like you are sitting on dirty tables. There are hot water bottles hanging on every mattress in the room which seem to make it dry out (or maybe you took them out after being wet). It is not as long and
hotel turned out just fine, two main things being that it's not a super expensive room but it is something that I would not recommend. The counter had a nice little wood-paneled counter stand with 8 feet of free space on the front and the front grille was fantastic. I was so pleasantly surprised to see the first 6 feet of space, a kid-friendly Great Sally-style table with lots of space next to the front desk!I'll definitely be moving a tad soon here but will definitely stay there.I felt very warm, smells and smells were light, and the cook we had had just cooked on television, lol The room was very cozy, especially around the dining area! I really enjoyed everything else there!<|endoftext|>

We all loved
hotel-something-out!) in the back lobby of Tower 9, the act of robbing the staff in the most very flattering fashion that I've ever seen. When the first floor of the hotel was moved, the rooms weren't part of any  public or private rooms, their  was occupied by employees. They left such an awful smell when all the diners ate here that no money was left. They even put  a water block in our dining room at around 3am to prevent a leak. Very rudely sent up a guy who already needs a hotel because of being on the record for these assholes out there.
Came here for business Sunday and got a complimentary room in the lobby. After waiting some time and reading the review, I read it again and absolutely loved the decor. So quick booked a night and arrived on time. When I came into my room was very glad I had stayed here! Attached in bed, however, is only an

hotela's Hammer and Diamond Antique Hotel in Chicago.

The hotel can accommodate 2 guests, but for an additional fee we decided to upgrade to four large rooms with bed/saddle beds for the street corner; room service is on the last line, after 6pm, and you have to be entered in person to rent beds; hotels may be harder to find, but they have several beautiful rooms; all the other hotels have privacy, but we didn't see the view.

I wanted to admit that Hotel Edis is definitely one of my favorite places to stay. I highly recommend it! This is a star hotel and very well worth every penny. You'll be back and ready to be treated like a king and queen.
I've been going to Chicago for months now and I was so pleased to finally be a guest here. The place is cool and it feels like real Chicago. The guest service and pricing are top notch! My stay was great (

The Vibe shoes are fantastic. Very comfortable and most importantly... comfortable. The suit and shoes are priced at $15 a pair. Nice value! Also, the line is pretty great. And a good deal for Starbucks.

My husband and I've been looking forward to this hotel for a while. The rooms are 3 beds per room. The living room has a suite of out-of-this-world amenities. The BOBAY bridge is right across from the swimming pool. And there's a pool with a birthday cake, birthday cake on it... These are the city's heartiest places. The BOWL stands right at the busy intersection of two major arteries that make up Chicago's east side. Park yourself in a quiet place; be respectful of the street who gets in line, let out their open garbage, and drink.
Got an issue with the 5 star rating. Service was pretty poor. The room did serve an empty decent quantity
hotelita -  11/19/14 For my daughter's birthday, she wanted to write a thank you note for Katie using the toilet paper.  Unfortunately, the team I work with had to order it for the birthday of her cousin who is with us.  It was quite pricey for a gift.  I hope I didn't go too far by using an asterisk next time.  There's a list of 20+ options available with $30 overages for $25 (and so on). The service was terrible.  There were drivers come out of their blue'u for $3 each - and he would go for them, I believe.  He had to actually pay money for one reservation - which was, again, expensive and a little silly.  They said to keep his room booked with the side room, and later a lady said she wouldn't pay money for a hotel room so she didn't have to have one.
hotel room, a couple of ladies (who used to live in my room, but whose daughter's room was in the old corner), lots of alcohol and a great view of the Pacific.  The waitstaff was nice and I really enjoyed walking down to the restaurant.  I really did not expect such an amazing hotel room.  All of the staff in the lobby, and the rooms were good!  If I had stayed here in the evening, I would have known there was an hour-and-a-half-long wait before a great staff breakfast and then some good drinks.  I even called the waitstaff twice, both times on the 11th - feel free to ask.  They were so accommodating in how they handled the time between my arrival and the reception.  I highly recommend visiting the hotel again.
We booked the best hotel we could get and it's a shabby by example hotel that should probably stay elsewhere, like

The Chinese Restaurant

After wandering around 4K there was a definite need for a better location. If you're going to the city and were going to stay in a hotel, then you'll definitely want to head here. Downtown is awesome, and the only thing in the front desk that tells you where to stay is that they really don't know where to find your room.  The place could have used more interior decoration or some food items and less decorating noise.
Great lounge
Attractively located, "I have really liked the decor of my hotel but not by many. Room was really nice and easy to restock. Also good money is to buy cheap items, not like I want to spend anything for a hotel.

The coordinator of the "Highway's Edge" was shocked to learn that he was having problems with customer service at Chicago's State University toiling in North Hollywood? http://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/30/sports/chicago.html By 2008, as part of the city's efforts to stay on top of the city's crime problems, i.e., a total of approximately 30 different city agencies took up the job, did nothing for most of them, and now have to put up with payment packages for $5 or more from the federal government, and do not accept food or drinks at the canteen.  They ask the guy how many drinks were in there, I don't hear he replies, then make him confirm a date. I don't even get why he did that. This is a private company and they have now replaced the canteen attendants and cleaned up the place.  The "Highway's Edge" employees
hotelanderkimmel: floor, food, gift-away area. I must be mistaken. i had no idea they would open this particular hotel so quickly. had fun there.
My roommate found this bar and we moved on...been there 20+ nights, always have great reviews.
The room and staff were outstanding. Really friendly, and totally helpful. The staff really came to help. I would recommend this hotel if you're a big -lazy - fan of the yuri bud from around the world!
First time I stayed here in Spokane Lake area. I gave it 5 stars for the quietness, convenient location, complimentary drink, service, and maybe a little bit of a charge when we arrived in the lobby. It was the reason I stayed in the hotel and they felt it would be worth it. The only other word that is really good is "deal". They come with a beer list with a soda, to make sure your drink is in your choice
hotel, and there's also be plenty of extras like luggage you can get in exchange for discounts on everything from here to $50 per night!
There's so much going on in Chicago - cool, but all around still delicious - but I don't care about how well it actually works. We went down to the L.A. Convention Center on the concourse and the entire lobby looks like a carousel. My staff couldn't even reach me because I just had the concierge holding me to my desk. It was just a regular hotel where we would stay from breakfast until about 10:30 or so, which was better than being locked into an elevator! The WiFi, which was also terrible, was terrible - it was only about half an hour and never offered special music or much else. The bathrooms and the access to all of the elevators were useless - the last one was a rickety, stained-glass bar - and I don't want to spend money on

More food offerings in the coolest of cases! I didn't care how neat their refrigerator, plus the comfy suit is awesome!!! Its not hard to fit a couple round ones like this in the room. Two good alternatives:

The cozy apartment suite had a water rate, double fridge, and slo-mo 2k seat cushion.

Beautiful decor. Still living in a building with gorgeous walls and my wife loved the lights!! The whole downstairs area was nice. There is a cutout at the window for cleaning the windows (it was a cute window. Good idea to leave a notice). The firehouse was cozy. Hot, clear, and spacious. Excellent bathrooms, a lot of room to clean, and awesome towels. Everything is organized, but is great because the area with hot water is covered with lots of old furniture. The kitchen had a spacious bathroom that I liked to use for the 4-5 days a month. Food was good
hotelish catwalk which is open to the public for just a few minutes. It's within walking distance of The Nobility Lobby Hotel which features luxurious indoor suites with studios, compartments and quite a bit of spacious seats for people of all sizes.The lobby is very small and felt like it was over a foot in diameter with the marble floors, which reminded me of a Victorian courtyard. I actually stayed at the Hotel myself but was prepared to have my mind blown by the views from the balcony. The loud drinks in the nightclub as well as the fireplace filled with smoke had a palpable impact on my body. I will definitely stay here again and will absolutely recommend this place.
Love this place! This is another one in a line of trendy single-stay hotel near full-service hotels. So you spend a day a day at the luxurious Hotel in the heart of a city, and at one of the city's most luxurious high rises and has an entire city center. The atmosphere is friendly
hotel was expected to be on the best night of my life. But, before we left, I checked my credit card to confirm that my ID wasn't stolen. The security person that asked for my ID quickly introduced himself as Bryan, and told me that he had sent a friend over to check my checking account, and that he did not know about the case. I agreed to give Bryan $20 for himself to run through the case. Then we went to see one of our meetings in front of the coffee maker. And there were two world wars coming at us, and we thought we had made a great deal of money to let our friends and family know we were about to pay for this. There was still a clause in the contract that allowed me to cover the entirety of the stay if I left. Now the gentleman's name is Phil, and he works for the Chicago Steakhouse chain. In his office you'll see a ceiling fan on top of the fridge. It's the

Food, Table Choices, & Gourmet!!
My boyfriend and I were planning on going shopping for the trip to Barcelona this weekend, but unfortunately we had to cut time to make it so we were in a really bad spot. The buffet was not very nice and I wasn't able to get as many toppings as I needed and the breakfast was way too high-hype. This trip is not for brunch, but with some great stuff we will definitely be back. My coworkers at The Spa are incredible and always suggest us a good trip over, not only to spa, but also a hotel room! If your on a budget & want to stay by a different hotel every weekend, go to the Spa Spa upon request. It's ideal to stay at the top of a high class hotel which has good location for a hotel lobby.The South Stream Hotel was ideal for us.
hotel.com can confirm that their chocolate was in fact what was purchased. They make gluten free cookies (gluten free dough) that are great with almost every size cookie we tried, but the gluten free cookie brand doesn't seem to be a way to go for the service on our new website, especially in Seattle. I've been considering this company since the first reservation but was disappointed to hear that, it doesn't fit into the criteria of the greats. The best thing we could do for the rest of the night was to ask our waiter at the check-in desk and see if they could help you with anything. If they couldn't, they would take your bag of other merchandise. For my last reservation I gave them the ballerina. These are fancy-looking but not worth the $13 you could've got for something more luxurious.
I received a complimentary wiener, I ordered the marble, which is not as fancy as I anticipated, they even had art

First of all I'm shocked we're going to a hotel like Tower Hamlets. First of all, I'll admit that I've been here before, while sitting here in Toronto and my previous trip to Niagara came down to Doncaster last August when I was still working on a documentary. The Hilton is amazing! It's so convenient. Nice reception and Great A3 staff. The elevators are easily spotless. Cool bed and amazing air conditioning options to go with it.I was looking forward to returning my room. After my trip we had to check out just a few places to find out where the toilets were, in case we were unable to stay there for only the first day of the trip. Needless to say, we stayed at Hotel Horsley for an hour with no issues. However, the staff there did not take any questions!

Best thing about this place is the warm coffee and everything is right in front of you. They have lots of space in the lobby. The breakfast buffet isn't even close to being what I remember when I took the train to my new house. Good place to relax in summer.

A front desk up call place for the holiday party. I went there last night to stay with my group of friends. We talked with the receptionist the day of the party but we didn't get anything but everyone the entire party was at large. My buddy was a huge fan of the Service & Reception team who were extremely helpful for the guests. Being on the sidewalk, I don't think I would've noticed them coming. They gave us an awesome tip, gave us water while we were asleep and then they have to clean our hands for no reason. After paying at full price the next night, we found it was the most efficient customer service I have seen. During our stay

I absolutely love the Food Service at Smartline! The food was very good! It was priced right but not exactly for the price. I am taking this location as an ex-resort. I live here! The cleaning & cleanups are awesome. I even got a glass of water. We got new clothes for a wedding!!
A budget travel-oriented destination! This was my first time staying here. Our company had a great conference room. We stayed at an authentic hotel for a wedding, beautiful hotel atmosphere, and fantastic views to the South. The room had complimentary wifi with free internet connection.

There is a reception hall with "old, good food, old hall", really nice air conditioning in the room, and floors did work. We spent an awesome $10 a night for one of the best lakefront restaurants in the country.
A good chunk of the night was partying and every hotel is open to the public. So far, so good. Overall a great hotel, solid location, but those who stayed there for not too long did not love it either. If you come from the south side or West Lake, great location as well.
My mom was great. We enjoyed being away from us all night, and our room was an all day weekend in Chicago. That's about it, if the place is bad, it's kind of an open book. It also doesn't add up

I wanted to keep my account, although I would consider staying in a hotel that was a little pricey. Overall the hotel is friendly and very clean.
I am here for a wedding. It was a great experience.  I also booked a room for the night of the wedding.  I will be staying here again in the future when I get another room. We can't wait to go through those beauty tries.  We stayed at a nice good hotel with some really good cuisine and all the great restaurants and bars.  I highly recommend it!!!

It was to house a restaurant in the basement, at Hotel 18. And it was not in the park, of course. It was neat and great. The doctor said it was not even business as usual, which isn't a word for people whose businesses are taken advantage of when the downtown area is shut down. But a few small questions to anyone who is looking to escape Chicago: what are your options and how much would they pay? I have never seen as much as I can recall or been treated to in Chicago. The restaurant was cute and clean, delicious. But to be honest, I found the lobby a little depressing, especially when my boyfriend and I sat at the table. My initial visit was with an open heart mind. So I stayed there for a short time and met some people, but decided that my experience wasn't worth the time spent inside the building or what it took to finally get

I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to look at a recent or historic tour, hotel lobby lounge, hotel nearby beaches, etc.  If you're looking to spend a day or two staying at an inn somewhere in downtown Fort Worth, you have a long and great time to be having a relaxing and enjoyable day there.  If it's a gang party, well,  it will have a little that doesn't feel like a gang.

hotel offers hotels at Discount for $40 a night, from 29th Street, 4th Floor. We'll also be giving away the 7th story. Another nice perk of staying at the Hotel Regal are of course food, which includes oysters, but without the daily double room service you've been paying for. They also have busy bars that are very, very busy as well, including Pizza Pizza, French fries, hot dogs, and pretzels.
I highly recommend the Regal. It has what you need if you are looking to spend a lot of money, and the restaurant will keep you busy. The hospitality staff is friendly, warm, attentive, and just a great add-on to your hotel. It has a large, excellent budget, and one of the best card-carrying bar to be found. In a hotel with little to no amenities or parking available, this one will definitely stay for long hours and work.

hotel. As the next night I stayed in a hotel and ate at a cheap cafe/bar on the hill (I think they use the same names). A couple of nights ago I was out partying with friends at the cozy restaurant (I like the restaurant just as much as the restaurant). The food was great as well, there is one pool pool in the lobby. The surrounding area isn't completely shabby at all but is as big as a bar, gymnasium, etc. There was a cool bit of burgundy street noise while I was smoking and the smoke was weird and, I was still smoking hot. My fiancée was always in the back of the room on all nights and were the only ones at the cocktail party (will never go in any other bar) so I was pleasantly surprised. The pool was lovely and not fancy but comfortable.

I have bought another fabulous and beautiful hotel in Korea for years, but in this case the living room was a mixed bag. The bathroom was at night and not in the same room as the bath. A queen bed made a great value, but the only comfortable one was a stainless steel bed with wood floors. It was awesomely comfortable, but the dimple was off and needed a different shower. The queen could not quite wake up, but the sound was the best I have ever heard. It's certainly not worth staying anywhere else.
Love this location! Location is good and I got a super lucky room booked to do a tour of the inn and the modern skyline of the city..permission must be given to my good friends..Great room!!!!
Time to bring back Inn Brands or try them...love the opportunity to keep a close eye on them so I might as well go.

My wife and I had a great holiday in the Houston area with good hotel accommodations. We stayed at the i-Star Hotel for our 5th night (24.2.2018) and are glad we chose this hotel. One of the reasons we stayed was because our birthday brought us a fantastic coffee, which was very nice as they are definitely not a coffee specialist. The air conditioning was great, water was all over the place and the room was beautiful. And as usual, the fact that there are no front desk staff is not nice because you can just get your

Dive in to see some exciting sights around Chicago if you don't want to spend over $200 on a luxury vehicle, tour, etc..I know you may not find what you have been looking for but if you are a Chicagoite or looking for a budget Travel Experience, then Doubletree is your hotel. I don't care if it's the best brand of hotel you'll ever see. Even though it is the second time I've ever stayed at Doubletree, this location is a tourist landmark and you can get to enjoy the very best local food in the Chicago area.

Came to stay a few days back for some music while reading the NY Times. I had one of the room's main suites and was very impressed. There were two chairs as I arrived and 2 men standing next to one of the chairs. There were no infirmary staff to speak to either. After leaving the room, we were greeted with "Yes" signed by the AC for ALL PARKED AFFORDABLE STATIONS (GEEPERPA). There was not a change of a single towel or nap. Honestly, our rooms were nice and well furnished. It is definitely not a 3-hour-trip worth it

hotel… not to mention the BEST snacks in Las Vegas! It was one of my friends that called in and she was so excited to hear about this wonderful hotel. She mentioned that she stayed in the Silver Linings Playroom on the Long Island with a large orchestra. She said she could sit in the back and that she loved it! The room is spacious and she had pretty beautiful saunas for dinner. The general layout is beautiful and the furniture was interesting but extremely priced. I've never stayed here before but just for the $125.00 price tag I thought I'd rate the hotel. It was in a great location in Chinatown and was home to a very popular movie theater area. WOOOO!!!!!.
Every morning, I wake up and my partner and I quickly find ourselves at a Western hotel.  My hotel room was an all-you-can-eat buffet with out taking a rest or a night to rest.  The rooms were beautiful with nice view

(Ha-Ha) I've been waiting for 2 x 5 years. The continental view is beautiful. The big piece of City is a nice flatline, you can see different parts of the city but I cannot see a tiny part of the city any larger than 2.5 blocks. To get to the parking lot you'd have to make a hasty road trip, parking is in the garage to enter the hotel lobby to get a "lot". If you happen to be working in the area, you'll have the opportunity to look around, see the hotel and make some choice calls - but you don't need to park in front of the hotel for the entire trip! The off-hours feel awesome!! Beautiful hotel, free WiFi is a treat (even though I did miss several times) and enjoy the awesome view of the city and downtown! [More about

Aside from the city the bathroom, there are very little shops around but many others. The range of refreshments can be found throughout the hotel but it's absolutely delectable to discover new and stuff the dishes that you could never have thought of!
Meeting up here is the most comfortable, professional, friendly and pleasant experience I have had anywhere near this much quality hotel. The housekeeping and kitchen staff are friendly, professional and the rooms are spacious. The staff is definitely top notch and its a welcome change to stay here. Staff is nice, even with the recent arrival of an upgraded Black Friday that meandered around from off time to time. The cozy room features 10 TVs, TVs with models on top and a large bed with built-in bars on top and a floor all over it. I stay here on a regular basis with

As a matter of fact, we brought my friend to the hotel for the 10th Annual Kimiwa Millennium Anniversary. Unfortunately, we were let down because of the need for our room to be dedicated to the Millennium. Our room at this hotel is also a great location for weddings, but that location is almost completely out of the city. You can just go to two elevators and find your room. Our guests have been checking in from two different rooms. They make a good choice, I even paid with cash. The room seemed especially grandiose, even though it is a dark brownish dark grey. We were all nervous when we got to the room, because of the minimalist view of the lobby. It felt like a museum entrance was being shared, so I wondered how they handled it. The majority of the staff was great. Everyone was so nice and friendly, we

While most of the food in the house was small plates, I found at least one large chili pie served on a small plate. So while I did NOT enjoy the flavor, the service was definitely good. and, if your thing, I would recommend a quick breakfast. The brunch to go was magnificent, which could only be interpreted as an inside joke that doesn't even mention his name. I could stay for breakfast at a few of his "friday spots" at the 3-star Restaurant Costa Mesa, but my first time in the Costa Mesa was in the Costa Mesa Area Convention Center at an average of 3 pm the following day.

Hi my wife and I had a little walk down the street from our building the past few days and my boyfriend and I are staying here today. During our stay we met up with Laura Zentner, who is a very successful reporter for CNN. To see her business she should see a DVD of the show. She said the driver in the white car is Gail Koch, a reporter for the Washington Post. So, we also tried to get her to visit us in front of us while we were there. However, she was not able to do this. I asked her what she was going to do if she could stay there in the hotel and she told me she's totally fine. So, we went back to our room and took a photo with Laura, which Laura is here with. I mentioned
hotelplaceap (as seen here). They've been at this location a couple of times but never cleaned me up properly. So far I've never experienced a complaint since, but you'll have to be careful if you come here. The closed back door just blocks some alleyway when you take a shower and it really feels like a hotel. Rooms are small. The entire parking lot seems to be a disgusting filthy disgusting stain.
I'm a hipster and love to party & a club!!!  And I'm just getting started with a suggestion to stay at the North End Hotel.  This location is typical of the larger and lower end hotels (The North End is absolutely luxurious & awesome), but has a very street level, bohemian feel to it, plus the poolside in the street (which means you don't get overly hot on the pool).  One place I stayed is at the 85 and one thing I really enjoyed was the "therapy" room
hotel lobby — and a soft-edged thing like a bee hive on a deck, or it's something to do with your Tintino friends — but it's nice.

You can get on the Gold Coast by swishing

What most people don't know is that the South Coast is kinda awful. The location of Millennium Pier, at 53rd and Cathedral streets just off Greenwich Avenue can make you feel like you're in a different city — the pier was recently rebuilt, but only in a totally different location. So if you visit Millennium Pier, you'll walk from the downtown station. The lobby is very nice, and a beautiful mirror of the office that covers many blocks is just nice enough for you. If you're interested in exploring downtown Chicago, it's very cheap.

The location of Millenium Pier — for $43.95 per day! You can even get t-shirts to commemorate the event!

'I do love this hotel. The women we stayed with were very friendly and welcoming. I feel comfortable in the hotel and the staff is very helpful. I always get compliments on our rooms for the value and sophistication, even in guests who don't know them, or want to complain.
The whole review can be read here: hotels that serve good food, close to malls etc. and the staff are friendly, nice and clean. Not a bad idea with great prices and really, cool architecture.
Our room was remarkably modern. The bed was not very comfortable but comfortable with a bit of room to spare, and that room was clean and clean. The elevator connected at a point

You will also need a swivel chair and a lamp to light your windows in your room. I use a big lamp with the grandstand! A big lamp in a room with a nice view. Not quite lighting the room but nice to have! 
Really nice place! I'm a huge fan of the "The Met" in Chicago and would recommend this place even if I did not find it to be even remotely desirable. Once I arrived, I was greeted by an elegant, clean lobby space with dark doors, narrow painted ceilings, soft and inviting windows and wide windows. I had to rent a room for 2 nights which was about $500, plus utilities plus other amenities. The last night, my server used "full go" coffee machine, which was very awkward. The wine and cheese were absolutely delicious, which i really enjoy. Also,
hotel] or a brand-new, gentrified building. At least that's what we were told. At least we saw how of course sooo friendly the restaurants were! No complaints of the waiters etc…but there are still something about the town that you don't understand. The parking lot is a little weird. You can grab an even larger space so you can park yourself and then you're never allowed to stop to pass one. The only other thing I want to mention about this place is that it's operated for over 30 years. So you can expect to spend $100-$300 for a great hour (restaurant) and - if you want to spend that, you'll pay over $300 at most hotels. At our firm, we usually used to have to talk to the waiter a lot, they'd provide my recommendations to the hotel staff for a $200-$300 refund, I understand that that's much cheaper than the bigger ones (goodies-for
hotel lounge. the guide might make the décor sound a bit dark, but it's a beautiful room. most rooms are 2 pieces - 1 plate with salsa, you can eat that at 8. The beller garden is next to the spa because of it. on a nice day, while I sat in on the showering the Spa, the staff asked us for more tips. do not rate anything you can believe but only try to make your bed comfortable. in the 21st century, the staff will not be sorry. The sushi was ok but felt a bit expensive. with the drinks, the room was very dirty. no service whatsoever at all. thank you!
My first visit to Spa La Devi came in November of 2007. I was the subject of an article in the Huffington Post - nearly seven years since Spa La Devi was first introduced to Las Vegas.

Other than that I think they are still pretty nice restaurant, which i like to see and appreciate.
Love the location. It is a beautiful brick building and you feel like the living room you put on a toilet.  I have been here before but didn't get any feedback from a catering staff member.  I cannot recommend their service enough. I would recommend checking out the place again as it is so nice to have a place that is more than they pay for. The food here was top notch - beef brisket brisket, sausage, pork shoulder, side left fork, coleslaw chicken, cauliflower,

However, he informed me that I must have mistaken my friend for a fallen cat and that there was a brick wall and even smoke from inside the building. I promptly informed the guard that my friend was to leave the building immediately. After the complaint was made, the guard was asked for my wallet and demanded my phone number. The fact that I left the area and not walked to the Police station (which seemed silly and did not seem that bad) was just dumb and contradicted my honest characterization of what the LPD had told me. Asking for money, believing my attack and leaving the area were inexcusable and my friend, in my position of innocence, made a stupid decision about asking for money, and came back to my friend and there sat all of us at table in another room for five minutes

I went there. We had made a reservation and that time we were all seated and the hotel was fairly well arranged. The front desk was kind of busy.  I had a feeling there was a problem, and we were taken to breakfast by the group of people around us.  It was closed until 4 pm, so they had to say "No problem, just a welcome" from the waitresses, and then they canceled. We're still in the rooms and almost felt like a huge mess while sitting in the rooms.  The rooms are awesome. The room number is out in half on top of the hallway, so we had to double check for that.  At dinner, we were asked to serve in-form for our fees.  The reason the dinner was so mediocre is that we couldn't recall how much each person put on the menu.  I'm pretty sure the restaurant is a little

I feel like a funny middle-class girl. To move over here, I had to create a Christmas tree and get "bloody." My parents lost their entire estate and my mom's house all to this horrible wedding!! I'm seriously going to tear up my rental options!!
I had a guest room at our wedding for the night and didn't expect to arrive at 6:00 pm. While not as large as a hotel, this was way above average. There were guest rooms up to a ceiling overlooking the street, and there were several all around restaurants and bars in the hotel. Aside from the deodorant, most of the view was wonderful, and the room itself smelled tasteless. I got through about 20 minutes without having to go to the window or face the windows.
We loved the hotel, but not by much. For what it's worth it is a very young hotel, which is not as good as other old ones, and I
hotel, Valois; if they are not a small hotel (I stayed at Empire Inn in City Hall), I asked the side entrance for free and never heard from anyone but the guests and checked the room name at the front desk. My partner and I stayed here a few nights before the winter when he and I went to rent a condo in which we felt comfortable enough to stay on the wall. My husband and I were always able to decide to stay there because of their old rent money, but we could not afford to leave. During the summer months we had hotels coming in because our credit card was so late. Since we were in the middle of holiday shopping in New York City, the night we headed to my favorite hotel that night (Wagon, so we had just saved our night's lodging) I figured it was okay because we had much better luck that night. At the Holiday Inn, that night there was plenty of rain and plenty of air conditioners. But it is expensive
hotelayacht.com of 36 beds available. Great price for the price, a quiet room with enough room to hang your car (NOT THE SHOWER). No need for someone to pay extra for all the amenities.I went to the front desk on my third night to request a room for the third one which was on the third floor from here and this was our first room. At the front desk we told all our staff about it. They explained that we was requesting to stay on the third floor and told us there was a room available for a floor air conditioner. When asked if I had a room, they explained that we would have to use their office for an extra charge. The room was neat but not to the wall or floor.I came back the next day with no problem. Everyone was friendly and all were much pleased with this room. I can't wait to head out next time.

We waited several minutes at the Terrapin Inn before arriving at the T over-priced guest room, and it was just beyond ridiculous. For what it's worth, there's nothing like a buffet buffet in Chinatown, and they gave us tons of options to get our food and drinks. Bowing and walking down paths to the side of the restaurant were very accommodating for the price, not to mention the picturesque room that I enjoyed sitting in. The free WiFi was pretty tiny at this point, but had the edge for its size. My wife and I used it to play with everything at the hotel. A staff member stopped by our room just to let us know how excited we were to go to Chinatown. She also paid $10 for brunch and breakfast, plus she ate

If you enjoyed the whole first season and want to grab a moment or two to stay better, this one is for you! This show is on the cusp of a hit with some guests and I would recommend it to anybody looking for adventure and to stay in a big city. Awesome location, location of Kāh Pamp and the elegant buildings on the best side of Las Vegas. Awesome wine.
hotelier and he swears that he was the only one. The open bar doesn't disappoint: even when we got to the desk, our waiter had no luck. The room was a snug, comfortable bed, so we were all comfortable. The pool was great and was awesome too! The line for brunch is long, and the line for business isn't as long. Our next stop: Stone Farm Inn. One of my favorite restaurants on the U.S.-Mexico border, definitely the Best Inn Chicago.  For just $45 and free wings, you get unlimited breakfast, lunch, dinner, and night service. I found this location several years ago (at the end of our busiest day of the week) after I requested a room.  I told the manager that I was not sure if the decor was all that appropriate, but the next night he brought me a phone and it had so many welcome photos of us inside the inn.  There are a ton of

Lucky card, interesting hotel. The rooms look beautifully done. I feel like there's a lot of the furnishings I would have taken to work well on a given night. When compared to those of me who have the luxury of feeling like the Kardashians you guys are super hip. Would recommend, but it's 4 stars in my book.
Room came out fast and service was excellent. Rooms booked for me were held until midnight and they had drinks and snacks in advance. I was happy with my stay as we had breakfast and breakfast with the staff and could have called again at any time. The place is an absolute gem in town and I highly recommend this hotel

Rory Keller's second job as a contract worker seemed to contradict all my previous choices. I called, and he said he had a contract that didn't permit him to work as a manual worker and work as an agent. So, we drove up to his job and he was in charge of everything. We wanted to know if he knew if the house was old enough that his house needed a brimming hot tub, but since he didnt have one, no one in the building was willing to touch the dirty or empty/empty out bathroom. He also said he would never mess with his employee and (it would be illegal) he thought it was nice that he could have his back at the table so I didn't see any funny face, I was confused on the streets and thought
hotel hill. I didn't know it for sure but I got a OK HURVEY welcome. It was a nice space for party favors and a great location to relax and have dinner, and free wi-fi. At the entrance to the hotel we were greeted by all the popular eateries from burgers to sandwiches to desserts. We knew this place wasn't all empty and had room service on standby, so we had a pretty comfortable safe place to stay. I also went to the spa where we got a little bit of luxury for the shower. When we arrived we were greeted by a nice cool spa vibe and a pleasant touch of shopping. I highly recommend this spa for a good birthday. Well done!

hotel 15/12/15 This is the best of the many to come by the Open House of Cancun at the hotel.  You have lots of room options, great hotel hospitality, and the staff was extremely professional.  But it is 5 min before the front desk came to meet me and most importantly we had the best viewing hour of the night.  Our guests and staff were super nice, good food, and extremely friendly.  Very clean and clean after a visit of the Intercontinental Tower and the lobby for the Hilton.  There was also a free parking right across the street. Great value.  Our room was very comfortable with very close proximity to professional hotels. We would not rate this hotel higher for any reason including the "lady's disease".

Liked this place. Is in St. Louis I know it's been here a few times. I don't remember much of the stuff that happened here until I've come back to Chicago. It was slow paced and crowded, had the sweetest cheese. I never stayed in this restaurant before but so many in the past were nice. But the cheese wasn't heavenly. I felt like my mom and dad from high school would have us sit at the bar and give us a suggestion if our wait was too long. My boyfriend and I stayed here 2 weeks for lunch to check in. I am pretty sure he thinks it was a "stay-in" place so

Jacquelyn Ocheras is the only woman in her early twenties who was the mastermind for the deal and charged the establishment with more than $10,000 in damages. Did the woman really know this for her husband? Would she be horrified that her husband, her husband-recuse, or other qualified party conspired to sexually gratify these arrogant women? Is the fact that no one has ever charged the same amount for their single fine, to be believed?

For our weekend of yoga I would recommend Checker Park. We use a small side room for relaxation when we relax at the OR. They are closed at 11am to allow an early morning check-in until 5pm. On top of that, every time we take the elevator up to the city plaza the lobby quickly gets warm. Our guests were very thoughtful, extremely helpful, and always ready to help us on our way down. When checking out downtown we found their shuttle run from 2-3pm and at a nearby park we immediately filled up on towels and again, that was a pain to pay for, so I recommend checking out it.
At the Restaurant Inn just down the street from the Union Square Mall, I checked out and noticed a pretty good looking room, decent service and staff. There were two smaller rooms downstairs but it
hotel  (St John).  The pizza was mediocre but tasted like nothing else  except a card placed at a hotel. Unfortunately, my boyfriend and I had not ordered anything besides the pizza, and we tried it again at the Holiday Inn in Atlanta with the brand new style of Yelp, but it was so bad that they cancelled the reservation. I couldn't help but end up spending some time with the hotel, and it was very warm as well. Only thing is, the parking (which costs a lot of money at this time of year) is $5 per hour.
First review I got at the Holiday Inn. The staff was nice and clean. Their "bathroom" was nice and there was a nice bed/couch. My boyfriend and I enjoyed the warm front desk, the computer room and the bar. The  room was very comfortable and clean with lots of common areas, it had good wifi and Bluetooth and it was nice and modern. The atmosphere
hotelier stopped by a restaurant on two wheels to see a drink. So for dessert, I ordered a small ice cream doll, a cupcake, and a glass of chocolate ice cream. It was the second most expensive food I had ever had in the restaurant, not to mention for an eye-popping price. It was time for the Park!
I just went here to stay at the park. Most couples find walking along the steps of the Doubletree Hotel (it is in some areas of downtown Chicago) to be very uncomfortable. It was a really quiet and comfortable building with no music, for example, the Acoustic Lounge and much better sound system than ever. The Aloha Room was a great location for a music night - you have your music sitting on top of it, the walls have great view, and it is covered in cool artwork. Of course, you don't get to drink from the room's lit candles. They were in no mood for us. No professional
hotel nightclub, using the closed basement floor and curtains as a template for a street party. The weight of such noise abounded and the lack of a fire alarm disturbed guests' wanderings that were deplorable. The most recent police report dated June 30, 2010 stated that there were no officers at the hotel. The first hotel arrived and the night fell apart.
The General Hospital would have been a great call by Marriott to the brand new Marriott Marquis Hotel. The back room was nice, the only issue was the floor, which was mostly a dead-end hallway that had a nasty nosedive. However, since we left the hotel, we didn't hear anything of the underwear manufacturer Maternity. The rooms at 795C and 795B both had a bed, while the bed was the only hallway with a wall but actually an almost transparent plastic bed. The coat closet was really old, although the only reason I would ever have bothered was the fact that the space was completely
hotelic, these are a good place to find some type of food for dinner. Good to know!
The shop we booked is so conveniently located in Downtown Los Angeles, just like the large mall. It has sushi, special waffles, and other everything you might need for a meal. I usually had sandwiches with as many meatballs, bacon, cheese, cheese at all times, and quinoa and rice in my bowl. My preference is really not to use iced water for the bbq portions but it works great. If you have any questions, feel free to leave a comment below or email us at
We are really happy with the rate at the corner market, bar, cafe/restaurant. A pleasant, clean location. The staff has a nice touch. The drinks are awesome. I would recommend it to anybody.

To finish there is a snackbar and very reasonable tip.  This location has very cheap and plentiful parking with a snack bar.  They used to make kids food in their restaurants.  I had the waiter's buffet there, and it looked tasty.  I paid for a soda and saw no problem with it. I have ordered in pretty much every place I have visited in the area so far.  That being said I find myself checking out as many restaurants as I can.  When I arrived here there were a lot of large and tiny rooms with very busy bathrooms.  I would imagine that the rooms are small.  It seems that there are people in the bathroom all around the building and for that reason we only had enough room for half of

While the house was luxurious, it was far from clean. The details are impeccable. I'm not looking forward to revisiting an old room, not to mention having better taste.
Oookay! I was having a few issues while my friend picked up my wristwatch. The large cut-out took up space, but I almost left my wrist. The case is beautiful. The keyboard-sized bar is perfect (it's a natural fit). Really even the little drawers in the room have really good grip. 
Love a complimentary service, even though it's not for young girls!! You can stay a while but I've been staying there and the staff was wonderful!! My first night, we all got into bed at 7 am and the lady asked us if we wanted breakfast before leaving for

He basically said, "Don't ask me to stay on our terms. If you don't like it, you can ask the phone company to assist you out."
We spent a short time there. But there was no attendant to help. When we arrived, the dorm had a large, old shower for a bathtub and a tiny pool. In all, we spent $4.00 for a shower and 50% off a tub. We stayed in the living room with the same inflatable mattress as we would normally
hotelat nice, which would make this the most enjoyable car I've had. It is a superb hotel and the staff are extremely friendly and kind. I should probably check out the Hyatt at 14th and 11th to see if they are fit to go home, because they are so accommodating. Also, the drinks are a gem, nicely packaged and the tables are beautiful too. The well dressed girl at the desk is very helpful and helpful, I also enjoyed chatting with her. They even give you a discount if you book ahead so you can book before or during the trip! In fact, one of the downsides of my stay at Hyatt Chicago was that there was a personal fee to pay for your room for booking all your room bills, so it was more of an adventure than a rental. If you're planning on traveling to Minneapolis for my pleasure, I would recommend you try to head here for the evenings and weekend before leaving again.

We think the request was overstated.If you want a great deal, it's always worth it if you're a busy person and could walk around from time to time.  However, you'll find things that are outdated, expensive and require some basic maintenance.  There are quite a few business venues in Berlin; however, we offer a wedding planner and talk center here, which was pretty enjoyable when we first arrived.  For the employees, the guest rooms are free of charge (even if the manager doesn't know what is the f**k out of the restaurant).  You'll need some hot water, some guests, a halo and a fantastic ice cold shower to get your stuff going again.  We also offer a downstairs wedding center and spa on

No travel allowance should be offered at the Palace hotel and 1 per customer can stay there. Some hotel managers from that day to this today (even though they are NOT the same) have violated hotel policy when they advertised guests to others and pay more attention to security.
Hotel. Just arrived at Door S for a stay. My room was (mostly) ready for breakfast and wanted something from our room. I used a room sink with no stairs and it had to be cut off just to the right location to go for it. I took a long shower (11am) and I slept like this every night for half an hour. I have never had any other problems, you are just getting out of there. On a hotel property with a ridiculously generous suite and amenities, it was the

For some reason the department did not give us a printout so we just have to make a selection of things for the stay on their behalf. I walked in the door and this was huge. I had received complimentary waffles and is highly recommended. If you are lucky and want to stay at a popular place you will need to sign for $40.00 in advance. The Waffle House staff was amazing, really helpful, and had his/her gift for us. Will definitely be staying again.
Hi there, Great location and great food! And the staff was nice and friendly. We loved the effort that we put into the experience. Definitely better than Hilton it seem!
I had not come to Chicago several times and they are great.  Consistent service, great location and plenty of great transportation. Good place to stay and highly recommended
hotel room and I said, "I'll get a check".
An hour later I was going to take a big photo of the room from afar and I saw the huge view, I asked about the receptionist, I was late to the party (unfortunately he was awesome and suggested a dress in an upscale hotel) and I paid for it for the view. At the next hotel I visited, there was only one room with a very well-kept desk and a hip view. So I booked another room with a different desk in the front room, and said to the receptionist, "Don't ask my respect for not giving me this room in that location to sleep outside that hotel!". I got a couple of minutes to go and in one business day to open a drawer in the wall to clean up that mess.
This place is HUGE!  It's very clean, basic, has couches, tables, stuff, etc.  And it has decent armrest
hotela - no clothes. But we were able to try the ice cream, they do stock a good location. Free parking on campus too and I checked in right away. Which is a great option as there is plenty of car parking around the hotel, and it has two restaurants within walking distance. I wasn't surprised to see the G at the the hotel. The food is alright, but definitely a bit pricey.
When we arrived in Tuscaloosa it was fantastic, not so great, not so spectacular. Was there anything better than another Tuscaloosa restaurant?! One would say the Shoplifter, but when we arrived there, there was nothing that could be called "better than that". It had crisp, warm staff, a warm restaurant atmosphere and, in the heat, cake was freshly baked. You could almost feel the shook inside. Everything was mediocre - that's why we liked it.
Cheap, fairly priced, and small but great atmosphere - you

Quick, easy to install breakfast. Just bring your coffee. Check out for your kids at the Philadelphia Phillies' fan area (it's near the Pier), and don't forget the King Center lounge and restaurant.

What can I say? It's not cheap. It's under budget. $1.15 a night is not something to be missed. I've only been to a few Midwestern restaurants here and I wouldn't rate this as a party on a weekend evening.
People who didn't mind the cold would tell me we were headed out of the city and on the Chicago way.
Must pick up for a week. We stayed at the Olive Garden Hotel but found they had no hotels within walking distance and suggested we try the Big Apple Hotel. The guarantee was to have food service that was affordable.
If you liked to come here with friends it was no problem but it is small, quiet and has plenty of cafes and local restaurants.

My Car Manager said that we were going to stay at 9 PM in the morning. She said we should see all the cabins. That said, we could just sleep in the apartment for a bit to stay. A train went in and they ended up locking us in the lobby for an hour. The next morning, we got called to the hotel. All I could think about was that someone was going to hurt me because my kids, a wee girl and my brother, all didn't get off until 12:00 AM with the children. So bad. And I was complaining like the rest of us that we were going to have to sneak in the loo
hotel stays within three to four miles of the building.

And even if you're a wall mall operator, you're a little inconvenienced because the hotel will not tell you how far the elevators are from the building's perimeter wall. The six-minute elevator down the hall is just so convenient, but it's much worse than that. Instead of moving your hair up and down, I'd just have to walk through it to get a view of the lobby or to come out and feel my eyes wash over my windows. As soon as you walk out of the elevator, you're in a high-crime area with two sides - parking that can be a very difficult task because there are no "flyover" restrictions. When we arrived to our room, we ordered a different hotel room than the one we'd received from the city. No matter how cheap we made our reservation, the first thing we noticed when we opened the door was how small the room was. At this point

Being so busy at the time is always stressful to us. Most hotel departments don't even want to touch our luggage as they feel like handing out a hotdog. We got to pick up our valet and pulled up in front of the window. I saw something clearly written on the wall, though we were on our way to the hotel. It said the bed was ready, but the entire room was cool and lay clean. We took some photos of the window and saw that it had somehow been broken or completely covered with mold. We drove back to the hotel with the bumpy old building, so the hotel had really messed up the building. We had to wait three days for the elevator to pick us up, but upon arrival on the last day of the night, it

Love the place. If you love the places they have, you'll not be disappointed.

My husband and I stayed at our favorite restaurant and I thought we were going to love it! The restaurant was huge! There was only 15 people inside and it was also very crowded. I am a huge on-the-edge eatery eatery guy and I love the location and time right outside of Chinatown. We loved it!
So nice to meet all these local eateries who serve dinner at the Sunset Strip, dining in front of 3 restaurants located on either side of La Piena. I was surprised when I first opened the call & offered to try them. From the look of it, the U.S. and what appears to be Russia made the reservation pretty friendly. The restaurant had a single (and special) color-coded
hotelies get really crowded after New Year's Eve, so you never know who is going to get you there at all.But, if you're a hot lady and got a mama chain high, feel free to do a quick look at its website and get back up to a little bit of a memory.And, if you are a woman in this business, I can't stress enough what a cool day this place was. When I first entered the Hotel I was an everyday hot girl when I first saw it in the NY Times. But this hotel was so new it must have been a TV show. The rooms were spacious, the roomy decor and features super-bright lighting made it perfect for the holiday season. And then there were the adult smoking areas. But really, there's only three brands on this list: Good Lubricants (each had it's own sizes and prices, so none of them had a number bar or like) and the Latest Boutiques

All of our friends and colleagues who booked our room received complimentary drinks and ate breakfast on the great 5 star dining room. Our hosts are very friendly and friendly. A true family friendly experience! Highly recommended.

If you're in the country and looking for a stylish hotel in Downtown Chicago, this place is the hotel for you. Priceless. 7 month rental and lots of room service!
If you're interested in Downtown Chicago's gangbanging feel, the Diamond family hotel offers a surprising amount of free WiFi on-site in addition to the wireless network available via the elevators, free rides, live concert tickets, and morning coffee. You can also go for free WiFi while you're staying at the Diamond, WiFi for $4.50 a month. We stayed there on Friday, June 4th, and as we confirmed earlier, came out ready to celebrate. We asked if anyone wanted to help with the event though, and they didn't get back to us
hotel/room 101. I guess for a club like City Center to make an effort to stop in downtown, I was impressed with the thought that they had here. The feel of the hotel is also outstanding. The fact that it has rooms all across the street is definitely amazing, the limited room list is quite large, it is nice to see some furniture, but that only reminds me a lot of Philadelphia.The food was absolutely divine. The menu was beautifully served, extremely quick and unique, really delicious. There was a lot of pork/sweet potatoes (basically ham) inside the Queen James Hotel, which was a big hit. The beat staff was absolutely gorgeous! The hotel has a dung fix, has a kids room, the lobby is really open and so on. There was a one-night spa during this stay, although the spa is very private, and it was nice to see the pool, under the train, and do some heavy lifting around the dining room table.

I booked this trip back in April 2014 because it was over the Christmas holiday and when you leave the hotel it's almost completely devoid of clean rooms. My friends and I were thinking it would be perfect for those of us living in the Mountain West in Los Angeles, but the Michelin starlet really messed with my expectations. If you want to stay for what is reasonably affordable ($28-35 a night) then come here. It is a gorgeous hotel and would stay in my rotation. I was hoping to stay at Millenials Palace and staff would be nice and pleasant! I like to stay there and I feel like there are a lot of stylish American restaurants that are available downtown. The bad news for us is that they have a sales manager on staff who doesn't have the experience needed to make the best decision about restaurants we like, even if you do like them, and they suck. The restaurant was great for the price but left me

To give you a sense of price, you should place your order online (in October, you can add $7.99 to the bill to your bill for $20) and when you're done you'll receive a $5 credit toward your bill. Once your new receipt was received and you checked out, the hotel was ready to charge you again. The room was spacious and beautifully crafted, perfect for backpacking or making reservations.
I arrived in the morning at the Hotel West [618th Street South].  I stayed there on a business trip to Manhattan.  The staff and receptionist were super friendly, the room was really nice and could do a whole lot of things for us.  I'm glad I stayed on the hotel.  And last but not least, the staff brought some nice coffee (you should be there for every 'business trip' that you're willing to use!).  There are

A little friendly and cozy room. This was my first time visiting Clorox and had everything in my bag. The staff was attentive and helpful. Being the first to head in for my seat, they helped me easily through the entire ceremony. I found that my entire headshot with my feet together (meaning no bower head space) was great and I expected no issue for being in a light room. Also to be honest I didn't expect anything better out of this place, at least at the price.
The apartments in Clorox are great, but don't have a lot of room for this! The door doesn't close and it doesn't even use elevator. The bathtub drains into your closet instead of showering. There is no shower, which makes it an odd environment. The staff is very welcoming. Some of the positive things about this place are that they're located right outside a river, they have

I was not all that impressed with my arrival in Chicago. The back door, how efficient, and the fact that they were able to give me personal and/or business credit never made the difference. Very safe!
I would spend about $50 for a hotel room after a great time and we stayed there one night and we booked it at Starbase. Never received that other in person, and never will! They offered a complimentary upgrade of rooms! I chose Starbase as an option and booked about $6,500! This is the best deal I have ever been offered in the hotel!
We stay in a building that just gets really filthy every day - which is why we asked for another complimentary hotel room here. Starbase had a very friendly staff and customer service.  While

Unless otherwise noted, we encourage everyone to get in touch if there is any issue, especially with the strike. For us, it was just the hottest club in NYC. Anyway, the previous night is now, not a great sign, though it may be a bit lower priced than a previous night's experience. If you have a previous hotel, call your old hotel and it will have to be upgraded to room 9 (where you will be staying at your next club). There are many new things happening in NYC over the next few days and there are so many events to be had. Otherwise, as an improved booking, well worth the money that you pay.

I had ordered a new small & comfortable room. It only got slightly smaller than the brand new room, which wasn't overly warm in the least, but not by much and was just almost comfy. During the $40 gochug down visit the back of the hotel, they didn't have a button to the wall that shut them off. The front bed and/or pillow were very comfortable, both are somewhat comfy to the touch. Overall I've enjoyed the rooms I stayed here with elsewhere so far, but this one is a 10star city average and i think the entire suite is better off at the Hotel.
I booked the hotel to sit at the end of the night at home

First, I would never come here again. Great location! I had known Neelam a year and a half ago, but this place was in worse shape than I had expected and I'm still really excited about the location. I have to say that the staff is absolutely wonderful. The location was tight - for all of the spots, less than 5 feet from the shops and because of the expensive small stuff. My husband walked around a bit, but was charged $20 per day ( I paid in advance) for this one room/situations with both beds/ beds. "Das" - worth a very small purchase. I can not rate this place very highly because I felt the same way. The gift shop was really

Thanks for a great night and happy new coming here! Me and my fiancé (her husband and I) ordered everything from On Amazon for our daughter's birthday, especially the Wilbur (dog meat), Burger King, all our favorite names, sports teams and cards for our girls and a lot more. We ordered a fantastic Wexford trip that featured great food at Robert Hilton's food truck where we cooked appetizers. We found the hotel with an awesome view of the lake from nearby River Shore Parkway. Another great price was $500 for breakfast & lunch and an extra $200 on lunch for dinner for each meal we ordered.

I booked the hotel from Cabbagetown Hill as it was this summer. This was a great hotel. In the summer, you could not go more than 3 hours on any given morning in the sunshine. The bathroom was in nice condition, a great view of the pools, lobby area, patio, and the huge Starbucks. The day after my appointment we noticed a "nothing happened" sign reading, "Cold XXXXXXX". This was the bad news about Hotel 'Cabana". We took a taxi to the lobby area, and a nightcap to the cupboard. The other night the lorry arrived, told the waitstaff to "hit the brakes", but when they came out of the window and dropped it on the floor,

Overall i was very pleased with the product from my tipster(s) and shop doorman(s) as it's kept working flawlessly so far with minimal effort to make the room clean and cool. When visiting several places I would be especially interested in getting it in stock for the hotel room after several days of maintenance! My husband and I were delighted! We upgraded our room twice and now use it and the air conditioning seems to be right at full power and the carpet really isn't too clean but that's due to the high ceilings which definitely can cause issues. In addition the counter at the end of the room when opened showed no signs of creaking but that

At the hotel, everyone in the room and in the staff were very helpful and honest. That last one that wasn't perfect was the detail of having my windows glass busted out. There was no way to fix that, nor should I have. The general parking will cost you about $5 per day (we paid less than $25 per hour). If you are looking to walk to a spa, I'd highly recommend doing so. The pool was a bit dirty, but the only area available to the spa was a parking lot (where I can't wait to walk to the front

the elevator fee is $30/month on average.  $10/month on average has changed.  (I believe it was 18/17 nights or more but obviously not one night is too common for that) I've never had a public room attendant make calls on your trip, so the time given is important but you should expect him to have your billing and payment in minute amounts (15pm-12am at start of each day) if you plan on staying over here.  I've been staying for three days at Carlisle and I came back for a three night stay.  My alarm system went off right away.  Cartoon's bathroom may have turned off on the way in to the hotel as I was looking at my device with this beeping noise.
Vermont gives very loud noises so they never even touch a knob or locking lever. This room has a

hotelie and restaurants that deal in adult theme. I ordered dessert, dessert. She said it was dry, she said it smelled like eggs but she said it was good, she asked for anything in the shape of dessert. I ordered something in the form of coffee mugs or a coffee hat, they didn't seem to have one that you could put in a mug. I'm not even sure if it was a couple of people who requested a mug because I don't know what anyone else was even wearing in there at the moment. I tried them. They were nowhere near the comfortable size of the desk that I was used to sitting, only about 6, 6 inches. They were a little thin, a couple of itchy and there was a lot of wrinkle in the stains.

The restaurant is the best in the neighborhood, and the bathroom is definitely better than the downstairs one, so there's not many room changes at all.
It's definitely one of the best hotel I've ever stayed in, everything we've stayed here has a top notch decor, we love the nice walk to the bar for brunch or a cocktail, and all of the single rooms have complimentary WiFi, coffee maker and room service. One of the things that makes the Inn feel special, is that it has a gorgeous blue ballroom. They usually have a cloud here, so you can just stand next to the glass room and wait for your appointment.

They walk me to the lobby and there was a the entrance to the lobby on the right, but the entire time they got here they were both leaving in extreme panic. They've been using Craigslist all night and not only did this happen, but I went to the CVS with an ectopic and it was all over the floor. This is why I want to book a room with them, because all customers are amazed how one down can change everything at once. They believe that if your hotel has room service, the money is going to be used, but it seems like it's not going to be that simple. They insisted that we take them to the Laundromat instead. The next morning they were not informed of our previous booking and ordered

Thanks, Dan!

9 pm with wonderful staff. Great service!

Loved this place.

very polite staff, friendly staff. I came by Saturday night to request service from one of the hotel industry's clients, and they handled it with an "We didn't pay for it" attitude.

Good business

Comfortable room, staff warm on the staff, and carefree attitude

Awesome. As usual, true to taste, my friends and I were pretty happy with the service provided and the efficient service staff had even checked in in. We had to leave early because of money problems, and expect great service in August! (I have to ask because I only stayed here for a night). We arrived at 11 and a half after a good breakfast and we enjoyed ourselves for a while. We had a very nice dinner, with wonderful views of the U
hotel. But here, what a the interior was...
Wednesday's Yelpers seen in pictures. The restaurant is what you'd expect for home entertainment.
Thought the art in the rooms reminded me of an expensive art gallery that kept popping up in the back of my room. Awesome...very warm as far as our staff members are concerned, no unusual smells but a very good service.
I am glad to say that as well as the true establishment, MHH is great! Great location to view the city...no one wanted to see our place go and there is a lot of light and a spacious area to get into for nights out. Plus, we only have a month for the summer so this hotel is much more affordable and comfortable. Although there are a few decent options, the only one that really stands out is the restaurant, which is a bit dated but very tasty and highly recommend this hotel.
I am planning on staying in the party area and it's a fantastic

New Orleans is well known for their design culture. They've got art/cafe restaurants, a ton of very professional studios, a VERY dutch location, and many family and friends who have stayed here for over 20 years. Our favorite thing about New Orleans is that when we came back for the last time, we bought our Airbnb. You will never go back.

Yup. My name is Tyler Valenzuela and I am a huge New Orleans fan. This place is in the heart of the city. I can't describe how excited I am about visiting. Great food and great prices. What's that?? Great place!
This place will be that. Don't expect much until you walk in (which may or may not be worth the extra $1). Highly recommend to stay for breakfast, followed by a great view.
Very unique place. 2-3 people in room and the room staff is great. We can definitely recommend this place to

My favorite date of the weekend. The service is good. The bacchanal guys are great and the room has such great views.

One of the best Chicago location i have been to in over 20 years. When I walked out in 2010 I tried to stay here on Sunday nights, because of a tax reason for the arrangement. Anyway, next door to a Midwestern hillhouse it was about 15 minutes of parking, five minutes of internet connection etc etc...it was not an easy trip. We found the bar with the perky bear as the only drink in the room (and a very nice spot to hold a drink in the open air). The food was fantastic! Very tasteful and delicious. The staff was friendly and helpful, and loved to know they will give me a tip, even if I am not sure. We left at 2:30 AM for a trip that was very convenient, but we should have stayed up.
hotel -- so common and fashionable in that sense that the problems they encountered -- including not being able to stay in hotels that can accommodate them for longer or staying in hotels that may not pay much -- are not unique to this airport.

The Lobby-style taxi took some 65 minutes from Port Washington to grab us from Harbor hotels, but the hotel itself is amazing and wonderful. The ride will take you to somewhere close to the stars. At night it will be a nice remote-suite with walk-in desks, a fitness center, and an area of the lobby that provides a quiet atmosphere for people.

My second agent reported on the evening of December 6 and the two days later we stayed in an Marriott in SeaTac with a gorgeous lobby floor (that I will call "downtown"), a fantastic pool, and new TV. We were greeted with a few options: Hotel Francisco - your standard day stay with a view of downtown and the Philippine Sea.

I'll be waiting for 20 mins to get a new one. <prexy> Well i didn't know i had to shower before bed so it was so busy! I just got a love tooth and it seemed to do. It was a little disappointing, but that's the service i received about the restaurant. The only thing i do am stay at the hotel because i want to be away for about a week! For the price, they are awesome. <prexy> I liked that guy who usually makes a good decision about where to stay. He is very experienced and available to discuss things. He also made a pretty great stop at the Pacific Grill (a/k/a THE BOTTOM of Starbucks). And most importantly, there is room service, by appointment, and a phone tip. <prexy> You should be able to sleep in a

Randy and I attended my first party on the Happy Hour Friday in Walnut Creek. There were many surprises and a fair price. We got to pick a story, book and dessert by restaurants, hotels, restaurants etc and pick four that we agreed with. So fast and easy pick your room and eat in front of the theatre. They had so many bedding that night. The room was the most luxurious of my life. The bartender was clean and said that if we stayed longer or if we wanted to stay there longer we could get a room. This was the last room we ever stayed in on the Downtown station so a really well planned hotel out of our corner closet
Love it. Friendly and nice staff. Each bar had something to choose from.  The whiskey bar  was short because of the TV's traffic
hotelier from Centerpoint) with his gorgeous newly painted finished pewter shell and brilliant set of hair. The roof was beautiful, this place has a great lobby and are on a tight budget. Honestly, I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking to stay here.
My boyfriend and I were on a regular and family retreat this weekend. We spent over two days in the hotel, exploring, enjoying the park, writing my reviews and chatting with others in the room. My girlfriend and I stayed at the newly renovated hotel for the weekend and have been staying with it ever since! For $150 per night! We called the hotel on Saturday, April 18th and requested that they hold our daughter in the rooms. The reception desk in the room was vacant (I say that because my daughters girlfriend overheard me shouting) and the room was completely white. The only door for our daughter was used in a historic elevator. I am very disappointed that we were not provided with a loo
hotel and other friends were surprised by the boarding. I spent about an hour or so at the club talking to people about how hot the room was. They told me about free Wi-Fi and the better internet connection. We were transferred to a different area to stay more comfortable.I was warm but still tired and wanted to go back. We had room service only until we moved in a few months later to San Francisco so we had a good deal of luggage. We got the place called the Lido and the P.M. and the discount rate was right after we moved in. As we were staying there at night, the car at the first floor rent line went a bit slow and the wi-fi was still so unreliable that we had to pull it out when it seemed the city was an overnight problem. Some shots were shot on the phone and out of nowhere, some of the broken windows and a lot of other stuff that you'd have heard about in the internet fiends.
hotel of a whole diner in a machine to open up. I'll say she was cute and had a spare space. They are super cheap so everything just cost about $2 per person.
Their breakfast was fantastic. I will definitely be back to many more my frequent dining encounters!
Great atmosphere! A nice crowd. The parking is in the middle of Lake Michigan, the name is pretty good but it is very expensive for the price, most restaurants have pools/baths and there are open bars on the block, these are great! The staff were great, friendly, and upbeat and friendly and  nice to have with you!!
Came here for a great breakfast and I couldn't have asked for a better quality place. Lots of open air parking in great location. Also has an ice machine. Would highly recommend to anyone coming here for a night of spabing.
I loved this location. The towels were brand new. Our backsides were visible and they were on
hotel of a chicken and cheese pizza? I don't know, but if it's a $35, this will be at your expense. While it's on your summer vacation, check out the restaurant if you wish to choose from a selection of appetizers, dips, entrees, desserts and more.
Great place to get drinks and snacks during the metro service
Great location for someone who's planning a weekend stay. On the corner of Sheridan and the East 67th Street in central Park.  The area is packed with restaurants in bars, food trucks, bars, and parking lots.  There is also a bed and breakfast room.  Very cool, some of the rooms are sized for 2 people.  There is a bedroom with a large refrigerator, which is nice, too.  It was nice meeting a couple of young girls the other day...for breakfast but not a perfect setting, as the front entrance to the park is up (though I have
hotel lobby with the amenities in hand, plus, the price was what it took to get here. We are very excited for our stay and for our guests to stay here again soon.
We arrived here Saturday morning and we were planning on staying for 4 days. We had booked a short stay for one hour with free breakfast and dinner for 10.50 I guess 2 hours of sleep per night and this hotel is better than most places I've stayed at. Service wasn't too bad. The hotel manager explained the hotel had staff services, asking about the hotel availability and said they would provide their address for their guests as well. I called the manager at the mall and asked to have my room filled because we would not be able to access the three rooms that are our room. The whole staff thought there was no way for us to get to one room because there was no available restroom for our guest. The hotel manager also gave us some advice on parking so we could have a standard Lincoln Park
hotel will take you to a location to go at the convenience of a head office with only a few more restaurant staff. Also very nice to come back for dinner for someone you haven't been to before or anytime of the year. You'll stay up until 7pm and check out a small good sized room. One of the outstanding things about the place are the specials. The waiter was never our waiter, so that's ok, but this place would be great for breakfast and dinner.  Great prices and great atmosphere, room's clean. The coffee maker came out great, too, so I could go back and relax and enjoy another drink while I wait for breakfast and dinner.
I liked this place!! Our family was staying at Mountainhams. It was a little newer than the more popular restaurant, but did use a third-floor room on the 3rd floor which was the first floor, plus a handicapped seating area for a few patrons. The rooms were clean and laid
hotel and Noz by the far.

What a place! The wedding venue of a city in a great city! Great hotel, great prices, free WiFi and long staff from the 90's.
This is not my favorite place in Chicago. The kids come early and I'd go home at 6 am and head downstairs and park, before about 8:30 am. I tried a different hotel, this is my favorite hotel to stay in Chicago and there is a lot of international tourists. Did you know they have a lot of international train and tourist talk per week??? I left my beloved with the American train for you.
Been going to Chicago over the summer. My boyfriend and I stayed here on Friday June 19th for 5 days so I knew what time it was. They looked after everything the night before and they have my whole family, including my daughter, and her 8 year old daughter who works as a carpenter. I would recommend staying here and seeing this place
hotel in Chicago.

First of all, on our reservation we did not make any reservation payment to our room until the hotel booked, which does not happen often. We booked so our room was fine to make it a Saturday, the Great Britain [that I visited] is a bit nicer than my Indiana County hotel with all the limited hotels. I cannot stress enough that being able to stay there on our first night in the desert, I thought we were moving away from the horrible hotels in our area. We stayed here for a very reasonable price - our family in hotel was completely respectful to all guests and absolutely turned up as soon as we were seated. I have to say we enjoyed staying here a lot and are certainly glad we were here!
Cannot recommend this hotel. I couldn't be happier about walking through the lobby for the first time and seeing no signs of any problems. The parking lot was nice but the walk away from the entrance was awkward as most were putting beds on
hotel is fantastic!
Posted by hale at 11:30 pm (Sun-Fri)  It's excellent! I just had a "clocked down" type noise to make sure I didn't wake myself up without a huge pounding headache. I never would have taken it out on a woman. Wonderful business and a great location!
Posted by Ddiamond at 11:00 pm (Wed)  I can't see myself recommending this area if you don't like the park. I was in line to a James train this evening, and just came out to check on it. I didn't take off my gloves so I didn't know what to expect, and I'm guessing everyone would have noticed if I didn't.  (?) I wanted a little cool.


Sure, I said I was coming and they didn't even know what we were there for until we left. You have to know the location. But that's no excuse. For any
hotel House with nice windows. The place is small, but equally cute and have a location you'll want to visit or at a bar near the house. We stayed there one day this past weekend. It's only a 10 minute walk from the Pens and top of the stairs in the Bar. I would recommend getting here for their attractive view.
I'll admit I'm a big fan of the 17th century French and German cantaloupes that they made. I've traveled to many American states over the last 10 years in order to celebrate the birth of America's first middle class city. The most popular was here in San Francisco. We have a lot of French knowledge in this country, and I'm coming from the restaurant tradition that I'd been exposed to. The salad portion is extremely juicy, with the cheeses and cucumbers that they keep on the table. The soggy sides are almost as good, though there are a few dips that are full of whipped cream
hotel noa, chum conon, eh clk, questionis if it is not clear enough?

The first (the ones on the front plate, a Peking) girl did get picked out and had more difficulty setting it off than expected. But I was not at the event, to be honest. I was walking to a pretty room to pick up my pal and when the bus lady asked if I had spent time checking in, I said that I did, that was kinda of weird. She even apologized to me for her rude manner (but I figured that every time they got around to offering to help up their pants I would never back down). I actually liked the place. Check out this beautiful bathroom in the lobby of the hotel. The first time I visited I was tired, eager to get a fresh start to my walking out to the city. They were super accommodating. They charged me a $10 piece of coffee per day, while we was staying there.

I will be looking out for a hotel in less than two months. I've been there a few times at the Hilton Chicago and the location is really nice. Rooms are affordable, too. The wall carpet was very soft and placed a thin layer of tissue paper over the hallway. The lights on nearby convenience stores would have been nice. Rooms were certainly small, and more for the corporate vibe than the comfort it offered. The staff was unprofessional, I'm sure that will change. The only reservations I made with others were with rooms that only had one-star rooms, and for the price of a 6-star hotel in Manhattan the hotel was too pricey. The hotel is small and quick, they're right in the West Tower and parking for less
hotel.com and get a pretty decent deal.  I would still go there for a walk but go at least 25 mins and they have a gift shop nearby that costs an additional 50$. Overall, I liked this location to a fault.  Next time I return home, I would re-visit this place on the cheap.
Only good coffee in Chicago.  The food is pretty good and it's not a faucet.  Only bad thing is that they run out of wine.  The location is very small, making room for a conference room or other convenient location.
First time I stayed here I had all but two drinks.  Lunch time was comfortable and I enjoyed the perizza, the kombucha from the fridge, and the coffee I ordered.  There were very good drinks on offer, and I did not see the need for anything else.  But it was clean, well-lit, and
hotel; the restaurant is available at CityWalk, a convenient and busy downtown/east downtown bus stop. Each walk here takes you somewhere close to the closest hotel. Did I mention there are vegetarian options? There is so many to choose from. From the complimentary coffee to wine and with a glass of wine you can be completely surrounded by almost anyone! For my pick of food, we spent $15 per person, so I figured I would be at least a little bit paranoid before buying the whole thing. I did not want to stay on a 'hotel'? I told my boyfriend and his girlfriend that there was an expensive "hotel" in Chinatown waiting on the train, so I went for the best option! I waited about 1 hour to order, and a new owner came running in and totally pulled my wallet out of my pocket when I said my extra $6 was free. We had already had a night to spend, so there wasn't any front desk. I left, and
hotel and pizzeria and you could find a girl for lunch.Then I went back to check out about a week ago and found out that it's probably midnight in Providence. The front desk there was kinda hesitant to let me know that it was 25, it was still night in front of us in the hotel lobby (she was only halfway to work at midnight, obviously), and they were trying to get me to check in early to stay. Well, what a joke.I guess I'll be back tomorrow morning. If only it had been nice to have the privilege of seeing such good American shops as Seattle and Florris so late at night.<|endoftext|>
hotel "Mr. British Bombardier" offers two residential apartments on the MacArthur Park site. The Hilton has been recommended as a contender for the Hilton Chicago gift shop and also offers free wifi! The choice would be very different if the Hilton offers 2-star hotel rates on the footrest hotel rooms or better 2-star hotel rates on the standard hotel rooms. It is, I think, fair to say that after the treatment and long visits that this hotel gives me throughout my stay I will be returning, thanks for checking out my stay. I'd recommend it.
This is a great restaurant. I had the honor to stay here on Saturday night, and the reviews were very positive.  It was excellent, with fresh breakfast and coffee.  The menu was excellent as well - from salads (there are, admittedly, many) to a typical size of Chinese restaurant.  I found that very helpful.  The room was great, and there was even a bathroom
hotel.com as an easy and quick purchase.
Mixed feelings. Short answer. Supper was quite difficult and confusing. For some reason I always felt like my patron was about to give a fucking shit, after the employee explained they "knew" and "didn't think to ask for a refund". I'll never forget my visit with our guest and she greeted me and offered her services on occasion. But when she got the hint she got shorty. Stayed in in our hotel for about 10 minutes and said that I'm not doing this business because my employee was (bragging things about) being very rude. The bartender was trying to help my boss with the restaurant but it didn't help. It took me a little while to resolve this, I was clearly annoyed at her being so rude and I was hoping she might ask for a refund. One of the bartender's best words at that time was "don't ask for a refund".
Liked the guy.
hotelier (in front of the floor). He was watching TV when he realized someone was watching over him. For a non-POTUS, this isn't a live operation. The train is only a three-hour walk from downtown Park Slope.
We got an excellent night's sleep early. The coffee maker was cool and inexpensive at 5:30 in the morning (about $9-$12 per person). There were no valet booths and it took about two hours to get to some grocery stores in downtown Park Slope. The concierge service was decent (to say the least). Parking was around $30-$40 per night (plus) and there was an in-car automated waiting room (but no fixed windows). Our nanny of the month was very helpful and everything was great!
The drive was slow and extremely bumpy. First we arrived, there were bikes and then cars, some running, one parked at about 5 pm. We were given a free
hotel, hotels, hotels and travel agents. The only real problems were one hotel employee who could not find the information he wanted. I expected that will be a place to stay for a few weeks, but it turned out to be nothing like a typical hotel or hotel that we've used, but a bit longer than that.  We have no choice but to use the italian free wifi. We asked our room to keep it warm because it is hot but the staff is rude and very unpleasant.  The flat roof appears to be cut up like some other free damn chimneywork or a wall of sparks.  We have to use a water lamp to make sure that the ceiling stays standing.  There are garbage bags full of food and other items in the bathroom so we don't know what is coming out of them and we're annoyed that the doors were broken.  We booked ourselves a night to go for a casual meal or a beverage by themselves,

Rent Food Is Cute but Not Nearest (Special price for a bed). Ordered my JD in April and loved it. They tend to go for up to $200 a night for a room, plus delivery depending on price. They have taken steps to provide great dining experience. I ordered it for 2 nights but unfortunately received no response (because of smelly towel inside). i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone in town

hotel here was just ridiculous. You will never see them again. Do this much work for yourself. There are shops that specialize in the Hotel Room. People can get quite wild and weird sometimes, though you will never be allowed into the lobby. Do NOT pass through the front door here. There are many weird maids here, but nothing bad. If you happen to have room service, give it a try. The employees have great attitude. If you feel like it, there are 2 open desks, one for employees, and one for other workers. Nice place for one reason or another, and the views are fantastic. There are small, but nice restaurants around the city, but most of them are unoccupied. There is lots of fun in Cajun Fashion Park and the area. The people in the chain of shops are not usually helpful, and you can find "seniors only" to our office very easily. Parking is $10 for a car with four spare people in it
hoteliers to sell at, etc. They would give us several $15 beers and a drink at a convention center that wasn't free. We were out of paycheque, so we made the hotel room we booked our flight to a hotel a little later at our last stop and had it taken care of, but it was a class 3 oasis hotel that needed rehoming and then repairs at the hotel. I ended up staying there on the night of the raid for no extra charge, so the hall service was free. You can try it out (there's three separate rooms) for around $100 plus I won't spoil you if you are a quick snack. The food was plenty to accommodate the hotel staff and parking was spotty on my visit to Miami. Definitely better than the 6 star hotel most hotels bring, the service is still good but this is by no means an overnight destination. I may come back again!
I am so glad to finally have the local Mega
hotel free, it's a very convenient location.
The International hotel seems to be much nicer than the low-rise hotel in Sweden and I truly enjoyed my stay there. They even offer a fantastic ballroom when you have a year in a row to choose from, which was a fantastic experience for me. The service was friendly and the rooms seemed rather spacious.  The most memorable thing about the room is that there was no tarp on the walls.  The hotel did not disappoint - feel free to call the helpline if you wish.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.
My date and my boyfriend came up to our room, took out our meager bathroom towel and t-shirt and immediately left the room after booking (night room he didn't clean up the towels, etc.). We've never experienced such a pleasant experience from hotel staff, always willing to give us special compliments or advise on our work. Our room was comfortable, comfy and clean

Nautilus Cafe located outside of the Failing Union on a 5 mile radius with spa and eating area, the decor looks really interesting. All the hotel rooms come with 4-star or lower decor and one of the best dining rooms in town. I would definitely stay here again, at a great price.

Very good rooms.

I had a great stay at this hotel. The employees were great. The location was great. The quality of the hotel was great. I found a large, spacious room that I could sleep in - also the shower and bathroom were quite nice.The bartenders were great. The concierge was awesome. Definitely a steal.

It's a lovely area. The street is lovely with plenty of space and great views. But it doesn't give you much room to sit and relax if you happen to be at the Tifton location. Our friend and good friend considered staying in our apartment to relax some and got more space. The bed was quite large with plenty of tissue in the bed to keep the mattress moving when you were in the room. One of the few amenities is that we are handicapped so we can't actually afford to use this luxury bathroom and have to use a wheelchair. Another thing, it's overpriced. For over $200, this is a convenience store. Still worth going to.

Seen Lake! but not everyone must be near the front of the line. As another resident I can't help but feel the need to suggest this hotel! This hotel will open one day next week! Nice price if you are a sensitive moneylender, but I would rate this hotel next to other nightlife hotels we've reviewed (except Aerodrome) or at sushi spots, and since the menus are generally remarkably complex, can't even imagine the chocolaty pizza in the restaurant. If you plan on going out of town on a Friday night, you will probably find a suitable location far away and in hot water, not even so close to

Chairs stayed OK, not huge for this hotel. Every time I stayed there I came across five very fantastic offers, from one to ten rooms, for ten bucks (excluding living expenses) to a roomful of great food, but nothing was up to par, fantastic hotel staff to provide you with the best option, in a good location. Love to stay at restaurants.
The BEST online booking service I have ever received..Rugged by its price, and is very awkward in accessing web sites. Could not come back from a long drive. Parking!

I had a bit of a disappointment with the hotel. What I had before the room opened was so gutty and last minute. They do have a lot of food here.  They have lovely bathrooms, so it is nice to have a nice room to decorate and share it with friends.  I always say "it's okay" but even at the Omni you will have to walk the blocks to get through the hotel. It was also held in front of the Eastern District Hilton during the day which is nice for the parking behind the Lincoln Park and the curb in front of the hotel.  The open floor plans make it very nice for afternoon/night to just relax and relax and enjoy in and out of the hotel without going out for drinks, food, or hotel changeovers. What a shame they went with a hotel with only two beds and huge stainless
hotel room.I remember having dinner with this gentleman in the 1930s.I came with my wife and 2 children, by late autumn of that year I had no one on my property. I had no friends, the beds were very uncomfortable, and the hot tub was scary. I had no choice but to stay there. The older female of the family had a little bed in her bathroom and thought I was lying to her. The room and bath were very small, but they looked rather nice. Our guests spoke a few words in the first place. She only asked the waitress at the front desk to pass us a drink. I asked her a few questions: How was the room big?

However, the hotel offers one of the best, if not the best, nights. The exact times, even though the client wanted to travel, was crazy low.
Kismet Hilton can accommodate up to 9 people at a time in the winter months. We had two nights after party so we got to take our night air conditioning out while we were there. The dining was a must for hotel employees, it was completely small compared to other hotels but plenty of restaurants and hotels offering a cocktail bar, pizza restaurant and dessert for dinner.

My husband and I were staying with a friend in Connecticut on a very busy business trip. She was there for the sake of additional business during the trip.  She did some renovations at her place that are priceless at putting an architectural wall between the restaurant and the hotel; to keep herself and other guests from traveling too far or traveling too quickly, we spent 2 nights at the restaurant in an apartment overlooking a river.  Our room seemed sort of king sized with a cool view of the park and the lake.  During lunch at dinner I noticed the marble shower in the corner room and the wet settee that ran around our room,

Based on my good experience of America, my eyes were deceivingly drawn to Lux Cuan and the city after visiting there a couple times a week, which was a blessing. Besides a hotel overlooking the lake, we were able to hang out in several tables, a bar, a bottle shop and a barber shop.
Unfortunately, there are two main reasons I don't recommend Lux Cuan for this post. One, it's a place that takes out large amounts of money in walking distance of famous landmarks and places, and two, Lux Cuan's outside of town and metro are crowded and shabby. Lux Cuan is really a must-t see. It's friendly and people are genuinely friendly. It also costs nearly $35 an hour in downtown Phoenix ($$45-45 more than downtown).

hotel.com/roads/history/ was used to be an early chain and part of it is still. Recently I booked a room at E Motel n° 1 before going there. As I was making breakfast I went up to the front desk with a sukkah. We did have to wait for 20 mins before we were able to find a room we could afford to stay in. We ordered food for breakfast for breakfast in the hotel and had the room provided us with both a cooked steamer and a soda maker.Our guest in hotel also did some Wi-Fi to avoid sleeping on the floor. Only complaints I can think of would be a poor idea to stay on a single room.Surely we will not have much to eat again. I was lucky enough to stay in our old boss hotel after my quick stay in the New York Tribeca. A few other things I wish I had known were important:THE OPEN BEDROOM!! We had tickets on the internet
hotel located at the Lake Story! The restaurant was fun. On our way out of downtown we stayed in a cabana hotel and found it was surprisingly easy to find a room (so we headed straight to the bar) We stayed in the lobby for an overnight stay for a while and didn't mind it at all! The service was great, not average or unsafe. The ambience of the hotel was clean, comfortable, and elegant. The bar was beautifully lit, even the old light bulb could light up! The room had a great view of the downtown skyline. There were plenty of restaurants and bars near the Hilton hotel, it was nicely done and well worth the travel. We ordered a full sized appetizer, 8 and I ended up going in for the baklava chicken and a side omelette as well! Overall a great Holiday experience! Definitely recommend!

Excellent location, nice location, good vibe and lots of options. However, this will be closer to to Saks for additional suites.  The service was spot on; needed a large board and it would take awhile.  The staff was great and the weather was mild.  The spa is, I think, one of my favorite hotels in the area.

It was good. They called me later to ask to set up a table for guests. The room was very hot and spacious. We stayed in the hotel room with our wits about us. The air conditioning works out and really kept us warm for a few minutes. The mattress was nicely laid out. They never had our queen bed and the queen was covered with one of the strange sheets which used to put a puffer rock in the corner. Our room seemed to have a large volume of play music and was filled with everything from heatwave and disco bands. It was highly decorated, with happy signs on the walls and walls of the rooms. We all got into our car for dinner about 15 minutes later and had a great view of Miami. I love working here so I will definitely be staying there again.

She also built a recently renovated online shopping center and waited five hours to book travel with her friend Laura Peretz who provided tips in the elevator to her.

We decided to visit her at the Hilton Chicago Downtown and spoke with Anne herself and her husband, John. They were gracious enough to send us to Chicago for our stay but we just wanted to try the hotel at once, she explained. They chose a nice breakfast buffet for the very least I could think of and breakfast within walking distance of the Cermak Plaza Hotel. The atrium is decorated and wood-fired and we were given free wi-fi access. We were able to sample local and trendy places throughout Chicago.

There is nothing right and there is nothing to it. The staff is very friendly and can't even answer the phone until late at night.
I saw their staff earlier today. Not too busy at all and once I walked out to the dining room and checked in. After half an hour, and a half after having left the bathroom, everyone had a rest. So much of the staff is old and outdated and doesn't talk about the dinner experience nor the feel of the surroundings.

A couple of drinks just as I checked out, and proceeded to hike up to the hotel - and the staff was awful... they had problems with making reservations and accommodating people until we left the room - I had to go back. The rooms are very outdated, the  private bathroom, the whole front room is  too old and chunky - no queen size beds. I did have one small piece of toilet paper, and there is no book for this area... well it is back and was apparently sent to customer service. I was given $5.00 for a "use it or return it" refund, but it didnt work out since I didn't use it while staying with the guys there, so I was told I can give it a try again, or I will request to cancel the same refund. I will say this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at and pay that extra price, and I will not be staying again

It is a bit bumpy and busy but convenient. I stayed in Algiers last weekend and needed to get a hotel room and so needed to park my car outside the hotel to get there. There was no reception room to my room and the inside of a taxi was one of the few places to get credit cards or as an excuse to take a taxi to check in and have the opportunity to be charged on time (no waiting).The hotels are safe enough for regular pickup or drop off for guests who are attending on business days.

One of the floors in the building was under construction (as a man in total contrast to the brown shacks there). This was because of some size of area that you had to relocate to, which was one of the only reasons I needed to spend that much money.

All I could think was "this room must be here, right?" and when the room really went to smithereens this isn't something I would have cared about. The bathroom was filthy, and the tiles were cracked. I never even knew that this hotel had an older bathroom. When someone showed up at my door, I called for some help and told them to put together an excellent mini-bar.

At that time, I had no option to sell the room at the writing of the hotel. I was furious, and they threatened to take my entire room. I couldn't wait to book a room for an hour.

What you need is a perfect room and reasonably priced room. A Good room, even an appropriate bed can come with room and weight options that can accommodate up to 10 people. It will be comfortable to sleep in a comfortable corner of the apartment. While not all hotels offer luxurious rooms and the bathrooms, most of the hotels were attentive and informed to which rooms they would be providing them. There were no "why" questions or such things that would need to be answered. The lodging is very popular, the staff is friendly and very friendly.  The mini movie star I booked was great!

If you don't like scallions,  virgin bread can be substituted.  This sandwich tasted like a dozen arego's.

I paid $200 for an option to stay at Ross Tower and The Belle. No entry fee, and I can think of no better place than to have such an amazing hotel, especially considering the high prices. I am the last person to travel with it and I've stayed in multiple hotels. What is the business you expect if you are paid based on your room size? If you are comfortable and willing to settle for a price that will last you a good while, they will waive the entrance fees for just about every one of our rooms. If you stay in a rented hotel with an above average-rise, the room isn't worth it.
My room was definitely not the best for the price. I think they will use mold

In a brash review on the website of Yelp, Starbreeze is free! And it's a bit pricey for hotels around town. The ice cream melts for about a quarter of a cup. In case you ever were with Starbreeze, all about the great bar and wine tasting.

I've always loved this hotel. The walls are wonderful, the rooms are very cosy, and the hotels have hotels too! When I first arrived, I enjoyed this place in 2 weeks! I have come here many times before and will definitely stay again! I don't recommend this hotel for professional or casual guests, but will definitely stay again for dinners, weddings, more conventions, etc..

It was the 16th time this year that Jamiy had attempted to spend a night at Burning Man and it wasn't our first time. We've had 12 nights at Burning Man and it has been one hell of a experience. We spent a whole night at this camp and we're very happy that we did. He had his bedding provided and he used some of the mats for her to help her sit. Yes, that's just the outfit - not that it's a "must" but it is great.It's highly recommended.

We've had very welcoming conversations with some knowledgeable people about our location and we've always been delighted to hear from them. We have coffee shops and bar & restaurant decorators ready to help us out when we need help. The ambiance of our rooms truly is breathtaking, the wifi was excellent, and the courtyards are too close to the road to get up and down the neighborhoods.

Great location, intimate and free of charge. Room in a modern building with charm. Our staff has always helped with food. Good at bar, wine, and coffee and is very accommodating. Guests can go in and out of the bar for cocktails, appetizers, free-standing area meals, food (indoor gym) and snacks or room service for breakfast and lunch. Service is great.

Quoted a 2 star review for our room. Plus got on the popular AppCrafter website and stayed for 5 years at a star for free. Was always impressed by the room with lots of amenities and this is my first time ever being in this room. So happy with this stay!

This is an advanced hotel. There are only three bedrooms - one for the kids and one for adults. It has plenty of the restaurants & bar space. The staff is fantastic and has helped with the hotel due to the work experience.
So far, it seems to be a nice location. They are really nice. The staff is really friendly and helpful. The bathroom is nice but slightly overpriced and expensive - just over $10 each depending on the length of time,  - so we highly recommend this hotel.
We have stayed here a lot but have never stayed here in a modern hotel. We went in for a great breakfast in a very trendy building and never really tasted anything else in existence. What makes this an amazing location is they have barter rooms, cheney breakfast rooms, and amazing banquet room reservations on a daily basis. Also great for you as it is a 25 minute drive from the lot of busy businesses and so there are lots of

What is going on?

The bus driver decided to stay for an hour, and the room was clean and the bathroom was nice, including complimentary cleaning and showering, even though I didn't want to be working there.

He has to agree that by order to come to the bathroom the bed sheets have been folded across the bottom of the bed. When asked if he would be pleased to go to the bathroom, but I am sure he wouldn't (he would have had to offer me the chance of going back), he declined. This is a huge embarrassing failure, because it is something I would have done in the event I had a night-time appointment, but if I was able to, I would have gladly sat down and seen what had happened.

I believe our room needs a front bathroom.

Wow. I had this great experience at Red Lobster and was genuinely amazed. I've been there three times and it is nothing but awe-inspiring! My sister and I were excited about Red Lobster so we ended up spending an extra $200. Didn't want to spend the money on more of a "customer service". This place is beyond amazing! The crowd at this place is amazing. The service we had to give to someone was awesome too! The cashier - Mark - was an absolute sweetheart to me. I am really happy that my sister and I were able to spend a weekend here.

The main rooms were either in a trendy modern house or, at least, being nice. The balcony overlooking the lake, made for a place to sleep if you're in California or if you've never been there before. The bathroom was never dirty, and was frequently very clean with ample on the hands. Very, very clean when compared to many other hotels around the world. There was so much to do around the Western world and the excellent staff was always friendly, especially with different coffee in different places. Little did we know, there was a restaurant that's still operated in this location.
This review was a little misleading... we didn't really pay any attention to other reviews since we loved the room with the gorgeous views and fantastic staff. However, it wasn't a huge surprise. However, having been so impressed, I think we are very lucky

Thank you for having me today.  The shop is gorgeous.  I was very disappointed and disappointed with my purchase.  I had noticed a huge dent to the old storage room, which had a sink, and a lot of scrub, so I called a few of my friends that I worked for, to get out of the service to get an expert on what they were doing here.  They said they had repairmen within walking distance.  The attic went down a drain and it appeared that this was a leak.  My buddy, who asked about that front porch was quick to return.

The West End was a little bit of a go-to location for me and I loved walking out of the Oxford Hotel and/or Carriage Place (which happens to be my favourite hotel). However, you had to pay a great deal for parking here (for a high price, especially if you're an 80 day+ tourist), which is a bit weird to say the least.


Some things to keep in mind... you have to have the best supply of rooms, an expert management staff and a super friendly customer service staff who did a great job with location, site view and adequate room service.  We had my view down the arches of the hotel which is the best option if you want a top notch view of the site, or if you are looking for

Once we were seated in the communal lounge, we gave her a couple minutes to think. When I asked what she wanted for lunch, she said she wanted to take a cold one because she was crazy hungry. She also didn't really understand why we needed a drink so soon after our meal. Once she did, I had to grab a towel. "Oh, you were kidding me?!" I realized that her bar nap was actually the last thing she needed. When I got back to the hotel she explained that I'd brought some cheaper wine, but had the wrong name for the bigger expensive bottle. "Oh... well, like, it's a nice hotel, I'm really willing to try it again, but my waiter did a really amazing job." Here's what she had to say. Thank you, no problems there.

Last night, for the first time in one of our tour stops, the place I went to stayed for $350 for a room. They had the location right next to her apartment and we stayed the night in the Chicago hotel, which was basically like having a city back in the day - we felt like we were in a different place, unlike our Chicago, but better.

After attending oasis and meeting a good friend of mine, Donna Diane, who was in town for this tour, we stayed in the hotel. As I said previously, I stayed here because we stayed at a terrific club with lovely people and it has lots of wonderful hotels. And the rooms are great, even with all the great TVs. What a lovely hotel.
I was able to stay at a few of the bigger hotels this summer, but as always, the girls, staff, or anyone else with a significant view will make you very happy.
Wicked hotel. Totally un
hotel from 9:00am to 2:00pm, except midnight that we had a horrible time since there are zero showers and no showers after 10am. We made it to the front desk, made some calls but not to the restaurant, and the service was terrible, the service is mediocre. The only, and only, bad thing I've heard is that the service is the worst I've heard. First, when we were in the hotel room, we placed a down-vote on a "suite sitter" unless we needed someone to help us with our toiletries, until there was none left. That is one of the worst days I've ever had.Second, the lobby/fatty room was so fucking dirty. The carpet, carpet, beds and the walls, the top of the bed were dirty and wet, the walls were wet and not covered with toilet paper. Never again do I have that kind of kind of place. The bathroom isn't great, no
hotel is really enjoyable and made a few meals. The second restaurant I stayed in for dinner was absolutely amazing. On it's own, the ambiance of this location should be pleasing to that of any other inn. The same can be said for the location's patio. No isopropyl alcohol was added but not if you were not expecting this place. Overall great hotel.
Love the room.  Love how old it was, so the lounge was cozy, rocking and also fit for a group dinner.  This should be the hotel that you need to stay to be enjoying your stay at the Hilton.
The room was great - old and old as many buildings as I've seen in Chicago.  They gave us a room with great amenities and great bar with a signature bar-coffee.  Our  lounge was back to where it was when I first returned to my  college town.  There was little romantic stuff in the room

Despite the ice water level, there was still some ice. The main room had ice (3.5 to 5) and for the first time in my life, it was cold to the touch. The only thing left was parking, obviously. I spent the majority of my week vacating my room and getting it completely re-bought so I could go check my room out again.
I never complained to anyone, and this place has excellent working and absolutely no complaints.

The latrine was horrible. I ended up under 35 lbs for the day and my advice to everyone in town is don't go there. My husband thought it was a shame he was in the middle of his bathtub next to my room as I normally do but I am glad the outside came out - no face with foam liner for more ventilation!  It's about $12 for a bathroom and a few towels from the dinner I spent I don't know what else to say about this bar which i think is excellent.

I've been here twice but their second time was this time a little over 2 years ago. The location was great and it's plenty on a high street. I've heard others complain that their payers can't seem to get there because of busy nights with people going all over downtown. I don't know but it really was an awesome experience.

hotel room in the family had a bed and separate showers, which means they had to accomodate a bathroom for the kids. It was a small cost, but not overly critical of the restaurant. The meals I tried were decent and very modern. My fiancé and I enjoyed the Kim Davis Party! We stayed in a cab there, which was expensive, as it is a very large space. In addition to the Hilton lodging options, Kim Davis gets a great location on the Grand Canyon. Thanks to the hospitality, we could have stayed at the hotel at least once a month.
This was my first time going to Williamsburg - and I had not been to it before. Williamsburg was a newbie of mine to go to, and a place to get a place to celebrate.

Worst hotel in the Boston area. If you are coming to a nice place to relax and have a nice hotel stay, here's a bad chance. Come here for a shower, to clean up your hair, a cool room, not a good bar. The marble ceiling is a terrible use of space... Also the front desk (mice, cuss words, etc.) is ridiculous (it was closed during the day). Would recommend.

Here's a quick summary of what the police say in response to the incident.

Police say the suspect ran down the street and took off after 1:30.

Police also say that they could find the stolen car and two other cars.

The man's car was unlicensed when the thief grabbed it and asked him if he could take it to the West Los Angeles Police Department, where they received it.

The stolen car was then taken to Midway Medical Center, where a trained car technician asked the man to remove the car so that he could go back to work, which was 10 p.m. and arrived about 3 a.m.

The suspect said that he will not have to work for the city.

I came in very early for dinner and found out how it was going to be so I got all the ingredients to start cooking by 3am. So was it worth it? The parking was horrible, but I'll definitely stay here.

The Seadamburg Hotel is the most luxurious hotel in Germany (I spoke to a former clerk on the hotel front desk, who tells us that the "low noise level" of the lobby was not our feature). While there are no public transport to or from the hotel, the hotel's services are pleasant, and include free breakfast and tea to every patron.

The ait: It is excellent for sleeping on the couch or in the hallway. The iron table is very modern and professional. The walls are so sappy, we had to fold our sheets across the beds, and we had to do all of this to have a roof over our heads. The best part is that a soft velvet bed with soft carpet still came out very nicely, and no one on the staff noticed.

An 11-minute walk to downtown Thrift Stores (at the time of writing I still found this place to be a good option) isn't a terrible decision. The coffee at West Coast Cafe, which uses freshly brewed and hand-lifted coffee beans, is reasonably priced. The menu calls for simple fare-for example, a big four salads with steamed rice, and a decent breakfast. The wifi is decent, with some fried rice and some eggs Benedict. The coffee is superb, as is the service. The coffee was incredibly warm and delicious with a spicy kick to the top. I would recommend going there if you need warm drinks at home.

The selection of restaurants is amazing and on my personal map, the video room (introduced in the tower of the hotel) is well lit and has numerous doors to play with. Aside from that the room itself is really small and the food and drink/dining are beyond amazing. Breakfast I've eaten here a few times and remember an open breakfast at Daza / Viscount's.

One of my friends mentioned to me the hottest restaurant around that he is close to, and I wanted to confirm!  The buffet and dinner will only have breakfast and lunch, but the food is super authentic. The staff is super helpful, helpful people, great lighting, and (especially  starved!) hotel views. The clubroom and bed/closet are pricey too, I would rate even higher. One more thing,
hotel service, Double Bar Cinema and Plaza Garden restaurant.

As the tipo Laundry salesman, I wanted to make sure I hadn't spoiled this fabulous little kingdom. Inside is the most spectacular place I've ever been to. The menu is quite substantial for a hotel stay but a little on the "tourist-friendly" side.
Upstairs, very good. Staying close to the entire hotel so I could stay at the bus stop was a pleasant surprise. This was such a good looking place and the staff was super friendly. Highly recommend this place.
After making an early morning walk to the Skyline, I stayed at the Singapore Hotels Hotel. I loved the gorgeous locations, the courtyard, the shopping mall, and the view from the window. I could see for sure and I had the room where I needed it, however the staff is so perky that not even I could tell you how awful they treated my card.
My first time
hotel year in the spring. It was interesting to see the small café near the campus, quiet and very clean. They had service many restaurants and bars. Its located next to a facility called the Olmos Hotel and a conveniently located pool in the lobby. I didn't recommend dining out since this was some of the worst hotels I have ever had. I would say this was not to be, however, for the food, much better service and service compared to others. I also saw they raised the price from $50 to $300 a night, but charged for pick up and delivery only. Also, as you're in the region of five bucks for the hotels in Lakewood and $20 for the lots, I'm sure there are hotels, on the block with tons of their delicious places to try, near the edge of the town or other areas you drive to or run through. Overall, I recommend this place to anyone traveling to the Midwest with budget, for every day or night.
hotelstroms.com - Eaters first experience a coffee at CafeElons - and then got our first impression at her. This cafe is in the middle of nowhere. We know it's not public but it's not my name but it's been the site of a lot of coffee shakes, lots of pretzels, Sausages, &...look at the dresser in the corner of the room. Thank you n00b!
I've had years here. The prices are fantastic! One meal at Cafe Elons is an all-day experience - you are surrounded by laughter, dark music, a beautiful restaurant, and a great wait staff. My girlfriend said she had had breakfast at nearby Starbucks because the bar had over $25 worth of strawberries, maybe $15 worth of chocolate, and because they did clean my room in the middle of the night - so when they returned to the room, there was no hidden gas - so all of her ouy were

Coolest, Fastest Hotels On Long Island!  I have to mention the Flamingo or a quick walk south on Joe Del Mar Road.  I loved this hotel I just got off the East Coast last night.  My plan was to stay at the Hotel Hyatt Hotel in New York for another weekend!   The name is not mine yet, they all start paying 30% off and the wall is getting slicker when they put you in at 30.  I had 10-minute wait time, which was pretty embarrassing.

hotela to Doktor—which was pretty close to this hotel, although not that great either—then go shopping for a room for my daughter. I had a bottle of whisky downstairs which I had to walk away the next day, in a strange room with nowhere else to stay, probably as a side room from the king room upstairs. There were tablecloths all over the floor, chairs, etc, but the entire bill was disgusting.  I made this stop off at Chef Von Pierre, and he made you a mini-barbara cake, as are most of my older, experienced customers, for just $11.  In this regard, no matter how you choose to celebrate this great travel experience, "whoa!" surely didn't go for this bargain.

Chicago International Airport (founded in 1875)


Chu-Chu-Chun is a great stop for new and used car travelers. From the parking lot to the old electrical towers, from foot to head, and the parking lot, chu-chun is less than ideal for getting your car. This is not an effort to get by the airport or if it was (it's better still) you could check in, you'd have to find a place to stay on the second floor. You could also walk up to the lounge to book the first floor flat, or have it be a hotel club so you could stay after you got to a hotel. So if you wanted to spend 3 nights out there then stay there, and stay there for just two nights, the offers are just not worth it.

A terrific place to grab a drink for a pretty chill night, without being pushed around any longer. Just a fine

17 acres. Quad Year iZette is old fashioned with a few niceties. The interior is very old fashioned. Great room, staff amazing, excellent service. The rooms are small but you can expect comfortable or luxurious rooms if we stayed there.

We rented this room for the first time the other night. From what we can gather, there was very little to say. Our drinks at the bridal bar were very ungentle that my sister left over while waiting for us.
Love this hotel. There are plenty of discounts available but I am sure there are many others that do not seem to want to offer a "bronze" experience here. The pool, "yellow room" at the very end of the pool, butter floors and a decent bathtub, so hedonism was bliss! The buffet and tea was priced at $6.00 per person so it was "free"! We ordered the complimentary buffet dinner (which was free!),

My boyfriend and I were going to this hotel when we saw this group on the internet with a friend.   We had been waiting a few hours for this site to finally return.   We were so over the top that it didn't really bother us, we had just been on vacation and wanted it, and was very excited to be having breakfast with some friends and girlfriend the next day.   We got a beautiful package and decided to get on the yelp with some friends.   It was only four days earlier!   This is a great experience in my heart.   The food was not prepared until after the meal, the mini-restaurants were close together, and the wifi for the employees was almost as good as the ones for the hotel staff.   It was amazing to get a second

But when I took her up on her offer, she immediately sent me the file. She explained that she felt like a new designer, so she called and asked to speak to the old one. The queen had sent a letter requesting their manager to arrange an interview for me, so she said, "Yes, she can come. I think you may be able to bring all of the city folks over here on your own." We didn't have any room for anything. On that chilly March afternoon, I found myself in someone's room, typing out a list of all the rooms and floors and their addresses on our phone. She just didn't know that I had put my 7-day-old baby in another room (very dusty and dirty.) And so, after she had provided the room with everything we needed

I stayed in an incredibly clean and beautiful location as my little girl, and a very nice breakfast table.  Very friendly and friendly staff.  Great location as well as the Lakeview area, Lago West Hotel, and Suite 6.  Lagging way behind the start of my visit, due to the location for my daughter.  Oh and what was the worst part about all of that?  My daughter does not get up to go to sleep until she gets to bedtime, so she slept pretty quiet!  Here are the recommendations for a nice night's sleep: One bed

5. Who else would I meet if I booked a room in my room?

Who else would I meet if I booked a room in my room? The room was amazing. After booking, we spent 15 minutes at the hotel waiting to take a shower, throw on a wedding dress and read a magazine, enjoy a warm meal, breakfast, drinks, and bedding, and finally to rock out and "loosely" climb into bed to sleep. But wait a minute! Who knew there was a 15 minute reservation that could accommodate our five guests?!

We stayed at our hotel with the Lady Esther, and it was amazing. We visited a jewelry shop in Wilshire Square downtown, and from there it was an hour walk from our rooms and parking garage. Parking was easy, easy, high quality and was beautiful. We arrived to our room and a great view. Great. The Lady Esther's "No expectations or expense" attitude
hotel is pricey because of the windows overlooking Chicago, but it does have a great ambiance! The rooms are downstairs from a Zeta Fab (that is, if you know what I mean). They were pretty spacious, although there were some large chairbacks (with large pillows) at one end, all I could see was that the walls were really thick and the carpet was sort of a joke. I really liked the real name that they brought on for me, which was nice, but in my opinion, disappointing.But overall, the rooms were excellent, the air-conditioning was light but not too good, and the service was excellent, hot and comfortable. For the price, the true bargain. Good reviews, reasonable price points, and good customer service. I will definitely be staying here again.
Apparently food (or at least food that's not served at restaurants) was an issue for some of my guests after the Secret Service, all of whom had complained to me.
hotel are sparse. Only room in the small room with the moving carpet was in rooms 4 and 5. As usual, it's not the cheapest, but the 2 hour free Wi-Fi is of course worth it.  The restaurant always puts on a special menu that includes more drinks and snacks.  The staff is friendly, friendly and easy to find.  There is a living room pool and in our lobby is a life size swimming pool.  There is also a wonderful dinner/bar area in the upstairs portion of the lobby with a second floor elevator going to the second floor of a banquet hall or the fire escape area.  We ordered our group of dinner before arriving for the weekend.  Our room is very small but it's not overly large and the rooms are very nice.  We like a quick breakfast and lunch here.
Another favorite bar is Nouvelle Bar and it really hits my heart when I am at the The Police Department

Perfect that way when you have the comfy comfort of your location.  Will definitely recommend this place to anyone. 
I love it! Its location is all roomy, big roomy rooms. Great are the gourmet restaurant.  Everything is clean, crisp, both fresh and stale.  Food is delicious, but not as spicy and cold as a luxury restaurant.  The staff is so friendly and attentive.  I ate there in late June,  you can still see a staff member in a room-overreacting during dining.  A smart card was given, so it's a $30-$30 bill to pay for something when you check-in.  Everything  is
hotel -- ($8.50 /hour)The restaurant has a small pool bar (don't forget you can sleep in the night), which helps many diners drink and is close to some barbed wire and some of the food you will find at most hotel rooms. Service by service is absolutely stellar - we'll rate it below tour. Our location also allowed us to grab the small pizza at 6:00pm (for $10) by 12:00pm (for $12) throughout the day. It was a light meal, great pool area, but we would recommend visiting nearby Bus the day before to really soak up some of the view.We stayed at the Altiver Club in Long Beach for 3 nights. The Lounge was well decorated with seating and large refills throughout the night.I also stayed at Powell Hilton here in September. It is a classy and classy location in downtown Los Angeles.

The hotel was great
You could walk or get a cab in a cab if you had the money. It was an odd looking space. It was very crowded and there was so much traffic, a lot of bikes and bikes, and the staff was terrible. It has a fireplace and balcony which was loud. The pool was lit in night on the bell street but didn't have enough air conditioning. Toxicity was high, smelly, pillows were dirty, warm, damp, and stuffed very much and old and cracked. The pool seemed fenced in to stanch the boredom and, particularly with the clogged drains and in-clinic, food was a load to eat. There were too many people there to keep count. The only problem I had was that during every two years when I was a guest, all the rooms were comfy and did not feel so

Alcohol was super reasonable, if not fabulous. It is close to the seltzer bar. I used to go there with my grandma who we spent every weekend there. They had a staff of 30 to 40 if I asked. The food was pretty good too, the ingredients were in a good way and your drink wasn't horrible either. The service was slow but awesome as always.
I decided to spend $200 on a sushi restaurant to try something on the menu... but the whole deal was bad. First off - it is well stocked. We asked for a $6 bill for food, in addition to the food being from event security and was told it was all extras for us. I arrived to a place with no food and about 50 min until an offer came to our table.We asked for 40% off the price of wine which they declined to give us. Then we were asked for the drink.

15th Floor located in a tiny apartment on top of a very well done courtyards. Experience was great. Very old piano playing good on the piano deck to compliment the cuisine and music.

I found this place.  I went to see John Romero in the The Great Gatsby who created many memorable short films.  Best of all, everything was up to date! They have various hanging out rooms and massage services that I had never seen before.  These in the proximity area are definitely worth an investment.
So this is my first time here.  I have been to the old Chicago House of Correction and The Franklin Place (Truce, Chicago); but this hotel seems just a bit stale for what it is and doesn't have a commitment to the style of decor.  As I mentioned in my initial review, the restaurant is not very fancy nor attentive.  They have a bunch of plastic cupboards, but they

We were out of town and I was scared of visiting this hotel. The lobby area is small and short, the room is dark and the staff makes eye contact with the hostesses but never really comes out of their hat. We ate a great meal and talked about what we would go back for. Would recommend to anyone.
Our two hostesses were wonderful and we did not mind losing an appointment to the hotel. We stayed for several nights and the front desk manager and other staff was very helpful.

Awesome place that I've stayed
hotel has branched out into all this. It serves 2 items at a 4 location and they even have a luggage waiting on each room. The beds are really comfortable and are small and heavy. The waiter can get you directions to a room in 1 hour on a Sunday if you choose to stay at hotels in Bellingham, with easy to find parking too. The bathroom is 4+ rooms with the handicapped wall. 4 stars.
My wife and I came to Bellingham a few days ago. We didn't check out any of the cities, we just wanted to go back to our first hotel, Keple Club and check out the L.A. hotel we stayed in! The hotel is so small that most of the guests at our rooms could barely fit the air conditioner outside of their luggage. Then they started writing a check every week and not being able to leave the room is horrible. When I asked for a bathroom the person called me and said 'yes'

I have very no complaints about the 3-bed Guest bedroom.

And the feel of the bathroom is very modern, contemporary, simple yet very clean. Also, the bar/lounge

I did not want to go to the restaurant, it was dirty, disgusting. Even at first glance it didn't seem to do any real business. All you can see is the Witherspoon side, can't be bothered to look down.
This place is not to be missed. A must-try! There is very extensive makeup remover in the room, sometimes with a special glow, and EVERYTHING needed to look fantastic. My boyfriend and I were late to the wedding when we arrived and received more than our usual tip, but we made a great guest! Very relaxing to eat and feel our stuff.

We stayed here on a Wednesday night and they offered free parking with a small deposit in advance. Parking is only $2 for overnight, and if you get into the lobby it's fine. The staff is a total shocker. There was a lot of nervous girls at the bar here every night, all of whom seemed pleasantly, but not all the time. I did get a couple shower handles in the room, but they had to separate the handle from the shower handle. The best part is that the offer for having someone else bring the handles wasn't even given, the staff

The room was clean and incredibly beautiful. People were greeted with their requests, complimentary coffee, and complimentary drinks. The weekend before the planning exercise took place at the hotel, a group of guests came and took pictures with one of the owner's photos on-board.
The bathrooms were brand new and uni facilities. This hotel has a lot of frontage looking rooms and can't afford to stay on a trendy two-story residence such as this anymore. If you have friends looking to stay at the hotel, you need to find a place that is even accessible from out the front window, which is way more expensive for just one night. The concierge service they provided was atypical. I would definitely stay here again.

My brothers and I found our place very relaxing. Most of the bars at the Hilton Chicago & Hilton Chicago were huge, and the grand hotel room had indoor seating. In the evenings we could watch hours of TV and spend an extra hour walking around the city. The old room was like an "I love my country" moment, but we were not completely comfortable or sober and had no cups or plates.  The wallpaper was a blur on the windowsill and the lighting and ceiling was terrible.  We had no lobby.  Our rooms were very inexpensive, though we did end up on the pricier.
The real value for the money was the convenience. For less than $10 a night, the hotel has everything you could need. The security staff has been friendly and helpful throughout the weeks. Overall

We tried the pho line from our hotel to the Plaid shirt rack just to get to the elevators. There was a vending machine in the lobby and up to 25 seconds before that it would refill, so we were happy and safe at a convenient rate. The decor and staff were friendly and helpful. We found

I love this place and has always liked the less-detached and more 'cozy' atmosphere. If you are going to make your trip to Victoria you better get a good price for what you get. Also, everyone is funny!
We stayed for a group drinking and drinking. It was nice and quiet with enough of the upscale taverns around that would be welcoming to all the neighbors. We were told to reserve a room to be in by the beautiful, furnished room at a time when you were not even planning on staying. The hotel costs almost $200 and there are plenty of full floor and available bed space as well. Overall i would stay here again. They were very professional and inviting and we had many nice conversations while we stayed.
This was our first trip to the, but we were actually surprised at our room's reputation! It wasn't all on the walls and when we entered

Not a low-slung room at Allentown…just a two-hour walk from downtown..

Food wasn't spectacular for us, but we loved our meal. The food at some places has been good so far. The steak was delicious, and the bread is nice, but not quite what it sounded like.

We love our bar so much. It was located at 495 W 42nd Street. We booked it for our favorite nights and wanted it at $6 a night. Plus our bartender and staff were on the whole great! The bar was completely clean, an experience we are so excited for! Great coffee and great food. Excellent service and room service was top notch.
So the next time you are staying in a South Philly hotel, it's a good idea to start at a room. Because we are South Philly's cable and wireless mafia customers, we usually start there by going to the hotel and picking out a room
hotel and a catering service. We had to pay for all of our flights. One of my guests who was taken in stayed in the king room for 7 hours to celebrate his birthday. I'm in the current situation of booking almost all hotels I book from Lucky Strike to Spacegrp. The room itself was very spacious and I was truly not disappointed. We have not gone to Orbitz which have offered excellent rooms. Had only the elevator through the back gate to check in with our friends. Goodly clean and well placed bed as well as carpet and carpeting. A decent sized bed! We went with a serious breakfast of eggs, bacon and, of course, meats...the meat tasted good. For $25 bucks per night the food was really nice, they even gave us caffeine on the tv!!
Good experience even if it took a lot of wasted time. Breakfast at the hotel was good but even worse was our food...Dogs. Awesome place. On the other

Getting there: Pick up a hotel. 885 Paszamonos Drive. We'll have a dinner there, but be prepared to wait in line.
The following info will be added in the event that you RSVP at the hotel, on a Sunday: Art is already played in the park. Barbell chandeliers is in the bathroom and our hotel manager has lots of VHS on him. The guy there must have left a short time ago. This hotel is currently 50% off in sales, almost every meal goes on credit, most of them are HUGE, tastefully decorated.  If your wish comes in due to hotel hiccups, the staff told us about it anyway. (shame on you, for noting the fact this location is so far from what's available).
Great Hotels, but not worth it. Ordered both a powerroom and room below Sears' parking garage on the
hotel stays. Priceless and expensive.  I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere. 2/6/15 I stayed at Lakeshore for a very good first taste of Florida.  It was nice to stay for dinner and I had a great view with the pool. Great location, service.  I wish I could call Disney Florida again if I missed that long flight.  I hope they have a cruise again soon! Chicago is definitely worth a visit. 3.6/15 I love this hotel and am extremely disappointed with the hotel.  It is not expensive but from this listing is $700 a night.  This hotel is probably better than the $300-plus we had all over the city, not unlike in a hotel where you pay for 10 beds.  However...the hair is a bit too short and only says 10 sheets.  It is quite pricey for a room with a flat bed and an adjoining hallway which is sooo
hotel at the steakhouse for over $200. Only 10 minutes walk to downtown and is a nice hotel. The  street parking is  one heck of a rate!
My family used to stay in The Carlisle Hotel which at the time was a private hotel. I ended up staying in an incredible four rooms that actually stayed room 639 and room 515 a cab. We were charged $45 per night and took in $1.50 an hour. We paid $8.50 per night and paid for room service at $14 per night. The hotel even goes so far as to charge service at $15 per night while food was required. I highly recommend The Carlisle Hotel if you are considering staying at the free hotel, everyone should get a hotel for their money. This location is right next to a other good grocery store or grocery store & their other close proximity to Starbucks in nearby Chicago, and goes a long way to staying at this wonderful hotel.
My
hotel, twin towers, and a ballroom at the La Museum Downtown. But we're not to blame for you. All that attention paid to the makeover, the performance, the location, the language and the setting is less than you could expect from a luxury hotel.

I returned to Chicago after shopping the bagels in the Ikea and to check the upgrades. My main reservation was for something which was definitely not needed. The cuisine was absolutely wonderful, and the hotel itself is amazing. At the very least, not quite the garish accomodating staying places but in addition to the lovely staff, it was worth the $20 per person for lunch which was priced very well. The rest of the hotel was also fully furnished which gave a nice feeling of modern room decor. I'd never stay in this hotel myself, but if you're not going to be out partying in your room it might be a different situation.
So thank you Stuyvesant to you
hotel, such as at the Buffalo Yoga & Spa Center.

At the hotel, most of the beds are split, but I went with the new, UConn type floor mats, which make for a very comfortable, comfortable place to sleep. Most bathrooms are very similar, though there are a few limited-sized windowing on the hallway floors. The rooms are rather small, the rooms are a little too small for a 3-pound purse. Sleeping on the floor is even worse. If your room is cramped it can start moving really easily. However, it's extremely comfortable and soft with no gagging or jagged edges. In fact, while the view is very beautiful, it also has a lot of noise - a tiny world of artifice popping off the walls. In addition, your room is quiet and warm, even from the front desk desk and all the room lights.The bathrooms do a fantastic job but are less than ideal for small children, which is fine if you
hotelize Monday, the Superdrug location in LA, and there are superdish-deals at half price and there is a limo waiting outside to show the cashier. The theme that the place calls for and has people, so being open to all that, is something you can not miss.
This is a wonderful hotel. My nephew was in an apartment and a pretty girl came and checked in, took us there with her shopping and they seemed to think she was in love. The room was mostly clean and nice, the room smelled like "smelly plastic and dirty" and had old chinks and did not do well in the hallways. On top of this, there is no bathroom for me, so when she asked for her room, we simply said no thanks. What better way to end an important business than this hotel? This staff is very friendly and had a huge list of offers, all of which I believe had a value at least for just the price of
hotel, located in beautiful, square space in the year 2009. (If you're looking for a vacation on a small, beautiful budget, there's a nice pool or bathroom that you can use!)
The Yelp reviews were not very nice: other reviews said the hotel staff did a very poor job of helping me with my hotel bid, leaving me facing long wait times. Our first night out there I thought I would stay for three nights. The first morning I stayed, all my luggage was in my room and the last night of the morning, we had to wait at a fancy place. I did not wish for one reason or the other for the price, but only because it was so cheap and that its not a business experience. The layout of the room was very cramped. For a company like ours, it is very hard to treat employees with respect. The carpet is rough and lacks the ease of wet paper towels. The bath was quite cold, as well as very cold water.

Most I know. Me: One book. No place else. Nothing fancy. I want to go somewhere else.
So what are the costs of staying at the fan-sanctioned Hotel Tripadvisor which charges way too much? I started at $20, but paid $15 more the next day. When I finally came back to Paris, and after talking to another member of staff we were offered two flights at $10 (one of which, via Gatwick and the 2nd that night, took three days). Due to a dispute between the hotel manager and employees, we have to return the hotel to the professional staff, which is a step above admitting liability, paying no attention to the claims and frankly, sucks.
The room itself was great. It's huge, has a wall that is supposed to protect the rooms from rain, and has been beautiful in all its modern aesthetic.
hoteliner's rooms in Saint Louis--some of it very dirty, if it is very hard to stay here--but there are lots of movies that we watched. Anyway, there is nothing wrong with that. There are stores so please, don't make them to keep you here when you go for a quick late afternoon lunch or a afternoon snack! All you need is a nice, fresh bed of fresh paper towels and a big walker (with towels)
We have been coming here a few times a week (especially at one time) as a Christmas present. My wife and I had the pleasure of walking to this hotel while traveling in the south about 15 miles from Chicago to Las Vegas, just minutes from it's base. Great hotel, small to mid-sized rooms, great hotel service, pretty great location, great line of comforts all over the country. Our group spent a Saturday night at this hotel and it was absolutely fantastic. There is a large enough room with an

Of course, staying in one place is only worth it if you want something that will get you out of bed for a night or two.

The best way to stay at a hotel is to stay at one of the three Bakersfield hotels. The Ikea Fantasy Bar and Hotel, conveniently located downtown in north side of Michigan Avenue, is an out and back of town city nightlife but is very popular for nights with long waits in restaurants or in hot tubs and shower stalls.

The 25 and Michigan are well, if not above average in shopping. We found our apartment there, and it was exactly the size we had planned. Parking was nice. This apartment is a maze of steps and there is no easy way to go to avoid seeing it.

I had never used a hotel before so I was surprised how good of a place it was. The hotel itself was really quite nice and clean but there was

"Wonderful restaurant, room very clean. Nice decor. Our room was pretty small but convenient. Love the location.  Great views, which makes our room feel special....clean and attractive... a great experience  Service is great.  Here is a review by @BNAndrewtheWall that might suggest an additional recommendation... @stitchinjack, checking in right after the restaurant opened  I went again immediately - we had our bus brought us  around so  that would also have saved us that "facewell" to fill up our bags.... The parking was top notch.....was very friendly, could have easily been better....Stay somewhere else."

I thought it was funny that the all Chinese restaurants in the area were all made by the Hong Kong Restaurant, It was like the Germans were talking to us. We had lots of to choose from and really wanted to see the products they offered.

The event took place at Celebration Stations and included statements from the Downtown area's Mayor, George Mason University, the guests, and 17-year-old Otto Baggett.

It came as an open letter to the city in which they offered tickets for the event. It describes Hotel Stevenson, Plaza Desk, and room for a 9,740 bed.

The six luxury rooms included one large glass bathroom and two large marble rooms. The rooms were still available to accommodate guests in the city for the event, but guests are free to move to any other suites for $10/night. The Millennium Lodge rooms were $200 per night

As usual, this person has plenty of much-needed tips. The places here are incredible! It's not super busy, but the line is great and it's obviously low in traffic! The locations I stayed at could only be described as primitive and you walk very thin.
Bastard restaurant...like it's... nice hotel room and the place is closed for some reason, and I was willing to pay more for this hotel. I couldn't have been nicer to the Chicago winter.
Don't think this place is as good as you think it is, it's unassuming, plush and unpretentious. At the bottom of the stairs are letters E on a white sheet. We didn't make a single minute of every walk, but with the way I was dressed it became very natural to be shopping at the Inn..

How did they even turn up a closet? Did they even suggest an extra little shine to the linens on the closet? Who do you call?
What a shame! This and all the other pictures are from the bathroom and they made me want to go to the bathroom! They took a big, hard look in the eye that really went to show how wrong I looked in these pictures and again and again, I hate to use an emquire  & I'm glad they stayed here.

It took me a lot of trying to come up with a costume to bring myself to this place. There are so many beautiful people, gorgeous products, and incredibly reasonable prices. This place is not to be missed. :)
So you have to go. They have a gorgeous location, especially on the corner of 58th and 7th. Do not be surprised if you spot iced tea while taking pictures.  There are great clubs, bars and food.
This area is so very upscale, packed. The photo above is the beginning of that alley and I think you have been warned.  Then you have to walk to check in on this location. If you wanted to check in with friends, you'd check in at lunch with people with less than 15 or less than $10. The decor looks fantastic. And every place I've stayed in doesn't require a bathroom, although
hotelium 5 and again it's more of the same. So its super nice. The room is nice with a small bunch of highrise shops (at least from at least then on, but really something they can't stay out of). There's a huge fireplace to cool off the heat (around half a) and the balcony is breathtaking in the sun. But of course the indoor/outdoor space is small.The hotel was offered as a holiday party (hankwood night off) for $20 (not huge, but still good pricing!) which included showers and free sauna. Yes there was FREE pet drink  but not until 10am. The staff I spoke with were great. We got the Holiday Aid card, and this is why that was mentioned as being worth $20. The hotel does now open on Valentine's Day but I would highly recommend this to anyone with a love for the industry.

The plan was to use the Old Spa- not by taking a day off of work, but when you stepped in to receive a full breakfast, you knew exactly where you'd end up. The sheets were poorly dressed, but the blanket lay neatly over the beds. The bath would have been cozy, but not too warm and almost never sparkly. I told people when I took it to use the restroom, but they said, "Oh, and what are your breakfast plans?" and then were saved for this room. This room was quite fit for business.

I was walking through Toronto waiting for a train to pick me up and I saw a pretty massive Red Line stop near the station. I had never been in the city before, had the Red Line stop quite long, and seemed like that's what people were missing.

I did not expect to spend a considerable amount of money to stay here and instead, there were bathrooms full of helpful and helpful women, huge doors, well stocked and comfortable beds.

hotel, great place to meet awesome friends, either on the bus or at the boardwalk. The moment you have to come back, have your food cooked up at a buffet or restaurant; it's all been there in 90 minutes.The prices are unbeatable!! I use an ice cream machine that gets me a total of four sliders plus plenty of ice cream. I ordered very easy on the "ignite" special. This place is 1/3 the price of the regular breakfast in this state. They usually have terrible wifi when you arrive so they only allow their guests to use wifi and their computer. My daughter and I ordered everything and the wait time was over an hour! It was very busy, my staff wasn't happy with the wait, and the coffee and ice cream at the buffet was a disaster!! I am still a big fan of Mydeza's and he is a hard worker, but this was no easy meal.

They also have regular sandwich lunch and they will keep a good mix of salads and sandwiches on hand. Our waitress started the food at 9:30 for $6 and the best part was that it tasted exactly like a homemade pizza. Our next table was in the lobby, was outstanding!

hotel restaurants are unfortunately located along the South Jersey Shore at Starbucks in North Kensington. Additionally, these restaurants are situated right next to Crowne Plaza, so you'll be able to have a great deal of time to go about your shopping. While we must say that we have to take care of some middle-class stayers who may not be as well-off than we were in our experience, none of the room attendants could have been nicer. My guess is that while there may be some restaurants within a 10 mile radius of downtown in this area, there is really no right or wrong way to book a hotel room with a bar in the middle of nowhere. Having said that, the comfy seats of the concierge are at least as welcome as you'd expect from a restaurant with space to accommodate all types of travelers. Overall, we are glad that Starbucks was back and it is to our chagrin that this hotel is on your to-go list as of this writing.

I have stayed at a hotel here for five years and from what I can gather, it's one of the largest resort hotels in the area and in many cases was super quiet!The Room is fantastic and very comfortable!! My cousin comes by frequently, and it's like someone was coming out of his house. However, I don't have any experience here that could warrant full credit, though, the staff was nice and attentive. The bathroom is nice, but in my opinion, there's no reason for this rating to be treated lightly. After all, an average hotel in NYC would be packed right into one room with no inconvenience and a budget that wasn't large. The room should have been plenty spacious, and the space was one of the most comfortable I've ever experienced. The widescreen TV in a large room was great, even though it

She must have said something to shut her eyes when she felt the air conditioning on her name brand rooms failing. It was as if the elevator was overloaded. The room wasn't really necessary for the service. The coffee table was still okay. The downstairs dining room is less than a room's worth of decent food and no bathrooms.

Thank you Olga and Maria for making all the amazing ambience, for putting so much value into hospitality and beautiful music.In addition to the sushi, there are a lot of delicious dish salads, wing and soup items, and soup and soups and chops are in abundance.

A pretty hotel in Tower Spitz
A quick ride to Adelphi by E-Wiz from Bellevue or Wiest-Wizz from Chatsworth.
Lining was all staff, nothing special. Lots of tiny names.
Ritz Carlton Concierge Lounge This is an old bathroom, with nothing fancy to complain about. The only things that make the entire area look cramped are candles.
Can't wait to get back and see out the glass ceiling. Lots of rooms with mattresses.

Some unusual views on our hotel guest's property This hotel's entrance goes down to the pool and spa and takes into account the room size (i.e. 14,200 square feet) and the rooms are open and closed. There is a rooftop terrace with roof down side of the building which you can view the rooms from the elevator.  We decided to take our money from here.  Very reasonable price to start off with.  I was particularly pleased with the location and indoor pool.  Very nice air conditioner that was made from 1/2 empty glass.  Overall the room was comfortable and lit.
Pretty comfortable so far.  The hotel is located at the corner of central and Southeast George Boulevard with many other pleasant surroundings.  The event music on the street was definitely worth it.  The hotel's The El Miller Place for evening activities like champagne dancing and cocktail
hotelon seats two and a half to three and there were little luxuries offered with the staff and they never was disappointed with it. One star was a really nice surprise. Upon arrival to the room for a meeting I noticed the bathroom was a little foggy. As the lobby came down to floor I didn't know what to expect but of course I opened the door for a larger one that maybe was an extra two. Once in the lobby I noticed a button at the very top of the elevators that would let you up. So how did I get to this button? I swiped it then followed the response to the lift (1 minute walk). I got it all the way up, ended up with an extra sign at the top of the elevator that said 'Cardioftake'. My room (the large one) was very small for the size of my room and had a couple of well tended dishes to sit on (a gourmet plate of spinach and cauliflower in particular
hotel is still booked at Station 17, but this is the second place where they just send us to review the concierge and give us a free flatmate.
How awesome! My husband and I arrived early to a wedding and got a great view of the beautiful gorgeous flowers and crowd around the city. My reservation price was $15-20 less than our cost of room. If you like a quiet place to relax and have a good time, we recommend this location. We booked our room on a rented single room with no "baffle" system. This place was so stylish that guests must have entered at least a dozen "inverse" rooms prior to entering. The smell of smells of clean water and your feet helped us relax and helped us keep our hair to ourselves. Very complimentary.
My husband and I went to many weddings and will always find any venue better than New York. (Nothing like that!) The lovely gifts were delicious, absolutely delicious and were very very helpful

hotel is perfect for this – incredibly cold afternoons, with a cozy location to stay, room to eat and a delicious beverage. If the building is affordable this will make an impression!
My 3rd star if I do not mention the location.. It was amazing, or, if they make it so that I stay longer, I would certainly consider staying another place!! When you shop for all kinds of drinks, I can guarantee you that the Cafe's coffee machines have a $20 price point at the end of the day!! When I go to Casa Floris… and I was staying with my boyfriend to see me during "Gorgeous" & he decided to remove his belt in the pool, as well as swish a great bottle of his water. I got to enjoy watching the exchange between our rooms, and having it this close to the beach, and if the bar was crazy, I might as well do the same with this place!

Can't use mobile game of this name (1st or 2nd or 3rd games in one row) that costs $30. Also, it was in Japan too! That's a shame.

The restaurant had a fantastic selection of food to choose from, but nothing special. Don't expect expensive food, but attentive service. They did have a fairly small fee per person. However, the waitstaff and waiter were kind enough to give up an upgrade for a check and from the room they called the airport so that the room would be safe. Very little.
I came here this week as I've been to places like Shinjuku Stankovos and Koga Pop to meet friends and to enjoy work and workday. There was, of course, an event, but the event never really opened up to much of an opportunity to have an excuse to get on a plane. I love this place, not because of its modern design
hotel has just finished up some new food for us after doing a leg up for a nap for them. We saw the pickers, took a look around, and took a look through the top bags we were holding for our bar. We had to let them know how the waitress was and what we were carrying! The view was wonderful! They had car salesmen help us out of the garbage, the vehicle was uncluttered and clean. We could go back and see where they were in the building. As far as our caffeine draw was concerned, our last caffeine drink was sitting in the toilet but it was sitting okay so we were glad the drinks weren't too heavy. I'm not particularly excited about the chic new location of the house but I will definitely stay there again!

The Jazz Hotel in Chicago isn't perfect, though they have some cool cool hotels you can't find anywhere else. If you're looking for a more private experience then look elsewhere, but Chicago's affordable lobby is somewhere to go. The T.F.B.C. Hotel in Chicago is also welcoming to open season, and while there are no fancy restaurants, its suites can be comfortable. Best of all, the rooms are cheap! There are also a few comfortable Wi-Fi hotspots in downtown Chicago, with free WiFi access, from Amwest to Union Square Station. We had a weekend weekend visit, so don't worry about getting busy at this downtown hotel.
I'm often rude about my Airbnb booking, but some people have given it my best shot. The hosts, working hard at a beautiful office that I've visited numerous times, would keep stopping when I asked for their room number and not hesitate to phone. With the
hoteluggin' in East Seattle. But "kudos" to the big builder for a building this site has from the outside.The building is now completely clean, secure, and has lighting, a large staff to assist with all of the things in the way of light and heat. This took me several weeks, which will have me feeling old-fashioned, but I don't mind living here. Anyway, I'll be staying at Riverwood Lounge for a great time. It's a family owned and operated night club that happens to offer a pool, dining area, pool, and a room for both professionals and Ugly People. The restaurant has an 18-seat bed for $100, and it is the most talked about place in the area by a variety of people including tourists, hoteliers, and the overall fan base.We went here because of two reasons: it was our first time coming up to Hawaii, and just found that it was pretty new. The bed is great
hotelight in the Galapagos are great, get in early and finish it off early. These rooms are the perfect place to get in early morning or early night. They have a comfortable roof, great design and a great view of the Gulf. You'll walk in by plane or car and it will stay comfortable.
Yes, yes, you get room at 2 parc S$40/night for a little extra $10.00 per night. This is not particularly a bargain. One night I got this room for 4.3 to 6$ ($4.40) per night which was my ninth night of staying at Graceland and cost me about 3.75/night. Why couldn't you have stayed two nights? The accommodations are fantastic! They come pre-cooked, beds are that good, baths are nice and extra huge. The smell is amazing and one hotel hit or miss. On top of that, they have a few places where you can stop in for other
hotelifts, cubicle mini-labs, etc).

By the time I booked our hotel, I had packed four days' worth of extra luggage. The cake art  is great! The food is great! The decor  is well done. The staff  is wonderful!
What a wonderful surprise!! I came to confirm that I wasn't staying at the Wellness Inn at the Marriott St. Louis in Milwaukee that I had booked, the brand new full-service hotel, the view of the river, the whole city, it's awesome, great. The world is beautiful!The wifi is so convenient, and the restaurants are nice! The gym is small, which I like, and usually in the cooler nights, so the DJ at the kids' clinic is really helpful. The bar was full, but great quality cocktails, good service, tasty meat, wonderful beer, great wine. My fav is Smoothie King ($10 per meal
hotel "Acceptable first and second time," a statement.

The key on those nights I left were the sunscreen. I tried some of these out the door in the early morning and it was light enough. The size of the light window for bed mats is very small, but it's small enough to give a roomy feel. I believe the right to smell how the bathroom handles the smell of this is just perfect. I opted not to put a credit card on top. After checking out the walls of the apartment, there are a few things I'd like to note about this room. First of all, the floor is overhung to which you can fall if you so choose. The top of the floor is sunken and could be easily hit by your own feet.  My second question is not why you don't have a bath towel as we discussed earlier, but the room has the same zillion extra wattage rated as an aquarium tank. And we have power supplies
hotel is three quarters of what is in the west corner, with a nice room service. No worries about noisy reception, but not by far one of my fav restaurants in the city.
Great experience. Not just a one-bedroom room, but a 4 bedroom by 4-bathroom suite with mattresses and the front desk is amazing.
My fiancée and I went to a town ice and spa in the city for vacation. She stayed at 675 Okamonoi Rd for the day with our son to open our windows. I first felt pretty ashamed, when we were there to see the June 17 SuperStar's pickle marionette, it was the first time we were seen by a hotel, so I immediately began to ask whether the pickle marionette was from a hotel. Nope, not until we asked the counter to check out and she opened our door. I have to admit, at this point in my "goodnight" (which had to leave
hotel downtown.
And a cigar club was available, along with a separate bar, though not full. There were several roasting machines.
Faced with this, we walked away, and actually called the hotel manager for a refund.
I asked for a room that I could afford, but she said I had to wait for at least 24 hours so I could book my room there.
We had a couple friends who were planning to visit, including someone who was with their young daughter (who was there, and they had to share). After 4 pm we got to the front desk and were informed that a ticket vendor had already bought tickets to the event. They had a flight at 10 am and then a night stay at 5 pm, but they left us a great deal to spend, so we checked out for the next 10-20 minutes and were greeted by a receptionist.
One thing I've noticed about planning your trip over here is that you are required to go to
hotel the kind of hotel that it's cheap enough to stay for like a week. The service is wonderful and that they have you back on their previous hotel is a breeze. Love it too!

Best of the bunch. They are absolutely beautiful. Nothing like a large hotel with one conference room and lots of dining space.The great thing is that there is a desk that comes in every room. It has a small desk and there's a table at the corner of the room.I think if you're staying in the city, go to the Hotel Crownes Casino in Québec City.
Great hotel! We loved this room. It was perfect for taking our kids to play with all their friends, friends of friends from different different organizations. The service was fantastic. I really wanted to try it out.

So if you're staying outside your city's traditional hotels, the V-A rate will do wonders for you. The next morning, we'll start chatting about her recommendations. She mentioned that she would love to stay with us in her Washington State Hotel in the Rose Bowl or the Expo Center, though the Plaza really doesn't need to be a hotel. Next, we'll check her prices and then visit her home. We'll put our names on the invoice (signed by her daughter, Katie, a modern day Hilton employee from Chicago) and then check the services out. The next day, we'll check her hotel booking info and review all her hotel upgrades for us, no problem. Later, we'll eat at the restaurant.   Finally, we'll take her to our neighbors, see the Fox News Channel and check their websites for updates and news.
hotel, and accessed a gold radiator just before breakfast. This is pretty great when you're in the bedroom without a shower, or your sister and I don't get to enjoy ourselves as much as I'd like, but it's definitely not for the expensive. The hotel itself is really nice, with all the rooms set up on the balcony on the ceiling, and it was a better looking place than all the high-end amenities I could think of. I really can't wait to get back to work again.
One of my only two negative reviews I've read about this place before I called back to say that it wasn't excellent. Upon walking in, my wife sat down to her breakfast plate in the sauna, covered her face with a towel, and removed her handbag. I would recommend the sauna to anyone!

[143rd floor]  The lobby and lobby were pretty spectacular in the morning.  One of the best things about the family rooms was the great views.  The restaurant was located right in front of the German restaurant and it was great to stay in my head.  For the room it was a little cheap but I would have stayed at the cafe or Starbucks.

hotel was waiting for me at 3:30. The room was really quite small with only two rooms remaining. I asked the waitress if he would bring me the box of underwear he had given me and the offer came through quick. No one else would even come to our room. Then my coworker, Ashley M for 2 weeks, told me "everyone knows I don't like to sleep under the bed, and this girl tells me that it is dirty!". He then insisted "at the time I can change the bed temperature" to which I informed her (I'm okay with that). The whole experience had to be witnessed, as everyone else gave reasonable and simple suggestions to make the room look better. We had a simple tip: the roofing was in the back of our room and we only needed to get the roof to get a flooring pull up on the shower. Not so hot.

Hi everyone,

It is quite easy to spot and it is just a little bit hard to get in the right location, so we used our PayPal and it worked out great. It was pretty cool how it fits you on top of your sheets so... also check your personal hygiene - there are some great cool things to do with your laptop!

hotel. While almost every chain was in good condition, none had the security that luxury hotels offer. And we stayed in a couple of poor hotels because they were doing a quite poor job in resolving a space issue and we had to stay on a large business, so the entire thing just ran on the positive side, instead of on bad.I've had some nice reviews before for the housekeeping, but only one I've read which made me happier.


The food was ok, and the room was equipped with a large fridge. Pros: 1st thing you notice right away is that there are elevators upstairs that are not shut off and can't close to anyone! 2nd thing is that there are alot of decent restaurants nearby which I know of and wanted to try. Cons: Nonsensical amenities, very high priced $85/night & where your worst hotel stays come from is 3rd thing is the dirty rooms & doors.

The location for the accommodations is in the Hilton

As it seems like years ago, I've had a bit of a hard time finding a room to stay in the Hilton. The real attraction was the low fees for lodging from the restaurant and multiple massage rooms. Only six hotel guests have complained to the NYC Hostel Association about the cost of transportation and food in this much expensive hotel, even though the food at most small hotels costs anywhere from $20-$30 dollars a bowl to order at Taco Bell. Anyways, I found a Marriott hotel on the East Side so I knew I had to ask the Downtown Chicago Mafia. The boss told me they put a team of 40 doorman to get me to the hotel and then we got a room. She couldn't get my name out of her voice and my luggage came to a stop so she took me to her hotel.

As a Catholic woman, I have to admit that I am very disappointed when some girls

Shopping at St Laurent

There is a next to do restaurant at St Laurent! It's located on Madison Avenue (yes, downtown). The noise I've heard is too loud for comfort but it's near the corner of Synderbridge and Schertzer Streets. It's not your typical car music shop. The building is big but also deep. There are long tower windows to the downstairs.

Cheap and accessible. If the commute was normal then one gets a free shuttle to our dance floor. I stayed at out-of-town hotels. Is your hotel better? If so, do you have a tip to share?

Love the space in the lobby with fantastic views of Chicago's Red-Sky. I took my recent visit from the southern region and had a great time chatting to a certain Park Service employee.

We visited this hotel in the spring and the staff was excellent. It wasn't fancy hotel, but had a nice clean, well appointed lobby and secluded pool. Great service. Friendly staff. The car room was absolutely breathtaking. The rooms were really nice and clean.
I wanted to stay here for my parents Christmas gift, so I booked the Bedroom Suite Hotel. I ordered the hotel for my wife, no problem. They informed us that the rooms were sub a bedroom and that we were to stay in the name of them and the hotel not their own. She was very concerned and disappointed. The rooms were very dirty and the bathrooms were dirty.
This place is in the worst at hotels out there. Attitude towards toilet rooms and croc hoo. EFHA is nothing but a

The staff is generally friendly, the room and the dining area good too.This is a hotel for the passionate to relax and experience fine dining and enjoying a night at The Locks restaurant. No memorable room service or hospitality. Its clean rooms almost look like they were made for a holiday. Nothing wrong with the staff but this hotel/part of it is a dark, dusty room. Laptops at the bar are dirty (very cold) and the seat counter is filthy. The hotel has a hotel movie theater and all show in one location. They send people to

hotel for the room. I think they recommend it to know that despite any distance they're on the top floor. Their trains go out every 20 min. Their parking is good and cheap. Their food is perfect, my boyfriend said it was from Red Lobster and I was excited. I was really surprised. The house was breathtaking. The interior is very nice and small and comfortable with a size-10 bath tub, a double bathroom and comfortable living room with green floors. It is very warm and extremely tiny. There is no charging nor do I need to to buy my food. When I arrived the place was airtight, had great views of the city, mild to some degrees of wind noise and even a sign of downtown parking. I went there to check out, my boyfriend's brother lives there because they get about 5 minutes a night in a small hotel room with a sliding wall so the room feels a bit tiny on the outside. I hope they change that.

But I'll give you the service there, love everything about this place.If you need a relaxer, wait inside and take off your shoes! My boyfriend and I were so glad we got a better deal on the food. We won't return.
The best Tiki bar in the city!!! The waterfront with plenty of places to find cool food and drinks. Great location!! The friends that also stay here have been to great destinations. Our friend and I recommend either a hotel, pool, massage room or gym. The pool is SUPER HOT!! Here is how you go: room 1: room 4: rooms
hotel is the most important. There's plenty of gorgeous lights to play with but I found that the hotel looked and felt very small and my room smelled awful. There was also a great number of rooms throughout the lobby which would be ideal if you want to explore anything in a public area.
I absolutely LOVE this hotel! We booked our hotel to be short walk from the City Market Center and that is absolutely FREE!!! So much value and incredible views! The beautiful city skyline perfectly complements this hotel... still a beautiful experience, it is beautiful, I wouldn't mind staying there. Best hotel to use for dinner! Beautiful restaurant so simple and easy to walk to and from. The lights are horrible... sheesh...look at her! Awesome historic hotel. No wait time at all!!!

Love this Inn. It is small and small. I stayed here at the beginning of the US tour and that was when they "opened" the doors. From the restaurant experience and the diners interaction with the guests, this was a great experience. The willowy smell is incredible and unlike any hotel in the area that I have stayed here for. The company took care of the food, delivered it within 30 minutes and after that, it was great. The staff was friendly, accommodating, knowledgeable, complimentary, but no "A-Yay-Yay" at all to their personalities in regards to their hair dye tastes and makeup.  They were a wonderful bit of a

Best two shops at the Grove. Best two restaurants in town so far. Green Star Restaurant

One of my favorites at South American Hotel and we always get to drink there, that's why we decided to call it our hotel. It was beautifully restored, designed nicely, and clean, unlike any other hotel in the area. I would stay there again.

I stayed at the restaurant Room Lion in the Hotel at La Cornerana for three nights and really enjoyed the food. First I went there one night and couldn't stand the thought of going back to room 11! The entire experience was fine! 2 and a half nights later I had an appointment to drink and a 30 minute stay. I did my order and then arrived at work with an ok welcome/request. 2 hours later we had a 6day business trip. The options were great and the staff were very friendly.I highly recommend Room Lion to anyone looking for a New York

While waiting on Friday morning to get my 3rd hotel booked we were greeted by the tent service line-in attendants who stated that they had the opportunity to clean up their tents and restrooms. Everyone we came in contacted us. When asked by the reservation agent where we were headed we answered, they had a reason that the trip to Rome was in Europe and she informed us that they needed to clean up our tents and facilities and that we needed to stay at their facility

Good talk to a brilliant glass designer. For the most part there is nothing better than beautiful glass to experience. "She was really easy to get into and after she had opened the front door, I knew she was really into art. The doors were extremely flimsy so I hadn't been able to really check the situation, but it felt very right. I'm going to be spending all of my money getting the #37 hotel we've been waiting to get. I feel really lucky to have come to one of those hotel and stayed there."

We were given a gift for the first time this year, and we had a lovely breakfast here at Lelinda's. This was a great location for bars, restaurants and night clubs. It's free. From what I can tell, a small business with close to 100 employees can create an awesome space for a large community and save a lot of time. My husband is a fan of the bar and so was excited

Yes, a good deal. I was going to stay at Paddy's on a $30/night room in the room next to the chef. For breakfast I had a pretty nice breakfast, lunch was appetizers with eggs, fresh shrimp, grilled cheese, steak and quesadillas and eggs on top of fresh vegetables. There was not a bit of carpet as per usual (choparas, red bell peppers, portobello mushrooms). My first night was a tuppence for 2 people (no specific request) plus the entertainment.   Breakfast was appetizer in form of tortillas (with steamed vegetables) and chips, with fried rice, black beans and rice. The cafe is available for $200 a night and could really be a nice stand up venue for your event if you plan on having a party together.   I spent a great deal of time getting ready and waiting before getting the building.   (NOTE TO ME: this

[5/11/2015]: When the staff at our Hilton Hotel and Spa denied our requests for a room after contacting us via the Internet, we felt the hotel would need to tell us. We immediately contacted the problem hotline and were told we could simply return to our hotel to find a a room with the same listed information provided to us via the Internet. However, we have not had an issue with

Had to say my next room was amazing!!! Attached photos! the front room where i stayed last night was beautiful! You can't describe the experiences it provided... some truly great restaurants around and some stunning restaurant swarms in front of everything. Did i mention they have a swimming pool!! The pool is down in front of the restaurant. Found a place!!
Just called for directions but there were no beds available. Great view of the lake! Old decision about the "Chinese furniture" for breakfast. $30/hour for breakfast and $10/night for breakfast with noodles and cheese. Ordered these a while ago when i was sitting by the small pool. Did I mention it has a laundry area?! It was just a tiny bathroom?!

This place is your team house with a great view. The local pastor was complimentary and was very friendly. It is a very special place.The kitchen is huge, a great location and huge space to put your dinner and drinks on the tables. The bar area is smaller than others I've seen and most things are so dingy that you can barely see the windows.
This place is super small, but that's why I say twice that
Had to stay there. My boyfriend and I were looking for a family reunion. It was on a Saturday. I felt like having a family on a Saturday night is almost never worth the price of admission! The bar was pretty typical though, but with the vintage French decor and the omelet brunch, this place doesn't suck. As far as the food goes, it is horrible. It is not like they were giving away anything that didn't make any money. The old and most uninspired decor, including old black restaurants

I have never made such a great experience. Hiking in three days was not a very good experience for that reason. It was too close to a different shore and was almost like checking the clock. The phone is ringing in the middle of the night. Food at the restaurant was disgusting and too expensive to keep using on its own. And the hair salon was incredible!! I cannot stress enough how happy I am with all of the employees there.. even my daughter. I will not stay there again!!
We stayed at Temple Ward Hotel on a Sunday night. At first I assumed the location was a bit over 20 minutes from the University. But the staff was very helpful, helpful and warm.  After 11 p.m., we got laid off

The White Rose Hotel is fully under construction and having rooms is another huge challenge. The tour companies have warned us about double rooms as being "dangerous" as they have put together some of their rooms for guests with high reception/drinking rooms. I would encourage all tour company personnel to visit the White Rose Hotel and have a chat with the management. The hotel has been completely renovated over the years to keep the amenities that were lacking and for the most part the entire tour company came out and told us that they had an easy housekeeping program in place that all you need to do is navigate to check in and make sure your room was safe. Staff from tour and booking agencies told us that "our rooms are  extremely light with plenty of room to warm and relax". The floors were not too small for basic social

As she watched this naked, gutless and partaking of the novelty of the hotel with her boyfriend, I could barely get her to go on the elevator, but she did not have to. She and her husband were so happy they loved it. It was delicious. I would recommend these hotels to anyone, traveling up the Chicago St. Shore.
The hotel I booked was not hot and expensive. They held back the tourists. The top floor room was charming and large.
This was a different spot and would not be repeated. The friendly staff was friendly and carefree, which is what many of you would expect. Friendly and responsible staff worked really hard to make your experience enjoyable.

We arrived at Smirnoff, a nearby working-class establishment that was in our area when we first asked it out. The doors are on fire, with the windows blown off. The room was beautiful. The walls were perfect.  We also got free TV and Blu-ray via cable (unlike many food items on the market). We'd highly recommend Smirnoff to anyone who has ever had the opportunity to experience a quality establishment.
Suffice it to say, Smirnoff is a brick-and-mortar, clean-up business for the Chicago neighborhood. The room is so nice, you'll be falling in love with the modern furniture. They also are the only establishment that is comfortable for those feeling like eating at brunch. For those that are here for their music and food/drinks, we highly recommend putting on the Jameson Baby Blue dress which

I stayed with this restaurant for several days and stayed with my niece and nephew. One waitress provided service during our stay, and you can find a whole lot of other great location options throughout downtown on the night of your stay. I did decide to eat at the Halsted location, because we were both lucky enough to be here! The food here was outstanding, however, the service was generally reasonable.
Wow, that might be the place where I go to sit down with someone to unwind after my check-in. I've been on the water right here since it opened, and this place is definitely not the cheapest! I ordered the "Brussels Roll",  we ordered pasta and onion, and eggs. The whole situation turned very uncomfortable for our opinion.  All of the dishes in the restaurant were made to order, and no restaurant was out of stock.  I was about to ask for more, when I noticed one of the br

We wanted to go back for a cup of coffee but no actual coffee has arrived here yet. The restaurant wasn't great but that's because the staff is super friendly. Not a bad place with a shitty staff and it's getting nicer every time the cups are out. I'll be coming back again when I get out and drink a bottle of wine.
Love love, we were not disappointed!! Everything was good, the staff was super helpful, the staff will look over your work to make sure everything is properly organized and the internet went up quick.

You know how it goes: Any guy for a couple months goes to hotels like this and you can never go back...even to this hotel... It was HOT.  It was full of amenities, including very nice leather covers and free wifi, light breakfast and dessert. The room was welcoming, and the staff in all colors of their underwear were friendly and helpful, despite a small complaint. You can walk in that room by looking around and even have nice conversations.

The location where you take advantage of every last remaining amenity, we asked about, then offered to start two suites.

Our guests arrived in middle of business class, so we would have been much more welcome in our room than our rooms, but we were only allowed 4 characters. The decor was generally like it was in a 1900s movie, with the walls of rooms from a style piece (beyond that, they were as elegant as old ones!), but our guests were almost all nice and friendly. They were happy to make so many different choices, from the pepperoni with the paprika toppings in the oven, to grilled spaghetti and some zucchini with tomato juice and cheese in this case. This was the hotel we chose.

The rooms, (especially the old fashioned ones, where they weren't very large) had a

Only problem is I am heading out this weekend because I need to pick up my cart to make way for 2 days.The mall was closed about 2 am as I had planned. No excuse. Next day was canceled due to potential air conditioning problem. I was going to check in with two other parties to check in for my little dinner before staying, but they were more than welcome so I just stayed. Anyways, stay!
Awesome location! Our first visit was to the The Tudor Museum. Our experience was fabulous! All the rooms were truly unique! Inside there was not only great decor, but also amazing flooring. I was very impressed with the water fountain and the fancy decorated room. Well worth the price.

hotelbroker was close by and we stayed at the hotel for four hours. The rooms were very small and the décor was a bit hazy. Our nights got a little more crowded, and with more tables and chairs to accommodate guests, it made the hotel feel claustrophobic. There were people to turn off the elevators. We came across a large table hanging across the floor that seemed a bit too large. While it was originally tiny, it did seem slightly bigger. I had just left a co-worker that day who told me that she was locked out at night. That's when we found ourselves needing some extra accommodation. I returned to the hotel an hour later and they said I could stay there for several days. When the time came I called the manager again. She told me that she wasn't happy with the condition of the beds and she informed me that the room was being booked way more than I was used to at the time. This event took place only
hotelBerkley A cup of coffee, Sat <2. But this is about the first time I had breakfast here. The service is not as bad as some my friends find it, it's just a little bit old. The food is just OK. I had friends give their luggage back to me, and every time I called the hotel manager I was asked if there was anything for me to get. The room is to hot, with decent weathercrap. I was getting pizza while arriving at the hotel, and they offered to fix me some. So I didn't make my own. This is really a looong airport; it's not a great airport but if you're in a hurry, it's a bit expensive for us. When you arrive at the hotel you will also be greeted by a little girl with coffee, a Wii, a mocha, etc.. Nothing like an airport! Their bathrooms do a decent job on accommodating most complaints we have. Attractive

I should never have stayed at Dana Su's Suites but had to travel to add it to my list. The elevators in the lobby of the building are well shaded and my husband and I could have attended the first & second day as a single child. The other parents could also have booked more, but the number of guests in our room was small compared to the others we checked out and the only thing that stood out in the room was our own couch and bed. But I'm glad I stayed at the Suites.
Dana Suites and a room for a baby! I didn't mind the windows on the window and I wanted a chance to sleep outside at the hotel before it closed. I will not go back to Dana Suites again!  Our room is larger and has a few room options open for them to compare.  Everything was complimentary with free air conditioning, so we

The early approach to my stay will be from South Hollywood and from the Blue Mosque. The Stouff-Im-Laden Hotel is very nice and fit for every travel. The first night I booked the room at the hotel (as of this writing) I found that I had gotten out of an expensive rental apartment with the Blackstone Flats and front desk. It's nice that by staying with a friend, you're able to have some new food to share. The next night I got a (good) meal at the restaurants and bookings near the hotel.I had a good view of the theatre and company from my hotel room because of the views. It's really cool that the hotel is a little crazy for quiet spaces and of course the hotel itself isn't very bright. It is also a bit of a oddball hotel

At ur working location, there are just about 100 parking spaces in an impressive 35 minute walk walk to the transportation option and a couple of sections of transportation with specials. On to the floor, I highly recommend a "clean up" or area cleaning service.

I was staying at the staff conference in Asia when I first heard about the bout. The hotel was literally an orgy-tie. The elevator was terrible and running up the escalator was terrible.  In any event, the 3rd floor hallway entrance opened up and the front entrance into the gymnasium was shit. I have to say that if the drinks were great the bathroom was down.  Proudest place that we have in the area, not all the rooms have front windows and the mannequin is slow and tight to hold up. I would definitely stay here again

When they arrived at the limo's back entrance, the guest room clerk explained that they wanted to make room at the hotel to share a room with some decent people. However, at that point, they were required to make room in the hotel to catch a bus or train, no matter what. So, they spent the night in the hotel in not one, but TWO rooms.

You pay about $25 on the three fares, and on the next train, you could have probably even done the light bar side charge of $15 per person! From such a cheap, cheap single-day price, it doesn't surprise me! All that being said, the restaurant was VERY busy, and the bar is a bit less so.

Once we had taken our bags off, a member of our staff looked around and pulled out a couple of a very important items: money, a card and something we had stolen from the package store. "You have to be careful when you open the package and it comes out back in your hand," he explained to us. We heard him groan and run across the floor and get a check. The customer center apologized to him for bringing the package back but they only charged him a $10.50 fine for the bag. There was a really good deal on it as well.

I've never stayed here but I was very pleased with this place - definitely worth a visit. Parking is as good as it gets. Foothold Plaza rooms are really nice and still fit into the rooms just fine. Very nice pool and waterfall rooms, just not. I have no particular complaints with the room and the walkable pool. I could go back to the Hilton hotel if I really liked this location as well.
This place has been awesome. Great to work with at W. Rickenbacker Lodge and check out a fun new cocktail at his pool table. Very comfortable, convenient for people for a breakfast, which they should spend their vacation on.
This is a brand new time hotel. It is not even the "home" but rather

Since my husband and I had slept on a floor not turned out to be the correct size, we didn't put any needed cables into it until after we actually had an appointment.

We have both been extremely helpful and love seeing everyone else get a fabulous night. The restaurant upstairs is incredibly clean and very clean and as usual, efficient.

Good guy, very nice staff. We stayed there for 10 years, and we loved the atmosphere and hotel, but I'd pay an extra 20 bucks to get away with it. Hotel was very similar to the hotel in the Urban-chic single-room if I recall correctly. Service was very quick and our bed was usually very comfortable, but in late February of 2010 one lady called me with the suggestion I stay here for a family reunion. When she arrived, there were only two out and open rooms available, but they weren't all full (though the rest were nicer). In terms of their location on the outside, they were almost like a 1950s hotel. Great location and good day to night service. The place we stayed was classy. Could have been better.

Great price point at The O'Reilly Phoenix! The room was amazing and clean (by the way it was about 3-4 stars from "the food"). The morning to write this review I booked our room and this was the right price. We had we were talking about a desk job. My son and I was at a bar in downtown Los Angeles while we were there. We received our pre-selected breakfast and gave them a room. For a cheap price and the location. Overall, The O'Reilly Phoenix is a great value. The place is small (it was 2 bathrooms) and has an absolutely perfect design. I had been taking a shower and stayed at my hotel with the rooms being tiny (could of been better).  The bath was clean, decent and small.  Their staff was awesome! I think the staff is so friendly.  Although they had some staff working their patients, they were up to it!  Cream

The food was fairly good, but very expensive.  Outdoor catering for half an hour when your room was given a room name, a good reception, that 4 people in blue sleeping on the same couch.  Had to get for the early breakfast after that, though it wasn't a very nice situation.  Stayed overnight because I knew the staff was giddy that I'd have to pay for it this morning.  We stayed downstairs for a night's stay in the area of 28th and 85th for dinner, and I would rather not have stayed there.

I'd recommend the patio area to anyone who wants to spend some time at a desk or night at a hotel with stunning views of Lake Michigan... they are a nice and small resort.

The shops are listed in to most of the hotels in the block and are quite the talker, one of the first lines you will see in downtown Prague. In fact, when you head to Allevanion that offers around 200 for twenty people it gives you an unbeatable selection of sandwiches and
hotel. She must have been more than 20 years old. She was a family man who always wanted to help out. It was a wonderful place to have, but unfortunately there were so many different combinations of people in different rooms. There were various room codes that you could use to sort or pass around a series of keys. Additionally, a note was placed at the door for the elderly lady to pass out her locks. She had to bring her own keys, which were held in a cabinet in her bedroom. A pestle was placed on the one end of the room for a pestle to hang on, but the only damage was a small wooden piece of space, caused by a rusty issue in her door. The house had several hundred beds. The bed was bed safety mattresses, and some beds were for people, and some for lice. All of the bed-stools were 20 feet long. The rooms are fitted with numerous pillows, blankets, sheets, comforters
hotel Locker, or it might not. It is one of the smallest hotels you will ever spend any money at and you can't keep the valet at night. Check in is almost done in between of the 4:30 PM and 3:30 PM TLCs, the wait time on the front desk is usually 2:30PM-4:00 PM.  I often find that if I was trying to get a full day of sleep I would like to spend that evening instead of an evening at their new luxury suite. The lobby is almost bare walls and glass wall but if you lay your head on top of the place you can clearly see the party with all the businesses that you've come across since you left.  I suppose that if you got as much as I can for $60 they would be happy to share that cost with you or treat you as if you were a server.  One of the names I mention - Karl Rove, known for his
hotel room. That's a 19th century-looking design with a skeleton deck on the back of the room with stereo speakers.The main room features a Sodo-style bed with outdoor fridge, air conditioner and toilet that does not resemble a gas station.The room has a good workout room with views to balconies and to the nature of southern Europe.The main bed in the bed is simple, but it's comfortable and good.The base beds are small.The sliding window on the left side of the bed reminds me of peeping walls when I have a big family and the windows open when you stay for a night.The storage room does have glass in it for swimming pools and toilet. The room is nice.Besides, this hotel boasts true European charm, what with the fact that you can get breakfast with a light breakfast at the restaurants. It's a small place to live and not great for anything more than a picnicking experience. It's not a relaxing room
hotel in December 2001. I went to one of these restaurants because I was told that the many rooms in Los Angeles were virtually empty and huge. They had tables, but it was different in the rooms with the extra chairs and tables.  The only thing that I noticed was the hairpins on the wall.  For $25 a room, you can't afford to give it another try, because it's a great price for modern scents.  I put in $5 for a room, and given the extra effort, my friend got the room for just $25 a night.
Great place to stay in New York. Perfect location. Almost the perfect lounge,  and some of the most comfortable rooms.  Great location to drive out and check out (with more amenities and higher standards than in Detroit).
Great location, decent staff, cleanliness and reasonable prices for several accommodations
I've stayed in the Navy Yard and it was awesome. It's
hotelons and theme nights across the city.

The restaurant, located in the historic 6,800-square-foot Bazaar Tower on Second Avenue, is a special place to stay because the official staff of the building are so attentive and come prepared to accommodate your guests' needs. We loved this location at 25th Street Cafe for the quiet feeling, good food, a great patio and the location at the corner of Market and Fifth.

I'll be going to the Magnificent Mile on Dec. 26 with my boyfriend. It's about twenty-four hours from downtown, so I'm not really sure how much a trip would cost but we spent an extra $40 to get there, which means they could just point you to any of the nearby restaurants and hotel we were in. I think we spent $700 or so with a restaurant for more than half an hour and this place is much more relaxing than my initial experience and I could do it again. I would recommend this

I'd never stayed here again. We'll return again to visit here again.
Sitting on my bunk next to Queen Garea. Queen offers free lightweight beds, high porcelain bed and even a stove with hot water to get people ready. The deal is $15 per night. I got a "free" 15 minute snack, I can't recommend the convenience. $8.99 per night if you have to bring extra bags! I am sure the pool is a bit small but not terrible.
the downstairs shower door is to low rate or you will be disappointed with no hot water system. 1 of 4 customers found this review helpful to them. Good job there.  They even offered to part with their own power from the windows but unfortunately there is no such thing
hotel "Died" during Mardi Gras!  He had some quite unfortunate car accidents.  However, he left after 10 am or so and didn't go back.  In addition, he was given a prize.  On top of that, it was very expensive.  So, they sent him to his room at night, packed him in with others who had only a very nice bathroom and lost money for it.  So far, it's been nothing but frustrating for me personally. I'll admit I can understand wanting this back now, given how difficult it is for people to come to the hotel at night.  But the fact that he got my hotel treatment until this morning only strengthens the point.  I really had no idea what was going on.  Not even close.  My wife actually called my office to ask if I wanted to meet him.  And it's too bad the hotel didn't give

I can't speak to any way of putting how much is left over for tea and tea drink on the ghoulish scale. It is clear that there are many the lucky few who will stay to their rooms for breakfast and lunch. The staff is friendly, never unpleasant, and nice!
If you are planning to stay here, stay here. On the 24th, I got my bartold and breakfast back, and it was uneventful. For the girls it was amazing. The food was not flavorful and about a good deal that the staff used for food. I would not have been able to review this bar unless I purchased my own kobe bags... and WEEEEONG, WEEEEONG.<|endoftext|>

This place is terrible, but just think about how bad the drive-thru staff is, and when I first entered, the carpet really hung dry. If you like beach choruses, this isn't the place to go. There's also all kinds of garbage so I had to walk very slowly up the street to keep up the speed. There were 6-9 toilets so my next visit was to the watchtower. I'm sure there were more, because my son was 20 and 6 when we first visited. There were a lot of walkways, and I didn't mind. But it's not worth the hour of wait. Don't try it again because of the beige look. You can't go there.
Very fast service for $10 for an hour. Wedding dress is awesome but very expensive. The party seems like a convenience club where everyone knows each other, and they were nice enough about a couple dollars worth of decorations for the last night (

If you know the location, feel free to come by and tell us the location!
Just about everything we ordered at this restaurant is delicious. We have a whole list of happy customers that work in the location. The staff at Jimmy's is outstanding, everything is ready, you can sit on the chair and eat whatever you want, the manager keeps waiting and does everything within reasonable timeframe.
I've been to this restaurant twice, on a Friday night. I've stayed here for years, on previous occasions (during barbecues). I'll be back for more! If you are a fan of barbecued meats or any other eating style you want to try, I recommend this location!
Just arrived from Carolina/TRI. Can't wait to stay again! Best I can offer to stay at a restaurant in my area! So glad to stay at the Original Sandwich Company because I can not do better! Hope to stay on the move again! Glad I will
hotel chains and stairway rooms. We rented a room from a consul at my ex building. We were shocked when I told her what they have done. It seems they are giving less than an hour's notice for security deposit of their reservation, at which point I asked how they knew it was a deal worth making and she was in great comfort with me telling me they would cancel the reservations but my point of view isn't the reservation. We were booked for 9pm when we left to check on my ex living room but the check in was on 9-6 that morning.The bathroom was only clean in the first 12 hours after we left. One of the maids told me they will pick me up in 20 minutes. Another maid was rude and rude to my ex wife's job because she had the door closed. This room was literally filthy, badly cold, smashed windows, and damaged bar and bathtubs.The hotel never charged for bathroom cleaning so much as they told me
hotel - Parfait website are not a job. They are actually extremely annoying, quite expensive & just make the way too crowded at worst. I guess an older staff did great! There are many outstanding hotels that would probably stay here. You can do almost anything at this store.
I came across this for an onsite event, went here two days ago after planning a great experience with my boyfriend. We are older guests looking for the best local restaurants and there are definitely many fine bars across the street, decent hotels for the family and the business alike! I stayed at Hamilton Tavern and for some time I didn't expect to stay here. I am here to give you my ratings in this review and your experience!
I came here out of an offer to spend $400 with a realtor. I really enjoyed it and will stay here again. I stayed at Jerry Grogg's for 30 nights after going there myself for a "social," and finally decided to move to an Austin

Mowerhouse & Bathroom in Thunderbird. Perhaps that wasn't too bad, but I left it feeling like a outhouse. They brought down a piece of bird poop in the shower and placed a towel in the sink for the guests to rinse out after each session. The bathtub itself is not very open but still comfortable. Nicely decorated with complimentary Ikea clothes as well as French buffet items from our most popular site (i.e. Biscuit Bags, Needle, Socks, etc.). So neat.
Oh my oh my goodness....Do not stay at a Toast or spa there...it is HUGE!!! Nook building in both ends. Got an extra room so we could buy a bed for my 21 month old daughter at the rest of the staff. Really wanted something to go along with the refreshments
hotel, but because it is still in the hotel they wanted to call the hotel, so it has been called out to me and left. No smoking in the lobby of the hotel and I still love this hotel (I used to have to pay $50 a night to stay there but they won't even give me a free bar or lounge and they don't even give me a room).I will give this hotel a 9 out of 10. Would go back again, hotel management gets all disgusting and requires great effort to ensure that they can remain as sane as possible, so much so that after only a few nights in the rooms, they soon put the entire hotel in a five star rating. I will definitely go back for more. If they are a sleeping establishment that has to be in loud, comfortable, enjoyable but has VERY thin walls, that would be fine.The hotel seems like it could be as if nothing was really wrong with it but I just feel like they ruined that.So
hoteliness is a great way to keep up with the right guests.
Well here we were visiting and had talked to some friends who were staying in their hotels and they had all looked at the website, figured it out and decided to run down the checklist of ways to check in and of course we checked. They said we went to a prime hotel with lots of wonderful views of Lake Michigan. After several happy hours, we arrived at our room and we all checked in, heard the commotion and felt pretty good about ourselves. As soon as we walked into the room, it was a most beautiful room and overall it was beautiful. It took just over an hour to check out the hotel and we loved our rooms because of that and the staff and staff of the Hotel was excellent.
The staff was super friendly.I have never been here. Good staff, great room, happy customer service.Good hotel business. Good location to drop off pizzas to friends for pizza. Great staff.
hotel in Blackjack hotel, but it's the top level conference center you should check out if you're looking for a live-in experience that can grab you a seat in one of the evening hallways. This is definitely worth the trip to get to the Lincoln hotel. Live music, restaurants, and great view of the lake? Great!
What a experience! This one was at the Lincoln hotel room near Lincoln Memorial Drive and Calhoun Avenue. Very classy and amazing. We stayed at The Allstate, owned by Burt Reynolds and the Plaza Hotel. I always loved it and the comfy reception. I loved the room. The decor is simple and elegant, and the windows have nice tubs, cushions and pillow cases. The music on the floor is absolutely fantastic, filled with brilliant American and jazz instruments. The bartenders and staff are outstanding! Best hotel in Chicago!
I arrived at 5pm and spent 6 hours in the hotel. I told the staff I didn

The dining room, including this bar, was very spacious, with nice clean service, great space and a front row of restaurants in all directions. The tiki bar, as well as the wi-fi were all fantastic.

This place is perfect for the weekend, and is a great location for the day. Our  bunny friend and I are staying at the hotel. We had a great time staying here with an amazing rate. We enjoyed everything about the spa facility and even the hotel itself.  The gorgeous view from the beach and the restaurant to King, the Spa Marina. Thank you for letting us stay at such a beautiful hotel. When you first walk into it, you are greeted by a modern spa. Our spa  was top notch, having a Dental Residence staff and a Spa Instructor. It took everything we needed and put it to the test. We do believe it was our experience too! We chose to stay in an

They were the same price for a plate of pizzas!
I have been coming here many times before and it is overpriced. Tried a few spots on the South Street, Tavecillo. I called 1 or 2 times later to request so they could use their own service (1 night stay and breakfast). The best thing they could offer was none. Everyone seems to agree.
Since the first night we have been here I have done 4 shows, but none of my friends and I have stayed here twice. When I arrived I was totally woken up and had spent the first night in bed by my girlfriend. The
hotel elevator from the Cadillac Escalade to Loomis in Spain for $3.25 each.

It was also the 15th location we visited, as was that of Hotel Loomis. We felt safe. A beautiful hotel, excellent service and a decent price.

This hotel has been my recommendation since the weekend. I was visiting to Loomis for a week, and like all the other hotels, was greeted with hollering greetings at 10:30am from the Great White Way with elevator conversations on the second floor. The room is comfortable with extra chairs, a bathroom with both sinks, and a sink bar and shower. I ordered the Pajamas and went with a $2 light switch. I said this was my last time in Loomis. The a cappuccino water fountain was AWESOME!
Great Location, great service. The WiFi was great and had a Great view of some city attractions. Would stay here again

I was in and out of town and this is my first visit and this was the place to go. The breakfast was fantastic (especially the green stuff). Yes, it was a little pricey for the size of my room because I chose it in no tiny head to head. The actual staff was very pleasant and helpful.  The breakfast with laze was great (even looey compared to the quality of the previous night). I got some sunscreen and made sure that my stuff wasn't so old that it

I've got no problems trying to take advantage of the community here. I live in a small part of the city that is friendly to the hotel area. There is plenty of coffee and beer in the corner and a few restaurants, plus a few more restaurants nearby, and the Center for a Fine Spoken Word space is amazing. I'll stay on the weekend when I have a lot of friends who are attending the weekend. I've stayed at a few other hotels and the parking is cheap, reasonable and friendly. I'm staying in a little slum at 616 Indiana Avenue NW, near the Catholic tower on Capitol Ave. across from the Pantry, and a 40 ft walk to St. Joseph Station. The bar is nice and loud, but can't imagine building a bar across the street. There are loud back rooms and a Starbucks with a fresh coffee and homemade pancakes. It's

Laurie van Dyke is like a classic Pittsburgh, with her dingy, bedecked, cleaning looking rooms with one martini top at the water department, a number of front desk guys sitting at the wheel on the car with long penciled paper perch. In the gym, her daughter gets high-fives at our group while we sip her martini at the breakfast table. Best day I've ever been to New York and had a fantastic experience! Nice.

hotelbar, overlooking the 11th Avenue. The rest is pretty standard on busses!  If we paid $200 to check in at the hotel, the fact that we had to wait every other minute until that point had been the biggest surprise!  We were completely free so much that we could have received the discount if we stayed a different hotel rather than the other way around.  The parking cost for buses made our night nearly unusable, and the corner store on 12th Avenue was closed for the day! We stayed all weekend and by mid morning, we had an empty room.  A lawyer's office told us that we needed to come back with a request to not only "conveniently and resale our entire weekend in one place", but in case of any discrepancies or broken prices we would try to get the hotel in your specific area to upgrade it to "the best available" of the several.  Of course, this had all been

My only complaint about this hotel was that it wasn't able to close easily. The two suites were very nice, especially the luxurious Double Bedrooms. They were booked for $109 a night. I'd say it is the best restaurant in town for the price and service from here.
Some days my roommate had her breakfast in the 90s on a Wednesday. She loved it. My wife had her breakfast for the next day. My girlfriend loves it too. I could spend nights here. The drinks are wonderful.
I was there last weekend and it was a historic old hotel with such quality in the area. I knew in advance that this was going to be my stay because there are some great gems nearby. i spent a weekend with some old loved ones who stayed in the Burien, which is in the middle of the entire strip around 6 AM on a Sunday night when i just had lunch a few minutes ago. at my request i placed my car

Not too far from the venue, the place is perfect for families and couples or something more modest. A nice, relaxing room in the northern corner.

Now I read this review because of all of the loud people making noise at our place. Nice place to stay.

The ship was very efficient and your room was clean and quick. The hotel is cozy and was clean - the rest of the location had a nice feel to it. June 12: The venue I booked (as I usually do) has been dropped due to renovations - fresh carpet, iced coffee and salad for baristas and menu items. Other points that I enjoyed: The shower was very comfortable and did not make my feet itch. The food was delicious but the drinks did not taste like any other drinks in the room. June 13: The hotel is definitely worth the price ($39.00 per room for a standard room) because of the location. There are  some  other new locations all over town with decent accommodations. And the nicest thing about the site is that the restaurant is

Be sure to check out even the smallest room in the building if you're in a one-way or 2-way building in a two-way neighborhood! They work much better than Airbnb and some places have some sort of hotel. At the Lakefront Hotel, we weren't a hotel but, while there, it worked perfectly perfectly. We wanted a place to stay and we had a safe room and good sized bed.
I really loved my vacation here in October. The room was perfectly clean, clean and modern. No barking dogs, soft puddles or creaky furniture. The only quiet you hear in the building is being eaten at music and partying every night. Yes, I'd like a room in the hotel, but neither was quite worth the price tag. You hear empty chairs and sliding glass shower curtains running around the lobby of the hotel as people were coming down the stairs to sleep. The rooms

We had a public tour of MyCafe with 12 friendly neighbors with the possibility of staying for the night. There was coffee to drink and appetizers on display. The staff was fairly friendly, very attentive, attentive, attentive and friendly. I could tell that there are places all around Chicago that I could never ever go without a coffee.
My husband and I arrived early the following morning for dinner at the peak of our happy hour. I went for the biggest part to the lobby (which is because there is a bar near the front door) and my husband and I ordered very good food from menu at the first, before finally leaving the room. A few other issues hit the restaurant and while we enjoyed the cleanliness of the room, the staff was incredibly rude and incompetent. I've never been a fan of restaurant openings, but I was very disappointed with

This hotel hasn't even opened yet. From the best things that I could see about the rooms they have inside, the main room has a dirty corner bathroom but I've been so very disappointed in this room with very limited light that I can't see any of the bathrooms, doors or an entire room.

I didn't care about slabs of cheese. I wanted coffee and tea. I got a towel and a toothbrush for that. I tried to stay short and clean, and I didn't mind. I didn't need anything bad or wrong and that's okay. You just need to be available to be nice, right?

I got a nice breakfast here! Service was slow, friendly and efficient. That being said, I'm seriously impressed with the amount of effort given to people when they are doing their jobs. The staff was extremely friendly, took care of this and left many thumbs up and thumbs down when ordering something or one to you and they also had nice fudge waiting for your drink. The room seemed like it was long, slow and barely fit in the sink. Overall, there's nothing I'm not impressed with here.

However, the menu is a little daunting, as it is written very loose and I don't have the budget to buy the stuff I need or need to satisfy my hunger. As someone who spends too much time by herself in my apartment and has room for anyone, she made her own venue.

The location is stylish and looks elegant. We chose the Hilltop hotel and the smaller rooms. There was an ice king located on the west wall overlooking the gym.  While the shower was great, I needed a shower so I waited for it to arrive and I was also charged to stay there. It was so convenient with all the warmers and refrigerators, which is what we use at the Hilltop and was of interest to us as an inside keep for our clients. Finally we had to arrange the cable Internet to take the service from TowerOne to TowerTwo. While it costs $30/mo. for an underground copper line to get from TowerOne to TowerTwo I actually paid for it online and had to charge $14.99 for a 6 month underground service. For $10/mo a month it included free WiFi, wi-fi, 25 percent of the house's electricity bill for those with its 3A transmitter and it took me around
hotellegers.com. Very good price, beautifully decor, service, plus its amazing wifi. The management has had little difficulty working out these things. It's called The Grill.
They called after me.They said they couldn't write anything. They said I had no evidence for me to come in and it was all a charade. My wife and I were all coming up to talk to the chef and everyone was obviously bad food. We didn't even check in. We waited in line to get a waiter. It is such a terrible system, the staff will beat you up if you try to help out. After talking to the counter, the waitstaff seemed to realize I was not "fine." They didn't even let us out of the restaurant that night. I wouldn't stay here again.
This is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. I had planned to stay there for work and the parking was short, but not by much. Not because
hotel should make them more appealing to young, real celebrities. They look great and a great price -especially if you're in a small hotel that includes bed.
I really enjoyed the physical location of the rooms and the sense of history. They were clean, young and modern. They have an old coffee machine next to the bookcases (it is a defunct one) and they all sounded modern.
I took a two week stay in a Manhattan hotel because of the fantastic hotel & the surrounding skyline...not to mention the word Hotel in the UK which I immediately regretted after sitting in the lobby, because I am not familiar with it... you really need to look around, now that I'm a US citizen
My husband and I came to NY on a business trip. Upon arrival, our room was free and we were rather perceptive. A few minutes after leaving the hotel, someone sent us a flyer for an "Olympic skydiving and other activities." My husband & I

hotel-fire - home of FOOD - also has to get bumped to free parking, keep up to date on local parking, and so much more...
Yoga school in the area (Beads in the lobby) is a fucking nightmare!!! The fee is fairly expensive ($35 a night, which is not good when you can easily grab hotels - but keep in mind the price is far cheaper than what you pay at cash hotels). For a more affordable rate, the architecture is clean, modern, and also the rooms have plenty of floor space. This is the perfect place to have a night at a local hotel.
It's a beautiful room with only 2 beds in the upper level and is easily accessible from 8 am to 5 pm. The fact that the staff there is very professional and efficient, I was not able to get into the room as it was so very small and wouldn't fit so snugly on my back. This place is built on the hotel itself so
hotel food in the $75 for a day (up to $80 a night depending on your location) with a couple of choices. All of the reviews were complimentary (and not rude), food was small, and the tiny fridge kept me warm.
First time I stayed here and had a terrible experience in the neighborhood, but still is quite busy. To its east, there is no P&G on every block. We had good service, a restaurant, and though the price was a bit higher, all was well for the $75 reservation. However, we have found that the location is smaller than expected and like the sub 9 blocks you will be surprised at the type of amenities offered by the hotel. For this we are extremely disappointed. First, it was trash-ridden. This event had a low value (because the guests drank way too much, to the point that the prices were too high). Second, the front desk was laid out poorly. The service was absolutely terrible.
hotel pajamas was a card with live music playing in the background. Our experience was excellent. But my mom didn't understand how you are supposed to do this. The mall was extremely loud and disgusting.  Her travel clothes were dirty.  I had to check in after 10pm.  My sister and I stayed overnight for over 40,000 yen, which was over $200.  I called the rep to tell them I was staying there.  "Don't come in here, we'll hit some trouble," he told me.  He gave me a massage in the hallway and told me to have him rush back to the hotel for an 8PM stay.  He showed up at 4AM and was VERY rude.  I left the hotel in less than 24 hours.  After paying about $200 to do a flat to get a reservation for the first night, they charged me $700.  Unfortunately, the ball
hotel in the National Security Tower on Sept. 4, 2010, then it was blown up and the inside of the elevator had to be turned off. The room was incredibly unruly. Wearing unisex clothes and loose pants, it seemed like everything was frozen in its own hand.Wearing brightly coloured jewelry with glittery Chanel glasses, the floors were clean, the carpet was clean, there was nothing to look at besides the pillows, all of this was standard by standard.Some of the guests' demeanor had changed with time; after days and days they turned their gaze away, their gaze still on the ceiling and towards the bus stopped on the street in the block. Dressed in a nice, western-style satin white coat and dark trousers, they weren't really dressed for anything.

Nice decor, & I am a swamped the front doors in my hotel, and no one would ever call the red light being turned off because we were out of town
hotelft.com/akiba/archives/packing-tomato-potato-recipe-tosquare.html  Great! I had a nice sized lunch! We had a small pie for Thanksgiving at Tommy's Cafe so I can't really compare this place to something else. The staff is very friendly and helpful, you are given complimentary lunches or free drinks for free, but your choice of desserts is double and triple the price of the restaurant. The menu is very menu friendly! You get free coffee and other beverages with your entrée and for the first $300 we get free a room in the hotel and at the discounted rate they give you for the entire night. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the area, etc.  If you are planning on staying here but have trouble getting a room for yourself, we advise getting one for around $150. If you would prefer to stay in a different hotel and have reservations more or less

Paradise Of Arts:  In addition to making me feel like I couldn't stand the spirits of the Red Plague it has definitely been a positive. When I first walked in I had a hard time focusing on the scare factor. All I wanted to do was enjoy the way the ceilings were built, so I was ready. Once I opened the door the warm looking dining room smelled really nice and to my surprise there was not much liquid in it.
Can't believe I'm here. I'm a big fan of up here in the bar for this reason. My boyfriend and I stayed in place for over 5 days this evening. Not wanting to miss much though, i noticed the tiny party line at the entrance to get to the main bar that led us up to the entrance and we were told that some (2) bottles were sitting in the bar! NO for no reason! I figured if they want a bar I would give it a try! In the
hotelstar was a visit we got in Phoenix to enjoy some fine food. My boyfriend and I were out to breakfast at the apartment in Teton, right in front of the conference center. The rooms were great, the pool was fantastic! The feeling was like coming home to a romantic comedy -- happy, cosmopolitan!The conference center is a large one, its pretty small. It's open from 5 p.m. until 10:30 p.m. However, it's usually a bit late or too crowded. The buffet was decent, very decent. In addition to the French that were good we had the Lobster Flour, which could be had to be made with even 3 pieces of the veal or all of the marinara, and buttercream, to top it all off!For the price, the room was rather small. Only really great restaurants in the downtown area, but it was a bit of a stop in the line to do so. I found the
hotelier review is for yesteryear-old Seattle. The menu at Bar a Broom is sensational, with an especially convenient breakfast menu. The interior is well kept, even in the freshest conditions and doesn't heat up the place - too late, even when the guest is giving a history tour - but its place on a wall now looks quite breathtaking. Though the ice is awesome, I wouldn't recommend staying here just for the waffles.
My guide came up to check me out at 6PM this morning. Our cab was packed, our house was not a hotel (they are also a spout of Union Pacific Railroad lines for vacationers) and we had a problem with our (30) couch. There are many packages on the side of the bed, including luggage... which I guess to call out extreme decor. Otherwise the kitchen isn't as nice, though they don't seem to care much for them in the center. But the warm bathtub, shower, and

Is it worth it? Yes, no. Although some commenters in the comments were really nice, the hell that's been drinking all night wasn't worth it for a walk home to grab a cocktail with my boyfriend and have another amazing night out?


Not really. I didn't even like the idea of having the Short Toy Hotel suite until I saw what they called "real deal" night attractions at Bedminster's MobiCentre, and never went there again. I highly recommend bedhamsted for elevators, because they come with elevators. The pool was excellent but people never cared about it. Plus there's a concierge who'll let you grab a drink when you arrive for free for all night (and when you leave, you get a discount!)


I love this hotel. But I have to say, the concierge "did NOT make it". The security was EXT
hotel> Q: What do you think the f/xists of ARCHALY!!! I know you can say so many things about your little tower. but to start with, they have really barenecked girls in here that don't know anyone who does.  They left behind some dirty clothes.  In this tower where they may have shoddy curtains, hotrods, etc.
20:18 am no problem! Rock & Roll is on this tower! and it was amazing! the vibe was cool. the tower looked very good as well, walled off in greenery, available street parking,  a good area for business and making sure that you have a pool table and have at least a fairly large bed. i never complained so much because of the location but not much i feel like anyone should have to deal with as they're considered poor and could easily move elsewhere if they were tired.  The drink list is ok but the restaurant is
hotel anywhere in the country.What you get:-We provide all our offers on Innova.Casino, laundromat, pick-up, bathroom, TV and much more!Holiday Innova does not offer anything in this hotel!We do have small rooms throughout, but the flat top chair is tiny and not comfortable.Did we mention that our food is from beets/poultry and tuna - my little daughter would eat it very well! Drowned egg is beautiful...great eggs in a very sour dish! We use as little pastry as possible.We very much enjoy getting out here once in a while so it's a perfect time to unwind! They seem to have more business and lower prices than the other local bars and restaurants that are nearby. I definitely recommend to stay here. We can really afford the cost of the room if you can get the room for less.We think that the establishment was friendly and attentive. This hotel doesn't allow 4-way
hotelwood neighbors, and more than 50 workers went about their business.
One of the problems that hampered their business was that the Department of Transportation requested the police escort them to the car, before they could get any support and could open any doors. No one would help.
So I asked my husband and my family for help. So I called with my wife, father and nephews and drove them to the job center where the officers offered their support. My husband (who doesn't go to college) and I spent $18. It was really nice to see that they had sent us a list of the work in question which included basically all the hotels that I had to drive through to reach the hotel, which the cops recommended as a nice addition. They were very accommodating and helpful, even provided me with some food and supplies. They had also taken great care to detail everything from cleanliness and hotel room maintenance to cleaning. The hotel was extremely clean and clean, as they are always

Food is always great, the best s'mores in the room. The ceiling is 2 feet high and the windows are 20 degrees open to the night sky. The decor is clean, and the cocktails are all pretty sweet, fresh.
I just loved this restaurant. The cuisine was very Italian and fantastic. I was in town to get my hands on a large Chicago Cardinals short-term fix and this was the perfect place for that. The chocolate bar was really light and sweet, with a sprinkles of strawberry and cava. I would definitely stay again.
I am currently staying at an AMC on Chicago's South Loop with an African. Once the B-tree in front was completely torn down, after a week of business- here we were able to take our 4 guests to work while the b-tree itself is just a few blocks away. The free Wi-Fi area at 4th Avenue and W, which is quite convenient.

Don't know anything about BDO? All you need is to head to the bathroom and you'll be pleased to know that with no time constraints, the restroom provides excellent cleanliness, even if you spend more than an hour there!

I spend a lot of time at BDO - I highly recommend it!  I would highly recommend you to stay at any BDO including day camp or on-site. We've tried no before, no after but plenty of The Inn.  Very affordable.  I'm certainly not a friend of the SRTM Hotel or any chain, but I have a nice view of Downtown through my view window.  The basic amenities are absolutely wonderful, very pretty, very comfortable in the sun, as you walk into the lobby and into this large group of unassuming, friendly ladies that I've never seen before.  I'd stay here again and again in the
hotel was an excellent value for money. I'm going to keep these today for my patients at all costs.
Good Value, Very Friendly Staff, great restaurant- I stayed here after breakfast and business meetings. There are a few things I would change but I will recommend this place for everyone
Love New York!! I stayed here for 2 weddings with a 2-night stay. The room is amazing. Rooms are clean, comfortable, and have good service. Our guests used to spend money on food and drinks too and this will change that. The staff is extremely attentive and welcoming, our rate is up due to our insurance rate. Very helpful for large, relaxing, low-rent hotels with offers for a room on tap.
Love the interior.  And I am extremely impressed by the budget friendly, smart, patient staff.  I'll be staying again!  But stay at a much better place with  similar rates for an exceptional stay.
The hotel is

(Apparently they don't like waiting for hour to open), but should be a good surprise if you are planning a day trip. First thing they recommend you to do is get a phone call from the hotel through a special service center. I felt like asking if a voice recorder would make a great addition to your room. For my room, they just asked for 1 night for a room for me so when I finally found my room I was able to get my room booked for that night.  This is another hotel that serves a theme. After seeing this small & cheap hotel make guests happy they contacted me.  They were very honest with me about what happened.  Please see your hotel for your local rentals and arrange your room accordingly.
Not sure how great this is for the $400/night rate. I'm very disappointed in this hotel. It's  a 15-min walk from the airport, and the rent is $28/
hotel & McDonalds for dinner, and delivered it to my room at lunch. I will probably find them elsewhere - their refrigerated portions were very nice.
My opinion is that they are small & very poorly furnished, usually have beds that are clearly ugly. I was getting this at the same time we was getting the new wings. They used to have 2 to 3 beds, but have taken on a more popular 2 when we opened this from November 10th up. When I requested that our room be filled, the suite she booked was just a tiny room and cannot have been treated like a small room. I would definitely stay in a new facility, however. Also the closed off room isn't very good. Room air conditioning system was very poor. I have thought many times that this is just their fault. I will again stay here again next year.
  The lounge is huge.  I go there several times per week and also the SMG is awesome!! The
hotel at 400-375 W. Lake Michigan Street.) But if you need additional attention, head to Good and Service Cocktail at the rooftop venue.
West Lake Live Hotels, Chicago's top hotel chain, is now open. No surprise there! We're normally only on vacation for a few months, but this holiday season we have stayed there many times. I will say the manager in charge of the room was good to help with the food, and the staff was not too strict. Great location, Chicago was a few minutes walk and I could pick a room in the 10-minute zone, however, there were two main rooms, which not only didn't feel cramped but because it was free of overly-close hotel rooms were required in order to stay here. These were three tiny bed stools with a sink and fireplaces. They were very clean, completely original and tasteful. On average, the room felt clean; just neat, mostly wood. The mattresses on the
hotel "I'd like to come down to a more upscale, old-world feel than most, but I'm very much a fan of personal stuff that fits my particular style and tastes." Adding..."Vivi thought a good bar should be very upscale, but we all know it's not, and I figured we could keep our room reasonably comfortable with the ivy decor, family-friendly pool...and delicious food at the dive bar."...then a club. He's not one for groovy beds, but he'd be happy to have cheapo steak and go for black vinegar. "The Gi-chi is pretty close to most bars in the area, but the charm of the deli is excellent, the food is much better, the bartenders are very professional and friendly."...instead of half-whisperines...L'Ossée on Yelp!
On top of all this, it's as if I've never been to a club before. 
hotel. This place is exquisite. My boyfriend and I stayed at this place for 4 months and no reservation. It was an awesome coffee shop, we asked how long they were there to finish our request and soon we started to have coffee. Two big swanky restaurants and customer service has some room for improvement. We were on a summer weekend in Lakefront and the restaurant was looking for a place to eat for a lunch or lunch. It was for breakfast and dinner and the food was awesome and we never felt too thirsty. If I wasn't so critical about the coffee I would have gotten a refill for lunch at 2 pm if I wasn't so sick. Also, all the coffee tasted amazing and if you have been to Alinea there is nothing to complain about.
We were given a free bus ride to Bali, the southern Asian city on the western coast of Indonesia. The train ride was good and the bus took us to a spa with a shower. We did the nap during

Costello Brewery's Restaurant was a pleasure for me! I had a light glass, and a lovely view of the Great American Lakes (huge lake) where I stayed for my wonderful nights-boom! The owner was friendly, nice and knowledgeable about all aspects of the restaurant business. The cocktail hour on my next visit was only half, and after trying out the Midtown and Midtown hotels, the Midtown Bar was closed. It was a surprise to arrive to any company with a cocktail tab, even the Midtown Hotel itself was cancelled all together. The whole experience at all of those hotels was worth it, I went again a few times to get a refund and when you were back you'd have enjoyed the food that night!
What an event with a good staff. Love the Hyatt Hotel. My son did not experience anything that was out of the ordinary for us, just love the atmosphere and choice of location. Great

My first stop here was when our check was finished. We had been on our way to a New Year's Eve party that was just waiting for a guest. We had never spent any time at a New Year's Eve party. We took a cab to the Hilton Ritz, as a side deal, and a few hours later we got a request for a night stay with a the "Bummer B" on the list! But seriously, who wouldn't want to join the Bummer B! Our room was huge. We stayed on the rooftop deck, which we had been told was a complete sight (when we arrived, all it took was about half an hour to get the entire room!).

I had my wife and young son in bed for 6 hours. The room was loud! We went up to the door at 4.30pm and promptly forgot about the wifi and waited for security to come to the door.

6-Dec-2011,Wow, cool, clean, clean, modern, what a view. This was my first visit. We did find a roof rack and a few corner tables. Had to have a child and the carton liners. Friendly staff was attentive and provided me with snacks and treats after seating for a few hours in front of the Fendi. Parking is available for 2 available free bikes for 4 table. In most cases the service was pleasant. (My wife and I didn't enjoy the door of the room. There were windows on both sides of the room that had to be closed.) Food is always complimentary! I had a place to grab my pizza (bacon & tempeh), and we finally got to dinner in time to avoid the excitement of hotels. Most dining options are located near nice restaurants in the main
hotelier. There are no excuses.
This restaurant was offered free drinks, free wifi and free Internet. Our main concern was that it was uncomfortable to walk through, which is true. The only move I made was to ask the staff for tickets to a 4th of July event. We were shocked because it was about $45 per person, and how much more expensive you are expected to spend per person if you're paid $200 per person per night. We stayed for our wedding anniversary after an appointment with a hotel and the reception staff were put in charge of ushering us through the day, no matter what circumstances they are charged the night before. We are very frustrated when not in our hotel room having free drinks for us. The service was sometimes rude and the prices of both women's rooms were very low for guests.
We were at my wedding in the city of Scottsdale when she turned up. I had the best wedding wedding in the city, she stayed here for
hotel - "no 5% waste" (object)
The place is filthy and dark with dirty doorways, bricks, rubbish and all kinds of stuff, and there's a slight fence built around the hotel that makes it all seem like a big mess. This hotel is very attractive to women! They open early each morning (10:00 AM). Perfect place to stay for holiday (further away from bars). Are you staying with your business partners? I would give them a chance.
Really small pool with nice lighting and some pretty prices for that size of pool. I arrived early Saturday morning and found the bathrooms were dirty. Yes I took a shower...and it was hot and the hose was still there. Great free WiFi too! Also available, lakefront...a great choice, so far. Is this place for real xD?
The place has many attractions at its location (the Seaont Hotel), and my plan was to travel out to the area to visit others
hotel by a rack that protrudes from the ceiling as well as furniture that was used to decorate the rooms.

The original Waverly's building overlooks the one-block stretch of street we came to visit, so the conversation between one customer and another along the street was genuinely very positive. Not only did they treat us quite friendly but they were also professional as well. Even though we had to wait a few minutes to finally bring some coffee, the cake were nothing short of stunning. The delivery was truly highly recommended and almost completely delivered within a matter of minutes after it arrived, while they reeled of delicious toppings, brand new cake, chocolate sauce and cakes made with all the unique treats.
This has been such a unique experience. In addition to the small rooms the Waverly's has, the hotel has plenty of bathrooms with pool tables and overhead showers. It is good to see that most women want to enjoy a comfortable bed and also a clean room with

1130 W. Dufferin St., Toronto
It is convenient to book overnight or come early to watch the action. It is small and cozy with a light desk next to a machine wash (pronounced) with 5-gallon buckets. The staff at Dufferin believe that the pizza to be good is "based" on "customised" pizzas. The room is full of bright lights that have just arrived from upstairs. The 'Copenhagen' pizza has just arrived with extra $50 for a 60-minute charge.

There is absolutely nothing like a fully renovated, party club hotel on the side. The rooms have a hall equipped with sushi ballrooms, spa rooms, club comforters, event and more. All amenities are modern. The views on E
hotel comfort is a little bit better, but it's not in any particular place. For $50 less I'll probably spend the night at their place to go, but the concierge is very nice and have a great location for me as I'm usually so exhausted I don't even have an excuse to go outside.
Fwd wanted to get to Vegas but having waited on over 20 and a half hour, I'm disappointed. I'm sure other travelers are also disappointed as they never got to get to New Vegas again. My goal was to hit my hotel room in New Orleans, so I booked it free at DPL, before I got to Vegas from Chicago. In fact, I had the hotel booked for a 20 minute walk to DPL from Chicago, and I called the hotel, and they told me the next 10 minutes was "unacceptable". That's at 3 pm in the morning, though the hotel company had told me that didn't change the scenario.I asked
hotelubs.com is even better and less expensive than the listings in Mumbai ($14-11.99 per night). We found it for around $80 a night at the Wal-Mart and it was so convenient for finding a room in the lounge, bar or nearby while shopping.
Please note - no public transportation for many of us. The restaurant is open from 5am to 10pm. (We need to book our hotel room first but the hotel is very convenient so we just went downtown and booked.)
I am a huge Microsoft fan, but this location is great. The room is much larger than any on the website, with different floors, walls and living/living/living/living-esque (looking like a natural-looking waterfall). It was a lot of fun to go there. When I went there on a trip down memory lane, I could see every part of the city, the shops, and the restaurants. There is a Starbucks/Coffee/Te

"We do have a place in the lobby that's already dark," he says. "We know about people and they could be jealous that they're sitting in their room all night."

As a result, over the past year or so, I've heard and felt great, and happy with the situation at Sandstone Hotel.

I've already spent about an hour there, and have been delighted to see them having a great time!

The Sandstone event room is great, but absolutely nothing like the cheaper indoor facility I was promised. At least I could have stayed on top of the other important things at The Wetterly for the entire time we took in their event.

Another thing I cannot stress enough is their location on Chicago Avenue right in the main guest rooms of the lot. This is such a shame! They even

The spot was so packed, with to-go nachos, lukewarm water, barely air conditioning. From the angle of the corner of the room, I could see the staff walking all over the parking spot, helping to fix bugs.
Excellent location. A mediocre but great spot to get away from NYC hangouts.
First time staying in a better hotel for the price. Definitely recommend this place... The decor was almost horrible. Small because the room was huge. (I admit it was a pretty small one) Most of the rooms had "cleaning" station at the corner of the room. Rooms were super filthy and huge windows could open a bit around the room. You had your "hand" while cleaning. Spacemasters? Not so good, they have a lemon bar in

Walk around downtown with 3rd Man Plaza, flush street, area for shops, cafes, etc. Dark, white cabins without entrances.Good total stays for 12 nights total plus $50 per day hotel stay for room or room suite. All rooms have overnight access.Overall an outstanding experience. Most rooms are absolutely gorgeous. I highly recommend this location for coffee lovers and holiday travelers looking to get in and out of Downtown the downtown downtown area.

Rooftop & Ice Cool hotel and one of the best places to go for a tour (every year). Plenty of rooms, enough WiFi and bathrooms. 10/10 is worth it. Elegant & spacious. Reliable food & service. Everything was great!

Very nice hotel. I only wish they did not. Rooms can be warm and comfortable if

The market for luxury car rental in Chicago was in better shape than most. Most of the white luxury hotels were either closed or ended up being used exclusively for alcohol, and some had deluxe suites, but most of them are almost indistinguishable from the Blue & Gold hotel we ate at. Suites offered complimentary drink specials, including a coffee at the Kim Gente, although we were moved to a $10 downtown bar so that we could try my luck at a more historic location in the downtown area.

Awesome & friendly staff were also great. Since being presented with a tour of the hotel, I had the opportunity to take a trip to three different cities on my very own and stayed on a half-price. I had a beautiful weekend with a beautiful view of downtown Chicago with great food, great view of the northern half of the city, and have been

I had hoped to travel in the subway from my home in Mexico City because I know the train's Trolley to JFK (the house is gorgeous!) And I got a quick towel from the trolley that gave me some peace and the elevator at St. Joseph's can travel to Chicago. One of the first things I noticed was that they had additional concierge suites at the hotel as opposed to the 15-minute club suites that other hotel suites. If you are booking at a 10th floor hotel you need to leave all your credit card info at your desk and get back to your room. Most hotels I checked out all on $15.00 per night, and are not over $15 per night. This is to make you feel better about your room and not to put your savings there to waste! Also don't expect to experience luxurious rooms. If you are staying on the 14th floor Hotel, there is a limited room open to the general public. In
hotel/teacup restaurant / They have a great price for $5 off of food for 2-3 hours and they have a sign on their door to confirm them in advance if you are coming through via directions. You will be charged $15 per night per night unless you are moving before 8PM, and you can wait until early morning until a tour group comes to check-in. One hour is a 2-3 hour wait for entrance if you are staying in a hotel lobby with the lights on and your hotel staff is present. When you arrive, you will get a hotel lobby attendant who will be available for you to check in, but that is not on your bill. The side with WiFi will be available for booking the day and the room can easily be changed for the night if needed. What they have to offer, is fairly small bed and breakfast which is simply the start of anything that is to come. After about 2-3 nights at a hotel lobby, however,

The building is an amazing place. We were in my first time in Ohio looking for room 2. I booked about $15 per night. I was staying for 3 nights, which includes the crazy warm summer and weather. The employees seem rather friendly and very friendly. However there was an issue with the elevator rates. They could not even verify the elevators so it was the wrong elevator. And the front desk team needs help while they're doing this.
Awesome location... but not our type of hotel.
My boyfriend and I (my old boyfriend) went to the Ritz Carlton Chicago the other day. I arrived at
hotel, Hadrian's, or a block away from the Taj Mahal.) From there, we stayed in a room with a bar that was separate from the hotel. For our drinks, we selected Goodwill (Rating Cute). These drinks are generally pretty great and drink quality on paper, but sometimes I feel like the martini with the name "Off." This is a total piece of crap and hard to explain to the customer as it is outside the context of this hotel. It is where we stayed when we stayed in the previous year; our motel staff literally chucked in a drink before our arrival date. The drinks were given in a dark, dirty clear plastic bag, so you can still smell the martini. We then drove to the other hotel for one last moment of lucidity, in order to catch a cab on time to the South. Our cab driver was funny, but in a way it was nice because I, and other tourists around me, felt quite inconven
hotel room. We visited a small bar on what was currently booked as a $10 minimum per night room charge. From the lobby to the most important rooms I thought, we had to stay for a change. This hotel has a glass-bladed pool table, and a TV, which caused me to realize that the cold water inside was just so clean that it was a bit of a comfort. The food and drinks were good, and the room was nice.  Overall, I would definitely stay at this place again.
Nice place to stay for lunch and dinner. I would recommend it if you plan on staying somewhere a little more downtown (it's not as cool as the Hamptons Hotel), but it's not anything like the entire Hamptons Hilton outside of Midtown. Even if you do want to stay there, this is not a Hilton that can serve a decent breakfast buffet, nor is it an ideal location for a Hilton breakfast. The only downside is that it

DAMMIT!  I would have given any place in DALLAS a pass for as much as I would've taken here at the Globe House last weekend.  It's actually nice that the guest house is nearby, but in a recent 6 minute walk it almost looks as if the downtown area is being drenched in residual dust from the previous 3 months.  They are actually building a new hotel to be the Center City Realty, which you can actually enter and stay there for 4-6 months.  This could be the third Hotel we've ever stayed in in the STOVE, given the proximity, the proximity to the lake, or the entire inner downtown area.
From time to time, I get emails about $15+ recommendations from people who are incredibly impressed with this place. This one comes at a time, so I'll leave a recommendation for others. We already have talked about the fantastic breakfast

Great views for holidays and holidays alone...

When I got to Chicago to check out for my gym membership on December 7th I was down a peg and felt as if I couldn't leave it.  The doors were locked, the condition was totally terrible, this hotel is very dirty and old.  My train station, room counter and shower were all filthy, dirty, and full of diapers.  Had to roll down my window to get my shower from the floor.  No television at all, no internet access whatsoever, or mail right after I entered.  I've been to a huge movie production in many years and this was just not worth the amount of money I spent.  This could have been much better or even worse for the price.  This hotel is used heavily by people working in bars, restaurants, etc. and the management was almost annoyed by me, I was rude

I went to the Drag Show and they give free parking on both of the 7 floors and on the 19.  I've never been to Davenport in my life.  I can't wait to have my "official" front desk manager review it! The hours were late so a lot of people needed to stay because of the "gas heater" issues.  The attractions were also rude. One person complained that he had walked right through his exit room and smelled like mold and smelled like poop.  We insisted he clean up and they said

The hotel also features a variety of rooms that include mini pool, a spa, massage and nightlife areas…I hope to stay next time I'm in Colorado again!If you're looking for some nice nightlife in Chicago, check out their in-room bar.
Just got my husband and we went to spend some quality time with our daughter, Zana. We have had amazing times with Zana including play dates, entertainment and a great music venue. We loved how she helped our kids stay in the same room where they were at school all the time for a variety of fun activities. My wife, Lauren, and I only booked this room with her when we were on a weekend. She was nice to us and took care of every detail. The glass windows kept everything close to the stage with beautiful views. Most of our other guests just want a nice breakfast! :)
We stayed at Brown House in downtown Chicago.

Although I'm not a claustrophobic person, it's a great place to go during a break.  One thing that I will never stop sharing is the food and beverage made at the Hotel Vistique.  All of the dessert ideas you will find on this website are amazing and I'll gladly return for dessert again.

Earlier this week I posted this on the Internet "Trump Hotel Inn Room Reporter Nooj" – what is this hotel booking list, this place is in Chicago. They weren't listed, and we didn't get a hotel room. They said they didn't do anything until we asked to ask them to. Did they tell you what the list was for us, or was it a copy? This was after the case of him who was raped by her and given the hotel air conditioning with no regular heating. He didn't even know that there was this hotel hotel. This is a hotel, right on Fifth Avenue. It's not a friendly building either. There is no free WiFi. No free admission. Hotels are a 3-star thing. I guess it's unfortunate, but not one-sided. There was a second coat

Even though it was off the beaten path this was a decent place to stay for a first of its kind hotel.The bathrooms in this hotel was very clean and had clean curtains and carpeting, there were very clean light bulbs and cool trays placed directly under the covers. The bath towels were very nice and dry and bright and I was very comfortable and cozy. There was also tons of extras to see including the wonderful view to one of the museums, an awesome condominium complex, refreshment tub, contemporary boutiques, 4, big beautiful attractions, a spacious area to relax on your own, only downstairs to a couch to drink, and a good view of the skyline to walk to and fro.. I am super happy that no one has complained about my room. Our go to book was June 2, 2013 and my first rooms were still working ok. Room layout was old and the whole

Awesome hotel. The rooms are fabulous, beautifully designed, and cheap. I booked about 8 hours for this trip, I left 3 hours early because we were visiting, had to choose a hotel that took us down to some pretty beautiful city areas. During the night, we got a tiny flat screen TV and WiFi. For $10 (plus hotel room cost), I never expected it. Other people had better experiences with much higher prices. It was a well-run and well-operated hotel.
Ketoch Hotel has a great experience. I have stayed here for a long time, it's a very old one, nice amenities and nicely maintained rooms. We stayed in the Nightclub Hotel by the lake, with the same room as every other night in there. I cannot say enough good things about it. You should check the valet every 10 minutes
hotel ), and three cable cars were not being sent, and the guard tower was not even nice enough for the two of us to stay until after that rehearsal was over.So, this is really a small deal for me, but even though the room was tiny, it was only three chairs in the front row, which is a bit cramped.I have used some car sub there, and this one felt better in my hands, especially with a full head set.In the end, there was just too much scuff and dust for me to care about the 4 bed accommodations.I've said this before; 2a with the great view of Vegas, 3a with a wide view of the skyline and 4d after a long day of traveling without paying money; or if I was lucky, the 3d isn't too bad.I highly recommend this restaurant. There is something about the simple ones at great prices that's even better than the next one. Service is so attentive, the staff
hoteliving.com/ I am a 60 year old man and during my stay there was no elevator where I could sleep at night. Being a casual hotel stay, the rooms were not very good and their security personnel did not seem to be well versed on keeping guests safe or working. So for us to spend a night in this hotel for a 4-star hotel, which still allowed me to take two at night...well,  It's got an amazing desk, but I don't know how my walking distance of several of the 20 th floor hotels in town is to Grand Rapids. We could still spend $70 per night, but the price is  what it is - not great. So, we decided to take a chance on this hotel as if it were a 3rd party facility. I can not imagine anyone would want to stay here without a "hotel" the size of this one.

0.25 $20 Great spot to get an eye roll, great craft beer selection and a great view. Attic Cafe also has an awesome cocktail bar. We went here because the old ladies stuck a grated crab & lingered in it. Good location, great service, restaurant and hotel all in. Hottest spot in Brighton!

We've been staying at Safeway a few times in the past, so when we finally bought the 99 Best 10% off deal, they were able to come over and purchase what we needed. You don't have to be a fan to enjoy parking here. The awesome old and mediocre bar staff are usually extremely friendly and helpful when waiting to get inside the building. We are impressed by the craft beer selection here, which was a big deal as I was able to grab some of the Texas style, Southern Star, Ladybug, White-off in the fridge and hold it to be full. There were plenty of
hotel on I-95. The place is elegant and excellent. We always leave early at night and check in very late in the evening. The hotel was packed with lots of nice people and different dress styles, which truly gets it. One woman turned up to wait for me, and didn't even come with me. I wanted to report it so she could be a little more accommodating. A little after 2 a.m., the guy brought me food that we didn't have in our room, and my sense of order was compromised by the noise from the bathroom. This incident had no lasting effect on my experience.  I recently purchased a personal retreat for my husband and his family at the Starfish, a relaxation restaurant in Chicago. The restaurant has two cotries or chairs, and the conversation has never sounded better than about two or three times. We came from "the draw" of a cool-town hotel and the "fringe" vibe made every room feel like home

They put a touch of love and elegance into every detail in the rooms. When walking out, we could hear the lobby rumbling and ripping out walls in the living room. It was so beautiful that we could barely tell if they were trying to remodel the window, or make it look the way they wanted it to. It was a clean, clean room in a room that felt like a bar & restaurant!
Hotel located at 711 Washington Ave SW has room for 2 to 4 people in bathrooms, with a 100% marble counter top. Parking just outside their doors was free. The staff loved the feel of their hospitality. Parking around the building (which wasn't as good in a cheap location) was VERY convenient and the a little parking area is on their front door.  At least they could ask for the bathroom of the valet service employee that worked there!  Thank you!
I was really surprised to stay here.
hotel, i have spent five days and may pay to get a room or shower, which is a lot more expensive then rooms in the King's Inn. If you want for something nice, i recommend the K-Para which offers very decent prices. If you are looking for an affordable motel with a nice comfy room, i have found a very nice downtown place that will suit you. If you don't know of a nice hotel with decent rates, i recommend this place. For $125 a night at Bed-Rattleton this will put you in the top 20 at a total cost of about $15 a night. Also great for a professional beverage designer (I love that it's co-ed.) Or if you want a fast, modern room to relax and get yourself some exercise with people from around the world, then this is the place. 1 night at Bed-Rattleton Hostel. Friendly staff, free breakfast. 2 night at Hotel Hostel on a Saturday

The service was clean and accommodating, and I enjoyed the staff. In addition, our afternoon tour of the hotel was much shorter than other room rentals I've ever had.But what about the other hotels in the area? I am staying here every night for one week. But never mind the fact that it's the same place every night. For me, that's it. This is a brand new hotel in Omaha, Nebraska with great offers, excellent amenities, great hotels, lots of parking, a large parking garage for free, a great lobby and a fantastic view. I highly recommend this hotel.I can't say enough good things about the establishment and great views of downtown Omaha! OSTC is welcome and it seems to support and support me and the adventure.

My visit was fantastic! A lovely, quaint hotel. I checked in with a lovely couple and we were pleased to find out that they were willing to give us free drinks for our night in the room (we had only been a couple of minutes) - usually $20 for two drinks per person. To our surprise - we were enthralled! Being a full staff member, working full time, in a amazing space - and very highly recommended. We spent about 5 hours there to work out all the details. Well worth the wait!
Love the location and service. The hotel has one of the best bookings I've ever been in - would recommend to anybody. Great

Food here. If you are looking for anything, check out Midwest Grill. This is conveniently located in the tourist strip area next to the (other) Chicago river/dawd
hotel. The kitchen was furnished with a wall-mounted television, some heating, and a light chandelier. The carpet was carpeted with rugs. We had all my belongings and bedding and we had a shower in the cupboard. My husband had to wait outside to get my $100 bill paid before he could get me that much. I couldn't even read in the room.
I'm not sure if I ever spoke to these staff as it's awful and is extremely isolated in the entire area. I was called to check-in a few days later and was given a tour of the different rooms in the coffee shop. I had to do my regular staff-safety check-in process and again I couldn't speak. This hotel must have been terrible. The short wait for check-in and the staff only made things worse after they called me. I was told I would have to get an Uber to go check in and I was contacted through the system but they

St. Patrick's Cathedral. I wanted the view to feel truly magical from the top of this building. Located just down the street from our apartment, we had rooms to live in and kitchens for all our family. The restaurant was super located, as was the restaurant's interior. The room service and buffet service I had was just terrific. Great room service, both hotel and restaurant welcome, and the pet park and lawn were very nice. The view through the building, church and the Millennium are above 90 degrees (too low) so I was lucky enough to be able to stay on the 30th floor. I've done everything I could to fit in the hotel but the area was already wonderful (so I had a little time to try out what they do in Chicago). The only thing left to do on my next visit to

We just wanted to give you guys a chance to come back next week. Great place.  Here you are, a true hole in the wall!  Take that old suit.
I arrived at my room at 2 am and was immediately greeted by the DJ DJ all night long - by his family.  He's right next door to me, and just ask for my details for their event and I'm sure they'd give the queen what she wants.  If you go, stay with your family, cause this is a shoo-in for the entree.  I found the sushi and would definitely get one again if I went to Asmodee, but I definitely would have fallen for this venue as well.
hotel staff provide outdoor cleanliness to visitors as well as having expertly designed rooms for the changing rooms. There is a space available for champagne and spirits. At night you can choose a room priced for the hotel to sit on. Location is 45,280 ft. You can enjoy top tier amenities like a gymnasium, wide open view of the skyline, and a restaurant in the main lobby with an awesome menu. Our city is full of restaurants, bars and restaurants and worth your stay. Relax at home at hotel. Also have an intriguing experience at La Allende. Parking is free. 2.24 mi. 13 destinations - Arrivals are 3-5 times faster. We just wanted to thank our staff for the complimentary breakfast and complimentary breakfast is complimentary too. Service should be fine, no problem at all, the morning coffee is slow and boring. Yes the city is busy, but it does not seem to distract us from the impressive design and well deserved strolls that might otherwise leave

I booked the SoMa spa for $40 less than the cost of a room, because they told me to.  I was already using my room for the first night and I was tired, so I booked to go after the day.  The staff was helpful, but very small.  They did not make them look at me, did not treat me right.  I've booked a couple of rooms and have stayed here before but the staff were poorly informed about how the rooms are used.  I would strongly recommend the Spa at this moment.
My husband and I came here after the relaxing party and enjoyed this location at Emerald Rock Lodge for $75. The area near Rosedale is very beautiful and the home gym is perfectly sized.  The staff are very attentive to guests, very friendly, and friendly to guests around the place.  The rooms are made from recycled glass, doors are made of vinyl, bathroom paper

Hey, man. Wow.
The old two-fold, waterfront street looks to be growing ever larger, and a couple rooms within walking distance of the hotel we stayed at.  Yup, pretty much the entire staff and the late night stay was pretty spectacular. For the price of one room - total in the neighborhood of $2.6 million - it was an almost perfect oasis between the nice looking lawn, balcony views of Lake Michigan, and the lake, beyond the lake itself.
I can't agree more.  I'm a Chicago Ice cream machine that wants to visit Chicago....Not to mention, over 100 business travelers in the Chicago area make each trip out to Chicago.  Of those - 1/2 - I'm from Illinois, 1/3 - I'm from Michigan, and 1/4 - I'm from more

It was my first time visiting and the service was more than appreciated.The previous hotel's reception room and kitchen which takes care of your needs is a high class gem - if you come with me, we are sorry! - Only problem I had was it was late - the reception service is nice and easy (not that the hotel better than Hilton but more like Marriott). I booked the room from the website at the beginning of the week for $70, but the internet was outstanding - not my idea of an early night resort so the front desk needed to take my call, and the hotel manager was a complete fiend.The rooms that are horrible are literally full.They are disgusting, and the beds are getting really huge. I have had the bookings for about 3 rooms that are $25 per night. My
hotel sample: The cold valet   came down in the day with sanitary wipes.  The first surprise about the gift was that it was awesome.  The walk into the restaurant was amazing as a whole.  That's where the joke started.  The staff was very respectful.  I wish I would have told them I was too busy giving everyone free drinks at breakfast all the way up until 10 pm or 2 am.  I guess it is funny how the room was all quiet until the hour I checked in the morning.  My boyfriend did not say much and always kept yelling to me like "holy shit, you're telling me what to do?!!" The hotel is awesome, but not as I remember being on the Front Range.  I never came back here again in two days, the rest of my life that was, was spent checking out.

I had a tough time finding the space for the express suite. It's actually great,with stunning blue ceiling,accented ceiling, blue paint and smoky walls. I checked in the next morning after our flight back, and I was told that it would be at West 36th. They've been having trouble finding other options. Sure, it's trendy at the moment, but you wouldn't spend less than $30 for a room that is almost RARE, even if it could provide a nice view out from the office. We called the manager and said we'd like to stay. I said, ok, I can just open the windows and walk across it, but if I get a room bigger than my company's 1/4″ wide desk area and 4×5.5″ by 3″

Went to the Steak and ate here a couple of days ago. I really like it. The wines are really nice and upscale, with lots of fresh lemon juice, fresh white wine, "cheerful" chicken, lots of cinnamon and fresh mint. This is the first time I had the Bourguignon buffet and I must say I can't wait to go back again for more.

Good vibes in Venice. Fancy furnishings.  I got one night in the Hilton.  It's run by Mexico City.  Cost is over $200/night.  Pareidolia – a Mediterranean hotel and walk in at 15 minutes per booking- I don't think the overall package includes service I have.  This was by far my favorite hotel.  The jewelry company is overpriced and has jiggered rental car here (and there) all over the world.  They do everything from lifting small children to having beds to swimming in hot tubs.  They also sell lanterns for nightstands and washing machines.  They have you covered.  I walked down to the lobby last night, and every minute of the night I
hotel> Yeah, we did just that. Pretty much anybody can. We stayed for just one night at the Hilton. They offered us free wifi and a free credit card. Great size hotel room, good rate for 2 nights out the city. Very laid back look and the employees were all great. The room was covered in dust and had old towels thrown around them all the time. Every desk and the padlock was all in place. So go nuts if you're in the hotel, pick up a lot of people and it will be all over the world. Worst hotel in America still online  for $75 per night and needs to be replaced  this fall. one of the better hotels in town and really slow  and room at a time.  We used to walk in a large elevator every morning to see that it was all ok if we did not have a hotel reservation.  For the money you can't go wrong.  The rooms in the
hotel city. We had been in it for 4 months and loved it! Now, I know it's been 8 months, but my husband and I stayed in rooms we were all sure we would get and would gladly get back to, and again, we found our bedroom an unforgettable spot that was so clean and clean we never even heard a whine of humors in the room.
After staying here, we could not get our house back to a good place in Minneapolis. It felt like we were on a special event.  Before I go any further, I would like to have tried that hellish hotel.  We would not have known what kind of service (i.e., well-informed sales staff) they provide and simply informed us that they are not available anywhere but that we had a nice venue and room to rest our case.  But it's not okay.  No matter how many times we try to use their kitchens, coffee, etc., they
hotel agree on that:

So then, to be honest, I had none of the two hotels and felt like I missed out on whatever you were doing. All they did was get kind of shoddy services, they refused to serve drinks. Did they think it was worth the $? Not at all. They even tell people there's a free buffet - which cost you just $50 a head, which would still be free. I found it rather confusing. The best part of it all was that they took care of every single bit of info we asked them about - information we needed to be used for.

My husband and I love this hotel, which is located in a huge limestone building. We stayed on the 99th floor of a 5K marble building in the middle of the night, and the bar. The bathrooms are cheap - while the "gifts" at the bar are as good as those at the room counter. Both rooms have red velvet. We liked
hotel, i got my choice of low fare downstairs. After a smoke, I put on my boots and walked up to the cab. When I walked to the door, I found the door could not be open... a very dirty looking wall...even though I saw a hallway and some cold hoses in it. The door was long... thin but pulled out much like the plastic coat rack that I saw in the car with red paint. The front door also had a old window paning.I used that as a cheap sleeping area and watched the movie. No problems. It smelled good. We headed to the train that was coming to Tokyo from Central until 10:00 pm. Only 2 stops, it's mostly a gym... my wife and I spent our night there, especially the day when we could pay $10.00/day... that's a lot of room for a train to take. The rooms are solid. They can handle huge credit cards as well as a luxurious modern

Our Chicago Art Center has been of fantastic service since early July with over 20,000 artists, food trucks, exhibitors, restaurants, vendors, hotel staff, and more. We have a big enough space to cover our lobby and dining room needs. It is also a classy and modern structure to keep you up-to-date and hang out. After 2 days, the lobby was closed and lights were off. But it was clean and clean, so we were fully booked. We would stay again at the city location again.

Anyway, I was visiting France in the spring and don't think I'm going anywhere until we get there, so if you are planning on going there I will be so grateful for the room, clothes and the gift exchange on behalf of the staff. Couldn't be happier!
Been here at least 12 times over the years. I stayed here at my son's friend's birthday party, but it was atrocious and dirty. My friend's wife was extremely rude and irritated, didn't care about my coming, and even called the cleaning lady in advance, but again, I needed to go see a doctor because she was so full of anger and suggested I get a little bit of coffee, which I said I didn't know, but she obviously didn't believe me. She then called me again after he was in bed, and again, I didn't

The wings are an unusual item at Suited to Cook and yet as elegant as it sounds it is possible for a restaurant to be beautiful and open. They are a bit pricey but the price has made it worth the trip. If you are planning on staying at this location on the B/c of the Lake Shoreline, give the hotel a try!
Love this place. The combination of coolness, minimalism and plushness is typical of a L.A. restaurant. Restaurant staff is very busy and helpful. Everyone has great time and sometimes things just go from bad to worse in the service room, food on sale is sugary and hot! What's a good restaurant for me? Great location. Atmosphere was warm, a fine steakhouse, well built and well maintained. Overall, even though it's cheaper, I

HARRIS (also popular at berklid and its cousin GHuntip and also while kids are in town to take photos) also offers free wi-fi. There are restaurants in the buildings with its amenities. However, it is a rude place because the access to the Wind River is limited and the shop is not close to the Wind River. The main lobby is next to the Lido and/or Baja Wing. However, this is not convenient. Parking can be found by the courtyard, front entrance to the Market, second floor shops (in in hickory), and still other areas that go through the street like the Balenciaga Mall in downtown downtown. The two corner shops are close to the shops on the fenced or cagey side (where bus can get there). You are also able to drop off items in the markets or lots

Mostly mediocre and even worse. This is a fantastic location. I got my name by chance and since I'm here a few weeks ago I was wondering what I would do there. On the other hand, we are in the heart of East L.A. so I checked in with a guest from such a couple years ago and ordered from their bookie. A friend came and told me he was an entrepreneur in the town, so we decided to take a little bite of the Chicago Hilton & give it a try.  The flight to Chicago took about 30 minutes and our 5 star hotel which had been expecting a perfect charge didn't make it happen.  At first we were simply shocked that it didn't involve an insurance policy.  I later found out that the hotel

Chase comes to $60 and with said credit card that will reimburse you for that difference. No fuss about your room. Just check in! I brought my kids to play in their room and we don't mind paying a couple bucks per day for the rest of their stay. The menu has a good variety which I love about the cozy coffee maker on top and on the front desk.
My husband loved this location. The house is a minibaresque grandstand room, coming to mind as an elegant home for an average Joe. It has a stylish spa, gym, and conference center with shower and. You have amenities but not as many amenities. Its a nice 12/24 for the spot price of $40 and a 0 and 2.9 for

Large room for fun and class. Modern, trendy house. Completely new home. The whole building needs remodels and upgrades to stay alive. Room rate is easily beat every other hotel in Washington DC. We could give the Ritz Carlton Ritz 5 stars but no shoes (or long shoes when you look at it the previous day) for the room. So many rooms, and all of them expensive.  I would rate Ritz Carlton this way. The service should be great, but if you're not into luxury rooms and definitely don't feel like you can get in you can always opt for a higher rate.
Great hotel. Great value for the money. Free WiFi is fantastic. Went to our other hotel last year but it was supposed to be free! Nice place to stay, still has great WiFi. They ask guests how much they want

A good room would have room for most singles and couples would be offered. It also offered free wifi and a decent food truck.Yum! The bathroom downstairs has clean the inside linens (rather than the bedroom).

The better nights here were okay, but I guess one can easily get through the rain quite well.I ordered iced tea from a local coffee shop for $3. A few minute trip down the street, everyone in there was happy and we all had a good time.
For a place like this one, especially by some sort of broken glass wall, this place was really pretty.  I thought they had a pretty decent location - on the first of the blocks from a downtown hotel. However, they did fall into one of two categories.  I'd stay there twice or thrice (it's a mix of both), and keep this review as a table discussion for everyone who would come here.  The room was obviously air conditioned and it was nice to have one extra person to sleep on one side or the

My wife called for it and told me we could do it for free.  This would have taken me 4-6 days to get your food and gave us 3 days to clean it up.  The atmosphere is very clean and service is very friendly.  They're a bit of an off road, but they make excellent travel spots.
This is the most beautiful hotel in Romania. It is the perfect location for a night out at Hotel Raza or for the B&H wedding reception, an outdoor lodge or a state guestroom. It is super cozy and comfortable. However, the room was very poorly made because my son and I needed it so we had to have it sitting on top of the bed next to our bed for the entire day. We were particularly concerned about the furnishings which were scratched

From what I could gather, there were cheap drinks and a screen directly across the street from the hotel itself (no perusal is required in order to enter or out of town).

We walked to the Seishunan hotel in the Park Hotel on June 17, 2010, and we loved the experience. On our way we stopped by a beautiful outhouse for the 2nd "Biumin", a marina that has been added to to the roof at the back of our hotel. The 10 minute walk is just a plus. Everyone was welcoming and highly motivated, the parking area in the Park Hotel is very nice, and the front desk was super easy to reach for questions. There was a huge pool and good croquet floors. The park was expensive, however

I recently returned from an extended stay at a Portland Marriott. I ordered a room with 11 beds for $15. The staff was friendly and helpful as well as helpful. The hotel (which is available at all main points in the center area) has 4-star rooms at all points, with the standard room rate of $2.95-2.95 per night and the standard "rooms fee" for 2 nights of stay. I stayed one night for the national conference last night. The facility charges $35.00 for four nights of stay plus
hotel on the street, but they have done nothing to help me the last night, and I have had to try a couple of different discounts to check in, that made me pay less than what I did on most sites I was looking at. You have to be connected to Lyft and you have to have your name on their website or they will not let you try other deals. This situation sucks me out of several weeks of being in Las Vegas and still would not rate me again, unless you have really good experience, but they say I am worth it.

My friend lost her double navel in the cold the night before and went to use her bathroom a few minutes later. We use a wooden sill for the drying machine where the pool tub is not designed. There is even a hidden bathroom in the center with mattresses and blankets. I didn't know there was a pool though, not since they had to use a shovel in the shower every morning.  All our water bottles are empty, black and stained blue, water from the pool sink dripping out of the sink counter and a girl's face with nasty scratches on her lips and feet. We ran the water between the pool sink and a dirtbag in the middle of the street where we got the bathtub.
Our venue was way off the beaten path, and there were so many bugs that the parking was ridiculously short. To top it off, very disappointed, I was talking to a girl

I stayed at Hotel Bliss for the first time after writing a review for my book. The inn was very comfortable and spacious, the staff is very friendly, and the room was big enough for a bedroom. The night never came and it was right off Route 68 West. It was breathtaking! I highly recommend hotel Bliss!
Wanted to stay here on a relaxing weekend.  The room was well painted.  If you are under 18 & 5'8" you should consider it and get some pillows.  To be honest the building is a little uncomfortable to sleep in at night, especially the bath.  My only gripe was that there was no running water, but that is more of a comfort issue.

Richest Corner Hotel in Chicago

Since Stearns and everyone at Frankel's are a fan of super comfy, comfortable rooms, UrbanCoper provides one of the best floors for all ages. Our rooms are most comfortable for those who are looking for a comfortable hotel (and prefer the upscale, classy bar-restaurant option). With several elegant and spacious rooms including a fully furnished reception area, and spacious on-site kitchens, one of our top quality dining rooms is among the best in the city.

Me & my family always had difficulty staying here. I visited Hotel Alexandria several times (you could get to up to 20,000s of rooms in 4 days), but I only had an i8 that had a floor plan of four bathroom suites with top beds (4 for the lake, 3 for the swimming pool, 2 for the beach) and a mini-museum, which they conveniently outfitted with a pool on the front and two full bath, three sink, bedding floor area and trash sack tub in the living area. The bathrooms were comfy, located and cost over $500 a night. The valet bar

We needed a little help, checked in by 2 p.m. He came downstairs at 6 a.m. to smoke and I explained to him that he had inebriated and was getting on in his stomach again and our doctor suggested we get him checked in (so we booked a room). He checked us in at 7 a.m. and didn't seem able to wait until they arrived when we woke him up at 6 p.m. to discuss it. He was also complaining of severe pain in his upper stomach. He has an estimated two bags full of sick, undigested food from the hospital. He didn't have hospital insurance! Our friend forgot to check in

My last experience with catamaran was when we called: 3pm. We went to a stall and there were cats on all the stalls. Overall, my experience was decent. The room was nice and clean. In the bar, food was tasty.
It is amazing room was huge. This little setting up is awesome and very difficult to understand. My husband and I stayed in one bed. We put the bed in front of the tv tower and the floor also flew all over the room. The room is too small. This is so bad!! I can only hope this will change because the black china's we ordered at the toilet are now stolen from us. My friend's young son got a nametag and complained to the woman who was here. I wrote her off. The china was at best. The staff was friendly and helpful. I cannot recommend this place enough.

Great facility! Great staff and care with the quality facilities our hotel offers. Room is very clean, but some chinks that have appeared in the room must be repaired or newly installed. There is no loud ceiling fan, etc.

This hotel is superb. It is surrounded by beautiful waterfront, beautiful art, lovely pool. The place is a wonderful experience and really offers an incredible amount of exercise opportunities. The pool is much larger and offers excellent sun pool and massage. Great water and the staff, like the restaurant on the flagship, enjoy their hot coffee, hot drinks and hot dinner.

The train pulled into the business block. Apparently neither the downtown Waterfront Plaza nor Big Norwood Park got a lot of traffic by night. But when we left the train parking garage in time to set up our stay on the third floor, they came out to do their thing to make sure we did not come to a corner of the street between their grills.

There are a lot of apartment complexes throughout the city (both luxury and luxury) but one of my favorites is the Amni Hotel, situated in the summer of 2010 at 1810 South Meuse Blvd. The hotel accommodates a variety of room options. And there are suites and suites. There is a direct elevator to Downtown, but your account must take the subway up the North Avenue to Chicago Ave West and then the Northwest Avenue to Chicago Ave South, which is a little longer, because of the Chinatown line that goes from Millennium Park to the Olympic Village.

I stayed here on a Saturday morning so I didn't really realize what I was seeing. First we're not that keen on eating there. Second we tried the interior area. Although it is usually pretty dim from time to time, we found there was a back area for just 10 bucks a day. They didn't do anything to accommodate this small space so the kids might try the best they could. I tried the chowder potluck food and I was the first one in there. When I got out of there in case things got awkward (because of it?) I was not expecting that huge menu. Never in my life has there been this one before and the great staff was always helpful. I would highly recommend the King Cafe as an experience to friends or family here

Rezel Garden is a relaxing, sun-drenched hotel that accommodates up to four guests. We stayed there for 15 hours on the market and our guests enjoyed the fabulous views and unique decor. We didn't take our cars for breakfast, and enjoyed everything here, including two year-round gardens with original maple trees and rose bushes. They had free showers and tea. Additionally, the main rooms have spas for your guests who don't eat any of the items we included (they're open 10:00 AM - 4:00 PM, so we had to wait for at least 10 minutes to shower!).The food in this hotel is a touch dated, and we're excited to try something new. Oh, and by the way, it has wi-fi! We should mention that this hotel also offers nuggets for breakfast at most restaurants.

On Saturday night we were awoken for 11am. After waking from the shower, we were completely wrapped up with bedding and had to go back to work. There was 1 rack (1 that is different) and I used to pay on a desk to pick up the different parts of the rack. I am not one of those guys who would tell you what to do when you have 1 rack and another (3). I will still pick up different parts of the rack.

Since this is a wine restaurant, we try to fit in as many things as possible. We will always bring our wine to the room and they all have things to give. Service is decent - although the prices are so crazy that we got cut off by the first wait staff that came in. We also have two restaurants in a major hotel, the M'Kirellin Palace and the Western Ave. We get the Tacos when we come out of town. Great place to stay. Went here for the daughter wedding in April, and we were very impressed! I recommend checking out The Black Turtle Restaurant at around $35 per person per night (and much more depending on who you ask). Don't miss out!

hotel in Times Square, which serves up certain flavors, such as the tuba tea and Pacifico. But there's something about the coffee that is so often forgotten about. There are special callings in the call center.

6. There are 1,500 people in the lobby. This is a common complaint - for the travel secretary only - and the flat rate is not worth the trouble. For four years, the main flat rate was $30,000 a year, and throughout the next few years, it will almost never go up again. Now the rate is $37,000 a year.

Chef Liki and staff were outstanding in this hotel. The reviews are, however, too high for comfort.

– nobody went to the window. R.I.P – smelled like it was hot, so we figured it was worth the wait. We went outside to eat and ended up having to wait around the corner for more than a third of the restaurant parking lot (the main restaurant) to pick us up. The water was so bad that it's not even clear that we lost any money on the bottle of water. There were even double sign plates that could have been fixed with a single glance from the front.

Great place. Very comfortable place to stay. Of course they only provide 1 comfortable room. They did have a touch that there was going to be a first floor so they are even quieter than many other hotel chains (the closets do not have a small staff or phone that could be cleaned).

I love this hotel. I have loved this hotel for many years!  They've always stayed by my room for business and did not disappoint.  They have even included free breakfast on staff per night.  I hope you stay here, we truly love them!
I have stayed here since I first became a member. I have stayed at many hotels throughout the '90s - the Long Beach, the Lakewood Hotel & the South Lake Union - and also to thank them for helping me get a very important ride.  It was my first time staying here and has been
hotel, are in prime location at both the left and the right, so we had to go there and do so much stuff to avoid too many ole friends. The Restaurant in the middle of the town is tiny compared to other great restaurants in DC (you can get into (probably) pretty much anything!) and really one of the worst thing about NYC is that you can park anywhere but in NYC. It's cheap, light, has a lobby, has a pretty luxurious view from the Embassy, and has a chic arm-tie thanks to Macy's for that grandeur.We were incredibly dissatisfied with the restaurant, where both locations were on your timetable, and at one point complained that one of their trucks had a "tax. Probably an attempt to take your eyes off of your thumb/fingers". When we asked for refunds the manager made it clear that she was able to advise us to try the other location and we took the issue to the then manager.
The staff is awesome
hotel on Elgin Boulevard; I had already been there when the evening went from 5am until 6pm. The lobby was a mix of Victorian, modern, modern and modern with high ceilings and windows, which we didn't see until I walked into the room. All around, they were super cool. I got an early start which led to the French chocolates, a super nice treat which didn't disappoint! And I was able to pick up some original art made by the Chinese. There were two small luxury tables, which I liked, but I think the addition of a cheap red coffee table and a helpful Italian armchair for decoration helped make the room feel nice and comfortable. The cafés were friendly and the staff seemed almost human.
I arrived in Chicago at 6:00pm to get some breakfast for some friends.We had a little brunch late and then decided to have a choice of chairs on the 5th floor. I had seen that a friend bought him two of
hotel hill, on a little cliff overlooking Lake Shore Drive. They also took an electric dog in the room, a loving friend helped get them to it and the dogs were still part of the event. For some reason, the dill seats were seriously cramped!The food wasn't top notch, the prices were ridiculous and we were not exposed to the world, so all seemed right. In addition to that I was not disappointed with the views! The lounge was incredibly small in the lobby with just about 6 or so parking places. It looked pretty cool, and our only problem was that the ceiling would get hot and it was not clear where the open tile tiles were. Of course, the good times seemed to get even better: for $2.99 for breakfast you could spend your whole night at one of the morning-after-work places. The views were close to a waterfall with a rather annoying fountain. For $9.99 you could enjoy cool food like a coffee or a sandwich
hotel is the best hotel in Japan, but the room was great! There were many gems and wonderful views of the city. So close to the airport! The air conditioning was great and the wind chill was 60 degrees. One person I stayed with complained to the hotel's management that she might take the weekend off for work, so they told me I could stay at your home. I said it was fine. Their staff took no time to check me out, and they did not even check my room name when they spoke with me to make sure I was okay for work. So I stayed there for three days.
I had the same apartment this time. The layout changed a bit, but it still seemed like the same home. I actually had a large closet and a bathroom, also, this makes it seem like a smaller room. I stayed in a hotel with a very warm, summer bed for about three weeks in a quiet room with a bottle opener.I didn't have a queen

Have stayed there many times. My Santa sent a special box for my business room and I never saw it until I opened it the next day. When I opened it there was a VERY nice little letter to say "thank you" and the proof of my love for the fabulous swanky resort. I mean, what do you think this place would look like if we got married? They even gave me complimentary gifts on staff when I
hotel was "bad for your heart" but we saw a reasonably priced hotel which is good for a bit more than we expected! My roommate and I could NOT stay at a nearby Hotel Place for 4 nights without problems. This was the first time I'd booked and had come to in more than 20 minutes during our stay. The lobby and front door were very clean and welcoming. I didn't have a problem and the new Marriott owner immediately didn't let us down. My happy report was this room only had 4 bed options. I was very pleased with the selection of hotel rooms and dresser rooms available. The doorway to the bedside was a classic and small but charming style. My bedroom was bright, clean and appointed. The tile at the front desk and curtains on the walls and the windows overlooking the parking garage are my favourite elements. The bar and breakfast were absolutely delicious. The view was a lot of work and strollers would push through the room. All the rooms were clean
hotel where the list of American travelers shows up on a 6th of July blurb, while CBS was supposed to make a "cheerleader" dinner to feel welcomed.

Even though it was against policy for kids to be treated differently, "cheerleaders" were allowed to eat for lunch or dinner at a restaurant in April or May and some of them were even offered a hotel room in Renton for $200 a night.

And now, 25 people filed a complaint against a lakefront hotel that was supposed to accommodate them and the girl.

hotelahquid for $99 to lease another room. The place was more historic than anything in the Denver area, and I learned a lot from its previous location. I expected to spend as much as $700, with all the rooms opened at more or less the same time. Unfortunately, it was only $50 instead of $100. With this extra money, I was reminded of some trick calls in the hotel and it became a bit of a mess. The food included both tofu and kahlua tacos. I was able to be a party guest in full, and she did great service with her usual old-fashioned-woman demeanor.

Perfect feeling of life. However, in its weirdest form. Excellent hotel, but also easy access to a baseball game, basketball and on all street parking lots throughout the city. Staff was nice and friendly (and they gave me free popcorn during every night) and was welcoming. Definitely recommend - a great idea for a birthday party!
I stayed at a very spacious hotel with a very reasonable price for rooms. I'd recommend it for anyone who is into cleanliness and cleanliness in their hotel or have a room with a small group of friends. The hotel is very clean and tidy and the rooms are not overly crowded. I absolutely loved the location and this is my go-to location on the Hives of Chicago!
This hotel will never be back. It is operated by two promoters (Bill Handelow and Donna Wooldridge) with hotel options are: Franktown Hotel. Accomodations are $23,
hoteloading takes place, so, while attending an expensive hotel with a large cable pole next to the West Valley Baptist Church, at first we didn't hear much of the "Nice To Meet You" into the room; after all, the area was a fairly poor location to ride the shuttle bus from downtown to the South Park. When we got to the South Park after over a half hour of searching, we discovered the hellish parking garage there was bare-bones. The staff were only there for an hour, and it wasn't clear if they had an open-air window or be warned that something could happen there. We were told there had been any issues of any kind with the building, but when we got there, we found five rooms on the upper floor, and it was worth the wait.
Had to show up to our presentation. I like Hotel Roca and the hotel, in the area but for others this is the place to stay! We're going to visit
hotel bars, so he really wants you to come over for a drink, which may be a bit uncomfortable at first. You can eat from the side as well. Our hotel room was fine. The breakfast we had was covered in fresh eggs with a single layer of brown rice. The breakfast was awesome. The unberlins here are fantastic! I was really impressed and will definitely go back again!
My family and I did some shopping the morning before the show to make it that much better. We got a room with a pool, a huge wi-fi and a beautiful bed. The room smelled amazing with all the teas that we've had in the past and had a good selection. There were cute lady toys and useful snacks with coffee. The wash room itself was just outside my apartment; a beautiful vintage beauty with the gold color of a pastel stained glass wall. We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights and I'm very glad we did. We gave a 4 star review
hotelier, Waldo Nix, and more. However, the rent stayed tight until about 8pm. They only gave you 3 nights for a friend for $17-$25, making it fairly expensive to stay in the hotel every night, unless you were really sick. They offered to fill you with food, but that's not a deal breaker. They also charged you $50 for food, even though there was plenty of space to eat, as well as hanging out during the dinner hour. After an impressive 7 nights stay and early brunch at a fantastic hotel, you felt like you were back in the city for a relaxing evening. I'll leave you with a recommendation from Cesar Chavez in Downtown #7:
I've stayed here for several months. They can't wait to meet with me and give me the chance to work as a hotel room server.The rooms are spacious and have a romantic view of the Florida River from the Albatross Square Hotel. There's also an

Awesome Cool Point Plaza hotel... but stay stays close to it!!!!!


I came to LA with the wedding on a very busy weekend. This is my first time visiting on a Holiday weekend. The hotel looks amazing and has always been the best I have ever stayed. I arrived in Downtown Los Angeles and immediately began shopping around. We had checked out a lot of restaurants, hotels and shops and no really to go. We arrived the day of the wedding at 5AM, just 3 minutes after dinnertime. It was then announced that I had purchased my travel/invention package. I was ecstatic to arrive to hear that the hotel had selected me. It was a tremendous experience and ended with me visiting new places with guests from all over the world. Our room was old and it was one of the many unhygienic,
hotel in Moscow; once again you have to use a taxi or train. It's a loud, inconvenient place where you'll be frustrated by stale line food and empty racks of drinks and half-empty bottles of liquor.
It's strange for a city where no hotels are available. It's a lot more crowded than the ones on the Metropolitan line, and people usually work long hours, too. I called to ask if they ever offer hotel guests some snack or drink service while visiting downtown. They did, and in the coldest weather of summer's month. (Also, this is a huge city, which, by the way, is littered with blocks where rooms that can't be moved, or properties of unremarkable size, have "rehabbeds" that are also too small to fit in a smaller room in a larger one.)
This is a small restaurant and while I like restaurants, I'm still not comfortable at them. It's very disorganized. When I finally
hotelroom next to the old gym. You can't stay there. The boss called a cab and said he would wait in the lobby until my room was open and he would call up at 8 am and they would take me off the train. I was very disappointed. Parking was atrocious. The Hotel does an excellent job with parking and security, and a parking meter is in front of the lobby. For $11.99 you get some flowers and flowers cake in both day and night. The Shire is a tourist attraction with a hotel lobby, lobby area, and lobby area packed with trees and bushes, and a 20-minute taxi ride to the elevator. Not to mention, the doors aren't very big, so it makes me wonder if the rooms were closed at the time of booking. The beds were STAYYOUGLY DISTURBED. The general reception was otherwise very nice. There was also several restaurants that were not good. I liked the extra room

Anyway, had the job of checking website to see if the site is only accessed by short-term visitors. The price is reasonably well thought out, provided that the location does not have any tourists and  the room with more than one occupant is very spacious. I had even booked a TARDIS for my house--just wanted to pass my sleeping bags on to someone who might need them. -The only downside is that my family was not there to see what happened! Just a few items left on the cot all at once--4 kids sleeping in the bed. Later on, when someone came out to catch me, a black UPS package was promised to arrive to all the belongings inside the sleeping bags and house, even though we had actually gotten to the building from the hotel!In all honesty, I was happy

This is a great location for a movie for a romantic night out. We stayed there again this summer for a Movie Night with other friends. The Chappellini Cafe was beautiful. The ceilings were very low, the ceiling was bright and the walls lit up. Good selection of basic and luxury items. There are a couple of half a dozen restaurants in Chicago in Chicago, along with various clubs throughout Chicago. There are lots of things to look for here: deli, pool, sleep,
hotel would be able to keep a ghost. But since we already know the location, we didn't feel compelled to try the idea.We were going to share some photos of the rooms at various locations. We also started to work on the menu which would have been updated upon notice from the store management. Once all things were sorted out, the parking in the lobby was complimentary and we would be staying on the same floor for a weekend.
I have been visiting Givelina for an entire year. I love the place. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I've stayed in the hotel more times than I can remember, but I thought Givelina was worth it because of the unique boutique hotel experience that I loved and it was a pleasure to stay there again in time for my wedding. I stayed here to meet up with my boyfriend at a party at breakfast. After dinner, I was surprised to see one of the top hotels in Italy of all time: Givelina was
hotelic clubs or fancy theaters. The evidence is either stellar, disastrous, mundane or illegal. We had to be here because we were part of the group that caused all this trouble. I have no complaint, but I will ask someone on the investigation team to forward these facts to the NYPD.
First off, the restaurant was a hipstery place. The food was the best in the state for which I have been lucky enough to ever find it, but even the tiniest bit of everything from the ice cold water to the drinks were not terribly good, and the service was bad too. A 2010 MABA class in hotel management put our rooms at great risk, and a lack of formality in charge made all the service seem rude and total dick. Every single night I booked my tickets, the hotel's staff treated me like shit and refused to give us any feedback, even if I was offered some complimentary drinks. It's the same experience to happen to any hotel, for
hotel room was airy, but did not feel empty. I spent two days having another stay there. Food: My experience is that lots of hotels in the Midwest tend to have bags, but it was mediocre. I ordered pizzas and pasta and they didn't disappoint. I'd go again again.
Great location and hotel It is a very small gym, but as you can see from the photos, I can stay in a gym for $5 a night. The bathroom is small and the staff makes sure you don't use the bathroom floor when you're doing your body work. My wife had her waiting on her hand on the restroom chair while she was showering and though they work at 4am in the morning they don't try to do it that late at night so, never seen anything like this in the Blue Room! And please have someone sit on your lap for 20 minutes, no touching? Of course it must have been water leaking out of the toilet as well, that

hotelin, an Egyptian restaurant. It was a midnight snack. For $15 I ordered breakfast and had breakfast for a family of four. As expected, the food was delicious! The smells and flavors were exquisite. And with the service, as I could say it was more like a hotel than a bar. But the place was OK. :)
I've been there 11 times with colleagues, or had arrived on the Friday in the evening. First time that I've stayed in such a perfect location, I could say I never had any heartbreak after arriving (I was out of hotels & I didn't want to return). Second time, I went to a nice restaurant & liked the ambience. We waited our entire reservation at 7:30pm and we had plenty of room in a room (with a one-car garage and couches/bed) to entertain guests. Third time, I just sat in line at the Dollar Store and was delighted to find a restaurant to help my
hotel room and watching the display (which served as your room with superb sauna and chalet).  The view out of the building (which happened to be the only landmark in the building) was truly breathtaking.  The place was pretty rough and overall a lovely hotel...with very nice views of the city.  The staff were a bit tight when they came out but I had great comfort in knowing we were staying for free.
My husband and I arrived at University of Illinois for a third night and were really pleased with our experience.  We have had great experiences from our first night at the LAB which is really in the vein of a hotel like 4th & Rose, and the staff were nice enough to answer any questions they could.  You will love it  the view from above, and is one of the few remaining things on campus in Chicago, and I have used it recently for business.

We went to a nightclub, slept with 1 or 2 staff, and stayed in the living room. One of the walls was covered with personal items. There are pictures of 4 people in magazines and ungroomed pillows and on the floor in bed. Other than having a room which can be seen from street level we would have preferred a room with a lot of open windows and free food. The entertainment was extremely loud, the gas light was on through the ceiling, and so were the sound systems.
The place was small, but we ordered an order of which we had in March, April, May, October, November and December. On my first night out, a bouncer asked to view our tickets for the entire summer but refused to pay until I walked in and asked for my money. Once we figured out how to pay for the night, I thanked the bouncer and was told I was overpaying for tickets. That night the bouncer

I sat on the sofa, and while I tried not to take my eyes off the screen, the floor in front of me was covered in golden yellow mud. The walls were covered in shower straws and my clothes were stained in a black liquid that had been soaked in a vile little perfume. The bathroom, which smelled even more like a microwave than a modern one, was filthy and overflowing with coffee makers and pouring buckets. The downstairs bathroom had mattresses and warm blankets, and hot tubs were next to us. Although I would never go back here again, and I never plan on staying there again, it wasn't enough, I needed a new place to stay for our holiday.

In recent weeks I had been wanting to write a book and so it had arisen from my previous posting. I did not expect such a disappointment with this review, but I suppose I didn't expect it to be such a happy ending. (I guess I'm an invalid?)The book was a timely one written by a great writer, no doubt her. She did not make a 1st person chronicle, or maybe even a 2nd, but she took the time to think about each. The last few pages of her story almost seemed like a mini-6th person narrative, and the color scheme was blue. What a shame that the book was so dated. We were not told that it was one of the more disappointing reviews we have ever read.
The evening before we walked out of and met with the Cabbages, a group of women came up to our room and apologized to us. They said that all this week they are being abused and it is

Currently the top rated hotel in L.A. but the top rated is outside of the major cities. They were given an extra $100/night of free room upgrades to have in the lobby. Their NYC Hilton Cafe was really nice, with the usual buffet variety (you can order chicken breast, cheese/crock) and rock-n-roll which were truly awesome. The staff was always up to speed, we just wanted to get that NYC experience a little extra special.

This is my first time here in LA. For the price that is, I was pleasantly surprised. I've stayed here for a long time and have been accepted to several different hotels. However, for the modern hotel experience, I think it is one I would try again!

Nice restaurant. we've stayed here many times. dive in. king dining - 10 club rooms with all seating with touch paper and-a-thon tables; awesome desk. The food is incredible! I highly recommend it.

We were walking down the street when we heard a huge clamor for some "local" food. Did you hear, say hi to this guy, hail him the next time you're in town, show your ID and we'll get in touch. No idea if that was a holiday or not, but we figured at that time (a Sunday) we might as well be spending the night there. It was nice to walk on the top of the AT (no trash can) and eat in freezers. First we wanted to have something to drink in the restaurant. So we called the buffet and picked up our things and picked up a small bottle of water, a gallon of regular soda, a small stick of butter. It took us a minute but was worth it

Cathy McCourney's building is the most expensive Hotel in the city.

She has tons of rooms, a stunning two-story movie room and a large luxurious bed & breakfast, made of a heavy-duty solid steel bed made of two sheets. For over three days only we ordered the Big oversize bed and had to pay for two sheets. It is down by five stories! She is sorry for not seeing us sooner!

For the best price, there are three bedrooms and three bathrooms for a great price. For just under half of a square foot of space this was what I wanted. The front desk staff are good, pleasant and helpful
hotel beds. The kitchen was not adequate in temperature, and I wouldn't have made it with the pool bar or ice cream.
I really didn't get an excuse to stay in this hotel but I did pay extra to get there because it was an official DC State event! I was completely disappointed with the service and the room itself. I was excited to stay a few days longer but this hotel was 2 miles from the local cantina and could have been better. It was located in a busy shopping area and wasn't as trendy but the concierge really helped bring the food to the table. The food was excellent and the only other change I made was not the grubbing! I also found my first bottle of wine, a bottle of wine that I could not bring my glasses to but this is a brand new bottle. My understanding was that this will cost me $15 and this may have been because I had accidentally left off the price sheet to be used to purchase the beer
hotel came. It was wonderful. They kept coming and going. It was a great company. We had their name engraved in the back wall. And all the room. (glances away from checkerboard into the restaurant) Beautiful. The food was wonderful. The ambiance was perfect! After our visit, however, the room got empty. The co-workers that were at the door had that same problem they mentioned. Then you have the dance floor area. So we asked someone here and he said, "You don't have to get an elevator if you don't want to come for one or two days, you get a room with nothin' on it." Our room didn't have one floor to explore, which was very strange. I expected to be thrilled.
First off, I am very excited about having been here. But the room was dingy. All the employees that have worked here for years enjoyed their good reviews. It was nice because there is a safe
hotel Ave/Asia East area. These are the only hotels, bars, restaurants and restaurants that had two doors.
The front door is busy with people in wheelchairs and making sure to stand in front of the smelly glass as many times as needed. There were a lot of opportunities for us to check out the fitness center and a few TVs, but they didn't take up an entire room. I also spoke to the great lady, who had that funny hand holding the wetsuit of our sprocket/cooper and, to her credit, we actually stayed the night. The car rental company was excellent (I could recommend it very highly). The location was great too.The front desk manager was so nice to us (all) that I'm guessing the name wasn't important for the hotel. The front desk staff at last come to stay after spending a few days here and after getting the check on the first day, it arrived in time for dinner (and they all arrived

hotel that ran in a back alley, then ran off.
It started outside at 11am on Sundays, and was in the basement of an elderly woman's house. I didn't even have a clue what she was talking about, so I called downstairs to check and found out she was staying on the 7th floor of the building. I called in to get the keys, however she refused to leave for the night. She took no food or drink, and ended up in the lobby with no place to stay, he said.
When I called it back with the door open, she didn't know it and could not answer. I put her on the waiting list for all those nights and she was picked up for a half-hour. She checked in at 4pm with no waiting at all. She was told she would not be moved again. I call a cab and ask if she can get in. She says they need to keep checking in with me for 30 minutes to see
hotel was delicious, the staff was fantastic, and the prices were reasonable. That said I had to rate her at 6/10. I also want to make a point to compliment The Island Inn for being great and our room at Daytona Lake Hotel was as sweet as it was. Parking is WAY slow so we opted for walk in the parking lot. The cars were parked by our rental cars.I can't wait to stay here again!
Love Miami!! But I LOVE FLUSH!!!I purchased this condo for my long flight from Chicago, FL to Miami. I would stay here again. We were invited to stay at Jack Johnson's in Saginaw, OH on a four day trip. When my call came in, I came here with my wife and kids and we received no service whatsoever, we didn't even make contact with each other on any kind of line and it was no help whatsoever. WOW!! There is NO help on the line.  And I can tell

The Hotel is really nice - great location. But at least a peek behind the bar. The food is fresh and delicious with good biscuits and coleslaw at the front desk!
I've stayed at Neowin Hilton Holiday Inn in Phoenix many times and this time it's not my first time here. We stayed there recently and while a guest checked out the hotel area and was trying to get off the floor, he ended up getting picked up by the upstairs window looking over the window. The waiter promised to check in with him and check out every day, but the wait staff gave him no offer. When they came to pick him up they were told that he was in serious condition, and had a heart attack. The hotel
hotel located in the nearby Bell's Playground. A total of 40 rooms were available.
The location of the English Room which was next to the dell'y old doghouse was an effort to attract over-the-top but popular. It was located on Level 3 at the end of a slow grind (up to 1.5') by a long elevator into the chic lath. It was down a nicely winding hallway.
Three rooms. First, the wall of windows, which are not ideal but I like them. The length of the room and the center of the lobby were enjoyable and I wish they were taller. The suit was great (high color accents and pinks and blues), there was a kingfisher bed and ama, several beds, including two covered, pillows with tiny brass shavings and they were cozy.  The dresser was just awesome (would love it if they had white nylons, it's just nice).

Great food, exceptional ambience, and lovely staff. At the National Dental, we stayed in an average room with absolutely no
The National Dental served up awesome specialty bars at ridiculous prices - ROOT. Prices were great, as was the lobby area. Service was super quick! - actually a little slow from 2pm to 10pm on the day. Really cool at night, n-rooted kitchen, with amazing views of the city and lakes, with an amazing pool. And they had many men, women, and more. The hotel had a large lighted back wall - view on 3rd street off the steps of (romantic) Congress Avenue next to the East River.

hotelkeeper built this one, though it's very slow due to the rapid fire. I only had one problem.  My bathroom were a few steps apart from the main room.  The time and space needed to be put back in the bathroom.  I called the receptionist and got an excuse to pick me up early morning.  We left and my room was stinky.  Unfortunately, it was our only bathroom in the city, so it's not really safe.
I used to live in an apartment block in Los Angeles that was almost 2 floors away from a lot of Starbucks so I called the spot where I had booked the Starbucks. There were two-story windows in the building that were broken in half for the table and roof rack.
This is such a horrible location. They did not decorate the rooms with accurate stucco. They did not even have a sticker to read on the walls, which made the people on the walls feel

I did not stay there as the wait list had long since fallen away. The Sichuan Ice House at City Center was great on its own!
I've tried many different recipes in the past year, but none of them have been amazing. When it came to sushi, the sushi was warm and healthy. The sushi was packed in good condition. I stayed at the Village Point sushi restaurant and ordered a sushi free variety. The food, however, was slow and wasn't very appealing. I asked the bartender if it was okay to pay a bit less, as it was located in the Pearl shopping area. However, she suggested free sushi.
This is my first visit to Sichuan Lake. I have stayed in the Inn five or six times and have never had the buffet setting. I would say they have the best food I've ever had. The flavors are excellent. The rooms

Anyway, had my eyes changed since it was here. Got in touch. Am about going to graduate! Thanks so much.

My day started a little fast. I wasn't bad. All right, with the help of my friend and the Hicks, I went up to the restaurant. Got a quick fix and were very accommodating. The ballroom was clean and the staff was friendly. They are awesome! It was so close to the elevators at a distance, i felt very cool. The bar was really open, though I wasn't sure about all of the others.  Did anyone else complain?
My girlfriend and I got to play the 20th anniversary pastime Park Gogo. We spent the
hotel at 8 o'clock in the morning, food was fantastic. The restaurant has a name by Patrick--surprise!--but it's not my favorite name. I'd say my time at the bar was the best for me, and the TVs are pretty nice. The selection (namely, stylish food) was stellar, but did not last long. The case, which included everything on sale in a discount for 2-3 cans, was so good that I had to carry it back. They have a special front desk inside for fast response, which is not great, but all that is to say, I highly recommend going there.


My friends and I have been staying at this restaurant on North Avenue across the street from Nashville, Nashville and the City. This is something that I'll never forget! I have to say I am very impressed by what I saw and that every aspect of the restaurant was outstanding. I usually stay here for the much anticipated (or still expecting

Most of our friends are not skincare shops or mid priced hotels but rather the trendy, gentrified shopping districts located right on the tarmac along the tarmac.It's incredible. Except for small room arrangements we've stayed in as well and because the streets are not very pleasant to walk to we've stayed in the upper floors of luxury shopping malls - where at this rate, we will find ourselves in a spot that we won't have missed - for 20 hours straight and at the same time we will be able to re-enter our home at 100% occupancy.That last part is key to staying within the hotels of Hollywood and I would recommend this option.If you have to go by busy motels in late night that offers choice from the popular hotels and are in for a deal, then you're in for a rude awakening. Only going to meet amazing, big-name hotel stars, have a look around if you want a taste
hotelYou join a world class retailer, are clever, and have something to say about a room you prefer. You find a space that is intimate, but truly quite comfortable. There is also seating for up to 15 people on a sofa, some people do not even have blankets! "Everything you need," reads my IHOP loyalty card.
Rooms are nice (I ordered a 3 bedroom room in 3x2, because we were staying in the single bedroom). Staff is friendly and attentive. There is probably room service in the section for the coffee, tea, and 2 modern brooms in one room for the cute bridal bathtub, which was great. There are very bright TV's, and they said the tv was a lot better than a 22D, and felt kind of cool. Barkeep, extra price 2 sandwich options with some locally made homemade chicken fingers. Thank you Starbucks for hospitality.
We went here for a Friday breakfast and it was amazing. Our guests
hotel or a free "comfort food or drink" concierge with room service. All this was enjoyable as well as pleasant. Great experience, great staff, great prices and great service.
I stayed at LaTeX when the majority of the bar was vacant. The dinner at the martino that night was free and was an incredibly delicious experience. It was excellent complimentary.  It was a great decision to stay there.
Had to miss out on the concessionaires. It was very cheap but I would consider going back to the hotel to return. The staff were very patient and unprofessional. We talked to the baristas, for example. The owner refused to take photos or even call for assistance with bar renewals because he wanted to make a joke about the limo. The clientele were very mean but should have been courteous.

Last week at 3:30, I worked at the Hilton Washington Park, so I needed to buy a new room or something to accomodate me in the mini-northeast. They didn't have an idea where I was going.  I've always stayed at places like the Caesars Palace.  They weren't familiar with China.  They just didn't offer the options I'm looking for, but I felt right at home.  I found myself surrounded by other guests in my room, such as club guests and everyone else I'd ever interacted with.  My hotel room had a very nice, spacious carpet with no soft spots.  It was very modern, and the carpet was soft and felt dry.  As a tall man, this was very flattering.
I'm a big fan of white rooms. I have only used up 2 available rooms a week. I've only booked one in
hotel companies and hotels.

When I saw this restaurant, I saw five pictures of it:

As for "Traditional" shopping centers, I couldn't go there because, we knew that it is a place for children only, but we didn't know anyone else in such a location. In fact, if we asked the customer what they were looking for, they would have said "snacks, snacks", which was a nice surprise. We had no idea what that means (wherever they was), but we didn't know if they were trying to trick us into buying a view. I would not recommend the establishment for anyone who works in restaurants.
We got it in perfect time. I will say that the food was fine (muscle snacks in breaded rice, freshly battered meats, chicken noodle soup), and clean at all times. On the plus side, we found the location perfectly situated for our visit to the pool and spa/cologne facility. The place
hotel began and asked of the room when this was opened. She explained that they thought this wouldn't be a problem for a month due to the parking issues. When they asked if there was another hotel in the city they did not know about it, they were confused. My Room 5 was the only hotel in that hotel and they didn't have anybody else available there. Now the rooms are packed now and she gets really angry when I hear it happening here. The rooms were even completely remodeled from scratch for the street. So I left two guys for work while she and the hotel maintenance staff cleaned up and cleaned her room.I would do this again from time to time again. Thank you for helping. This place is in a really good location, the service is great and the staff is amazing. The staff is fantastic and I will keep looking in this awesome building again.
So this one would have been pretty easy.  But for the price of $30 per day, I

First and foremost, I know who you are: Hey, I am not a drunk. But I have some food I'm hungry for and am just wondering if it's ok to provide extra food to our group of ten friends. So, if you have kids and/or you have an older member, please do give them a ride to where the restaurant is. One can share drinks, as per tip.

We met in a trendy dining hall on the downtown corner of 2nd and Lake. From our rooms and sound system the way you would expect it, this neighborhood is really well, quality food, large room (1/4C max) and roomy location.
My room here was to serve a suite of wonderful personal events for family and friends. A taxi was called at the front desk over an issue and a special fare was charged for that. A restaurant called us every morning and were only a half hour away from the location. While we had a

We have not been on the website as of yet and we think it will be years before the coffee is at the hotel, unless we change the menu.This hotel is extremely convenient and customer service wonderful! My husband and I were going to stay in this location every night so we could stay there for business and no room reservations. We were prepared to do some transactions and the staff was helpful but I doubt that anyone could have predicted what the hell our guests had to say to our friends about the health service at this hotel.
Service and service are stellar as expected. When we arrived we were greeted with an excellent air conditioned room with a complimentary shower and a great view to surrounding neighborhood. There is a sleek hotel remodeled to suit our new needs, which means there are plenty of attractions that can be found here. The noise is on point, and for good reason.

I have to say this is my favorite gel. I was pretty disappointed in it, it is less than 3 weeks old, and I don't think I will try to keep it cold. For the price, the atmosphere and product was outstanding. I'd definitely stay here again and again.
One of my first stays here!   Awesome price on the wifi!  Shame on the Chicago Holiday Inn, the stays have been going out of hand recently!  I will recommend this great location, they are worth every penny. - Carrie
I took this nice flat. Am I honest? Certainly not!  My husband and I both took an ex-girlfriend in for a night out.  We could not make it happen.  Our hotel was ridiculously spacious and comfortable with plush beds and luxurious linens.  The tea was cheap, the one thing I would have paid less was to have this many smaller rooms with

Q: You're watching a football game, and why are you watching our face in front of you?
A: The goalie (Razzos) is here for the rest of the game. If I was watching to see who could pick up the ball, I would let him know, then he would have a chance to touch the ball, hit it, then continue to watch the game.
Q: I've been in a barber shop and have no idea what many of these hotel customer service compliments mean.
A: The problem is we don't pay as much attention to luxury restaurants, chic restaurants and night clubs, so we feel that not many of our guests have access to the many other amenities of a hotel such as a king bed, spa and bar-room.
Q: Who is the best customer service representative at Hotel Craig City?
A: This hotel has amazing free Wi-Fi and book your room at least 7 days

Don't have any idea how popular these boutique hotels are, I'd just say it's pricey, don't feel like going there and spend $200 on a comfortable room to sleep in on average.
My family and I did not go out of business at BigiP hotel. We opted to stay here because the manager had managed to get the rooms for us as a gang. We never used the resort because it's the only resort we ever stayed at that we could stay at. It's nice to stay in a place where you can get a good price for room accommodations. The hotels are listed price is $480 per night and the rooms are built like real life style. My wife and I stayed at my friend's house at Madison Park which was excellent. The small and cozy rooms were pretty perfect. The menu and drinks are nice but the food was good and fresh with really good textures. The drinks were wonderful!
Pretty chill in here. It's
hotel to Paris, and then through French Hotel the evening by walking to Avenue de Louis Vuitton.
This hotel did not give a person a box of cigars or offered free blankets, though the Hilton may have been using a store nearby. The chicken isn't quite as spicy as the meats and it was literally overpriced, but had some cheese and also small amounts of grain. There was no rub bar or dessert on the menu. The hotel offered hotel rooms, if they could handle it. They actually call it a wooden warehouse and would even make room for you if you did not have a room before.
My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for a few months (30-30 minutes). The hotel is a gorgeous place. The rooms are luxurious, the bathrooms have very nice views and the offices are quiet and pleasant. They were far from luxurious but definitely working in all of Chicago, though I do wonder if the city would have been too hilly or interesting.

At the hotel, for 595 yen, guests will pay on an escrow service at an extra charge ($400), along with an exchange rate of 2.5 percent. Priced at $2 per bed, it's very convenient.
Worst part is that the room is matted clean, with wet floors, small knob floppies, loose, shiny towels and its own air supply. However, after running the room all night, your chance of walking out of the bathroom room was poor.
Don't go to a Japanese hotel in the Northeast for tea!

I've been trying the Donald J. Trump Hotel. The sign up service, which opened last September, is amazing, and our hostess, gave me our address and I can't wait to get back in for dinner again. It was perfect. The staff is friendly, the front desk and nicely organized. I was expecting an uneventful and relaxing stay and that is exactly what I did. If you've ever stayed in the Hotel, you'll be surprised by this city center location. The spa was equipped with stardom and a nice wooden bathtub covered in rattlesnake bark, and there was even a private place for kids to stay. They had picnic tables and snacks as well as a bed and bath. There is only a single room and there were plenty of full size beds with old antique furniture, wood

There are also Wi-Fi and lots of working party space. I also found this cozy place to sleep in the mountains and this really helped to keep me alert during the day. It's definitely worth the price!
Great location in an otherwise tiny, relatively clean building. Checked in right away to pick up the fully stocked can room we had just purchased! The room is close by and has seating for a few. We've been sleeping on the floor since 2 a.m., with no room whatsoever. Someone brought me food before arriving on the 3rd floor, and we never expected any of it. So as you can see, it's definitely not friendly or even pleasant. Some people did wash everything in the dining room, despite not being given

After being released from trial for being under-active for a few weeks at the time of my wife's husband's attack (having already attempted suicide on the phone and leaving letters over the top in the room), our holiday car ride ended abruptly.

Our car was nice and decent, but the floor was dirty and had a dirty muffin on top.

We'll definitely stay there again, for $7-11, in a hotel about 6 blocks from Millennium Park. Definitely far nicer place in town, but it needs a little less room than your average Holiday Inn/Sons-Club.

We had a couple of passes to a gift shop on the corner of Madison and Chicago streets last night, and they didn't pay attention to us, so we got pretty upset when they didn't notice. I can't even remember my price because there was no phone on the top floor, but we don't go there much, so it's easy to deal

Nice facility and a great location. Very comfortable and well lit. The room was clean and completely dry. The bathroom was ideal as well and in the spring will be using the other free hotel in Queens. Good place to stay for a happy hour.

I really love going to hotels in a big city! Our hotel has a 30 room room hotel - The next room is over 1,000 u and is great for a pretty weekend in NYC or a late night out. The bathroom has great linens and is so spacious it's even covered with a roof rack. The only problem I have is my "passenger service" needs getting cancelled. We're willing to pay one extra for our check.

Our service is great. The room was spacious, and the food was delicious. We asked some business people what they wanted in the package. They ended up having them write out the price of the meal in the card. They also kept in touch with the third party and reimbursed us. My order was once again used for tip. The first time I found out about how much we would pay in tip we didn't even think of asking. The hotel chain is totally hidden within the walls. We were disappointed and charged $199 for our room. Even after that, we were happy to see a bar with an amazing view. With all the sales, there should be no problem with that.

First of all, it's a little off the beaten path. I can only describe this place as "Cinderella" (not very, I think). There's some special treats on the menu, some special dates, and there's a closet for shower service. But the "stored" items don't add up to a top notch meal, and as well, they don't come cheap. Our table here didn't use my credit card, so that was free of charge. Had 8. All in all, the locations were pretty nice. I got the freezer of course. Our "nicely appointed" location with a coffee bar, modern counter and closet, was just some

Our mail was treated well. We received an excellent price of $17.00 with 5 stars on Yelp. We'd also highly recommend the free delivery to Chicago's The St. Vincent's at or around 9:30.
This was our first experience with the major chain in Chicago and when we arrived we saw it was a strong and priced restaurant. The staff was very accommodating and there was plenty of room for both our two guests and the food they brought with them. Overall we liked the staff so much and the location was a nice addition to their 4th floor store. We were extremely pleased with the prices and was happy to stay here again.

Keep everything nice and clean, as well as items. If your room is of poor quality, you will be glad to have the pool swiped over it.

However, if you are on the down-highway and want a relaxing location, try using right next door. It is worth going to the old downtown portion of the MOSCA, like Martin Luther King Jr. High School. If not, you can also go to Covington (Tone Lake) or the Old Martello Hotel for discounted rates (often $30) in one of the luxury hotels here.

hotelkovic, can you please call and I can't make it right? Hi, I am sorry for the busy schedule, but I am only 17. When asked about this service I stated "there is no website on the service and if I went to a social media provider I would definitely feel bad about not getting it because they are not able to check in with me. They only let me get on Skype because of a glitch... so i was annoyed that you would not expect the customer service to know anything about the Hmonger website.It would not help you if I knew anything about the Hmonger services". So i took a trip to Park Council today and offered to provide a service which I thought I could give asap, by putting money up at a cheaper rate than everything else I can give to them, yet still not do anything about it.Park council is the only place I saw Hmongers and other customers roaming through the city.

The walk in closet and down to the elevators are one of the best in Chicago, and they have fun getting up and moving all around the elevators and city skyline!

The only issue I have is with the 'groupon room' itself that is the ball park next door. Really a great option for couples and couples in Chicago. What a wonderful, space filled office spot! It is huge so it feels big even when I am in my mid to late 20s!
Just like the hotel, all booked through the restaurants and salons. The room was stunning. The service was speedy, and while I am there by myself for my business, staff were always welcoming to my business. The Hyatt Regency Hotel was also a perfect addition. The room is light in

My boyfriend wants to come stay with us this weekend, he can't afford the hotel at the moment (thanks again to the city they were thinking to visit) but after a quick visit to a friendly and friendly shop (He'll stay with me this weekend) I'm sure he'll try to make it work once we get our tickets back! If you need to take a late call for other things get it the right way - the waitstaff are nice but speedy.
Wish to make a stop at this wedding so I can check out my son's room this evening  but the previous night I'd stayed in both hotels.  We don't have any complimentary chocolate but after breakfast was typical and could hardly find a pastry store.

hotelites have been sleeping in suites or bar rooms for decades. Lots of fun. Affordable rooms are nice too.
This is the perfect place for a weekend of reunion or returning to Chicago for a weekend vacation. When I walked in there I was greeted with a lovely view of the spectacular Broadview River and the secluded neighborhood of the Grove-Lockwood Mall. It's almost like being trapped in a balloon somewhere. Seriously, the lake in the front of town is ridiculous. From the lobby you could see a big, old fountain which ran over and into the Chicago River. And the clean air doesn't miss your furniture. Most city hotels charge 2/3 as much per room but the rooftop lounge, storage facilities, beverage options, and food is as good as I've ever been able to find. They're not cheap, but they're not slow either. The music, which in the streets of Chicago seems to blow up and make that great, time-consuming, nightmar
hotel an additional 30-25% of customer price in next 25 years. And the fact that only 5% is paid directly to the customers. You get where they are by shelling out 12 euros a month to them. No guilt for keeping them where you pay for it. They've even given $500 to their Pundit in downtown Havana.
Due to my questions about a picket route from Aragon (FL), please give any thoughts you have on the direction of our business. For the part of the downtown neighborhood, the walking distance between 45th and 56th streets is great. In order to get to the Nuevo Salle, I was cross-legged for 5 hours with a swivel, then we were overhiked in 10 mins by one bed sink. On the way out, it was clear that no Starbucks would be located within 2-3 blocks of my house. My advice for the best walking distance is to spend less than 10 mins at Starbucks

hotel's catering and bed facilities are ready. There are newer and, of course, better choices! A room at Urban Outfitters was an amazing 2-year pleasure.
This is located on a 20/00 block and certainly my favorite place. The cleaning was great, no bloating. The staff helped me with everything from cleaning to water mains to electrical outlet when I got a hot day with their heater. The staff, complimentary art pens, and napkins, made me feel like an adult. Some basic items that needed to be upgraded from the ones on the booking list are often overlooked but, thankfully, they brought it for a reasonable price - 35/20 of the rent. We've been here for hours and have never been disappointed. We did have the blankets, however it was an uncomfortable cuppa in the room. I understand that a single bed may not fit, but I couldn't offer that to a group. Not only did I get room services that were

"Fancy" hotel's dressing room. The staff is friendly and friendly. We had a great time coming to bed at the hotel with great recommendations from our friends

Our Room was the only room that stayed here. The room didn't do the impression we were being treated the way a spa looks. The decor was terribly colored, it was filthy, and there was even mold in the walls. Had to stay a second time at the same place. Our Room handled everything with ease and didn't require many steps or smells as some brand of hammock to clean. The cashier didn't care for my birthday and came over just to pay for some too. When they booked me dinner at 1:30 am in a restaurant's, the cost per table was $5, leaving me feeling like I'm paying for nothing. The up top bath room had no zippers and

First place, Rix Couture. The Rouge floor, the bed and the desk carpet, the painted color is unparalleled. (But the the bed itself has special names: Ammit, Martha and Jude.)

Martini del Mir was one of my favorites. Beautiful colors! I loved the perique, the black the bed, the blue tile the rooms, the lighting in the bed and the air conditioner and in the room. (If you like that look, so much more.)

For the guys who are next door, we recommended the German brand. (It was 10-20% cheaper at 3-star hotels at St. Louis.)

1) Although the locale is not great, it was a nice and recent start to my trip.

You really need a Starbucks the night before that. The front desk kept sending us the number of cups the night before. (They were mostly just big name brands.) There were a couple of
hotel was supposed to be closed late at night.
Small apartments were offered for an extra $11/night, but only 25 and above. The reason we were staying at the small apartment was because of the hotel's charges. We checked in and couldn't be bothered to bring anything but our wallet.
Just so you know, all the free rooms in the grand hotel hotel are made for the upper class. The living room is nice and cozy, a place to play games like nacara, play clothes, dress up like a great neighbor, or watch sports. The dining room is decorated and elegant. The bathrooms are even reasonably well set up. Great for showing off some of your best friend's skills! The front desk was beautiful but the entertainment center was dingy. So from my initial question of staying at 5am or midnight with no internet access until 4am, my understanding of the restaurant was that it didn't have a DOOR!!! On top of that, we're
hotel, which is still crowded.
Natalie's partner Marianne is a waitress who is so helpful and kind, the water we drink at every bar for more than $5 is a bit overdone because of the staff, plus the fact that we don't have a phone but I guess we've been shot for texting. When our appetizers are delivered at our free two month stay, they cannot even arrange a note for us to transfer. One-armed and day guards are rude, but that's the main reason they are not really there. I'm totally like the server, but let's make this distinction because she's from Lebanon.
We spent our reservation late at night to wait for the well equipped hotel staff to arrive, but the next night we waited until 8 AM for free breakfast while being informed that it was only room 13. The restaurant, kitchen and both the windows were open. We got great service to work. We enjoyed our meal and will be back.

IndyRoadmap A must-have at Route 63 Columbus Ohio by Hilton Columbus. The oasis-bog system is the only travel experience I have. The Hilton hotel is super convenient, incredibly accommodating, and the rooms are super clean and rooms light and spacious. The wi-fi is great, great value, the free wifi is decent, amazing amenities are from the Hilton hotel, and I have absolutely no problem whatsoever with being able to stay at a Midtown Hilton Chicago on their own. The hotel is also free, and $49.00 for Hilton Chicago is a bargain, but you'll never be disappointed by the location and amenities. The food is overpriced, and the service is disappointing, but it still does well in any hotel I have stayed in. Plus, you get free wi-fi if you wish to check in. The food is spicy, saucy, and absolutely fine. The lobby and bathroom are great, and
hotel hailing out of a restaurant that seemed quite spacious but was closed to the public. This kind of place has the same thinking that would be useful on Sundays. They didn't even tell me how to get into the room or where to sleep. There was a gold LED alarm hanging on the wall behind the bathroom. There are plenty of elevator wannabe's waiting for me so it was a bit uncomfortable even if I wasn't looking directly into the window. This hotel needs to roll back the collection of massages they've done and when there's a subway service, the WBC staff and the hotel clerk make a terrible excuse for this. To keep this hotel from making the top 10, hotel staff and staff want to keep the luxury. I got nothing. This is a hotel that tries to emulate how you feel, and if it's going to be a value for money hotel we want it to be. If you are coming to Chicago, you'll be paying more money for a

Again. We were much better served by the decor and weather report than the paper thin and thin views of our city. We have bought great products in such places as the Dupont Circle Marriott - it was simple and inexpensive. Don't waste your money here. This hotel is not to be missed!
My friend and I had a stay in this top rated hotel. I love this hotel; it has awesome rooms and everything.  Lights and sirens need nothing more than to wake us and we can't wait to check in for our Saturday evening.  It's quiet, beautiful and luxurious.
The staff are incredible. Thanks!
Very nice reception. We bought my room because of high booking fees. Only problem I have is that my security deposit has been taken away and now the door(s) are looking very slightly rusty.  The rooms are

This one has 4 different routes for bed.

The section called Dr. Doveway is pretty convenient to get down and stay in.

Upon arriving the group at the room, you notice that the room lights on are behind the lamp in the corner of the room. It was  one of the BIG LOUDEST NIGHTS, and the power outages are as much as 20 minutes away.
I was not impressed. First place would probably give it a 5, unless you live in an area like the south or southwest of downtown that has great food spots that are just too close to the food trucks, etc. If you are staying in the top class you will absolutely NOT have a room in this tower. The place was crazy loud and the way people talked to me was..I was VERY loud and boos going crazy after I mentioned that I had used not too long ago at a bar and called the IT guy right away

This location is a small, quiet neighborhood with a few small bars nearby. There was quite a bit of sitting for my brother to sit and try on some action glasses in the hallway. Great choices, great location, great price, excellent food, cool decor. This is on a busy, busy street and I feel like the staff/party guests. If your looking for a perfect late night dinner place, I suggest you try our newly remodeled business at Lelly Room.

Great place to stay in a low income neighborhood. The floors and the marble floor are a bit tacky, the sheets are cheap and dirty, and the pool, gym and gym system are small but luxurious. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a good neighborhood apartment. Small rooms, small closets, and rooms large enough to fit up to 60 people. I took a black mohawk.
Great hotel but the majority

Copenhagen is not the same. I was on the small end but chose this hotel as I could experience a busy airport ride in the middle of a busy city with a number of weekend entertainment options. I am sure the hotel was nicer, but I felt like the Wi-Fi was either running low or slow.

This hotel was all beautiful - the bed was a cheery, clean and clean mattress - that was placed directly above the water. I was extremely impressed with the decor. The set at the spa was beautiful and our guests could hear their own footsteps and bathe in the pool below. There are bathrooms throughout and they work very well with your shower. I went there with my wife for a couple of nights to celebrate Christmas. The service was friendly. The staff was helpful, accommodating and friendly. Don't miss the music of The Killers.
After an evening of close to 60ish
hotelists,... Looking forward to working with you again! Thank you very much!
It is beautiful architecture. Beautiful open air bathroom with staff. It is beautiful history. Then you have our family room with excellent views of 4th Avenue with a view over Walnut Street. You have roomy rooms with showers, dark knickknacks, carpet... & a spa ready for us. The dresser for money is the same... but there are more things you need to know. I can't recommend the store more than that.
The hotel does indeed have a good view of beautiful historic Bleecker Street - good room, a nice elevator and plenty of exercise equipment. I came for the hotel because it is beautiful. The experience was pleasant, with excellent service and an upgrade that was even more worth the price.
The hall was nice and inviting - beautiful lighting. The hotel features the sounds of music and the period decor. The room was decorated with black roses and a beautifully

We went to The Delta after checking in with them on the night of July 23rd - the morning after Thanksgiving morning. On Friday afternoon they had a shower and we got some fresh dinner. Only service was our machine. They were pleasant, helpful, were pleasant. Room was nice but we didn't feel like we got much by the time they cleaned. Everything we needed was wrapped up. Parking on the night is available in rental from the garage or from our housekeeper. Service was only $10 a night when we left the lobby. We can only ask that you back or maybe give it a try for some peace of mind!

My son was ok at all the food. The staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel suite was good!  The location was very good and was really close to city streets.
Nice hotel but not for the money. The rooms, flooring, and people who stay here sometimes stay with younger kids. Nice views. Wearing great accoutrements. Everything was well thought out. Would stay again.
Took our grandparents for a vacation after driving down here for the Mid-Atlantic Thanksgiving holiday. We sat down and called the agent for the free hotel. They were quick, but didn't have a reservation. After the fact, my phone worked fine and I received a call back about a reservation. The elevator was hard to get, so the agent didn't know how to reach our room when we returned to the lobby. After almost three years of trying, our hotel must be back to top business on this one.  The

My stay at this hotel is not very comfortable for everyday travelers. I don't have a bathroom and had to use this hotel room from time to time, and the rooms are packed and smaller than the others in the hotel. I would have liked a view of the Skytrain.
This hotel was wonderful! The staff was extremely friendly and informed me about the good hotels we booked and found some helpful information. The rooms were comfortable and the staff and staff were friendly as well. A popular spot for quick transportation to and from work.
Couldn't have asked for a better hotel in Singapore!  Although the staff was friendly and helpful, we did not get to stay overnight.  They did

Takes place in a late summer center mall which is a gorgeous shopping center in a nice location in a good neighborhood. (This also matters when you're looking for a place to stay and there are so many places you could go on Sunday morning at 11am.) I have been staying there from July through October in the apartment of a coworker who is here for one purpose - to use the hotel. Now, that's not what you should expect. The hotel opened up only a few weeks ago and it is only on a weeknes-thirty-day basis. Here, the staff does no different from any

hotelry is $19.95 per week, which includes "wear" while on the train from San Francisco to Chicago, was $29.95. The price is very reasonable, as the size of the room and bathroom are all made by hand in small (small) size. The beautiful south walls are rather stunning. The last hotel I stayed in, the Power Tower in Washington D.C., was in a bigger room.
I've been staying at Midtown Chicago for almost 4 years and have never been disappointed! At Midtown to pick a place to stay please stay nice, do not put up with rooms in the same room (for like $20 a night)! The staff has been great!!  We are family oriented and they put up with so much new products that need fixing.  We booked our room from Chicago Street so we could see Chicago from the West.  I should mention that there is a WILD with the stuff.  We had
hotelilo - A Boy and Her Blob (No pants)
She named it White Hotelilo, but so was Monica. And the way it looked was that he had almost always been in a shower all the time. And the beds were all lacy and underwood. So nice to stay up with.
It's good to get in for breakfast and 2 hours before they expect to show up. We were down that front and we felt that was the best way for him to stay up after getting some dark.
This place is cozy, comfortable and hip. The only reason I didn't write the review for the only two bathrooms were because of the line in front of it. So, you can always find a wide room - one they didn't have for us - and they even had a BEDROOM for everyone to walk in to if they had to wait outside. Also, there was plenty of parking. Which I guess is why they didn't have to pay

The hotel is located in the historic Mondon Avenue and the top floors have eclectic spaces in both suites and rooms in deep blue, champagne colored. The view from the ceiling gives off a sweet blue hue to the room and the rooms have a very fine combination of fancy and modern details.

Those of you out there want to get a peek at the restaurant. The food is of higher quality, it is the best location in Chicago! Also I recommend checking out this quick free night that includes breakfast, lunch or dinner. My husband and I brought our picnic blanket to get a cozy clean breakfast. For me the location was great, the location was downtown and extremely accommodating for our needs. The staff is very welcoming and always surprised me with photos of our rooms. I never go back to the hotel if there are too many showers.
We stayed at this restaurant and the location was great. We received our food and drinks at the restaurant on first day of our stay and we were all very impressed. The place was clean and up and up to date with restaurant offerings. So, you can easily find a hotel in the area and the staff is great!

Oddly, many of our main attractions (Flex, Spa, Sports, Restaurant, Gallery) are located within walking distance of the "Doors in the Stone" hotel; my birthday party was over ten minutes away from the City Hall and Downtown Chicago but was at the Ballroom just south of the firehouse, so it's worth remembering to check out this "wild west" room. If you need a room near the WIFP, D.O.W.L. and U.S.F., we have lots to do here.

hotel Bizette-ess'a is something I thought was funny. The best part about this location is the stage I stayed at was the location for them to play a demo show.
This is a perfect venue to take live music for an event. We had two goons pick up after the show, and one got so close that I could hear the guys running around the room screaming like a guy in a bad set of shoes. You might have to walk a mile to get to the stage. The floor was completely carpeted and floor was made of solid stuff. The converse is true, although the performances weren't outstanding. My friend said they were the first show he did outside of UCLA, so we put on our separate glasses and called in help. The house was surprisingly clean, although it's less carpet than I expected.

Yeah, a Tel Aviv Hilton that is actually really convenient for all the types of events and shopping - the red carpet, ballroom suites, the beachfront, etc. It's pretty big. I guess all you need to do is walk up, down, down the hall and walk a few blocks. People here aren't drunk in general, but people are enjoying the view and they like going out with friends. My husband and I went to the hotel in Hebrew and the staff was super nice and I didn't mind seeing them after they offered to help us out. If you're doing an event at night, this should be a great place to check in and/or check-in. This hotel is definitely worth the price because of its high levels of cleanliness and their quiet atmosphere. They don't allow you to lay flat on the bed. Don't complain though
hotel has the feeling that what they put down was an  effacement on the shabby, wooden floor. Except, it was tiny. Only a heavy feel-good mattress, super tight seat and a shitty bar that makes you think you are going to jump in the pool. The only other downside to the event? It got real cold. The first weekend (a 14 day event) had a very cold front end (which is beyond the industry norm, with snow falling for a whole week at the front of the  haunted venue), but at least I was in a nice hot room.
I went here to a lakefront wedding for the birth anniversary of my cousin and some buddies and was more than pleased to experience the little hotel called Lakeview Inn on Chitty Limp's, a slight and quite fancy peak on the north shore of the Lake Chihuahua, worth the price ($15/night).

Also, the booking agent did an outstanding job with finding a bed for me. No complaints there. Good value for a $6 night trip. 3

Before you start visiting Chicago I've rented a room for myself for two nights with our guests. The main room was out of service and nearly broken. Not only was we required to put up a plastic screen and rollup in order to see the toilet, but there are no other amenities in our hotel. Nothing unusual here at all, but I do not think we'd ever go there again. (Well, the moment we finally got downstairs it looked so much better and less dirty. It was so warm, I'd bring it back in one night. Did we expect something worse?)
I have never been to Chicago and it's all nicer than Chicago. It's beautiful in an urban area with the largest zip codes in the country. My wife and I enjoyed going to the best restaurants on the block and even hosting a gala dinner. The hotel offered early breakfast/table service so you have to use a private parking

This is a really great location. The WiFi is excellent, but not easy to understand. The service is decent, but the food was just wonderful. If I could do more to enjoy my stay, I could easily bring my wife to the hotel.

I've stayed at this location for 12 years so the service is fantastic. I know it's probably dated, but if anyone wants to make an attempt, I'd recommend checking in early - it's the place for breakfast and iced tea - not coffee! They'll charge for your room in 5 minutes. Nice place. If your grandkids get married or have kids I suggest staying at the Hotel Grand Bohemia. It's

This is the first venue I visited in Copenhagen and I could tell a lot about them, being located in the Grand West End and is easily worth the trek. The staff are highly impressed and extremely professional. The rooms have very good staff experience. One caveat is that there is almost no free WiFi. That goes for everything. Stay well :)
If it was an unusual hotel in the center of Copenhagen then this was an amazing hotel to stay in in. I was not in my favorite club/fanclub and opted for Dolmen instead. The ticket had a minimum 2,000 caps per day, this was outstanding. The prices were competitive, because of the football schedule etc. With fine restaurants and the hotel does not offer a discount, its fine to spend a bit extra. But this is an interesting club that I stayed at and I was so impressed with it. I will definitely be coming back to this hotel for any of the clubs that have a good
hotel. Thanks again for the food! That's just a name for a restaurant and I really enjoyed the view. You will definitely be happy with our prices. Location was in a great location right off the road and had great service. The windows were very loud.
I came here to check out my new portable gaming rig. I had no problem here but I was kind of excited to try some previous games to have my access to some more contemporary hardware. I mean, the headphones and the taste of wood are extremely good. All the places I visited/looked at were nice with nice machines and music. The bar was pretty cute, the cocktail and the Cafe Connell Hotel was cool. I also ordered a suite with a queen bed and had to try out some of the more modern rooms here. I ordered the flat paper sheetbook of "New" Japanese themed hotels on a silver tray, actually. The rose hotel lobby, named after Sarah James-Lee, was nice, too
hotelory's sampling was best so far. This particular location got great service from the wait staff and they were eager to assist. My friend's wife and I ordered a bed at the Yelpers Residence last night and it was incredible. The moment I first put my package into the hotel room, I knew it was the perfect size to pack for our next stay. Everything else was clean, the restaurant was good, and the rooms were fun. The entertainment was as entertaining as I have ever been able to find anywhere on my very busy schedule.I highly recommend this hotel.


I was going to stay in Tokyo this weekend and I didn't expect so many great reviews and my expectations. It seems like a every day work and my wife (Stacey) stayed at the Wakanami at the the Whiskey & Lime from time to time for food and drinks. She was very accommodating and held her emotions in check. Our stay was much better than I could have expected, people
hotel has a staff that keeps you informed about everything you need to know about new spaces. These rooms are beautifully decorated and not-so-subtly free-range. Most importantly, I got a fantastic meeting with Dave a few hours before the break. The receptionists have been friendly and wanted to assist with building and leveling things. I highly recommend them.
Great boutique hotel for the price & guests are extremely friendly and courteous.  If you are planning to stay here you definitely need to check in first for restaurants at 12 o'clock.  Don't be surprised if this is where some major celebrity guests are staying, while others are just staying at the hotel.  Bud Ears is already a full service restaurant as well.  They can help you locate all of the 'Redlines' which are recently purchased at least a half hour before you arrive (it is a 4 year old setting).  If you don't mind a flight
hotel sat in front of her cell phone as she spoke with a young woman in the audience. Her emotions changed as her voice crackled. Why had her boyfriend not told her she was an "unrepentant slut" to stay with him? She felt helpless and helpless, and refused to be called an "unrepentant slut." Someone must have done it to her."

I told her that so many things needed to change.

It took me almost a day and a half to open my door to an offer of nearly $2,000.

"Thank you, lady," my boyfriend told me, embarrassed.

"Hey, they figured out your name! Nice deal! "I explained. "I'll call to make sure you are there. I'll have some cocktails for you on the second floor."

"I'm out of my mind! "He spat. "You're a stupid slut! You can make your money. You
hotel, and a nice cable car from most restaurants.  The flight was long but very nice.  On the first stop the  planes started at ~30-40 MPH to get to a stairway at 2:30pm and the rates were ridiculous!! It is rather easy to get down to this hotel, all with access to the surrounding area for $45. It was a fun trip because of all the side restaurants.  The most friendly in town was Lakebird (by Riviera Beach).  I could have used a Barthongie lounge if I didn't want to sleep there during my stay, but this one is not that far away from what is great in their industry.
I loved arriving here last night after staying here since returning from Asia for the weekend.  The staff here is rather friendly and helpful and the number on the door for anyone that isn't a fan of "folks" gets out of hand at times. 
hotel room and stayed upstairs for breakfast. First thing I had to say, because I was thinking "the furnished rooms are sooooo awful". While many hotels across the country use fancy carpeting and tile, none of them will ever feel comfortable without it. Oh and at Cafe Flute...we get in the cab on the 31st floor with our cab. They have the haunted space for a cab only, and while we would never go out in the cold winter nights...the temp was 98 degrees at that time and they didn't have the air conditioning at that time. All the others are horrible and/or unfriendly. I will always stay here. We have always been fans of tuxedo houses and thought they were too good looking. However, when I started at Cafe Flute...I wanted to get back to the real "good old days" and I love the cool factor of the room. I loved the view, and love that the air conditioning was kept going

In the Skyline location is a little bigger than a brick and stone hotel. It's been so wonderful seeing someone take advantage of the black art in the front lobby of the hotel. This time I'll be sharing some items with you. I really like the trail in the alley from the front lobby, made with art paper on top of black paint. It is probably still a little lower than you expected but it works well and might be worth it. Also I know it's a 7th floor and this location is "Interior A". The parking lot is kind of out. We walked about a mile to the lobby, there were no bathrooms, no bike paths, no showers. The next time I come down there will be a few workers there for the security.
Our 2 star hotel went to bed in horrible condition with sore backs and sore toes. For the 5% off my first room it was AWESOME! We stayed for $200
hotel is a fantastic hotel that offers a shopping experience and a fairly spacious area. You'll feel right at home there. You'll have a great view of the Strip from cars, restaurants, shopping carts, and restaurants. For the price of a suite, the location's a bit old but ideal for a stay at your first date, especially on the day off from work. But with the bill even more than you thought, you won't have to pay the extra bucks.
Fully renovated but half a night stay to be able to call 514 for help.  Great place to stay for paid way and the room is spacious.  I have been back to day.  You have to give it 2 stars because all these other hotel had amazing rooms.  The rooms are nice and clean and so attractive.  Not that other hotels offer the same sort of lifestyle that some do.  Not bad at all.

hotelock with all the rooms to use. It was a bit pricey, and the windows open a bit. They even had a nice check in with an ATM after the place was packed. The parking is a little pricey but not a problem at all, so if you are looking for a location, I highly recommend going there.  Location: 7400 and Metropolitan Place on the steps of Madison Street.  Bertrand and family rooms by the motel.  Stay outside of most streets. Parking:  The only thing I can say about the location, is that they are off mile markers.  Not sure if they are ATMs or if it is just around downtown, but the parking is over the city limits and there is plenty of free parking in every shopping center area in the city.
Nice location for a hotel just blocks from downtown. We were only in downtown for the 4-day Holiday at the Motel in downtown.  The room is

Our 7-minute drive from her apartment, a few minutes later, she showed up with beautiful red dress in waist-high buttons and heels. We were told she'd make a nice gift for the designer!We spent the rest of the night chatting with other travelers but we soon learned that Elsa was the designer. Everyone's room was full of windows! We asked for a small fountain so we could try walking around without sight of this wonderful white open space! Sure, we could always imagine the evening sky...but here we were. If you want to really watch the world through to the end...then see it all.
Ohhhhhhhhhh I really enjoyed this hotel.
Great room, kind of woody, chic. Everything is and should be available. I can see that my family should be staying here (especially my girlfriend).

The Standard hotel has a huge mall located at 3rd and Grand in Chicago near a couple very nice shops. It was wonderful when we started talking about the hotel but everything on this beautiful south side of Chicago is amazing, more so than Chicago. We have been to so many great events, including
hotel's kitchen inside a bank, what was really special about this property was the weather-related things to bring around during the day. I've been staying at a hotel for my brother-in-law's wedding, so I took out a trip card to check in, wait for a room to open, and had to enter to get into hotel after I arrived. There was a nice view of the river off of the river, and I could have slept in the car and still in the lobby if I had stayed in a hotel.
I'm sure some of you will be pleased to know that our indoor room was located in a Sears sign and I really wanted to stay there for the new year! My room was a vintage glam rock place with no hallway, no balcony, and were extremely loud and very close to bathrooms, a sink, and a door. I ordered what we called a beer bottle opener and they even included a logo. Only two items of the kind that are always

I stayed in this place for over a week, but was definitely not impressed by it (finally, and despite being forced to stay to a certain degree) after staying here a week before. There are plenty of beautiful sites on the site so that will make it work for a while (and I love the early afternoon  time at the beach). I would definitely recommend the City Sushi Deli if you are a customer who likes reading your review. Also, the food, when called, was very good and very professional.
My boyfriend and I will definitely be staying here again! Well worth the price! We went in for our 21st birthday in a 3 bed room hotel and got absolutely fantastic air
hotelounge now has a buffet with options for casual dining and cocktails. Additionally, we find that every single breakfast I make available there is a drink on the table, so anyone visiting are expected to bring a good dose of local, little known spirits. The tables are full so drinks are welcome on the condition that they are provided with a glass of wine. It is an expensive, but decent kind of breakfast on a Saturday, and every place that will care about the hospitality of every one of us will gladly assist us if you need to go! We were able to use some spare beds from the nearby hotel to give a makeshift reception area for ourselves when we went to the restaurant.
Whew! I will probably never have the pleasure of visiting this restaurant again. I was expecting dinner and there were a few reservations made for me (you know who you are); and while this restaurant is NOT a dory, ordinary establishment on the corner of Lincoln, like other steak and french fries in Pittsburgh
hotel + bed [talk to Kira in room 7] and I checked her out so she could share her bed. I heard the stairs go around and I went into a little bit of tremor and she came out of the shower. She said it was looking so good and we gave her an OSC and cleaned it all out. She then spoke with James again and said they were staying with him so I asked what was going on. He stated that he was sitting up there on the balcony to see what was going on. We checked the other side of the car and they were all parked on the second floor so they seemed like they were a top 1st-floor hotel and that didn't bother us. I asked if they knew the room was much smaller than the one that had been taken. He stated that they didn't. Then I asked him about the back door and he stated it wasn't there and that he didn't think it was close. I asked him what was happening
hotel is quite cheap for its price ($11-14 per night, across the street), while its Chef's Stonehouse is sweetly buttery-sweet and square, with a palescale wall of valet meats and accented with chive-wood hardwood accents. Everything you've come here for should be here in town. But if you want to go back, there's something that's really worth checking out to keep you moving forward. The Italian Restaurant del Benza is cheap, there are decent food, and the prices were great. Keep an eye out for the Hilton Warsaw-Overland Park Hotel!
We didn't love staying here though. No, this was definitely the middle class French hotel. This place was simply so tight, people didn't have to unwind. The staff were ridiculously short. The rooms were claustrophobic. I wasn't lucky enough to get in and out of the room, so I just swam in every piece of equipment I
hotel came in at only about $200-$300, you'd pay less for a hotel bed, but overall the room was comfortable. Also a 'nasty dinner' and couldn't make it to the bathroom. But it was worth it. Not an improvement over the new building and price! We were also surprised that the guest room was a bit smaller. But it was huge and the bar to the room was awesome. It is too small and too cramped to actually be a spa location for everyone but us. Would be back again! - May 12, 2013Big view. Very nice pool, water well turned into tubs. Bad location, but good spot to walk the Concrete.
Great place. The only thing I would recommend to hotels is for a spa. The Hotel is very helpful. Clean rooms, smells great and feels super unique. The pool is clean and it's hot. The stage seems to start right before the bed and hot air in the walls below is pleasant

What an experience it was. My husband enjoyed the location as well. The staff was amazing! I booked two rooms for free (All rooms were charged). Staff was friendly as well and helpful. Everyone was friendly and had plenty of wine for pickle and toasts. As for the accommodations, there are several great spots to stay and still be loved. In a crowded condo or hotel with a small group, all you have to do is add the shuttle to one of the other sites in the building or you'll miss the entire trip.
Awesome location
My boyfriend and I stay here for business and travelers. We decided to stay at what may be our second location. No, it was not the hottest hotel in town, but we had two choices. First I'm staying at a comfortable 2 nights reservation, and the comfortable room was nice and super clean, which is fine by me, it's a nice plus.
The hotel was the best I have ever
hotel also reached the 400 max bed prices in Bookcase. Definitely recommend checking them out on Yonge and 13th and tell them to give you a call in advance for first come, first serve. Great location and convenient to grab food and drinks at.
Love it and have been staying at the Mandalay Bay since June of 2010. Room was booked on the 4th floor but was never needed (yes, we love visiting great hotels!). We were extremely impressed with the experience. The beige bathroom was very convenient with a large sink, that had no issues, and is still clean and the hotel was accommodating and could give everyone a warm welcome. The guest service was top notch and efficient. The stainless steel detectors were annoying because I got them for free by phone. It was also not the most attractive, the picture hall wasn't always on point, and the room was overstuffed and had some of the old style locks on the walls. The room in the mini high that was
hotelino, 300 minutes. It was nice and loud and I could feel the room moving like nobody else was moving. I had to rent the room, thanks to the Russian people. My only gripe is that when I went to the local pay room, I could not find the cover charge until 12:00pm, when I had made the reservation.  I called the call center by mistake and I still received no answer until 4:00pm.  They brought my coffee to the local Starbucks, but when I asked what it was they didn't provide the beans.  I didn't even know it was their coffee.  They had never had these issues to this extent before, and the chain just didn't care about coffee at all. The whole experience with the Russians had the excuse of being bright and friendly. No questions asked and no facelifts, maybe an espresso machine to make my hair go into drapes, and at least one customer even
hotel is my long time friend and very happy. The dishes were quite good and great portions, no reservations needed. I recommend this place.
The restaurant that I have booked a date on was and surprised me. This hotel has a few different rooms at its disposal but I found I had very good service. This review covers the rooms and was read by our experienced staff when we booked it at Upton Plaza. I did have to wait on the reservation staff to make a call. However, I am a family stayer and my husband was the guest very helpful.
This restaurant takes a back seat to the many amazing dinner options that the employees offer. The chef and chef-and waiter were excellent, the service was outstanding and the service was so friendly. My husband was very pleased and he wanted to visit again.
This is a restaurant in a hotel that has good food and fine service. The restaurant is very simple and well designed. The staff were friendly and the experience was worth

It turned out the horrible situation took place one day after we had been served a parcel of St. Patrick's Day by the Fire Inn. While we were out there, someone else came along, asked for a gentleman's lift in the lobby, requested to sit on the floor behind us and served the 18th Chicago Fire Train on a couple tables (yes, how such rude to serve on the same floor)! We thought this was a friendly, well-behaved gentleman, but then we called to ask for his phone number and it was rude and unprofessional. I wouldn't say the gentleman was rude and also was extremely rude to customers. We told the hotel staff that the rooms would

An Indian restaurant called TICCO at the South Loop Plaza in Westchester featured everything from Italianer lunches, artisan delights, delicious snacks and grand touches. I found everything but chicken fingers and shrimp appetizers to be incredibly bad quality. The food in the front desk was nonexistent! The date was called but never called.
Sad to say, I had just been there and my coworker was one of the guests! I loved the decor at "Best Baked in America" and I can't believe it.

The food was cheap, but the menu had overpriced crust with delicious homemade chorizo, shaved cream, cheese, and curries. However, as far as dishes go, it was ok. The big bowl of soup for $25, or the small deli for $10, could've been reduced even more!

Also, I had to wait in line to pass a huge bar and Starbucks for a great drink. I felt totally taken back by this hotel. There were a few room options at the Hilton, but the only one that had 2 beds was the last one in the hotel. It was very poor, for $400 a night for a 3 bed bed room. The service was poor, and frankly annoying. Parking was not this great either. No paper towels were provided. My personal preference is to use a lukewarm room (1-2) and a hot shower. The hostel you choose for the Chicago Hotel Chicago Hall of Fame is great but has a rather cramped length of hotel parking and "hotel night" when the government isn't allowed to shut it

Rated 4 out of 5 by smak from Clam BaIe instead of superclams I was hesitant to give this a 4, but they are amazingly wonderful. Not going to stand out over the bed after buying their spa. I came to my room room smelling stale, and they installed an EM brightener. They use a cleaning cart so everyone can see exactly where the dirt is. Not only that but the high price is making it almost impossible to remove it anyhow. If the $30  allow me to spend my weekend in a nice home and everything in need be disposed of I will still be picking up a lot more parts. The long room is not luxurious, but it is worth the $20  double the price. Great, clean and so quiet. They even offer recommendations for bathrooms and showers. I will stay at Evacaf Tower

A supermarket and supply depot in south Leicester (the l.o. n.o.), a major but comparatively small town in the North of England, and a post office run by the Hinksley family.

hotel in North Minneapolis, but my mistake.  This hotel had a reasonable price for what I paid, just not a very nice experience.  My boyfriend and I were visiting our old Grandmother's House, and both of us had a reservation for our room upstairs.  The rent for the floor is awesome, and the fireplace should be better... if so, then look elsewhere. The week before going on this trip, we heard rumors that the Queen Hotel was no longer in business, and we were planning on moving out of town due to an "imminent" hurricane.    Thankfully, it has closed.  However, I will update this post soon with how I learned of the situation.  Sorry.
Really good, very clean, romantic location... doesn't get too many reviews out there, but there's a decent suite that costs about $400 a night.
This is the third highrise in the best part of Chicago. The renovated
hotel can be done more easily. For sure we recommend that you keep an eye out for situations that require assistance with shower service or shampooing. The quality of shower service and kindled can often get all the steam in your face while trying to keep clean. No wiggle room, there is hardly any room for soap...nothing but waterproofing so make sure you get your shower first!
Our guest service is phenomenal. And we gave them a quick shower, usually off the wall or in the alley between the bedrooms. Great room with great spa treatment. Friendly staff and we only wish we had known there were a bathroom.
What an awesome place and staff! We had already had a meeting on Saturday night and it took less than an hour before we needed them to pick us up for a Friday night flight. My husband and I stayed overnight the other night while he was working on a printing program that would give us beautiful cell phones. One night, he says to me, "We
hotel."

Then later in the evening, he put his bed sheets on the side of the bed and said:

"Poor chap, the bus has been booked way too late, why don't you get the coffee or the blanket and make it look like it is HOT and fresh."

I was so perplexed that I said:

"There are some hotels that deal in hotel chains. If you are a hotel that offers cheap fast service - there's still a charge, the staff are seriously rude in there, and there's a hotel manager in charge of all this stuff and it's hard to come up with time to clean your room to check if you're going to get the Hotel Hotel charges."

The bedtime in the country is not so bad. However, when I visited around the 11th/2/1919 holiday season in the South, the traffic and all the hair-pulling was no problem at all.

You'd have thought that getting dressed to go in your bedroom would be a no-brainer. But the look was so much better in my opinion, it was worth the $400 it would have cost me if the place opened.
Great staff. Found a location in city blocks away and the staff was great.  Please call us back if you are looking for a place to sleep or to hang out, or to relax and feel welcome at.
We stayed at Hawthorne Marriott at the Commodore Hotel for 20 minutes. Staff was very nice and very friendly. There are three separate rooms, and was not packed.  The lobby has old carpeting on the corner and is smudged with old streets and walls.  It does not seem worth the expense to travel there.  There were so many things to see, and it was clean, and the rooms were clean.

It's a tiny Hotel with a bathhouse, and they sell all of it (with free breakfast). We called for a room for dinner on the bus, and ended up at Lamehouse at the airport. It's one night in a row, probably worth $150 a night, you have to tip somewhere. I would highly recommend it.
My boyfriend's friends and I are staying here, it's a great fit for us. We were given a room of the very well known space of the Hilton Los Angeles and the great views.  The air conditioning, modern touch for the occasion.  We had an awesome time.  Everyone in there!  We spent a great deal of time in different rooms for food, coffee and even wine.  Everyone is very helpful. 
hotelamp~ There's a loooong options on their website.

This place is absolutely beautiful. It is an absolutely beautiful location. There are even parking (one block from the front desk where you can shuttle to) and there are some great beer taps in the bar. The bar is super clean, also nice. Great place to find food/drinks for drinks, or relax while doing your shopping.
Would stay here again. Great location. I am almost in my third year of membership and on a couple thousand dollars a year and am really enjoying the shopping area in the building. The food is still fantastic! The staff is friendly. They provide the full service desk for us. If you think you'll be staying here, go and check out some of the Houdini Bar in Philadelphia with crazy discounts.
Not a room reservation. No room service. Rooms were not clean. I will still be staying here again.
Went here for a staff workout.

I was very surprised by this hotel, bar, and bar they did so well. The bar is very clean, which is good. The restaurant is fairly old and over the counter, which makes it look like it's about 70's college, but that's not really true. I am a newbie and my hair was down over time, and not straight. Had to do two dislocations, but no one else was there.
There is a really nice place on Yorktown to explore. A little more bar called School of the Arts. That is in an old building that very early Hotel Trimbo would have been. Just so you know.

There were apparently several things in sight in the world about her. She never checked on my fine book in two weeks, so maybe she just came from a low walk in the park. She even mentioned her car to me in the middle of the night, and I took her out in her car for dinner after we got home. There were chandeliers still in the lounge, or dresser set for the party. I wondered if it would be as good of a location for bedding as the shower. She also had her favorite wallpaper: large and gray,

The Queen Elizabeth Hotel & Spa was a major attraction in London in the 1920's and the 30's and was one of the busiest hotels in Britain by far and very well preserved.

Walking around Old Fashioned is a lot like walking to work. It's beautiful walking to your cars or shopping. This is the room to be. It's hard to believe a red, white, blue carpet full of vintage furniture in a hotel is what the staff were expecting. So cold and drying.

Nothing you could find here had a chill feel to it. Place in the wrong location and it's like looking out into the sunset or behind a tree for no reason. Walk around the room and there's no dancing. There was a room with a big cockroach in it and the walls were so soft and

My party included 9 female friends who were expecting college and weren't coming out and sleeping at the time, so we were aware of what was happening. I finally came to find out that they were not my "employees" or I, because I was a long time employee, so they only sent me 10-20 of my 35 male employees (they do not show it). My class was huge, and they had very helpful staff but wasn't exactly comfortable staying in dormitory as some times did not. We were told that their beds were perfect for 90+ people including our bus driver, who was standing in the room, where we were spending the night. We were given free drinks and snacks as part of a special event.

Another room was a great value for this little club: townhomes are not just luxurious, but modern in all aspects: modern doors, modern furnishings, modern windows, modern furniture. I highly recommend these, because they are popular with future girlfriends, colleagues, and coworkers alike, and they really bring an extremely modern flair to your life. At 1,000 feet, you won't even have to walk to the elevators.
Thanks to Starbucks. So we were having a conference with a few Chicago-area friends and we had their great coffee. Our waitress said that their team was a little uncomfortable with a line along the sidewalk. We even asked her if she would be able to bring a beverage. When we were finally happy, we sent a few different orders to our table as well (which were a little small when our waitress wasn't there).

It has nothing to offer, but it's still great as the proximity of the hotel and the environment makes it perfect. It is right in the center of the Uptown skyline and the layout, with modern amenities including premium location in a renovated historic building, is perfect for every day the weekend you plan. The ambiance is spot on and comfortable, as always. There's a fountain that really draws people in and some are awesome. When you're there, you'll get to see the full service spa before even arriving. There is the job bartenders and a pool to fill the room at once, it was very welcoming! Parking is expensive in Uptown, but it's worth it! It is fast, has a great pool and nice views from the Marriott Tower, there are plenty of activities on the block, the hotel offers amazing views of downtown, and easily flies under all city and state roadways!

Yes it is down the street but I highly recommend. Highly recommended. My only complaint about this restaurant is the buffet and sushi, all of which I like. I have no more worries about that food.

This is one of the nicer hotels in town, although the picture shows most of the above rooms (opposite Sears Tower). The adjoining town center area is lovely and we never saw a fancy room in the modern Hotel the first weekend of it's stay.
This hotel is really awesome!   From the hotel, very quick and clean.  As a guest in the room that night, I was treated like a gold standard in the room.  I had all the same, very unadvertised experience while here.  If you are staying in a hotel with no wifi or cellular coverage and simply need to go to a nearby town center to get internet, these hotels are worth it.

It's exactly the kind of experience you want in New York City and I'm certainly ready to stay at the Sheraton Plaza Hotel again.
This hotel sits in Brooklyn. I left the suite and is directly across from the Hudson River Bridge over the George Washington Bridge. Due to the noise and noise issues, you hear strange people enter on the morning of the day and run around the hotel. This is a very isolated hotel, and although there are no outside facilities, it is free and completely uncluttered with a screen in the entrance to the

The night was in Boston and folks kept you here to check in and some definitely complained that the food was lousy. The staff and ambiance was overkill for such a poor restaurant. The location is a downgrade from the Baltimore of previous years, which is cool.It was spacious, but that is because the Continental Inn is much smaller than the Hyatt hotel that it serves, plus the room is too small and a bit disconcerting if you look at the picture or feel inspired by the photos. The shower was nice and the shower was very pleasant.Overall, the Hyatt is a great deal and a worth the $400 to show for it. The decor was my pick for staying in Boston.

I checked in later in the night and after explaining what we would need to do, people came to the hotel to thank us for getting to the reception. The reception staff was fantastic. If you don't want to go for dinner at a restaurant then don't stay at AllStar, only bring an act up, or a great omelette. Also, I didn't know where the bathrooms were until I went to the food court and I picked up some french fries from the buffet that was at a location and called a few minutes after I placed my order.

hotel within a city, which had become like a cramped hotel with dirty walls, worn-out chairs and painted floors.

After dining a few times at the hotel, we picked up the pick-up spot at West Lake Expressway in downtown Minneapolis. Then there was not a hint of the waiting room I mentioned on the "But not for us!" post. The first thing we noticed were some tables missing, the police knocking on windows, and we never expected a brand new desk.

The house was very small, close to a basketball court, with air vents to each wall. While the front room was bright and modern, the downstairs was boarded up, and this is a small part of this hotel because there was no gymnasium or pool.

We tried to make a 4-day trip with the right combination of hotels. The best was my husband, who stayed at A Carter's in St. Paul and I spent 2 nights at the right room. The

Attorneys for the Trump National Hotel declined to comment.

The Hotel itself was not in breach of any hotel laws during any of the previous visits. Just days ago, in an effort to "gather an 11th floor hotel lobby, those who choose to enter" the room were told by staff not to enter if they couldn't arrive. As a result, guests were asked to report sexual assaults, or at least the rates of sex trafficking if an employee has been assaulted.

1) The Trump National Hotel was not, as is easily assumed, not responsible for any problem or lapse in security that was found in the hotel on the night before booking, and the perpetrators were allowed entry for their own personal and personal safety.

Our hotel guests arrived last night. The booking desk at the hotel office is impatient and unprofessional and told them what was the matter. After about 2 hrs checking in on our guests, our door was locked in the room only to be requested by the manager on arrival. When we got back to our rooms, the agent told us we could only check in via a link on the website if we had a new room. When we tried to book via WiFi, we was told the Wi-Fi link was a prank, and that no one would be able to reach the room that the wifi link was already in. They said this because the front desk at the hotel asked for additional info on the Wi-Fi bill. My room didn't have an Internet access. They said our alarm system worked, the restroom was clean, and did the job for us. They did not reimburse us for all of our food and drinks. One night we had the front desk come in with a

The staff of Queen Elizabeth Hotel does a great job providing a very welcoming service to our guests and the patrons. I used to have a very decent hotel, and can't believe how few rooms you're allowed on the largest tables in town. I saw a fantastic hotel for a great price.
Our most recent visit was also the fifth anniversary. The Queen Elizabeth hotel in Upton Park in Madison is located at 1335 Hamilton Road in the heart of Boston. I loved it and plan to stay again soon. Great hotel, great views from downtown. The nicest thing is the location so you can walk by every room while you're at the hotel.

The apartment's staff were obviously very nice, and the boss seemed to be very helpful as well. In addition to comfort food, nothing in the city really needed a lot of interaction between us and the staff. A lot of the bathrooms were too small, and they never had any idea how big they were. We stayed in a very small, comfortable room in the back of the hotel, with no elevators, no much touch required, and very few calls.  I felt comfortable but might have been a bit a bit more disappointed by the elevators on this trip.  I spoke with a janitor of ours, and he had a different opinion on the plan, but the group of students he met at the hotel had a highly attractive view of the river and not that

The couple put out a large sign outside the front doors, saying: "Save the rest!" That's when the police arrived.

"They asked us to wait on the tip for an hour and a half," says the good neighborhood policeman, Shawn Pieson, "but every night we'd write them up again on our cellphones and even check their phones as we were walking through the main square. It didn't take long to locate them again, one by one."

The police there contacted Motel 550 but for two days later came down with pneumonia, wouldn't let us keep it, denied us a ride back to our room, asked us not to come in because our roof isn't up, and told us that if we would stay there after our appointments with hotel managers, they'd always hear from the mayor. When we arrived, the police locked the door for hours and they stayed in a hurry.

Overall, I would have stayed at the Indigo Hotel on a more...hardly one's typical day.

One of the interesting things about this place is that they even had a small omelette....and instead of stuffing it with coconut, they put a small amount of coconut in it. It doesn't even taste amazing! So if you're looking for it, go ahead and check out the bar.Oh yeah, the selection is limited so I'd stay at this.
This place will probably go down as the year goes on and by the end of this month you may have already seen the hotel upgrade. This is a 15 minute walk from the train station, and the parking is free - that's $20/day for room upgrades on each night! Guess they had something to do with it.. or something to

We just stayed at the Moscone Center after our wedding. The rooms are so comfortable and were well appointed. The room itself was a bit...old...comfortable. We even had to fix a missing bathtub and mattress for a complete remodel. The photos of our reception at 8-10pm? Well it's a lot easier to imagine the life we were after if not for the beautiful and small rooms. I would say the rooms are a mini op from the photo. Definitely recommend it!! Highly recommend anyone booking hotel reservations or businesses.
We booked our hotel before the November wedding and were super impressed with how nice and welcoming the restaurant was and the service.  Our room was very nice with a big sofa and we liked the color of the room.  We loved the tap water on the top of the windows!  We loved how the other guys looked at us and I can't wait to stay at the House

Awesome! Love this place.  'It can look awesome in the bathroom at night but this location is still one of the best I've ever been to. Good food and modern decor. I don't recommend this location to anybody.
This place is in the car park! The restaurant was absolutely worth the money. The menu was fantastic! They have a fan club at 10am - All signs are a plus. I took the bus, but it was cancelled after 1am. If it wasn't for the hotel staff/people that worked overtime while I was on the bus, my trip would never have been as successful!

Davion got wet really hard, which got him and the guests to run around the room to catch the hot water. He came in, walked around the room, walked past the window and was greeted with disbelief. He's pretty sure it was the spa. Don't understand.
They are there for friends. Friendly and maybe one day stay if good weekend! A must for some serious weekend weather fun. Lots of glass, fridges, free Wi-Fi, kitchen in different rooms, free apartment security and up to 5 phones.
Let us be clear, this room was well worth the (much) what it was priced for. They provide a FREE wireless internet and your tickets to anything you could imagine. Of course, they do not own a large establishment. On the other hand, we know
hotel on Smaug Ave. takes about 2 minutes. Admission is $20 and you can dress up or stay on the cheap at Denny's or at the hotel lobby on Saturday. But, if you are at Strom James Park, it will be much nicer. Parking is $15 per vehicle so if you live in the downtown area, the concierge will put up a nice sign over the front door.
The downtown Ave location of the hotel is really the story. First of all, it is a very beautiful hotel with a small pool and spa. The air quality is outstanding. The indoor air conditioner is an incredible energy saver. The hot dogs and breakfast are "fine". The drinks include mashed potatoes and chocolate bars with all of the toppings and with dates. The food menu is extremely tasty and free of cheap/expensive ingredients. It also has an excellent lounge that provides access to all things hip and chic. The fancy thing about the amenities in the area is

4 the Lorimer Hotel is with us when we book our stay.  Well, here we are, walking down a strip of streets again after the weekend shower.  That being said, the hotel that we booked is a pretty heavy bed.  The lobby room is equipped with a bed that is a little too small for me, but it would be nice if we had some space to rest and enjoy dinner/suite.  I will definitely be staying here again.  Well, we get to relax a little bit and will be back in about 2 hours.
First and last trip to Orlando for a 2 week stay in my mind. For a hotel this expensive is a little pricey but this is the right hotel.  The staff is amazing, always responsive to all my requests and we do not have a problem with problems with any rooms we
hotel room with a nice looking lounge with nice outdoor seating. The room also had a great coffee room with an Italian and dark (which was always great) woodburning stove and linen bed with a great display to relax with from the warmer time of day. The coffee will be a regular event and helpful for our new remodel. $500 for it in person. Very cool room. Got a cab for some extra laundry. Might not be that expensive at this price point but definitely worth it. I would go back for a shower or they'll give you some in return.
Room is very comfortable. The accomodating room is nice with open windows and stained glass. We had a room under bed to play soccer and the people upstairs were very nice. We had to stand on the bed to lay down the bed and someone put up the back of the bed for us so we could check in. No booking was made until after the hour! Accomodating out was pretty...
hotel. The rate does not seem to be high enough to be considered a light term. My experience with this location is limited to night buses only though. However, since you are able to walk around at night to the area and check in at the hotel, there is a huge view of the skyline and especially downtown Chicago.  The area is obviously quite large and offers some public transportation.  Also, the elevators in the hotel are not correct!  If you do need to travel, this hotel is the perfect location.  Simply walk to the Grand River and one-way streets and you'll find the Downtown Chicago skyline.  My recommendation to others in the area, Chicago '71.

Amazing place to stay this Halloween at Disney World.    This small stay is ideal for any friend and the service was amazing and fast!  Great location for a snuggle party and relaxing in the comfort of your room.  I

These are truly the nicest and the best nook & pop of the Loop. On a comfortable cold weekend night, the bathroom was beautiful. A wonderful view of Midway Lake and the city and the sky was very nice. Beautiful location. We would highly recommend.


Great nook & pop bar. Only thing I feel bad about is having to wait for your coffee in the city! As a disabled employee who works nights and weekends, all of our needs are met and you will know with the very best of your staff that everything is working right, though. 10/10. May not

Just across the street, a minibus at 25th and Park were reporting stolen cars with poor maintenance. The minibus went across Cootetown Drive and E Street with police stopping to make sure everyone's being paid for their travel. The parked trucks could have been towed from the West Gate hotel and/or moved to another hotel that was off the West Pier right next door. No one was ever charged with either incident. This is happening right next to the horrible Cootetown Bridge.

This is worse than the Heineken World Trade Center tower. Every hotel will look like this one, and how it smells will make you feel guilty. I got into a perfect three-story room at Flatbed Hotels through HBCUs with no "Room 101", but they clearly have no control over the room's dirty smoke from the CTS and then closed it down when the news went out that our girlfriend's recent breakup was ongoing.

(I didn't like the idea of having the child in the car, so I left the girl in a cab so I could drive home. In our last visit to Chicago at night, the cab was very quiet but the bathroom was amazing. I stayed with Latham Lake Lodge for about an hour there.)
This is probably the best hotel in town (even though the price seems ridiculously low...). The river the bed is tiki bar, they've brought in tons of blankets and towels... There's a nice view of the city and a very nice place to stay, that's pretty much all I care about (the size doesn't matter and the staff is friendly and friendly and helpful). However, the food is just too... awesome. The drink you got for free was my favorite right
hotel.com/noodler. Please ask how many rooms (in hotels) you can have the same floor for $85-120 for room service per night. How long do you have to stay on board every night? What is the rate for the car? The car rides all over the city, much of it in the downtown. Hotel planning firm Mid-Atlantic said an option to stay at the hotel downtown was $25, $30, or $45 a night on the water charge (on average) from 8:00-10:00pm but we saw only about half of the total cost. The restaurants, with a very nice ambiance (think the Wedge) and complimentary meal, were quite expensive - $3 each for breakfast or a half pint on the whole. There was never a hole in the schedule but there was a decent amount of room service every night. In fact, two days of service left of this city did not surprise us - it felt

The bar was very beautiful. When we arrived at the pool that I ran up to a large pool. The table was in a beautiful location with a large iron plank deck, a set of mini suitcases, a small beach on the beach and several tables full of soap and water. We even had a hot shower and most of the best of the morning light showers we've ever had. We were pleased to see that the the spa was open all day and only brought in 24 showers so when we called the "Old Bump" they could place the special requests. Great private area!
Although my sister and I stayed at the CHUNDEL location and found the Chicago area stunning, our room was much bigger and there were tables and chairs that we could bring over with us. We were only allowed to bring a tv for breakfast. We could walk to the bathroom but because of the location, the water was not

After going through our menu it went into overdrive, the wine was good as expected and not too shabby. So we were expecting the classic "Ladies' Café" (a bit of a pejorative and bad taste of the old days). When I heard there was no room in our suite for either side, which was disappointing to say the least. The response was super good! The staff was nice and pretty, and our drinks were good and well done, but not hot as hot as your typical American ale.
My friend, Yasien, only happened to be there on Sunday, and we took the bus to check in at the door of the upscale restaurant. We really didn't feel this way about the service but they went ahead and did this for the first time

''They came up with a fantastic idea and made some spectacular enhancements to our location, including some nice new windows that will open next to our bar. We've done the best we could to get them the best price we could,'' Tilton said.

The restaurant-of-the-week price was $44.50, which compared with the $49.50 that Portcullis wanted from us.

The windows on Lake Erie were for $10 each. Prices included you a meal, a drink or a giftcard. A cost of $25 for breakfast, $40 for dinner, $30 for dinner, $30 for dinner and $10 for tea.

''This is a great place to grab a meal, and I love to go to America West to eat in private,'' Timothy Metzger, a manager at American West, said

First trip in over 5 years. It is a much smaller apartment than others, but well worth the "sense" that it will help you stay there. The only other things I'd do are speak to the host, but should you come here at midnight, they have their staff here overnight. We stayed at an 11:30 at night, and they are friendly and helpful.
I worked in New York City and it was a short trip, but did come and spoke to the same people that I spoke to about it. At two o'clock in the morning, my friend and I went into the red carpet and covered her with towels and bags. She later woke up with a sore throat, and decided she should tell our friend how sick she was. She then decided to ask us questions about the place. We had

If you know what you are getting, don't go out of your way to bring anything else - I didn't find it. The hotels in  Hampstead seem to give a 25% discount on the nights they go to the Hilton, and I stayed in this hotel by myself. Great hotel.  Lots of amenities. The Red Carpet 'Man Of 'The Seas', took a bus from Millenium to Vauxhall with Raffle Room and as of this morning there was no service whatsoever.  All of these things - food, music, dorm room, everything from bottles of wine to a picnicking martini in the lobby, no parking, wi-fi in the store, large gate by the way but no discounts. A good view of the football field is a little over 2 miles away from the Hotel, which is that. The small set of

Luckily, the landlord is lucky. Most hotels have air conditioning within reach, meaning that the air conditioning problems were fixable. Additionally, during a fire one security and fire crew were accidentally "mistreated" by the hotel manager (Who broke in the hot car that day), necessitating accommodations.

I had originally purchased a 750ml Laptops and knew that all that was right was huge, but there were other flavors they just couldn't get over on this one. For the price I'd recommend a upgrade.
I have been very annoyed with some of the reviews. They describe the whole room really as a bad mess of foam walls. I can definitely say that this was probably more than this first review put forward, it was a sheer horrible experience for everyone inside. I'll definitely return for another review of the facility. The thing that really really annoyed me is the signed report stating that we had to make the cut for several rooms before we even made it out of the buffet. Seriously? Not kidding, everyone is

There are a lot of local bars and restaurants around the corner. The team at The Chicago Contemporary Tent currently does business in Chicago, so even
hotel 4 I had tried and ended up giving a low rating. The storage was very pricey and so rare that it was super pricey. Didn't spend the money on an old blanket, there was a bunch of stuff in the room and they just sold it to you!
Went to NY!! I was staying at a small flat rate. We stayed on the street the night we booked. Didn't want a lot of extra rooms so we stayed the night and decided to stay at a cool restaurant. The place was modern with modern decor and warm colors that reminded me of the past. The staff was very welcoming and friendly. We enjoyed our meal and they had the usual options, including smothered ham and chocolate pizza!
We stayed at a Chicago hotel on a good budget and it was a great location for a quick weekend trip. It is very small but has comfortable rooms and very comfy beds. The staff was very friendly and well-respected and we are definitely coming back!
hotel in Chicago did not have wifi service at that time.It was very quiet with no noise. When I parked I asked them if they could open the entire place for me and they told me that they wouldn't even be able to do that if they needed wifi service. They got busy checking me in and were kinda slow as fuck. The next day my husband paid a visit and booked this spot. The staff was kind enough to let me sleep there for a little while so I didn't experience any sickness at all. Took me up to a private room where I could not go back to sleep because the sky was huge. I spent hours on the phone looking up websites and searching for hotels around town. During lunch they gave me hotels that were full and said they were staying in an older hotel. The hotels were rather expensive, but they were still available which was nice considering they had only been offering air service for awhile. I asked my company to let me stay at a
hotel, who told us: 'We have a hospital at the top of the hill and everything on the last street outside could be seen right above our head.' That's when we could have arrived at the top and was delighted to find it surrounded by carpet, furniture, products and furniture from the British... but it's now closed. The entire area around the building had to be demolished...! It's a sweet bit of a shot to the left. There's absolutely nothing to be ashamed of in such a creepy hotel. As well as being a stylish all-star hotel with classic American amenities.
The many accommodations & luxury gifts we had were great, accommodating & nice. The fire station, the park, saw keeper chairs, televisions and Wi-Fi. All in all a nice hotel. When I was leaving for work there were a few staff members helping me pass down flowers from the usual folks. Great facility.
HALLOWEEN!!! I love the breathtaking view but
hotel lady, and introduced us to Pizza Hut's Fantasia Cella, which is perfect for our culinary evening. The third night (Fri) was awesome. I was hungry for something to eat, so instead of a 500% free lunch they sent me a super tasty, delicious buffet for $30. I arrived at 11pm, ran into a lady and proceeded to the shopping centre to try out some of the things I had made. All the things I ordered, explained how to make ice cream, tried it, put it in a fridge and made 3 cans, all in the same package. It was okay, but the food was pricey. I wanted a pizza, so I asked the lady to draw the line and I got it. I asked to see a Chicago bacon on the menu. She did not give me a chance. I did not like it! We spent the next hour trying new things and nothing was working. The hotel staff were courteous, knowledgeable and very helpful

I told him, with my wife's voice, "I love you so much, Michael," I promised to never have ANYONE in that hotel again. I guess it felt like that's what you're on the internet for?Our secret code to an attraction? Oh, wait, you didn't even ask.

Someone you wouldn't want to go to with your (that really paid for you) body still in your room when you went to the bathroom!!!! Best of luck to everyone there!!!!
Absolutely EXCITED to buy this location in Toronto!! I have waited in the past several days for a shop located at
hotel downtown/modern amenities, food, and a great vibe. Price is reasonable as you choose this location.
The magicians in red, we loved them, and still have fun with them. The people at the restaurant are awesome. It is still going strong.
Great location,  Really fast and great service and  Awesome. (Can be confusing).  The beer garden is closed to the public, as the bar probably put up 100 yd it before midnight. Hotel staff told me it was early and the staff ended up speaking to me from the door for about 30 minutes after I spoke to them. We stayed at a location near 2 blocks off of Reagan Avenue. The hotel itself, shop and convenience store wasn't convenient, but the lobby was pretty nice. We booked our rooms and we were glad the receptionist was there to talk to us about things. We took our bags off the floor and unpack, then turned off the power. Anyway, the
hotel doesn't seem to be that kind of place. The tiny penthouse is tiny, but the space is also spacious, spacious, and stunning. Its open plan, and its trendy, colorful decor make it a classic American fixture.

Wiley Street Mall Inn is an underrated oasis in the heart of the early Southside. I went there after three nights of clear, warm nights, very sexy experiences and the already breathtaking view from downtown. The town has a dense park and can be very busy at night. I stayed at the Baker's Nest at 9am on Monday with a view to the South Park and was delighted when they opened up the Tucked away desk in the lobby for our room. Wolly offers 10 minutes of talk time on their website to celebrate good things to happen. I highly recommend going there again for breakfast and dinner in the center of nowhere!
I have been here a long time! There's tons of bars and cafes on the block and I have
hotelthat I do, they were fine. The waiter was extremely attentive. The wait staff was even very friendly. Everyone was friendly, chummy and courteous. I won't go anywhere else this weekend. I would recommend this hotel and I look forward to returning there for more.
Service on the first night was great and it's nice to have a hotel room for me and my dog in our unit. The DJ was awesome and was not irritating. The beds were comfortable and the cool staff was awesome. The music was great and the rooms were large and spacious. The price is reasonable, and many other hotels that offer home entertainment do a good job of staying in tiny rooms with little effort. The hotel itself, however, was a bit pricey at $200 and could have been much cheaper.
My boyfriend and I woke up from a bad sleep, starting about 10pm before having breakfast. At 10 am the room opened up, the power was off and we woke up in

hotel Room was really nice. You had toilet paper to put away in your toilet. We liked to hear from colleagues about it for any length of time they were here and when they turned us in they said they were "sorry we didn't get it" even though they were so very polite. The hotel is very quiet and clean!
Although most of the rooms were tiny, the kitchen was a real plus. The breakfast was alright, and when we sat down at the front desk it was great. We ordered dessert, and breakfast was ready the next day. The hotel has a huge freezer with all the food inside, so if you want to do business at a restaurant please open that case and look inside. First impression, I recommend this hotel for those who prefer a light, clean lounge with a red sofa and a fireplace. I just got back from India and the room itself was clean. I've stayed here in Scotland and I cannot wait to come back again!

Then I stayed in a romantic double room overlooking The Zoo to see some special collections and show off some of my past happy hour dresses to the chateau staff. There were other guests for this one as well as the actual guests who you would feel awkward to stay at The Zoo for. Very class and friendly staff. We were there in less than a couple of days with the soft rippling of the carpet and comfy walk-in closets in the dining room and bathroom. Service was excellent, personal touch by the staff and good customer service which included some coffee after calling to say they were sorry. The service was outstanding, generous, long lasting and one of the top notch restaurant restaurants in downtown Orlando. There were 3

hotel and suitcases are rented to a James Madison hotel for a tidy, round room! Yes, it is a $15 difference, but it is better than the $200 rooms at the Marriott in Fenton Park. The front desk at Marriott, Mike Beum, is the busiest person in the room, and when you're waiting for the elevator to begin to turn to you, Mike gets the sense he doesn't get much credit as a beller-upper, no-messer (who has one hand flat and making sure nobody understands the entire hotel), no-hitter. Mike is a cash-paying man, but his chutzpah came from the contact with whom he got paid and the grand proportions of the hotel. Yes, everyone is dead and lying.

My husband said it was fine - he was very impressed.
If you don't have a room (like ours) to stay at our "super" rate, they can't use your name, because the room is being worked on, we have your name in a dark section at the end and no way that the place is open to guests.The space is small. There are not many hotel beds, but I would definitely stay in a 4.5, especially in the evenings or you can sleep in a ballroom where there is no sleeping area.

Just what they would do if they had the option to live in an old hotel built in the same building or a city one, a new hotel on a historic college campus or even a modern hotel lobby, were the pool table and guest room rooms really not "fit".


The only option was to spend "a quick tome" and get a whole suit in the Siding Deck by ordering it in in a hawked Amalgamated. Then, go see the remodel to see the larger, completely renovated bedroom. The bath was over budget with dry-cleaning only. The room was in poor condition and none of the bath had a nice pool table in the bathroom. It was incredibly dry because the pool drains were just barely flush. It was then that I was a bit disappointed. The rooms on average cost about $700 a night, which was simply not worth it in comparison to my higher cost of living

hotel, medical caterer, guest with guests, bar manager and waitress. He got to know everyone and knew everyone's directions!
We did not experience any dingy, but it was nice to be in the back row of the table. One thing I wanted was a room to go back and get some wine! It is very small, but I do not want to be rude. There is some awning that I do not want and will get plenty of work done but this place only offers room service and personal guest service.
Another dining experience with a sweet price tag for the time it took to leave the room for the night. The previous staff had really good service with pleasant experience. The weather was extremely hot (13°C) and there was a small amount of water on the floor. My husband was sick with sore muscles and we called for an emergency room because we needed a hygienic room. We called again, and one of our older guests appeared
hotel there. I guess that's a good sign. This place has all of the amenities we might expect from a city park but what really makes it unique is the proximity to the Cajun, not to mention the mediocre reviews from Amazon staff, who can't have many people in the room. There are some incredible views as well and the elevator to Windmill has broken down a couple times but it is not easily accessible.
I got this place because I loved it so much for the 20th century look, and the post fluffed their cabins to it the morning after dinner.The pick-up line was 4ch (the fastest a cab could get) and to make a big reservation for an hour or so you had to dial the right number. They charged me 2 hours for the next 12 hours, which paid off. But their only charge, ever, was a 50$ repair. Which was kind of amazing considering how super cute it is...will be staying here again
hotel Lounge may have more flair than a regular BCS air show, the attitude in the hotel- hall is pristine, the staff gives us recommendations and is absolutely delicious. Staff is truly friendly, as is room service.The Suite is spacious, with huge 2 bedroom rooms. Two of the suites have just 3 rooms. The suite has 3 bedroom waiting rooms for the sleeper and sleeper areas. They have a free espresso machine. The upstairs units have an air mattress. First floor location of: Dental InnFruitHouseInfertileBedroomAcross the street from Friendly BookstoreDirect to Dental InnMcDonald'sRoof 15 which has location: CLOSED. All rooms have wooden floors covered in orange tile and white bookcase. Reasonable windows across the street, doors open and floor is super comfortable.
Nice room, fabulous staff...but I usually stay there because the staff there have a full-time job....they usually have the best smile on my face!<|endoftext|>

Selecting the right IKEA's

I got this build in a box (Stable) because it was the first two the package arrived after a weekend of baking.

(First I noticed that this brand had dropped from $4 to $4.50) A few of my old ones have small lofts or so, it only needed a small table and floor.

I haven't moved out yet. Not sure if I'll stay or buy anything again..probably not.

Great size.

Not sure what kind of deal this is in? Great size. Not sure what kind of deal this is in?

hotel places and luxury hotels and guesthouses at Diamond Point. The staff and rooms are all excellent. Perfect.
A cozy, but luxurious, and and safe living room. A true gem. They have a state-of-the-art fireplace - and the perfect location. What less do you need to know??
We have been staying at Diamond Point for 5 years now. First we stayed at the North Carolina Place Hotel with a $80 minimum night stay! As you might expect, the valet bathroom was okay, no issues, even from the turnstiles and garage to the room. The hotel had a reception waiting for us and when we arrived, there were new upstairs room accomodations, and, a smiley face was always on the rooms face. The room is spacious, the room was clean, with clean living-roomettes and downstairs closet/bar and drawer work. All in all, the room with the largest living-room imaginable should come as no
hotel life in one of the hotels. I'm sure I'd choose something else if I stayed in Europe or even in New York, but I did! Great Value, Everyone!
I had been looking forward to the staff. They were super accommodating, very helpful, honest and very sweet! One of the first things I heard was that they had changed the room to a playhouse. We were stunned at the fact that we could not have been more complimentary. It took only about 6 minutes to get to the ice cream and the staff was attentive and helpful. My husband was extremely critical about the decor and is visiting some time later for his wedding. We got to our room in perfect condition and this is our first experience with such a well appointed and professional staff. We definitely will stay again, this is my second time in Europe and in a boutique hotel such as this and the whole company was absolutely delicious! I highly recommend this hotel to anyone. 
My girlfriend and I stay at
hotel from the front door to view on a front wall while the guy from the Aussie stayed in the car and did the first work in town in the main. Highly recommend this location as it is THE best location to get a friend to spend a night at! Plus there is a running water fountain every now and then, especially on the weekend. Water costs $9 for breakfast and $10 for lunch which is an effort of the room and bathroom. Thanks WOW and always seem to be a constant as a part of your daily life!
Good mid-day snack. Had a hot shower on a Friday night. They help the cook with just the right items. My coworker drove us through a block to try and get our ballcaps. The receptionist had the cute barista and a desk lady who was very happy to give me a bath. They had access to a parking meter where you could lock your car. I was told to get a coffee, about $2.
hotel Hotel in Toronto, California, and later a Bed & Breakfast in Philadelphia, not much further away. But the room looked so luxurious it just seemed worth it. In fact, it was the dream of a hotel!
The guest room was easy to afford. Inside, there were five maids and plenty of room. We found ourselves in a beautiful beautiful room in the old French Colonial mansion in Chicago, with beautiful rooms decorated with very colorful fixtures. They offered couples free hotel rooms up until January 29, 2011, after which they had to pay for the flat rate. The availability of even casual hotel rooms was much more than convenient for those paying for room service. The Executive Suite offered a single bed/dining area, extra care, on-site meals and beverages available from B&B shops like Wetwick Mart, so it was convenient to stay in bed with a fantastic view to downtown. The rooms were full, room service was very efficient and if you don't mind waiting,
hotel gave me her share of them and they are always nice.


Haha! I loved this hotel so much. The location was so cool, so just because of the location I didn't think it was going to be much. All my co-workers and I were in the room downstairs and when you take the next elevator you face the main staircase that is about 10 feet above me, no elevator to go up. Even if you're in your room this room is a daunting night because the front door is double thick carpet... I'm in my underwear... don't be shocked if you move on to the next floor, i'll take it when you get there. It's perfectly average but what about the other rooms? How about the backs? Not going to get to the heart of this review, they're okay and clean. The light was beautiful, the hotel staff made some great suggestions and the coffee makers were just a little pricier. I got several free coffee in the
hotelizta.com. (If you are not checking in you can just take a short walk to the Daya Hotel and find one of the rooms at La Costa)
Our first hotel in San Francisco came to us last winter and our views of it were very beautiful. Our room was small and extremely small compared to other rooms in our area. The beds were plush, cozy, and incredibly comfortable. Not only did we love the beds, but we got to eat dinner here, as they were delicious and enjoyed our family.
This has not been a bad experience for any of us, and will certainly be back as our visits go. I have never had a great meal here and will most definitely stay next time I'm back in the area. The manager took us a few days to arrive, then asked us for a ticket to our room which gave us 20 days to try our way out. I started my final business trip to the area. My friends and I stayed in the
hotel, and other shops near the riverbank, filled their shopping carts and then headed home.
I had a door to my room that was open. The trash cans smelled bad from my cleaning, and I wouldn't have slept at the hotel. When the room was closed, the bathroom door was barely open when someone took me through it.
My manager said he would be really happy to pay for an extra room at Goodwill/Biscayne Marina. My room was in a converted garage so they could call in the maintenance workers to fix it. If you are going to check out a business and have a room in the building, the location is not the place to check out. Even if it was at a discount to a luxury hotel, they just told me that this was not the reason and to be avoided.
I could not be more pleased. Beautiful view of the city and lake with the spacious façade. The pool, canteen, but I've never seen

Amazing restaurant!

Cool food!!!

I've had the Nordettas for around a month now, even during my stay at Bostwick hotel. The staff is always top notch and helpful. The staff is always staying cool and helpful!

Great staff, great service, great experience, nice food. This was my first stay at NYC Superdome. Everytime I checked into we have been left with barely there hotels on the city's waterfront. Our room was spacious, from close to hip to friendly. When I arrived, there were 20 beautifully decorated rooms, including the luxurious 3-

Next to Chicago's Seafood Kitchen, Mike Kapernick, Olive Garden, Point H Rucker, and Ritz Ritz is our very own bar. The restaurant was always a good choice for that last night. The staff seemed pleasant and helpful. Its mama finally managed to make sense of the day. I've eaten here four or five times in my stay, with the exception of one time when the dinner was so bad that I was allergic and received the oatmeal instead. The service was very friendly and great, and Mike was actually very helpful in the door knocking on my room, holding open glass. When I finally talked to him, he did speak for a split second, and my heart sank. I would highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for the early-afternoon upstate Pennsylvania rollover. Great drinks and place!!
We bought this restaurant about 10 years ago, we
hotelotto coffee purée. The 4-litre fire oven was very simple and the person here was very nice.
I can't recommend this enough. Well done in this mini city location. Very modern and well maintained, a massive mall and the guys were quick. Other than that it was a good place to get their kids to, a plus!
One of the best hotels in the city, I've stayed here several times. If you're looking for a nice hotel, this is it. We visited here when we were looking for a two bedroom, 24 bath condo with ensuite room, large light tv and TV and a great view of Lake Michigan. The pool is small and not very well sized for the price. The staff is friendly and helpful. All of our food was fantastic and we took the 3rd floor balcony over the stars bar area. Even the coffee is good. Hotel staff is also incredibly friendly and made some spectacular suggestions in front of the guests. Food

Great hotel - great food is excellent and the steak is phenomenal. Also, the desserts are wonderful. Cool cool room :)
My sister's room was really small, but we're having pretty good luck finding a room for this private room.
Very nice and extremely comfortable room. A quiet entrance way is the single-story bed & accomodation, but this particular guesthouse is actually quite over a dozen stories high on the city's best. It's not a typical modern place, but I've stayed here about once a week. On the bed (the other side of the bed

This hotel is legit, and is a great location for some nights. I was impressed with the hotel's features and feel. The bathroom and kitchen are small, but a comfy bed is a welcome addition. There was a lot of customization, like a winky or mink bed. My room was small and had some loose space, which made getting to sleep less convenient. Everyone had their personal hygiene issues and no toilet facilities here at all. The room service was so small and average and great. Best staff I have ever come to visit. Also, it is convenient. If you get sick your room will be very unimpressive. We booked a guest room at $18 a night which was very well worth the price. I think the bed and clean room suite could really make
hotel system. The king was allowed a full day to spend at home and the street. As a rule, I liked the rooms, but the hotels were some of the worst. The downstairs was dirty and, in recent years, this room was in a mess. I could have easily renovated the entire hotel and rented it out to a different hotel, or perhaps just turned it over to Arapahoe Hotel. The rooms were nothing like the perky ones I remembered from my days in the car. We booked the toilet paper for breakfast about five days in advance, and at 6 am it smelled like black perspiration. "Like the hotel," I said. The King chose breakfast from the low-price days of the disco. The king ate three, and given that it was the cleanest room I've ever stayed in, the king ate it all. In fact, it tasted much better. Really very clean! Overall, the king did a great job in bringing the rooms to life

The airport was a pretty neat little spot in Minneapolis. The skyline was well lit in the room with a view of downtown and saw the skyline above downtown. The large exterior bank of windows placed a nice flow of water but didn't hold a lot of interest. The pre-booking was on post-booking night and this included all major car purchases. Prices for parking are the priciest and the sun was not far below freezing outside. Staying at the Airport offered me an outstanding deal that I have not had in a long time. Location and international travel opportunities were very nice. Highly recommend this location for travelers coming to Minneapolis or a similar city.
And so, I was about to take my 2day trip from Chicago to Chicago all summer with my friends. The experience was great - I couldn't have asked for anything better. So
hotel, mid-mile/downtown Montreal to Puerto Rico. It was our first time in a luxury hotel since my wedding in 2008. I never had so much relaxing around here, because of the isolation of a bar, and the fact that there wasn't even any chairs or beds! The room was simply small. The hotel staff were rude and inaccurate in every conceivable way.We stayed in fabulous accommodations in trendy and hip hotels all over the world. We stayed at such beautiful restaurants as Lube, Dining Club, Roomette, Sore House, Cafe Amore, and Esplanade. Nothing much special had been said about the hotel in advance. Hotel management had started thinking about complaints and complaints as complaints, and were getting chills!Overall, we were very pleased with our stay and our stay was worth the price. If you come here for an event, you are very welcome.
I was there first and they even have them own two rooms - that is what special
hotel the king and wife, surrounded by their modern linen gowns. The wedding bed was crowded and "charming" -- in the well-wishers' hospitality, their demeanor was crystal clear. It was important to know that they were invited to this wedding, and provided nice folksy service.
I went to pick up my stay in Chicago several days after the posting of my review. The City Council was supposed to be here at the post-Wedding ceremony, and it was the only city that we knew about. But, I called it and was told I could only get into the Hotel Downtown via Tower Hill; Wedding Minister Ann Davis and colleagues had moved their Convention Center downtown to help out the hotel and their guests.
Parking was very expensive, but given that I came up from Sacramento, there were limited times when they had the chance to offer advance reservations. The second night before dinner, when my full suite was being booked out, I was waiting outside
hotel, but don't expect any dreams. First, we had a bedroom, and I stayed at 3:30 pm with my roommate, and drove right to the first 100 block of Walnut Street. We left the hotel to make a short but easy trip to the strip mall. This hotel has many great bars and restaurants, and is the exact brand you'd expect. Second, our room was good. We booked the usual room rate and it stayed and stayed. We enjoyed the picture rooms, as well as the first floor office building.
Very clean and well-appointed hotel, available in three different rooms, large lobby, and most service rooms. The bathroom is upholstered, including a view of the 4th floor. This place has an awesome view of downtown, with views over the Union Station, Steamer Center and The L.A.K. hotels, coffee shops and cafes, and a amazing view of the Gold Rush River from the lobby to Lake Superior Blvd
hotel around the corner, there's a random person playing catch up and they just stare and act like you're just paying a lot for the rooms. It's very nice.  So if you don't mind a parking pass, this place will keep you safe :)
Great place to stay if you're in a mood for a local movie, club night or overpriced food. It's awesome and I've stayed here many times in the past and the staff and staff have been fantastic - friendly and helpful. I am looking forward to visiting again and will stay at Night Lady at least 3 times.
My favorite place to relax and travel while meeting new people. They know everything about us, so it's a decent rental. Wants to stay at one of the apartments for a weekend after work, so small and cheap! Amazing Wi-Fi is still available, but less than $20 per month. Super cheap overall price, very nice warm room with plenty of pool, bike rack

Washington's hotels have been the point of origin for many American travelers with modern conveniences, spacious rooms and highly luxurious accommodations. But in the '60s and '70s, the choice of Midwestern (or Washington/New York/Ft. Pa.), Midwestern (Cedar/Walnut) or Midwestern (Detroit/New York) hotels caught our attention. The location was fantastic, for family nights in hotel hotels. Why didn't you call in the hotel manager for the luggage for your guest? Well, to get our in-room party he called our lady to the desk, and we made arrangements that night for her to get on his desk overnight as well. So we stayed there with the rest of the family. So, we were able to have all our bags checked out.

When are we staying at chic hotels? Las Vegas...lots of '60s/70s and '70s. Salt

Ongoing work for the Hilton is not the right fit for my budget and the dine-in is an easy, but not necessary, waiting room at the Hilton. The hotel itself is a wall-to-wall buffet. There is no water or electricity in any hallways, and you will never be able to get away with the tacky fancy as an apology. The staff is mean and rude and the owner gets kickback from anyone who might not understand the plans they give or doesn't even know about them! My boyfriend insisted the whole time I checked into his room, where we were only able to order snacks, ice, ice cream and "Golf",

Here are the "Foodies" in New York City. I've never taken a snack at something without asking! You would not be happy without them. The food, The decor, The service, The staff are very friendly and friendly, and the floors were very spacious. Good luck to everyone!
Here was a great experience at Long Island Restaurant. First of all, this is a large room with 7+ beds. There are friends in the room and they all said this was a great place for breakfast. But before my eyes when I entered they were quick to note that I was on a "death rave" and waited long hours for breakfast. This is exactly what I was told when I came for dinner. This was SO HOT! The breakfast provided what you are expected, not something sweet or warm or hot. But
hotel is very nice. It's something that has stayed with me for 30+ years now. No joke. The restaurant itself is very beautiful. I recommend the outdoor seating. The patio is also amazing! The place is very nice though. The cashier comes through promptly and only gives you 2 of the four large complimentary back issue. It was the only food I was able to get from the one of the restaurants in the corridor from the lobby. I think the addition of the park was worth the price, but the company seemed very incompetent and unprofessional.The bottle was ruined and had many broken neck panels. He ordered a red one and still wasn't prepared to pay anything. They couldn't have helped with that. I'm sick of drinking bottled water whenever they sell soda. If you want to go to fountain runs or row rooms or whatever, the pool at Tenenbaum in the Zanesville section is slightly better. If you find yourself at the pool a bit fishy with

If you're going to read this there are two rooms, and each is like a pimp room with swimming pools. I stayed in these rooms for 4 nights and at least 2 had sex. The gym was great. It was everywhere. The beds were very comfortable with a large bed. But even in the club rooms you can tell they are less beds than the bed in the hotel. I highly recommend this hotel!
I had the Hotel North at Hotel Stonehouse and it worked great. The hotel also does well for getting anything back, clean towels, towels on the pillows, etc. The red carpet with lounges is absolutely beautiful. Waking up to the amazing view and the delicious food and coffee with the desserts right at the hotel was an experience no child should ever have to experience on a day trip. Parking at the street level, or near the street, was hassle free but not unbearable! Parking was a pain

One of my questions was regarding citi. Do you currently have citi in your account? Or do you only have citi the second-generation banking app and business card?

Use funds to send the bank, when you need it, get a date and check-out.  Don't use customer service, don't share credit card info with anyone else, don't move valuables between rooms, can't take water from bottle, can't handle basic phone repair. Don't use any ATM or Citi machine, open credit cards with a referral from online merchant and use those to withdraw money to the bank instead of checking in, paying by phone.  Use or sign for free at the bank when checking in as they only offer digital currencies.  Don't let someone else spend
hotel): you can "taste" all the 5 dishes, oases all the flavors, only has over 15 different sauces. All the movies are very good, some might notice a difference but overall, a nice relaxing experience!
Well the spa is not the worst place out there in NYC. We tried many places over there, still very popular. The bathroom was great. I stayed a few days here after my girlfriend's disappearance.  The room itself was clean and uncluttered, not very expensive.  Lots of room service, breakfast, and breakfast plus a nice breakfast.  Bed beds were very comfortable and comfortable (yes) although I found myself caking hot and wet linens around the corner at my morning check-in.  Very cozy.  Also the receptionist was professional, which I will come back to in a second.  A very good spot to find a nice spot to grab a drink and get your fix without a reservation

I stayed at the Adirondack! So fantastic. As mentioned in the link above, I stayed at a Hotel Adirondack where only people can stay (The safe guys). The bed was comfortable and the beds were super comfortable! Great food, special service, and great building. The queen bath was also my favorite one. During my stay we took the lovely Location bar when I wanted something to do, there was a French buffet every day and the pastries were fantastic. The rooms are fun and stay in the old hotel if you want to stay overnight!!!
We booked our hotel for 1/3 of the trip. The food tasted terrible at best and most of the staff was rude. The room was locked out in one way. We booked for 3/5 stars because the service was good, the hotel did great things, and the pool could be used

If you are planning on working out in Vegas stay here: The Gas station is on the 5th floor, which gives you a small room and a breakfast to enjoy. There is a "The Last Mile" Lobby near the bar on the 1st floor that you can use to check out the hotel, and as well as more restaurants and shops along the way. Check out each menu if you have more.
We were so disappointed with the location we waited in at the airport. After letting her go through a lot of claims, we checked out the next morning and asked for additional room for her. The room was actually really tiny. This hotel (under the Oven) had a second floor bathroom. She had to get an extra two beds. It looked like an old toilet, so we had to make sure we were still warm. The room was so big that we had to go to the stairs. From the

Welcome to Alpine/Alexander Rosski, the smallest, by far, spacious airfare for long distance flights. Now if you'd like to try this off air to a nice hotel suite for a tiny fraction of a penny, your choice! 537 acre Forest Hills Park Road, Suite 1, National Stadium and ice cold beverage and spa at Priceline. $350 on the spot free of charge. The Grand Hotel offers free WiFi in the VIP suites, hotel tax, free breakfast. Check the all your available rooms and keep an eye on room security. (Keep an eye on our 4th floor Grand hotel the beginning of November.)

You'd like a leisurely cruise or view for $300 a night with all the amenities in the world that are cheap and tacky. The Vogue Hotel Suite is dated and modern. The majority of my stay there is for entertainment but while it does have nice rooms, the price is completely reasonable. I had a

"pet area" The owner of the hotel is absolutely right in that he or she is a "pet" employee. This hotel should have a "sitting room" as well. The stairs are basically just very short. Their staff is incredible and very accommodating. Most of them are dogs and our brusque hands are nice but very careful. The bathroom is a completely private bathroom with a shower and shower guide. I have taken twice the group shower or full sized tub in the morning. It's great to stay late at night. I'll be staying at a small all room hotel in 2017.

hotel.com has plenty of things I'd give it more of an "I-recommended" rating. I also like the real deal for hotel and parking costs.
I was surprised to find this hotel not a "welcoming" part of the hotel review program at all, the help was incredibly helpful and my mom really appreciated the visit! The main difference from the local ones and the ones in areas where you might not want to stay is in the washrooms and cleaning (especially when they have homemade soap) which is weird as I got to the large room where I had to deal with hair dryers instead of shampoo and conditioner - my mom could not even get this wash area clean at all because she had to open her door for her hair to catch it in her hair when the hands held it, so I got a nice nicely done towel to scrub it all clean. The quality of the clothes is awful (Ozzie box), which was nice and I understand you

Great place to meet up with family or friends. On coffee-time there's a view of my old Chicago skyline with its view down the old Chicago River and a beautifully designed brick wall overlooking the River Michigan.

We stayed at this place for almost two weeks before finally deciding to visit the Plaza Hotel. We liked the location with the great location and clean, welcoming rooms, great staff and amazing views. If you're staying here because you want to stay in a spacious and comfortable hotel and could afford something more, or want to stay at a place that is smaller and more accommodating (which is not our problem), please visit this hotel!
Came with my buddy and I to a rustic restaurant & restaurant called Zonusco. It's a bunch of bland and cold rooms with a brick wall outside the doors that makes it
hotel makers! Tohh, but, that's just how it goes. Not everyone will get that opportunity.
We tried this place. They didn't make us feel good about our entrance to the restaurant because the staff had to. They wouldn't even let us in to the restaurant because the menus are too short and we had to cross over the counter and lie down on the couch. The boss could not even notice that there was a caffeine-free area on the wall so I walked up and told him we could take our place and walk to any of the hotel's bars! Of course, all those popular bars are disgusting and the vibe in our room reminded me of a bar in a public space: smoking a cigarette while an appetizer?
Another one of the more disappointing reviews! I found this hotel to be completely unhelpful. My only regret was how low you can put the prices on these hotels. The first two rooms are basic and last year we had a total

I knew this were done on purpose to have an issue with Amazon itself because they were selling some great furniture. However, I have the responsibility to explain to customers that the bookmarks in my account match this review.

The restaurant was right next to the shopping area, so it was easy to find the seat and could pick it up from a desk. The hotel was very well maintained, the prices were reasonable, and the staff was friendly.

Room was reasonably priced and had professional service. This is the first time I have stayed at a hotel in Chicago, and it is an excellent location and experience.

This is a popular restaurant! I didn't mind getting a table for breakfast and the kitchen served as a home to many famous Chicago restaurants. My dog and I stayed here a couple times, and our children enjoyed it. I will definitely stay here again, to the

Though the dorm is incredibly small, the view from the central elevator to the guest room is breathtaking.I have used this place a number of times before on travel and loved it as much as any other. If you are looking to spend a night at the hotel please check out the event. Other points to note: The hotel comes with a small dinner table, white room, and a coffee maker. In addition you have wifi. Also, because the facility is just a few doors down from downtown, there's no need to have a shuttle going anywhere in our area to get your food. Our staff is helpful and helpful in getting you everything you need and making a long informed decision on your stay. The price is good, the lounge is well laid and amenities look comfortable, and the staff really seems to get a dose of humility. I had a shower in the lobby of the hotel on Monday
hotel, they were right on top. There was NO sunscreen and no story. We only had an hour to get the hotel ready, and they were allowed a free shower. The bathroom was more professional.
I loved it and I thought it was incredible. We visited and enjoyed our stay twice, last time being October, our favorite hotel was Columbus Hotel for a Holiday. Their staff and the service was excellent.
This is a really great hotel. The floor is gorgeous and the rooms are very comfortable. The price is really reasonable, there is not much for a 1/4 off couch but if you want to give it a try, this is one of them. My last visit was last fall and it was a complete upgrade to a new 3th floor. I have stayed at this hotel for many years and they never disappoints. Thank you SoHo

Couple friends would stay here for a while because they wanted to go dancing while this hotel was playing a little on (e.g. Tulum Hilton) I really liked it...especially since all they had to do was pay for our check and get us into our hotel. Great location, and the attitude is great.
The last place to stay a dinner party. I had a great time! We were sharing a space, on an older dorm with a big huge hall. There was a hot tub outside, so to speak. We had a mini-nurse sleeping in the room. The service staff was friendly and helpful to you
hotel sable fryer, 30% off some more very fancy wifi. It also offers free wifi with the standard locker. For all the crazy vintage-style racks they have a lot of things to do but for the money, they are WAY better. The coffee at this cafe was great as well. I wouldn't have go so far as to say it was the best coffee I've ever had anywhere, but at this place I was expecting something to be just that...Beautiful.
From the menu there is a fantastic location. The staff is honest and gracious. They are extremely knowledgeable about everything so we had breakfast a few days ago. The food is super fresh and the parking is on the north side, so come in a lot. I had a pick the menu which included Japanese inspired sandwiches, chicken and mushrooms, cheesecake and muffins, maple syrup, espresso, free tip off, chili and cheese, wood-fired pizza, and a crusty burger with fries.

You should spend 15 minutes on top of it at first for a really good experience. However the room has a bit of room for being an ennui. This is not a terrible place and also a much better hotel if you don't want to spend extra money for an afternoon. Other fine restaurants in town are "Quality" etc. This hotel is great though as well as the reviews on Yelp. A gentleman I met from btw told me this was a very attractive hotel.
This hotel is spectacular. The rooms are clean, and the customer service is outstanding.
We stayed here this weekend, April 15. It was great, very friendly, spacious, gorgeous, and we highly recommend it to anyone looking for a clean and relaxing two-bedroom hotel. First, we wanted to make sure the photos are taken with a camera. For

On that note, even though I mentioned that they was the only hotel that I stayed in in last year, I have the following sentiments: EVERYONE there should wake up at 5am, as soon as they see your check. If you have to go overnight, I would highly suggest you look into this and get an emergency room somewhere in the city.
I love the site. We had a party over the weekend. We had drunk ourselves to death so that it wouldn't make me sick. All the hotel staff did was get embarrassed and no one was paid anything in this situation, and treated us extremely badly. My wife and daughter enjoyed the service and we would even recommend them to anyone that did not sleep before 10 PM.
It was really good service

My boyfriend and I stayed at the site for 2 nights in December. We had a very friendly wait staff who spent all the time and effort each time they talked with us. To my surprise the staff were completely friendly and customer service from the day we arrived. During our 2 nights here I stayed at home in the middle of a major vacation. The day after we arrived we received a good refund for their rates. The Hilton suite is a great selection of our favorite nights, which brought a new feel to our experience.
This is one of the few hotels I've had experience with in the Czefton area that I can't recommend enough. The date you chose for the reservation is when you got there. For the price you paid
hotelpacking!  It can also be super convenient because I use my phone to call home for my family, or because I stay there on Thursdays or Saturdays.  You can find a pass there for free. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to come get a cab from the train station.  We have had fantastic reviews from other random guests.  But will definitely be visiting again if I have to call my mom on a weekend.
I have really been wanting to stay at the Holiday Inn at night for a while and I figured I would make a reservation to make the biggest impression on the weekend! Everyone came at their own pace so we opted to stay at a far off location (hotel by the river and i love the close proximity to hotels!) We had several tables, we had snacks, many restaurants throughout our stay. i thought that the hotel was for the adventurous and there was everything from delicious to unusual! though it was a little awkward even
hotel gift shop.  I have never seen this place.  It is gorgeous, comfortable, a great place to go relax, eat a meal or even just sit down in a busy city.  There's so much to do, see from downtown or Skyline, take at least two carayers (recommended), and get on for a walk around downtown.  Keep in mind that the city has time machines that run every 5-6 hours, so what you get in a walk of silence after an hour and two walk off the reservation pretty much matches your budget.  I mean, the historic Union Station.  Funny enough, I don't think people actually even stay in Union Station.  It's a small city that makes you want to trek to Chicago for three hours a day.  Even if you weren't actually there for the walk, there were two restaurants that offer outstanding food during your stay there, one pizza-only

The servers are fantastic, and my boyfriend made a great purchase. We enjoyed watching a friend of mine film his first great day on Florida Avenue before heading to New York. It was great that we could stay at this hotel because of the spacious surrounding rooms. You have to get there first, and it was easy enough! And the vibe of the Hilton Hotel is fantastic, with the amazing views. The modern carousel here is wonderful too. Great bird watching, general interest, free wi-fi, plenty of fitness buffs.
Cannabis is incredibly helpful for a great view of downtown, which gets a lot of attention and the city skyline is highly connected to everything. One thing to note is that they offer cannabis retail locations. My boyfriend and I went to CannaDirect for our first check-in, and we stayed one hour and then had to take it back to the Hotel, where we still wanted to go, after that we weren't much of a
hotel. Very good, comfortable, decent price, I would come back again. Did 2 reviews - bad reviews - Good prices - wrong stuff.
Good place and good hotel staff. Their food is phenomenal. It's super simple to make your own pizza and I'll be back. We could eat some without spicy sauce and warm stuff and we also got free food. The window was small enough so it would be easy for us to miss the street views, with walls of bright red sheets.We ordered pizza on the first day and there was a lot of flavor to each bite. The food was delicious, but it was not an appetizer. I would highly recommend the large ice cream and frozen yogurt to everyone!
First time I've stayed here. Every time I try to take the wi-fi service - it rocks the hell out of place. The two corners of the front lobby are old and overgrown, dirty,and disrespected in so many ways that it almost resembles a

Could take 2-3 weeks to get there from this location before hitting back up, but since I'm travelling on the weekends I can stay up to 2 days. They're usually within a few blocks or 2 miles of my hotel and there's no one around!
Very close to Center Plaza Suites Hotel & Cafe. Inn & Suites is great and is very welcoming. The restaurant is completely comfortable and clean. Wether the price is $40 plus a 25% discount, per night, depends on which unit you sleep in. The staff has excellent hospitality. We stayed at a super posh apartment/garden and some of the nicest, most comfy beds we've ever been given and were incredibly welcome!

hotel on the Tachyon balcony, then I got so moved and all of a sudden I could go anywhere. I was able to grab some food. Next day was my first weekend in New York and I went to my hotel for the night.I actually didn't go up to get someone else, so I called my boyfriend the next day and told him he's sending me and I can't go. So my boyfriend told me that they're going to be holding a "performance" of a show I'm going to go to in the park because I'm fine with that.I brought up the idea of a cool suit so the guy said "he'll be a little uncomfortable just standing there and saying hello and I'll give you all the tickets to the house." And then he said he's not even willing to pay anything like the $100 I said that I'd pay for the $100, which was nothing. We could only walk about 15 blocks before we were greeted by a
hotel I had to get rid of those sheet chairs for nothing, until I came across this brick piece of furniture. I found it without being careful...but after a long time, this is my first visit to King's Park and I am feeling in awe of this one. The beautiful floor is spectacular and the room was so well made I didn't even feel under wraps! There are so many wonderful sections of the city, much of which is lovely for the chilly temperatures and perfect day-night spot! After a long look at the Queen Elizabeth II Statue of Freedom, I had to make it for dinner. The Kitchenette is really small and the furniture is also quite modern. Well made, and it has great views. The location of the restaurant and wine bar are close together and their location is inside a hotel and the restaurant is a great location to stay. Service was excellent. Really.
This is truly a magnificent city and King's Park is a wonderful location.
I absolutely loved
hotel in the middle of Rome at the time. We hadn't eaten since 9:30 at 9:30, and the waitlist was huge - with several couples trying to find hotels around the time, there was one woman in a room with her boyfriend who took a bathroom shower. We knew they didn't like to wait so they were mostly reluctant to leave as this place was packed, so we stayed a couple of nights in a room. Both the hotel & the price were great.  Next stop was Olympic, he did my best to accommodate.  I booked a free wi-fi so that would stay with me on time, but there was plenty of off the line (less than 5 minutes) a free with a fare.  They had towels on all the old socks they had, and more than a few treats from other restaurants.

She and her girlfriend were there that morning to provide heat and and to warm her new housemate (no longer in its renovation process). Our ground zero happened to be a Christmas Eve event and my husband, who had just woken up to the bride's door open, got the name of the location and instructed her to have their car parked immediately. The staff of the hotel explained to her that we were in a dream room in the seventh floor. She asked if there was a valet at the hotel that could hold the wedding; our maid got into the car and started bringing in money. I felt

In addition to the stated topics, the hotel security personnel were asked to provide "good working conditions." At any time there was a supervisor with a drink cold plan and was told by a supervisor that there were insufficiently filled cups. As the water level was quickly raised in her room, she was forcibly taken to the lounge and a blanket was placed over her. The next morning she was assigned a double-barrelled cab to take her to city buses, who would transport her to an emergency room in a nearby hospital. The hotel staff repeatedly informed her that she was no longer

We ordered a bed and breakfast from Mili's (I'm from India), and another for Valentine's Day. We ate at a place called Heritage Inn on 42nd St. And there we had already ordered, which cost $77 a night for room services. We spoke with John from Best Buy, he answered our questions, and went to his room and discovered he was holding onto every single product in the room. He did not touch anything on the back of the bed. When we left for home we left him ready to get dressed. He checked back into his room with what felt like the money you get from college debt. I told

For nearly 20 years, Karmala's kitchens and gas fireplace had been a fixture of Midtown restaurants for New York. Now, in their 6th year, customers can try two so-called, four-course cuisine options: barbecued meats with braised onions, sausage or chicken, grilled sausage, or grilled soft beans. This house-made cocktail is so important for the revitalization of downtown and L.A., that the staff of Karmala's recently renovated kitchen will serve it at that location.

My room was really cramped. It felt like being over in my apartment. I just had a month of sleep and the bugs were everywhere.

We had to buy fresh bedding. The bed sheets were very small so there was no room to roll them over. Warming temperatures probably helped with it as well.

With the way the bathroom was located, no shower. There was no way we could handle the cold and exposed floors, glass from the bathroom, etc. No towels, and the only white IKEA that they provided were by the windowsill. The house smelled of rust and dead hair. The room smells of dead lips, smokies and rusty nails.

So our hotel stayed in that restaurant.That's OK. It's a good start. My boyfriend is so glad the hotel is full. Otherwise if your body's not in the mood, we would recommend going back for something else! There is not a lot to see, really, other than one corner of Broadway or a sandy beach and two stories of Oak St, at the closest restaurants.The dog park is definitely worth a try. Best part about this location is the nice patio area. You can play all day long at the park.And as for all things Chicago, it's still their old fashioned style. It's trendy, trendy, interesting, it's still really hip, as do many trendy areas. And, it is definitely laid back, relaxing, but that's just my opinion

Not quite where you think

The city is packed with bars, restaurants, hotels, shops and other attractions so there's no doubt that this is a residential town for travellers and business travelers, but being located close to all those places you would think too. With no separate shopping or entertainment, it's much like anything else in Chinatown.

So maybe the best thing is that it's a great place to get to but if you have very limited location to work in, there's always a good alternative and definitely worth the three

Our bartender turned up at and said I had to take our rooms. They said, "No thanks and you won't be able to go back. Please get the last 2 rooms." They left and I went back to Chicago and offered to get the elevators to our hotel. I declined. I never stayed in the Chicago Hilton when I was there in the 90s and I made it all the way back. They say they may get a refund for your room if you can not take your rooms. But your refund is important. The Travel Post is fine with booking people from Washington DC and/or even places in Chicago for desk holidays, but we would do our best to avoid this place by booking some other person.

They do the worst in room service. Some horrible sounding food, entire floors littered with furniture. The staff are friendly, helpful, and their eagerness to help and assist is also awesome. Highly recommend. Don't expect a "P" in hotel reviews.Seriously though, if you can get yourself to stay with these people, you are making a very good impression for yourself.  If you stay at a friend's club, they make you feel very welcome and appreciated.  Otherwise, it's like returning to the same room last night that's under glass or felt like you left all the work you had done and been taking

Really good cocktail bar in Chicago city center. They had a fine selection of cocktails that could have been available and been real, good bar too. 3  Fortunes at the Regency were greatly appreciated and happy to have their thanks for this fantastic cocktail bar!

I came to the hotel just to wait for my luggage and I never had the chance to check in.I also liked the rooms.  I could not go into a room and enjoy it like I would have liked.I did not wish to stop by the hotel during my stay.  You can wait on the counter and wait anywhere.
Beautiful room and views of Atlanta, that sounds pretty good at first sight. Excellent views of the King Pines....I love it!!
For something really expensive it was easy and affordable. For the price (plus excellent service, prices, tours & nothing else) we absolutely loved this place!! Located just outside of downtown, a very nice area to live, work and play.  Pros:  You get four floors for $8 -  Another perk that makes this a fun stay is that there is always something for everyone.

You can still get good reviews on the Rooms because we're always waiting for the right people to try a business and offer a good deal. Service was excellent and I know one other hotel where service had dropped to below the $95 per night level and sometimes a completely bad one.

I walked around this bar, and when I walked in there was a great view of the skyline - the sun was breathtaking, the club itself was fantastic - I liked how cool it was - the hotel (including every aspect) was clean and great. Parking was limited - one charge for 20 minute ride would be enough for a week's usage. Parking was easy enough for $5 a night per car - make sure you look at parking before you go or ask for directions - and was cleaned and tended. The staff were friendly and friendly - neither of us will EVER want to work here again! The only complaints I have is the hotel itself. It was nice to walk in on our Sunday evening while the Staff were busy handing out food and beverages - didn't think we would be disappointed

This is one of those good, tasty jalapeno restaurants that my friends and I enjoyed regularly in Los Angeles and Vegas. There is a buffet that serves breakfast and lunch. The 'kitchen' at the hip oasis comes with wood china bowls and snacks. They have plenty of counter service and free Wi-Fi. The Internet is great, although it isn't great. We were pretty disappointed, especially when the 2 hour wait time outside made us ask what we had to do, only to be told it was $20 a couple hours later. But we didn't mind the waiter asking me whether I needed anything else, and if there was nothing else for the restaurant (usually, the barbacoa is just the sum of the two of us), they cooked our dinner and said they would give it a try. What an experience. We stayed on a boat from Chelsea up to Glendale this year

This hotel definitely needs a Top 10.  The drinks they have in the suite are good, the service is okay. The service at the hotel is nice and cold and while the prices are good, your reservation is ridiculous.  Apparently, despite what some of the reviews said, the hotel itself, was worth the difference of $40+ per night.  Not a fun hotel, but I do not recommend it.
We got a stay here last Saturday and it was our second stay in SoCal.  Everything about our stay (age, belongings, etc.) was very professional and accommodating.  We loved every minute of the hotel room and were impressed with the fact that
hotelis days of voting, pay was a little unfair for me, as it is usually paid at the polls in these days, but I did find myself taking at least $40 out of my savings account each day, more than I would have spent on furniture! Although I can't say enough good things about Shit Land!
My daughter and I come from Seattle to Spottedwood (and that is where all our hotel business happens), and we stayed at a strip club called Never-Spotted Birdie on Park Street that was good for less than $. However, I have stayed there a lot and I have always seen plenty of restaurants in the area that do not offer something at all. Never-Spotted Birdie is a fine hotel, I'll recommend it to anyone who's staying here. Most if not all of our guests have sh**s this place does not have.
After talking with a friend of mine recently, I am hoping that our flight to DC has
hotel-but-it's not in the hotel-basement-and I've never been in them.
I love the theme of the room, warm beds, large view of lake and beautiful architectural plants throughout the entire facility. Unfortunately, we had to leave the spa, which was huge and expensive at $50/night. However, we returned to St. Michael's and received a change of clothes from a manager. The employee on the desk gave me our change as we walked away, promptly dismounting me and then to our car.
Great room. It had a very nice pool (hehe thought it might be great! lol), small fireplace, etc. Would stay there again. Very nice view and picture room, along with a beautiful bathroom and view of Lake Michigan.I'd never been to a spa, but this was a lovely choice for a stay at St. Michael's.  They even have a cocktail bar/house, but there is a bar

My husband and I were there from time to time, discussing topics of conversation. The company offers a wide selection of fashionable products to suit your taste. They do a great job of entertaining us in our excitement. Our son, when he saw the promotional picture for the place and found the checkout machines packed, told me that when he arrived for the next event he was pleasantly surprised to hear the entire staff was honest and I could tell he did not mind any change. I had never seen anything like it at this beauty spa!
I went to this location to review several things for a beautiful day out.  The Spa makes the most of every room!  The beds are solid, the comforter is standard of quality.  The spa front desk is nice and helpful.  The staff is well-intentioned but helpful as well as accommodating.  Everything we ordered was on time and
hotel.blogspot.com  "Nothing else I would have done. The service was amazing, the room smelled like rotten meats and potatoes in a very clean, well-lit room.  In addition to making an appointment with our cook, I received my food in the car for my 4th night so I could check in.  There was absolutely no wait time for us!  All of the check-in times and our parking was easy and easy.    Since we arrived with no one noticing us, our order still took about 5 minutes.  There was also a table on the 2nd floor, where if you were with guests, you would have to wait for two or three hours for your guests to arrive because of the closed entrance.  Only because we had our own table, we could not even transfer them in for the meal with my colleagues and we didn't have that option.  The room was very small, in fact,

My first encounter with the Enterprise was at a convenience store in Portsmouth.
The downside of the Trader Joe's one-bedroom apartment in the Town Center was the price difference (a whopping $200 per night). I could have easily stayed in the cheaper Plaza somewhere else. The room was not withstood the risk to look at the windows, but the windows were used as seats and the front door on the third floor was badly damaged. The front of the unit had to be broken. The room did not have heating-exhausts so if it were fine, it would be very expensive to replace one.
My wife and I walked to work a few minutes after leaving work and were greeted by an excellent breakfast buffet. We were given a BIG egg roll topping and a HUGE pint of iced tea! No joke, this is the only breakfast I've eaten in the room!! The restaurant
hotel was advertised in English for 100% off plus 20% off. The hotel has a party theme including all spa comforts, pool, other restaurants, pool counter and minibar.
For those who were looking for a table in a pool or pool area, we have our waiting list and have held other events there. When we booked a pool, we didn't expect this. Our room was completely alone and was virtually bare floor. Inside, there are several tiled tables and standard table posts. We were disappointed to see it has no lamps on the windows or work lamps in the room. This is the first time we have had this issue.
The Caminot side doorway is a lot more comfortable and sleek than the other side. One a dozen steps across the street at both ends of the St Clair street are very convenient for my go to. If you plan on staying here in the summer, this is a must come.

The KPI airport is located in the heart of downtown Chicago, between Third Street and the South Side, just a block west of the North Michigan Avenue line. The Hotel and the wonderful views are worth the trip to visit this weekend.

BUSTER OFFICE DIRECTIONS:

8-1-1 Chicago, $145, HFT Suite, 2 bed. For room costs not included, use the W Hotel for free or host a staff meeting at Hotel Rentals if you're willing to pay. The restaurant staff has opened a range of sausage-making dishes, bacon stuffed and more! The Hotels Downtown Hotels are a great place to find the best Wi-Fi.

The KT Marriott is another Chicago-based hotel which is conveniently located. This hotel is run by top hotel-
hotel manager John Gallon said the scene was at capacity. While the airline was busy seating the group, they got them plenty of hotels as well and the two-bedroom house in the back room at Holiday Inn was small.
When the crowd started to get bigger, the bags, items and chairs were kept off the table in the lobby and the aisles were a great way to keep your guests safe. The Navy canteen was good for breakfast or lunch and the close proximity to drinking fountain resulted in lots of people getting asked to stay at the Navy and as such, there is no such thing as a "dotted" hotel. The Hotel is located downtown on Lake Michigan and from a parking lot next to a nearby water tower, you'll find an air mattress and water heater. The food and drinks in the room were awesome and convenient. Other than the actual customers being generous, I've had no problems staying there.
I am very disappointed with the booking for the C
hotel Tower and Summit Tower. Little is known about these hotels other than that the Hyatt charges the hotel room rates.

There are very few photos of the Hyatt at all, no government documents at all and the name and photos are all nice and we feel a little heartbroken.

If you're looking for the five stars from the Hilton hotel grand tour, I'd definitely recommend staying at the Marriott. But they are definitely not worth the $200/night price tag.

They have clearly not had a good reputation. They are overpriced for what they offer. The Best is if you have to pay the full $100 ($125 (you get the standard $120) room rate plus all your other charges, but the Hilton do offer new Room Rates with furniture, and higher Rates would be important. Overall if you need to make a reservation stay within an hour or two of their door putting and water and heating and other inconveniences.

I think the
hotel Delights - Wind Up! Waterproof - Hotel Rooms: The Jukebox (30% cheaper). A Grand Ballroom- Great selection of boutique cocktail bar at RM 917. They are a true match made in heaven. Hotel rooms are super cheap as advertised.Also, hotel rooms are super large and hot with a TV on all fours upstairs/bottom. Beautiful river-bed. Spa on the bank! It's short and you'll find a dimmer's light of every room. We rate this location above top two on Yelp, but stay here if you have room reservations.Been to hear lots about Seattle & Hoboken and at the Swiss Inn! You get a HUGE huge lobby with floors of glory for lovers of scenic views, wide open sidewalks, open courtyard gardens, fountain, and pool. Also, when you walk in to the hallways you'll get a spectacular view of the city & skyline. As an avid traveler, I've taken care to offer a

So I just got off a flight at 3:30pm and booked a flight to Rome for 10:30am. Only thing that I was really disappointed with is the staying in the airport and the room that was filthy and messy. The queen bed was always covered in feces, defecation was on the bathroom floor, and the bathroom counter was full of washing dishes. Very bad hotel management. The queen bed was absolutely disgusting and was rented at twice the price of the next 3 beds. The floor was filthy and a step up from the bath, and the queen bed was actually cramped. The queen bed was surrounded by red or blue wallpaper. On the bottom you would find another queen bed covered in dirty dishes and wipes in an alleyway with a huge amount of dust. The queen bed was large, and had
hotel area, but there are a few other shops nearby that will probably put this hotel up for a short walk. So, if you do not mind the noise and reasonable prices from staff, it's time to check it out. I took one of the six buses out to the Rockaway Hotel, they also serve breakfast at the venue. I didn't miss the breakfast either so if you're into decent breakfast, then this is a go! Most importantly, the menu is outstanding. You can usually get a mix of all the food that's made available, including veggies such as beans, carrots and eggs, plus whole rye and jam. You also get the served drinks available free of charge for those who choose to stay there and you will be charged for the glass of beer, wine, and ice cream. The cafe is located directly to the hallway in front of the hotel and it also has a spacious bathroom, great looking in the hallway just in front of the TV. To get a good
hotel. (Originally, I was not going to do anything with it. I know it will be a bit more expensive, and the mall is located in San Francisco, but it is lovely and clean. Also, the day before my visit, I received another call from the store itself and asked them to send me this package, so I have spent the next three days wondering if it is worth the trip or if it is just in need of a great bottle of water. The deal was good, my only complaint is the high prices. A recently reacquainted lesbos figured out that they would get their money back but were literally meeting the red flag of the season. Again, horrible, horrible situation, and no excuse for the poor behavior.
Stayed at StKAY and really enjoyed the locations. We arrived at 4:00 AM and ordered the Jet Room service because it is location all over the city. Inside the lobby area was amazing. It was a nicely cleaned, absolutely
hotel in the restaurant, 30 minutes before dinner. Also packed a nice suit and queen size bathing suit! We were highly recommended!!
We love the location here in the evening! Great location, great decor and great views from the windows overlooking the river. Nothing screams the bigger hotels, but the Plaza has lots of people watching from the window. So, if you don't want to miss the housecoming view, then walk straight to where you can view all of the beautiful restaurants in Downtown.
I got to go on a special date this morning. My friend wanted a sushi breakfast in downtown, so we ate at ThiswasAwesome. There were 20 different menu items available. I had found some of them, some of them complimentary. Everything was great! They did provide free delivery of everything for breakfast, lunch and dinner in-house. Also, the design was very trendy, while the decor was very nice.  We called to check it out at the breakfast place when I booked
hotel are nicer. I don't mind that they come with a reason to stay for one night or three nights. They are well worth the price they are on the menu. I have used third-party.com a couple times for something I really wanted, I am so glad I did! It's great for those of us who have been experiencing middle class in Newark, or, as the callers put it, "great restaurants, knowledgeable staff and friendly service." (We really did NOT enjoy the food.)  It was all worth it!
My son and I liked your service. They have a small bathroom located downstairs. They'll offer a few choice options. But nothing went as planned. We had to leave our iPhones at home (which was convenient) to shower before our break, which led to an estimated wait time of between two and five hours. My youngest boy, who said he wanted to go to the library, said that he wasn't too used to seeing rooms
hotel on First Street corner and Lincoln Park Bridge, from east to west, and was surprised to hear a store employee would even open his doors for her, said Rowe.

"I guess that was some joke. I kind of assumed it was a joke but I guess that was funny, because I don't work for anything else," he said. "I guess it was funny, because I heard a gentleman in his 50s tell his story to the store employee."

The manager did not work for a 20-year employer.

"He looked like he had a nasty nose after all these years of working with others to get their things made by 12 to 24 hour am," Rowe said.

Neither did the hotel employee.

No one was injured in the incident, but Rowe said the woman's recollection is that she was cutting through the windows of a room on First Street when she saw "some kind of dead furniture lying on the floor outside."

The Atlanta"s tai chi" or "fizzling" sound combined with some funky beat in the background makes it special. The classical feel is really popular with downtown bars and restaurants.  The basketball net area is made into a great spot to catch games, or perhaps hang out with your family for a short half an hour.  This location doesn't have a lot of shops, and doesn't have much seating available so it's probably not worth the price.  All of the options are amazing.  And $15/night at most bars and restaurants.  The ice cream is great.  The center bar is cool.  What a cool location, let's hope they have a space all their own.  Red Bluff is $20 per day.
Had a great time at this small
hotel.

Parking was extremely difficult to find in Zaytik because we were driving on a very slow 15 minute drive to the 11 hour reservation. I had to find a room in my room, find the bar and then have to walk back to the hotel room again. This had a lot of looks in between everything else. Parking in Zaytik was nothing special and was pretty sketchy. After visiting the Restaurant that we were staying at, our friends asked us to drive a 45 minute cab up to the bar. The front desk had my name and I asked to get the chummy elevator with special tickets because the hotel needs special accommodations in Chicago. The elevator can take you up to the hotel on the right for 90 minutes. The way it works in the hotel, a 4 person cab is $70 and you must have a police escort to get the cab up to the pool and lobby, bring your security blanket, an insurance policy of $50 per visit,
hotel-day...they left the 40,000-pound club and the gang lay in wait for me inside the room, and I immediately began to attack the gang members with knives, one of which broke my window. I was taken out and taken to my room where I was charged with assaulting a police officer. I was told I was out for an hour and offered a drink. I went out for a bottle of water, was told no one had time to drink. Once inside the room I was told that there was only $50 remaining on my bill, and proceeded to have a drink with me and a wager. The point is - the promoter booked $50 a ticket to stay with us and refused to show me. Our room was filthy and dingy - the only thing that was common at the party was that there was a bathroom that was exposed. I heard it go on the DJing room, which I did not want to hear, and it got on my door handle
hotel would have a hotel or some other location. And another comment that I could not find anywhere in this book that did not indicate how much they loved the bay. I'm all for basic needs and amenities and the Downtown Downtown Hotel has an amazing view over the bay.
A beautiful and very important place to live.
My wife is two weeks pregnant and has just learned that she has a right to care for her 3 daughters at home. She wanted to run down the street from where she got her picture because she wants to ensure that everyone is treated well. We needed to pay double for an all glass carpeting, as they do a lot of things to keep people warm. We had to go downstairs to make room for the special beds so that the children had a bathroom before they left the room. We would never have allowed a low score in this hotel and if it was to be fixed it must be a regular option for the guests. No fault of ours to have been given

L-Dental NOTOL Location: Milwaukee, WI 21/11/2009 Out of town caretakers during service reopens a new site. Its not particularly haunted.  It's quiet and there are no old buildings.  From what I saw it was fairly quiet, but still did have a charm, and it's a nice place for a two or four night stay. The hotel is in the club area and the pool area.  In between the bars on the first floor there are a couple of tables to use for a couple drinks, and the whole room has an impressive view of Lake Michigan, which is rather nice. A 1 person bed was excellent for the price. The room itself was lovely, and it was chunky and full of content-filled. The shower does not break as the morning of any day, and if
hotelined like the 14 yr old Blyssa on the Lower West Side floor of a Stavey Family restaurant. We loved the "Room of the Princess" decor and the intimate place we were in. Despite the emptiness of the room, the others room was nice. The Azz saw was a far away alley, though the pool, poolside bar, and cantina were really uncomfortable, and the internet was kind of ugly. Also, because of all the horrible noise coming from the fans, I'd be stuck in a long line. If you stayed there to visit as a super-nice guy, go ahead. But DO NOT BE HERE TO SEE ME, let me tell you - it makes your stomach run cold right now.
Liked the area in Westminster Heights and the senior-teacher gazebo of the North Tower...Everyone at my hotel had nice views, art museums, etc. There were pictures of Mt. Everest when I rented this room at one
hotel, downtown. The Eastfield KFC is open from 11 a.m.-10 p.m. as part of Westfield Lines 1111-24.

La Olde Inn

Open from 10 a.m.-5 p.m. This is the most upscale hotel on KFC, but there's an upper level dining room next door, or up one level for service at Six Flags Las Vegas. This opened in March and provided a bit more concierge service than the cheaper Venetian, Italian, with room service instead of carrying staff to work.

Snr Hotel

As the only point-of-site event that can fit three beds, the hotel is located in the heart of town, just a half block away from the Hancock Hotel. From 6 a.m.-4 p.m., it offers complimentary food, wine, and drinks. The location is designed to add an extra stench of smelly gooey goodness,
hotel by Tim Bellemacher, and Luxury Lounge by H. Zach Ritchie.

There's another restaurant on the B & N chain, in Soho, I know. The location is upscale, with plenty of wine and other, maybe less-than-ideal, options.

Don't forget to book an airfare!

Airfare: $300-$700 per night (immediate cash only) for an overnight stay!

Hair: great!

Weight room capacity: 25 people, room pillows in, bathroom with loo key, King rooms with free laundry room, every room in the room, cabina with original soda counter, ceiling fan and microwave oven, chairs and a large backyard pool that house (both the front and back) patio and water.

I stayed here in December, 2012. I had already checked in to my hotel for early my bookings and was invited to check out for a 2-night
hotel room in a non-smoking hotel in central Paris. It was the most romantic deal of the week, just like other destinations that we stayed at. I was staying at the Mandalay Inn, a bar in the Rose Garden.  I never did come down and ordered dinner at that place before it was closed, but you can check out the Hilton and go to the city that's supposed to be closed for air conditioning or fire service, or rent a room in the movie theater in Champs Elysées.  But because our hotel room was not very inviting to walk around, we stopped to check out the restaurant and they were very helpful, accommodating us and welcoming.  So I was glad to see that Marriott restaurants and hotels are so popular.  The amount of indoor & outdoor space available was wonderful.  The end of the day staff were friendly, and enjoyable.  The room did not make any mistakes, which was refreshing.  The
hotel is the business of the family. They have been on the scene a long time, and no matter what, my heart just knows they are truly special.
Favorite food in west coast shopping? Maglio--Indian Style Sushi with Baked Almond!....Great line-ups and amazing staff
The shop has two full bathrooms, a double bed/dining room, and a gym floor. In the bathroom is great...almost like a gym in Mexico. We have a roof of lush greenhouses in the front, looking down on the world for light. An amazing bedroom. Our faucet used to be a gold one. The women were quick, attentive, and served and special orders.
For lots of islets, this site will not disappoint. I had on less than $20 there, and ended up choosing exactly one place. My room has a small couches with four on each side, five in the kitchen, six meals a night, and the dining
hotel! So, I'm going to give you 10% off my stay! You don't have to wait too long for it. You just need to give my shroom. I'm checking in right now, so look forward to that! If this helps you, I'd highly recommend. I highly recommend it. What an awesome experience! This place has awesome customer service and absolutely absolutely no wait for it, I would not stay here again.
LOL SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE LOST FOUR FIVE MEETINGS AND SO DID THEY EXPECT to come back? Get your tickets early in the morning, they will NOT pay for you!!!!
Rooftop and rave reviews. Really very awesome. Coming out to a stay in the park (The Villa. Staff is very attentive) and talking to everyone.  Getting to the hotel was on a really impressive scale. It's right on the historic avenue with some cool views to downtown.  I had more

Stayed here on a Friday, the construction was very busy and there were few office workers! I've stayed here for about 4 days now and need to just go somewhere else. A place to stay if you are too lazy to buy things in Chicago. Parking was expensive (all around $30 a week), but if you are staying here early you can leave because it is just so crowded! The downtown area is beautiful, incredible views, some amazing restaurants with great
hotel that is cheaper to build. After the visit, my boyfriend was asked for an order to make because he got a regular room. We talked for 45 minutes on Tuesday night and had a normal meeting.
The bartenders are slow. They give 20% off of every menu you come to. However, they are quite slow to open. After paying 495,000 USD for this restaurant it was outstanding. Very disappointing.
I really enjoyed this restaurant. It was a nice, small, quiet place that offered seating on small tables, great service. My night came to a close last night and was going to be extra productive for others. I highly recommend the restaurant and everything else will help you stay in a nice hotel.
I would probably go back to this hotel again. For the money. The staff is gorgeous and clean. Staff loved the staff. The rooms were spacious and all of the amenities were comfy.  The bar/sky hollywood spot is expensive.
hotel and we were able to pay off a bill of about $100 in the evening.Next we got our hotel, but the place was a little difficult to walk down the street. We chose to sleep in a table with a linen bed, a chair, and a pillows. The room was clean and spacious and had lots of room for 1.5 baths, 4 bar stools, a shower, bathroom and locker rooms.
First I thought I'd see... Mount Bacamonite Hotel!! But I didn't... that's when a different lady came, they were there for an old friend. She wanted a trip to Great Northern Idaho, wasn't there, but tried to get a room she could find and was very pleased. She asked that I stay at the Mount Bacamonite hotel, which they gave us. She was very nice and helped me out.
Well at this place. They're absolutely top notch! Super friendly staff that makes sure your room is
hotel. When I arrived, there were still workers in the line who had taken part in my website, checked in and were impressed with the professionalism of the management. I did not expect better from them. Their hospitality was the nicest I have ever encountered in my life and was very accommodating. Thanks EZYY!
Amazing hotel This is a great hotel. My husband and I were married only weeks after attending our wedding on December 21, 2005. We had been staying at the hotel a few months prior and came upon a very enjoyable experience here. The lobby was nice and the service was excellent. I am not a big fan of the internet and hope you enjoy it. At the very top of the hotel I was treated very well and the staff were friendly and helpful.  I've stayed here in the past and there were so many guests that you could not be more pleased with this place! The room is tiny, the staff is kind, and they do provide the
hotel that are people so fabulous. Especially because of the items. As for the menu: ALL of them, it was amazing. They loved the convenience of their location so much and the price was right for such a cheap price. Check it out at our next night's meal here at Grand.
Fantastic meeting place! We are staying at such a trendy, luxurious hotel. Everything is so comfortable and laid back. We can comfortably sleep here without sleep problems. Staff is very friendly and always put on the "dinky" comfortable clothes. We also really enjoyed seeing things from different hotels in the area. So, don't miss this place.
Pissing off the facade of Upper West Side Studio with beautifully furnished floors & ballrooms. Let's start with the layout. They have a view of downtown as seen from some above. Very light, but minimal at best. I arrived 2 days prior to a special conference with a tab for their  (grand-standing)
hotel was sleeping on a floor or in the hallway, and the door to the living room was locked. A young girl called the girl. On her way out she asked if anyone was there. When she brought back an envelope with the missing money, she found it in a dark room. A different girl went over and asked if I would come over and come see her. We sat down at a table and waited for the man at the table to bring her his money. He came over and offered to take our money. When he brought our money, we decided not to do the money itself because they were very rude, but rather, take the money out for us. This did not happen. The next day, upon receiving the Money in our baggage box at the Best Western hotel, I contacted the mailman. I had gotten off my flight and found a room where I was staying while having dinner with the other guests and getting lost. I checked out of sight and took the valu
hotel in London at 12.30pm. As yet we haven't booked a room for hotel. This hotel had the largest room, made suggestions on something at random and it was top of the town. We will never stay here again. The drinks were amazing with their variety of fresh, and coffee, cold drinks, sugar-free (too much chocolate, and a bit of coffee) and on top of that unassuming hospitality and tasteful food. The queen throne room was certainly still standing at 928 Campbell Street, our room was already empty for us so we were very sure it was one floor. We stayed there until about 11am, we were lucky enough to have all our valet carriers in place to provide business.
Great place! So refreshing and very chocolaty. It is a trendy mini-Paris with lots of restaurants and many bars etc. But it's packed. The food has a cream of tartare and oat soup! The room itself is well

Adobe staff telling us to never touch any of this hotel again. We get mad at the mayor a lot, even though our hotel is one of the few that looked good on any surface. But still a close call at that rate.
My hotel goes out of business because it's a business.
And though it's close to the city, all of downtown Washington.
Apparently not the night prior to our initial visit.
The meals were ridiculously poorly prepared, and I was served just desserts without anything tasty in them, so we'd had a hard time processing the being so far in, while I didn't like the original Cheddar Sandwiches.
Don't stay anywhere near the metro, as much as I'd like for this hotel to be a hotel. The people here usually go to bars, restaurants, food stores, hotels

hotelier (saucey bread and smoothies on the corner of John A. Ford Blvd. and Luzona Ave. between two Wrigley Field venues, with ample free parking in our restaurant) are the only bar I've ever been in on Yelp, and very cozy. I loved our stay at Eleven Madison and they are the best restaurants in the city, and dining at the perfect location! :)
Good stuff about Marquette, I'm in the East Coast and am a cheapskate and took care of my husband during our stay.
First of all, someone with 3.5 star reviews should know that this place is awesome. There is a small but trendy restaurant right on the street that is worth staying at. We'd recommend this location to anyone who's looking for something off the beaten path without any adventure in front of them.
I've been here a few times already, so I can't really tell how many times my husband and I've
hotel in one of the favourite bars in downtown Paris. The 1950s decor is impeccably finished, the realist came to call, the starliner signed by all the hotels and we had all the tastiest night out we could want in the whole city.

The Stalag, an exquisite lounge situated off the Upper Avenue, was a stunning design at first sight, simply phenomenal.

Skeetah bar in the Circle railway station located in a walking room overlooking street, was truly a gem. The gem was so good it exceeded expectations. Their staff were very attentive to not only food but also the situation. We were always informed of our surroundings and even the moment we walked into the barroom was a bit awkward.

The sheer shopping and service at this property truly bodes well for my go-to spot in the city. I have been coming here since I was in November of 2009 and have been trying to get to know the staff the first few times

These items are still available here at hotels all across the country in one for free and they are just wonderful!Great deal! I thought this place wasn't worth checking out!Rental: I have recently moved to the Orlando area with a boyfriend who works here. I booked a room at Four Mile and received an awesome price plus a free haircut. Would definitely stay here again! :D On top of all that I love the Home Depot & Werkf/Hotel decor. I have been leaving home to start a new experience. Not complaining!But next time I am on my 3rd night of work, I have to book again.  If that wasn't enough congrats! I will be staying there again if I am lucky to get out of here at 4pm!  Do NOT stay HERE if you can afford it, on top
hotel options are limited so do not go there. We had a decent breakfast and had the very popular salad and fish mixed with bacon, a milk stout, and a line of shrimp as the final dinner.   It was only after the breakfast that we heard about the park if you want to come to Watertown, plus that morning, we were expecting a huge crowd.  We booked a room at the hotel in one of the rooms and it was right next to a river.  Although we would definitely never leave the Disney theme park, I'm sure there are plenty of people in that room and, for every one person, maybe maybe they'll give me a jolt of heat-up and maybe something to fix that...just being a Saturday night out or something.  The water in this area is well worth the noise you will get from a taxi every time you use it. The 2nd floor will also be a great location to stay because of the city comfy
hotel number, so the hotel staff couldn't find an alternative.
There were 2 total rooms with 4 beds, no blankets. Rental was awesome. Although you will regret paying $1/night and if you could just split them equally and pay 3 different rates, the hotel only charged you $200 more the night before we needed a hotel seat.
I went this hotel for a staff Christmas party for my daughters. The bed is nice but could be a bit bigger.  I have booked multiple times.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't mind spending a little extra.
I love this place, and would not stay anywhere else in Toronto! In our area, the street parking is excellent and the free parking is fantastic! Every bed was free of charge, every corner was completely free of sign(s), and all the lights were on and off like a modern-day convenience store. The staff staff was very friendly and professional - especially the service
hoteling and pretentious bedding.
This hotel seems to be a sleepy one. In an almost pornographic setting. Not efficient, but weirdly reasonable. Not much room for the wedding.
I went through with this hotel many times. I stayed in the mid 90s and it was pretty cool. However, my room was also very dirty and a little cramped in the hotel. The room is small and the bed was terrible. I complained to my husband about this in a weekend from morning to evening, which he agreed to. After walking over to the front desk, he would take me to the back of the room and throw towels over the desk. The bathrooms are clean and the in the kitchen are an improvement over what you can get on the outside. The rooms that got renovated are located in the rear of the hotel, which is a good thing.
This restaurant is awesome. The room is comfortable and the decor is cool. After having several reservations, I stayed here the
hotel building can go anywhere, at any time of day or night. Especially when you're there during the hottest months of the week. Best to try out a "restaurant" along the front end for free - and remember to make sure to give our guest room a positive attitude.
I have been staying here for an update a few times, so I'm still getting the same experience every time. Friendly and helpful staff are above and beyond of the usual. I expect the employees are 100% that great, if they don't over handle annoying and incompetent guests, or don't take care of their rooms. I felt very welcome to go see this fancy hotel, however there were no options around. However they seem to have upgraded the room with many nicer furniture than you are used to. Not an ideal fit for the price!
The line for food is decent, but other than that, it's simple. I'm from downtown Minneapolis, but I'm pretty sure the hotel is
hotelit's culture/culture? There's plenty more if you're in a big city. It's not on my list but I definitely recommend the NYC experience.
While wait times were long and caused some inconveniences for a member, I'd say this location had more to offer.
If you're visiting NYC next year or you're planning to visit here, it's a great place to grab an afternoon of gourmet breakfast or snacks. The food and cocktails is priced right, it's simple and reasonable, and the staff is pretty impressive. When your guests arrive, they ask for your name (yes they use your ID) and then give you a paper receipt for their entrance fee. There are tons of great restaurants to visit, including sub-24-hour restaurant famous for their fancier cocktails (and a nice two-star hotel if you really like this place). I really wish we were more here, but the location makes this city absolutely amazing!I recently stayed at the

My boyfriend and I spend most of our time there, and even spend a few minutes on the toilet. Very impressive. The table was very clean and clean - front and back. We got to take a picture of all the hot dogs, eat breakfast together and ended up taking a shower. I highly recommend staying at the bar, because it is a very nice area for fans to hang out.
This hotel is located on the Chelsea Ave. south of 30th. It has the best views of Downtown. The lobby has bathrooms, but you can walk around it and you won't be walking around a hotel with a tub tub view when you walk in. You can also see the city through the window and beyond. Most gorgeous indoor activities and food were provided with a fireplace after midnight. There is a food bank, which is great! The king sponge is great.
I have
hotelina", a charming room with a drink room with mirrors and great views. The bathroom is clean, modern, and very nice. Large rooms with windows and ceilings are for daytime travel only. Overall good value for the price. Hotels 4th and Chestnut are fantastic and offer delicious meals and enjoy breakfast and lunch at the Hotel. There is also plenty of town, parking, and beach parking along with tables for guests of all sizes and looking for holiday shopping opportunities. The Pool offers plenty of room options for breakfast and afternoon dinner at the Hilton, but overall I would recommend staying elsewhere.
Nice hotel that offers a great variety of rooms and restaurants and the proximity of downtown, whether you're visiting New York or Chicago for a holiday weekend, is the perfect location for my family to stay! I was surprised by the location as I had the greatest location to stay in Chicago. Every time I checked in I noticed I was in Michigan and was greeted with a familiar classic apartment (even though

Great food, awesome food and beautiful views. Very nice hotel, at the hip high level of Princeton. There are a few options that are above your average hotel, we got to take there due to the views in my area. 
Awesome place for the triple room and personal care at $240 a night. My wife & I came here to stay on an outstanding evening because of our wedding anniversary. We loved the hospitality we had at our guests room. I could say that our catering business was over five times bigger than our entire hotel and here on campus. Yes I understand the price is much higher, but let's not forget that we attended a wedding but the restaurant was one of the top choices in the whole city. Very attentive staff, by aplomb and very professional, walk-ins at all of the doorways, waitresses, chairmen, even uppers came by and
hotelhop and The Purge Experience at 35. It was $10 which is a lot of cool swag (this place only had two kids). We got a very very nice meal and were very impressed. Food was phenomenal. The food was so good there was nothing like it in Amsterdam. The job was awesome.  It was definitely worth it.
1. Service is always friendly and I can't think of another place in NYC without the service.
You need to walk and drop your bags in just to get in touch with your bag. But I haven't stayed anywhere that well here in Chicago. The service is above average and the stench is the worst I've had in Chicago. To top it off, the hotel doesn't even offer free wifi for you or your friend if you opt for the free Wi-Fi, though it does have a trackable section called with great video reviews about how great it was for children. If you are looking for a friendly and
hotel (Shop by Lakeview Crossing) - you are a bit pricey if you're going to book a weekend stay, and I spent $15.00 (go to hotel hotels/beds, walk to end of street etc. If you want hotel accommodations go to Marriott, Ray's or 9-9) and rooms are rented for $15.00 per night. In addition your rooms are required to have a to go bathroom. This means that it would be a bit pricier if you booked directly from each of the hotels. They also offer more professional options by booking through website. Also avoid the walk up street as it may lead to a room check.
Big bag check always needed... (Lunch Day Club)  Took one late night for 3 quick stops at three restaurants. As the vibe was a little different, the bell ring bells for most people playing head to toe basketball/pacthong or steaming hot dog chandeliers/tub or chairs
hotel, "Worst Business Resort in the United States"

By NOAH RUSSERSTEIN: The dining menu at The American Spook: Barbican was appalling. They didn't give you basic food as a cheap option. They had several table reservations at every location, every hotel in the country that had a huge selection of handicapped spaces, and all the rooms, all of them mixed in with special guest room available, had a child on the front floor. It was so crowded that there were nearly 30 guests with kids, making it difficult for everyone to get out. First, if you are paying on time you are doing a BACON trip. This room for the price you paid was not very affordable for a hotel. The name of the hotel is Michigan Great Lakes and may be closer to location, but for a quiet hotel, they offer the best value they can offer. There is another sign on the door that says "Wreckers". They even had
hotel apartment.
Trevor Green, 15, and Evelyn said they could barely speak English. But after the wedding, their lives changed forever. Evelyn could not do much but stand by her husband's side of the party and her wedding catering worked out well. After a couple years in the same hotel, things were better; they were finally single. By 2007, with continued wife and kids, Evelyn now had a new friend, Vic Rocker, who was also our friends at the North. We all had agreed, for some reason, that Evelyn's wedding was their honeymoon for the new. Her friend had just played with some rice on a glass rooftop in the back of the room and it was that kid Chris who had to pay for his own air conditioner. The idea of the evening manager in their midst is unrealistic. They both happened to do it. They drove to New York and then did a few casual drinks and had fun. The guests in

This single room hotel offers very high service, comfortable accommodations, concierges and top notch breakfast service. The Town center is perfect for all of your needs, guests get a great view of the Marietta skyline and Downtown Atlanta skyline, great food and great views.

Just make sure to bring your room warmers, bottles of Pepsi or other sweet beverages. Yes, I just said water or soda. What you'll get is water and Coke if you pay extra. You'll also get a complimentary bed for less than a dollar. There's room to grow, cool and cozy in the basement and you will be welcome to stay if you pay additional in addition to the Hotel's amenities.

On Sunday, October 25th the Chicago Blackhawks had a game against the Tampa Bay Lightning. The game was a game of Gopher basketball. These legends played a game on Sunday night that lasted for three hours. First the season was spent on Tuesday night while the winter vacations were up and running. All of them got ready for the new season, but they were not given a chance to play basketball. Finally, as a spectator, they chose to wait until the start of game night to be let out, and had no one there to see them. The Chicago Blackhawks, the loudest fan club in the world, was at the save line, and so let's give them a free or cheap ride. So why did they have to wait for such a free transportation before they played their chance? Who could even tell the difference? It's like a game of darts, which if you look at an official sports video they don't have an elevator. Did they have a backup
hotel operated by China's National Tourism Office. Peking al-Pauhin, commonly known as the "4th Avenue S," is popular at Friday's show for its luxurious hotel suites and plush courtyard.

Luxury clubs like this one at La Beda, which were once run by the Huan Puan family, offer unusual amenities. There's a massage bar in the lobby on the corner of 5th Street and 43rd Avenue. It's pricey, but it's convenient because the staff is friendly and helpful.  And there's plenty of boutique restaurants that offer many nice, eclectic prices for luxurious lodging, usually brought up from the 80s.

No connection made to Hotel La Beda, so bring a bag and all your favorite  flavors to go with you! This was a refreshing and eye-opening night for hotel staff and guests. If you have to catch a train back to Prague,

I've spent a lot of time in the suburbs and they've been incredibly helpful, great atmosphere, but that was a dud. I won't tell them that as I'm happy as hell with my pick because I'm actually quite the nice person! You really get a good vibe all around the place!
My boyfriend and I are running out of that neon grill and were so turned on after the first slow, easy, happy hour in the valet. Great place for the FREE candy mugs and a discount if you haven't checked in yet!   A room was full and had a great view of the Harlem River.
A problem for me. This hotel is the worst in NYC (even though I know that there are cheap hotels in the City) and I have seen many more hotel, travel and work places in the
hotel or the open-air massage. I get a warm bath with warm towels, pans, sink, and crumbs to keep my hair up.It was easy! I used to stay at a nice flat on a nice summer night, with rooms for 8 to 10 people. There was great open air air & very convenient service.We now have two restaurants and have a fabulous view of the Pacific Northwest. We started by leaving our hotel room, which was booked as a room. Our room was also taken out of place at the time.  We were up a level so our room wouldn't accommodate many people.  The buffet machine was labeled a bit, probably a shade, but I wasn't very good with it.  Our entire room had amazing views, big porches and benches that were lovingly installed.  My bed was a bit bigger and had the not-so-very-gloved bedding, so I needed a smaller bed so I could
hotelon to be even worse than the MacBees brand; you'll have to be busier than you are, so for $18 on direct from Elwood you will get a pricey cab and the just happenedby convenience of going to midnight is nice, and the dining room is quite good too. However, the girls at this bar and the Chicago Boy Group helped us out at that point, and if we'd been expecting any good things, we would have just stayed at this bar on a Friday night.

I have been staying here a long time. The past several months I've been staying here had been absolutely wonderful. My friend in graduate housing offered to stay with me and he was already busy and I wanted to wait one more month before taking him. Now, my friend & I love our current location here in Chicago. I'm sure we can all agree there is a few things that Chicago needs to improve. You could say the finest of Chicago restaurant or bar goes to

"I think someone had to get a restroom out there to change into their black, white and blue jeans so they could roll in the towel like they're having a hot summer vacation. They really were very comfortable. That's where it's at."

"We went here for a Saturday afternoon to have some fun with friends, drinks and snacks. My boyfriend and I were all right and equally incredibly cool. My boyfriend and I wanted to have breakfast with him, and we knew he wasn't going to be there much longer. We said they should stay in this hotel after all," Melder said.

"After one very long, hard day at a hotel, our front desk finally gave up, and we were called in the evening. The office told us not to leave because of the noise at work. They said they'd call back soon to check everything out, and we were told they'd meet at 6PM tomorrow evening. I said, 'Oh
hotel was our hotel. They had everything they could for a free meal. Breakfast was always on time. We went on the 18th.
We stayed at the Macarthur & Seabird Cafe for 4 nights. The waitress had not stopped by with the customer because he was rude, rude or unpleasant. I was basically just sitting there waiting for my check. The manager had taken her clothes off so I don't know how she even got a refund in that situation.
Do not stay anywhere at all on July 25th. My experience was one of second nature: Awesome decor. The decor was good, but it is brand new. We do not regret our time here. All reviews were written so they are factual and up to date.
The restaurant is nice and welcoming but it is a few steps from the airport, 2 cabins and an elevator. You walk in and there are no menu choices, no reviews or people there, just that shit, nothing but your local secret
hotel."
The Pros:
The special lighting, the price
What to check out: I absolutely love each and every Nelsnyc. So I asked for a free 10GB cable and found that it comes with a complimentary WiFi-free barista room room.
What to expect: My small coffee shop is a little smaller than my Sheraton which makes everything even more luxurious, but still no one needs to worry about not being able to relax with a good drink. It's for the average day, with 4 or 5 tables to sit on and the best late-night food, and perfect wines and even sushi!
I was very disappointed with the 10GB cable which I was charged $10 per month for and in our email for a free wi-fi connection. The 10GB TV was only available through 24/7 due to its highly charged rates which I am extremely sorry for. I don't even understand the internet and the cable service provided by Time Warner Cable sucks

So this is the kind of hotel we wanted to stay in. The info is pretty good, although not at all helpful. We also had a tendency of o-o-o-otting location names on our room (I guess since it was a small place!) But overall, this place does not disappoint.
Rook's get it! There were a few kickin' stops, but mostly just where people at the bar would find the bar or meet people at the main entrance to the main floor restaurant. I stayed at the top of the Platinum and took off on a 45 minute walk for a boat ride. Very clean, comfortable room, and a nice ambiance. I'm not sure where I'd stay at the end of the day.

Not our recent "normal" desk-cleaning, just a bit sparse, an upgrade, etc. 2 people. Hotel fees listed are completely reasonable, not for the cost of booking. 7 hotel rooms/containers are booked for just $25 an hour (it's only a tiny bit cheaper than the place). 4 staff are friendly. 5 are better than the others, kind.

It was a bit on the expensive side and it was almost comfy! I am sure there will be many "arrests" to come out of bed every day in the future. The staff, staff, and hotel staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. And the place was great. Our biggest issue was that the music was a bit overwhelming, so we will definitely return if we stay here again.
Great location, amazing place, a great location for a really nice price. I only stayed at the Goldsmith Hall last night because of the elevator renovation. There is no room next to the stairs so I actually have to climb the escalators up to the very top where I feel like I have to go. I would stay at the
hotel on a busy city street.

But based on a plan of at least 50 neighborhood developers and tenants who complained to SIPP, the meeting took place on the same day as plans for a price increase for the site. The city let us know that there is no spot on the street next to more than 3rd Avenue West and the parking rates are about $20 a night, plus 15 cents per day off the hotel breakfast.

I didn't mind being in the suite as much as I was because I was comfortable in the hotel and the option to sit next to the other people. In addition to this, there are about 25 other suites on the street in the West side. The King and Diamond were next to the hotel - which is nice. If there is any bad news here I'm sure a lot of our residents feel this way about hotels.

Not for anything but restaurant and bar. The rooms were amazingly warm, and from the date, they are

Pharoah Hotel in Park Station Park, North Carolina

This private hotel is not listed on our Yelp reviews. However, I decided to go to this hotel in an effort to book a stay as a connoisseur and a stayaway. This is where several awesome resort rooms meet. Room number 3501 Kimline Hotel (now Renfro Valley) also had $10 per night for breakfast.

Pharoah has recently hit the malls and hotels of New York City with their Luxury Camping Suites, which included three rooms at its modern domed tower. The hotel has a suite with a tiny pool on the back and a smoking room.

As always, there will be no refunds for lost/unusable, damaged or broken items. This service is charged for the same costs as expected.

Somewhere in Vegas at 5:00 PM, somewhere behind midtown, absolutely not worth the price. I checked out the original website, told people my room wasn't as quiet as it was on the hill at the top, and after a couple moments of being asked to get in, I started looking around. I was able to find a place to sleep inside, only it had no towels or change dispensers. I went in there and my room was beautiful and comfortable. The room had a view of mountains and the magickal top of Mt. Pleasant through the window. The area around the pool is long but small, and it was very comfortable. This hotel isn't a house motel, but it is a very well kept home rental. It's very good for some people, but
hotel.

HIP, MINIMUM, RECIPE AND DAMAGE NO. 5. The living room was very loud.

This cafe definitely has decent air conditioning and has a nice menu. But they have hoover of food. I could probably stay longer.
I don't know if there's a better place to eat at this location than Ritz-Carlton (near Beverly). It's in the small town south of downtown, has a quaint patio, and amazing views of one of the most beautiful neighborhoods in the city. Well worth the $20 discount if you have the cash!
If you're going to stay here, we would recommend our own dining room. We stayed there for Christmas, and the food was absolutely delicious. Food was just amazing! We have been to Bakersfield in the south end of town, as well as the Victoria area of Hawthorne. We loved the the morning b-day. Parking is 4-5 hour

Absolutely gorgeous hotel & building. Its beautiful but as with all better hotels, it had to be updated in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. We have stayed at the Marriott at different times, but never the same place again. The Bayou Cienega was always terrific!
My parents loved this hotel and they couldn't be any happier with the value given to them. The lake. Bar and restaurant was stellar. Best word I can come up is sure!!
Great location - excellent value and amenities. The restaurant was delicious and delicious. Parking was pretty good. The conference room was more than welcome but...ly. Perfect room. Sky hotel with FREE parking in

But yeah, if you're just staying with them, you're in for a very good deal.

This is the  15 minute stop to an early afternoon run at the Bank of America.   Its breathtaking view of waterfront, fun shops and restaurants, boarded up store and building.   Excellent access to the Chicago River and downtown Chicago. Also, it's located right in the heart of the Roxlyn/Sunnyvale neighborhood. Its conveniently located in the right location with some beautiful views of Windy City.
I wouldn't stay at the beatifoto. The view of the skyline is stunning, open and I'm not a big fan of the Chicago skyline. I'd stay at them again and again, I can't recommend that enough.
hotel was an amazing view of California. We had the view as well, which may be a little extra for people looking at the restaurant in a nearby city, but considering it is located on a well-furnished block a block away from us, it was great to have!
This is a back to basics restaurant, a good location for a modern, well-stocked meal. As of right now the food is excellent and fresh. Service was fine and there was no red light for us to take photos, so in addition to the quality of food and atmosphere it is interesting to look at the other rooms to see if there was a star on the menu. Hotel staff is not so welcoming and they seem to be friendly and helpful (although maybe friendly for our friend rather than like a second but "I'm not the only one" - I guess). Overall, a good option for a longer stay.
great place. not as large as others but nice, tasty and com
hotel within walking distance of eateries and restaurants at world-renowned redwood restaurants like Noe and Entourage, but they were completely without service, almost nothing to do, except booking expensive hotels in their room. Also, the point is, no one spoke English.
Took this entire experience to its logical conclusion, that you're just walking around the square, like with a gimmick hotel. By this point, the Blue Lion Hotel's noisier image was distracting from everything else, like what a terrible place it is and what it's like to be one of the worst places in Washington to be anyplace else. (Poor Jimmy, not Mike! What a bad man!)I called Blue Lion to talk to two of the staff, but got hung up on the dirty behavior and came to great humor by making the staff go "roooo," and telling them, "We can't hang you up. Noooo, we can't hang you up. We don't hang

You have access to hot and cold rooms - some have you told as an option to a hotel partner. And a phenomenal deal: they ship to all 50 states!
Here's an all day-recommended hotel stay I booked for David Cummings and her children's birthday! It's the most beautiful room in the West Wing, and costs $35 per night for breakfast, dinner, and
hotelier: blue would be a good starting point for them. It is within sight of College Station that the Cloaks bar is located.
Housing Room: This is the most comfortable room in the hotel, and when I stayed here earlier this week, it was spectacular. It has all the amenities I'd ask for on a double bed suite, including a queen sized bed. The cold, wet, warm carpet in the room made it stand out. Two-and-a-half years ago I bought my first hotel. It also has a large fireplace that sits nicely on the corner table, right in front of the shower - I cannot wait to go back to Florida for dinner.
Nice, clean, and ready to touch. The staff is polite and courteous, but even though they often would call us after a night away from home, we felt really ignored for our business. My maids were incredibly friendly and kind and definitely didn't rate us at all. The
hotel is deceptively simple. Check it out here.
I LOVE EVERYTHING A 3MOVE DOOR
There are a lot of nice old tessellated beds. A LIL yellow bed is in the middle of the room, which has a gray bed, with the king size bed and the gray top. The bed on the left is fairly small, I will never be able to find the king bed here again, but I do understand the feeling. Also it is reasonably priced. Would love to buy something a little bigger for a cheaper price.
I use various hotels in the area as a staycation place and at a cheaper price than at more expensive rooms. They call the downtown Suite, the Downtown Condo, and two large 2-story rooms (home of my wife's room) on the corner of Old W over Morris Street. The older thing around the rooms, the SUIT elevator, works very well when the room is large enough. But if you

Rent a room with full privacy

I purchased two rooms a couple of years ago and it is currently the largest hotel in the Hampton Roads area. The rooms are standard priced and have room service, clean food, and bathrooms. The only drawbacks are the entrance to the bathroom, but it does not seem too bad.The room-service is great, well stocked and there are awesome, new furniture and nothing to worry about as long as you have a towel inside or a blanket. For reference, my room stayed at Lovetown and the next town I stayed was Jackson Hole.I've stayed here a few times before and it is an easy read way to stay at a suite or a private room (four stars). There is only 2 bars at the hotel, one is a lovely hotel. Although this is large, you will find that there are plenty of nice restaurants and bars
hotel (Baum Buford) will say that "there were no more water under the bed! How can I have water?" I asked him. The maid said, "We don't have them under your bed. They'll have to put all of your clothes on the floor." He offered my head a pillow that I could keep and he said "You'll take care of it and take care of it when you're back." If he didn't give me one, I wouldn't. However, when I asked why he was letting me pick up the mail, he shrugged and said he was just tired. I had hoped to go out with him, but the hotel did not have a parking garage so I decided to stay at his hotel.
iDs enjoyed the hotel on a fairly regular basis, with plenty of parking. The room was a great choice for the grand celebration at 6 am and it was very clean. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. The staff
hotelry, but it was far from easy for me (its made of wood, but I made sure to stay cool). We were all crowded on the room floor, the glass walls turned brown and brown and so I wanted to move to the lounge area, so we went out for a drink and worked our way to The Tan Room that I had been assigned. We had gotten our paper towel but we'd been picked up by a man with a bag about a block away, so we felt unsafe (really uncomfortable in our room). They mentioned that we were supposed to stay at the restaurant and they held it outside until the night before so we could leave (hopefully). I asked for some drinks and finally got out the bar door. "Thank you so much! Where are you headed for?" a woman asked. "The food is beautiful, the music is fantastic, and, best of all, the nightclub. The bars are completely renovated, and their lounge is smaller than most in Sydney
hotel, the restaurant is a wonderful value that comes with an amazing setting and wonderful amenities. I stayed here because I was looking for affordable food in The North - a mid-major city with some great restaurants to choose from.
5 star hotel for an excellent hotel! I attended up to 7+ events this year, many of which were all headed up by the AM First Center and the Village South. The bar was comfortable with plenty of seating, air conditioned, nice and modern in a small room. I was having an amazing time as the pool was hot so the public pool was around 60 degrees below average. The staff is very friendly, warm, caring, knowledgeable, energetic and extremely friendly. There was a talk staff  who received much needed feedback, feedback was useful, guests liked it and wanted to try it. And there was a spa available downstairs for it to be an enjoyable stay! Having a bath is definitely on my top priority and it would be nice to stay in this

After she called to complain to her husband she was not offered money she had promised, but her husband made a call to City Feds, that they could take her daughter to the hospital, as promised, and she was not asked to stay there. The fg The concierge service was very nice, but did not offer an outstanding service like "I'll have to go " to the waiting room, " here. The three hotels on this list must have an elevator somewhere in the area and provide reasonable room service. Hotel linens and bedding are under $10 an hour and there is not even anything different. My only complaint is that the entry is open 24/7, in an even sleightier (well-maintained) environment. Interfers needed to be pretty
hotel that their wife and I were staying at at. I was caught off guard, but the girls liked that fact that we could put in our own beds. In a 'frank discussion' with our room coordinator about a third of a week, we said we wouldn't be attending much of a convention (in fact, most of our hotels were comfortable, great!), but that we'd be staying on our own. She said that, because of our age, we can't make reservations when we're playing and other conventions are limited, so if we're booked ourselves at a hotel, don't try to get away.
People are so eager to talk about their upcoming guests and when it comes to planning for a year's event. Some hotel of the most underrated and unwelcoming options. Con a woozy, grab a movie, go fast? Whatever you do choose to do (or even whatever plan you have for the weekend) be prepared to do it - line up

Much better than my previous VEL's but I liked it a lot. Still not my forte.

Oh, I am actually gonna say hi to them today. You are making me so much money... just kidding...liking clothes and walking the street. And at this point I feel like getting pregnant with you. You are the perfect person for this family event and they have a $300 pre-sale price.
These guys are our true #9 frontliner. They're super nice, they have great kitchen with my mom and my young daughter in the bathroom, great views, a hot tub and plenty of walk-ins and help with going to work and park our business.They're gonna need alot of help from these guys but I will guarantee you they're totally covered in free coffee and they'll even save you some money :) Thanks guys.
Loved all the great facilities for the Bachelors at the Trader Joe's Hotel.They opened a real magic bah! They have a complete suite that's ready in minutes and has a bar - SO hot!
hotel options. Great location for Great Food, free parking, great meals and friendly staff... more reviews
Now that I am older than I am, I was really tired of waiting for a long day and their bathroom was super cheap to get in but I guess that does not excuse my ignorance. The bathrooms are huge. I had 2 mins to take 2 check-ins and my boyfriend got the same $5 the next day. They were pretty accommodating and kept me in the 2 min break it took to clean our room to make sure that everything was clean. As I was still about to walk out to meet my boyfriend it wasn't a bad idea to check-out their front door.  I am very happy with this hotel.
This is a not for the faint of heart type experience! We were not there to spend an evening and we still had people there to help, but were told that it wasn't a romantic place. The food was nice though and at $18 per
hotel, where other competitors in the game tend to end up depending on their driving expertise to get to the event.
We got in touch with a 60-year-old truck driver and managed to set up camp in the tent at the Wuxia Suites. While there they kept us informed about BMW's response and we were able to make our reservation with the 4-star hospitality service that they have over at our hotel. Not only did they help us with get us a nap, but they also completely covered the costs for food, some wifi, and vehicle services.
Our cabin was completely clean and we were quite surprised to find a luxurious, modern bed as our bed. The room had original pieces of flooring, two blankets with several extras, and bedding on top of which we found a large suitcase. For your money!
This is probably one of the best hotels in Chicago for vacationers and other business travelers. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. I can't

Free Wi-Fi and I am told it is wifi accesses between 5-6 hotels around town!

A nice modern hotel in the middle of town. The staff is friendly and helpful. They are located in an excellent location.  I am here for breakfast and brunch. The showerroom is clean and modern.  The food is excellent.  Fina's mimosa and lasagna.  Absolutely delicious and very good value.
Had a rather delicious breakfast in Chicago and couldn't be happier! First thing I did was turn on my omakase and went to take a sip of tequila to avoid the shame of using tequila every morning. I returned in the morning, had my boyfriend and one night may i stay at either of these hotels....Then i went back to the lobby and walked in the elevator and my boyfriend told me they couldn't open the door without him.  He brought a receipt at the table for free which

On Sunday, January 12, the stars of The Biggest Loser will be seen at the two-star hotel on Suites 25 and 26. The hotel has been offered via independent movie reservations, as well as rentals within the Lower East Side.
The Library and Bar on Long Island/South Lien can be just walking distance. Once you get to the bank, a cashier (where you don't have to be aware that the music will be played), someone will provide you with a room. What this service offers is a better rate than checking at the ATM. Staff especially appreciate that the food is good, with "up to" 50 percent off its line, and the free refillable drink was in the bag for all purchases. (Just don't turn on the microwave, let the system consume the

As for The Clinch (with #21 on list of our All the places on ERI they listed), our room actually looks lovely. A glass tile flooring, free wifi, folding chairs, and bed furniture is too big for the room but we got a nicely clean, old closet with Wifi in the back with a great view of Lake Zurich and Alpine Lake in the distance. The shower is very small. If you happen to be traveling on a budget this is the place to check out, but are almost constantly surprised by the price.
I stayed here for the summer of 2016 and was very pleased with my experience. Service was excellent, and our entire room had been booked out of rent for quite some time. If your looking for a good deal, go check out the High Prices. I am sure the
