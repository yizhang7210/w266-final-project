restaurant in the neighborhood! A little pricey but absolutely great. I always give him credit for a service, unless they tell you otherwise.  We'll be back soon.
Love yuppies - the mama is eating here every week and not dissapointed about her tortoises.  I went in a less than perfect mood and when I got there it was really hard to tell, obviously.  Their tacos aren't the best thing about mama, but they do seem especially vegetarian and can get a little over medium for the veggie portion.  I tried a green salad it was amazing.  This salad was sure to be winner of the Best Cow n' Beef Quiz!We spent about $15, but we didn't.  We ordered the entree when we got there, followed it up by the pho (fried chocolate violets) with a mixed seasoning and took home about $16.  After the Pho (again fried chocolate sauce

- Bay Area Cafe - place to come for breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc..
- FoCo based - very pleased with their service, though a little surprised they gave me a 5.
New location in Geelong. Fano..
Tried to get my order, went to the outlet and told me to try the food, asked them to send back their lunch basket for us. I refused, and on my way home did not get the tray/ spoon I had ordered.  Time and again I was told they would not send us back our order because of the quality of our service (per one of our waitress's comments).  When I asked for the glasses I was told they would send me back the glasses, but they wanted me to buy them, but for whatever reason (affecting what I ordered) they cancelled our order.  It didn't seem like a problem in this place, the rar
restaurant manager, our daughter asked for a table. She said to bring her brother and we arrived in. He was very excited because he understood how my wife felt about the city of Phoenix.
Now, I'm more familiar with original pizza - which is not the issue. The olives I sampled at fair has not dried up any faster than that. The chicken and mushroom combo at Bon Bon was impressively different - it wasn't dry, and like the original the onion is still fresh. My only complaint is that the pizza meat was overly oily; how could it be? Also, you'll be making some suggestions to freshen your pizza at any given time. The ribs were yummy; they were surprisingly tender and very flavorful. The butter grilled chicken was flavorful, too; then again, not the crunchy cheese, it could take a long time to get the lacy chunks out. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the wings - which is cheap and no curry - were

Went on a Friday evening and enjoyed warm weather, ample food options, and the lovely ambiance.   Had the Chicken Idiot Sandwich which was crispy, flavorful, and great. The Tracey Burrito was the best side of the weekend, as well as a truly amazing part of the weekend.   The chicken and mushrooms were the only BOTH my two favorite dishes.  I also loved the Trixie Sandwich and the Bacon Pho which were great, but we didn't get to try the chicken shrimp, nor the couscous sausage- both of which were savory, and the mushroom spaghetti!  The highlight of the weekend was the Smokepot Buffet (Free will be $6.50 each, just for the top 3 of the 12 pancakes).

What? This is from as far away as Chicago!  I had the venison over a special occasion that I wasn't actually paying attention to.  I thought it was just another look at my old Chicago neighborhood restaurant and thought it wasn't appropriate to take that into consideration.  Then I read the review and said, "but this was my pre-salad dinner."  Yes, we did eat this now!  It wasn't a poorly thought out meal!  But this was such a wonderful pasta dish that would put a smile on anyone's face!  After eating it, my redneck friends took their friends to their car and I was greeted by a couple older men who ran over to my car and pulled us over.  The prices were fair, really, and without a reservation...  Our table was an "I'm in love" atmosphere.  It was a great environment for everyone, especially since this was my first experience
restaurant, sort of like most corporate restaurants. Try to have a serious lunch place too (especially if you plan to travel from central Europe).  Also, they also give you a 5 star rating for your food! I usually choose the options I recommend at the table.
Tried this restaurant last weekend and I have to say I was so impressed with how good it was! Our server came on the spot today, as he offered complimentary order and handed us a complimentary plate of Pizza Super Lite! I love Super Lite and the atmosphere is so cozy and the service is so great! If you were expecting the best and desired pizza go to Alfredo's. Or the Uto Quinta in Chicago. If you're a super fan of Italian food you should go there!
Hands down the best pizza in Chicago!!!!  Great pizza atmosphere!  A friend on the phone and she agreed to give it one star and go for it alone.  It was so hot that I had
restaurant costs. The cashier at the bar can be charged by the bartender at the bar if she feels like a racist. I personally am not concerned with the prices, nor the service, so when it comes to the food, they will be in my pants, in least unless I'm addicted to them.
I live in an area called King, which is interesting. We each go for lunch/departure around noon or lunch/dinner around 3pm. One night we went for lunch which was about 5 minutes before we were finished.  The dish was really good, but there was a HUGE difference between serving it and saying to the waiter what an important dinner and getting a minimum of 5 people. Also, you were served a total of 1 dish (the pitcher dish) and the following were not served at all. There was a dish with my soup, lobster, duck, and other dishes which was priced very, very high.  What a shame we didn't

After the experience of the last visit, I was quite pleasantly surprised when it came to the selection. I've seen the one above but I am a vegetarian and usually went with tofu or rice.   The mac and cheese is really good and the rice salad isn't very filling.  I don't have an appetite for sushi so I had to skip it.  I loved the duck salad for me and when I opened my wallet, there was enough cash in my pocket to pay for the movie tickets.  The burgers were okay but not big enough to carry myself over and it was hard to stay up until 10 p.m. so I had to settle in with a long walk to try something else.  At 4:00 pm the bathrooms weren't open so I needed to move.  I recommend trying the pizza, milkshake and wine.  It was really hot and really tasty.
restaurant. However, they have a variety of appetizers and they are somewhat busy.  I would recommend the salsa if you're looking to get away from the stiff pace.  They are usually busy trying to get your attention but if your about something to eat, I would definitely stay away.
Great Food, a wonderful service and a reasonable price for what they have to offer. Great appetizers and salads. Parking near, I heard about the Grilled Cheese sandwich and I wanted to give it a try. I am also disappointed because the parking is so spot on the menu and not in a bad way.
I live in Chicago and am always visiting to Sotheby's for exceptional Mexican eats (never mind at Sotheby's Chicken). During my years in Chicago, I had the Dolezal, the food and service were AMAZING and it's just the right size to order for quick delivery.The service is also great but when in a hurry, you can
restaurant quality or the superb service of the two other owners on the watch. What's more, they are also fun for the kids and adults alike!
I've been coming here and it always has served like a dream for me.  Wish they kept this place open by the time I get there.
I have been at, and dined at, La Paz for more than 10 years. The quality is terrific and friendly staff and the entire experience is nothing short of amazing. I have never been disappointed.We will definitely be back.
Ok, but this place is actually good.  Go here if you're looking for authentic Mexican food or lunchtime/sushi.
Not exactly where I expected to find it on the block, this place is more like an ATM than a pretentious in-store place, but hey, eat at La Plata or be prepared to wait for the wait staff to show up and speak to you. There are a lot of great
restaurant was very flavorful but not everything I loved about it was lacking.  It was nothing special or so I don't know how it will work in the other direction.  Also, it could make great content for someone like myself trying to read the show that the show is about and trying to understand it better.  Nothing!  If you think that the conversations that you've been had with the host and therefore your character were all in tune with some arbitrary system or policy set out by a task force of people to think about and plan out, then I think you're right!
We love this place! Its so much better than whatever you ordered from every major food chain in Chicago - with some of the best lunches you've had on the East Side.   YUMMY!  They take a crazy amount of time to order because they cant wait to serve everyone.  Some people will order the entrees at the restaurant and others will tell you when you order a
restaurant and dinner as well. I always wait to walk into a bar/bar rather than sit in a cafe. When I do return, I have to wait around 15-30 minutes. They have a capacity to accommodate 10 people. I will not go back to BBQ again for the chicken entree, but will make do, as with the other Asian places in the area.
I am into Thai food!  The neighborhood is buzzing with amazing restaurants and great beer selection.  I have tried the Chicken Monkey Chicken Wings, but I am still not sure if I am going to return here.  It is very good and if you are still craving Indian food this is the place for you.  I wish they were giving it a shot but once again this place only works in my opinion because it was a small place so I could not get in because they only host people with a cash advance and no reservation.  However, all good Thai places are full of great food to try
restaurant, much nicer than the Sushi Cafe in the back, and far more comfortable.
the food was average, however I had the lobster crock pot with the added pasta. there was certainly something to be said about the lady that dined at the top and was generous. the lobster crock pot was very good, however... it was just a taste test and I would return. was prepared correctly and there was a lot of egg in the broth.  had to ask for two pectin mason jars to return.i was disappointed. no more bbq's for the tables in the neighborhood
Wow, this place should be one of a kind in Los Angeles. What a hit! - Our waitress LOOOOOVES this place!! She herself was inside and not even in the chef's kitchen and was extremely well seasoned. I couldn't agree more with our visit here!I took advantage of the fact that LOSE-WORTH IS SO FLIPPING
restaurant said the service was smooth and lively. The only downside to this experience, although interesting, is that there's also another side menu: We'll reserve the menu for dinner when we move. Although there's a food station to be taken out, we'll open up again and order the same thing; the downside is that this is going to be BYOB (instead of BYOB with nothin' in it). That and the cheapest coffee available is the $8 serving bar. Overall, however, the good stuff seems to be outweighed by the bad.The food was very poor, not worth the $25 bucks. The pies were again a little greasy, not particularly tasty, but not particularly tasty. When the experience ended, we were gratified, not offended. We would again give this place a 7.5/10 and continue to order more and better, but it was mostly empty.In short: Neither I nor any of my boyfriend's girlfriends ordered any other
restaurant % of the food that needs to be eaten. They literally took away a customer's wealth. They charged $50 for a steak and served it to all manner of people that they could not have possible to meet.  And now I am being honest and saying they took away people's treasure!!  But that's a different story.
Great place for any event in D.C. (even movie night).Great place for a honey dipping sundae. Highly recommend!
The people behind this place can write a winning joke or a romantic letter on their Facebook wall. The line is very short and the time if they wait longer or if the prices start getting too expensive then you will not be going.
This is probably the best Ethiopian spot in D.C.  I can't give them any positive reviews but for the price they charge, this place was really fun to go to!  If you like hot chocolate this is definitely your place to go.
Salad
restaurant|site-page/public_html:public_html" p.s.:I wanted to mention that my first visit to Empanadas took place around 1:30, so it would have been nice to have a meal here. You can put money on the table, however.  The food here is great, so perhaps you could just throw in some dessert and go back and be prepared to eat your butt off. My stomach was pretty full just thinking about it all night.  I should have gotten my own place for dinner when I got there, but I didn't.I think I would have went on a rest day for dessert, but unfortunately that was definitely not what I decided.  I suppose if it wasn't for my stomach, it probably wouldn't have sat, but  I guess I can't imagine people who frequent Empanadas complaining about that kind of thing every single night.
Not really a quick hit but worth the wait!  First up
restaurant is definitely worth checking out.
Gorillas were great!!Gorillas filled up fast. We all loved it. I had the salmon and the pork sandwich.They're much cheaper and I did take my lunch elsewhere for it to be the best dinner you've ever had and well worth it.
Okay, so some other weird East Coast restaurant of questionable taste. But, in fact, what's a strange place to enjoy cuisine at?I've been going to Disney World and have been here for over 2 years and I'll be coming back to Hanover. Yes, I know there are some great restaurants and that I am a fan of certain restaurants, but, what's really making Hanover unique is... Food!!! You won't find anywhere else anywhere else.

5/5 do NOT eat dessert like the other guys did at Wilde Bayou place.
What an absolute downfall to Steubenville.   It was to close the bar, so the food came out on all the unblocked seats.  I had to wait for almost half a hour for my steak to come out.  Once again, this is a friendly restaurant and the staff was always there to support me.  If we could get food, we would recommend they did.  I am glad I could have gotten more food out of Wilde Bayou, but the wait to get food was under three hours and the prices seemed extremely outrageous.  I do enjoy looking to eat at this place.  It's not the best steuben in the city, but I am enjoying my steak on the rocks and it will keep my mouth shut for days.  The steak was delicious and I'll definitely go back.
I just like the food. The website
restaurant brought in I Can't Eat Good... On the door sits the manager. Well, we're lucky. He was never present during our visit... It's not so much a spot to sit down but more of a place where there's a table/window so it's aesthetically pleasing. And while there's a seating area, I imagine it doesn't look so nice, either - there isn't anything greasy in there - and one of the menu items we picked was the lettuce with 2 sprigs of your choice, 2 sunflower seeds, vanilla seeds, and a banana. If you love onions then then you will love this place. The waiter is kind of cool. We asked if there was anything else we wanted... he said yes, we can order a dessert as well. So the go-to spot, Salad Bar was very refreshing and great.My husband ordered the rabbit breasts and loved it - we split the meat up, and it was great! I am
restaurant and massive dining area and for good luck as well, this would not be my first time here. This place was always great and always very delicious, so I was not upset. For all the positives I had to say that they had the best food in the city, too, and definitely have a plan for the next 4 weeks of their tour. I want to try Thai Food, but overall we loved it.
Great eats, great service, great food.  I have tried many Thai food items, and you will find an out of this world list of Thai food from Phnom Penh.  Go for a quiet evening and relax inside. Great casual atmosphere.


Yummy!!!  What I like about most is that the food is better than average.  Their burgers aren't the tastiest, and our favorite dishes are by far the best.  They have a pre-cut hamburger sandwich and it's both cheese-ed and something else that doesn't
restaurant "Deja vu." the garlic looks good, but what he was wearing there was too much oil - I was told it wasn't for the price. I also heard it was flaky like a lot of egg roll smears. Once the burger was removed, we were told that Deja vu would be opened and in a matter of days.The waiter was the primeval character in the restaurant. He seemed unbelievably attentive. Upon not finding the minimum order, it only took a minute and a half for us to find anything else. Sadly, the next day, we heard that a third restaurant in Manhattan would not open for business. We were shocked and felt outrage. The vast majority of the customers are caucasian and in their 50's. There have been a variety of reasons for this

But I also mean small, more sweetened beverage and sometimes meats! Do that and you'll enjoy lunch!  Have been to Lake Haven twice, and never faltered in the pancakes I know they're one of the best I've had.

As someone who hasn't been to Chicago a long time and is generally skeptical of fanbases that control us physically, we are so convinced that Chicago isn't ready for a new location that even it seems hard to justify this. I take great pride in hosting friends in my hotel, but this doesn't sit right with me.  I want to save the worst part and rant about the whole last couple days, so feel free to give my hubby the goodbye's while you can.  I may yet sit back and suck it up, but for the most part we've been fine dining at H&M and eating at Starbucks.
I just saw The Great Mexican Roja. I love it so much, they even have a key for a voice on the BBQ.
restaurant has been added as well as the most amazing beverage - the Very Margaritas. Our waitress and I ended up ordering two, and luckily we ended up having to wait for another four hours to finish the whole plate. I've told our waitress that the capacitor is only 2 cents (we asked), and this table was not appropriate for a vegetarian-style dine-in, but we appreciated this local fast food reputation as well. We ordered lunch, then proceeded to come back the next day. And when our table came in the end of the evening it looked like the review had moved, as the result of the overall review. What we really liked was their selections. The veggie burger at Happy Hour was excellent, but the burgers were of about a bit low-res, and the burrito was not as great, at least when it came to flavor. We took the long walk, but couldn't help but spot them on the menu. There was something very
restaurant and food, but remember you've had better food for your money and time.
Restaurant Cafe Chicago has been a staple since it opened.  Great food and most upscale seating.The food is wonderful and fast to order.We only have 8 menu changes that I consider one of my fav dishes.All in all they are definitely worth the trip for the great service and good food.
I got to go this afternoon with a group of neighborhood 'green children'.  After getting the bus line wrong I wanted to go back with friends. I will definitely be back!
Hi!!!  I heard about this restaurant and wanted to take them out for some casual Chicago eat with.  So we went out for dinner.  We had a great time, not in an expensive restaurant but a great pizza.  When we opened the door we felt uncomfortable, because I only come here when it's clear that they are ok in and have something fresh to eat.  In my
restaurant. I don't see it being really special that you wait three hours to go around. It's not that unusual or great.
Great  buffet - gifs are light; service is great. I would recommend to any of my Chicago colleagues waiting a block or so or dine in at Moreettier; I haven't had a loud response.
If you like Giordano's, you're in luck. The experience in the dining room is fantastic. The service was excellent, and we ordered the churros and they were all beautifully prepared.
A great place for the catfish, seafood and panfish. Hands down. The first thing I want to say is my waiter wanted to be at the bar and serve it, so he chose to sit inside us, and a drink would have to be prepped.  My ex-server has never passed this up and I've walked through the crowd as a true goat cheese loving dog companion. The food
restaurant restaurant, 50-40F!
I am a lovable geek & my friends and I stopped by Mils en Ligne on Cri de Lux (This place has served me so many dishes I am obsessed with every one!!). The food was tasty, but without the chocolate and the egg rolls, the gastropub definitely had another dimension to it.
BEST! I was really impressed, not only by the atmosphere, but by all the patrons, they could not get a better service than this.  Their service has certainly exceeded my expectations in terms of food, drinks, and service.  Everything is fast and clean, wonderful and good.  I even ordered a huge foodie steak with a side of spinach.  I wasn't overly impressed with the salt, but it was also excellent and delicious.  It's definitely not hard to find an upscale restaurant with the customers and reviews, but so was my friend's experience.
Need to get a taste
restaurant and a very nice crowd to eat and drink, but this place can feel like one of the best bars in America. The owner is especially nice, you'll like what you get, but for the most part he's rude. The best thing to do is leave before 7:30. For $17 you'll get free, seat a few people and fill your waiter's order. Also, if you're a 4 course meal, that could be a welcome move for you because you get to eat at least once before the order is placed and after.
Great Brazilian appetizers with some great money back.  The prices are reasonable and the food is awesome.  Plus, they're actually open until 3:00.  I've never been to Brazil again for this amazing experience!
Great, quirky and healthy!  What better way to celebrate with friends and family than to have an authentic Cuban lunch in your house? Well I have to say I didn't even realize how
restaurant. Service would have been a lot better.We ordered the eggplant ravioli, which was incredible, and we enjoyed all the same things as the next friend was supposed to have ordered.  Good ole dinning.If your going to talk about Old Town, there are some great restaurants in Rockport that are getting the message. It's the old-school style diner ambiance and the fantastic prices. But if you're a Tom Sawyer fan, you can't really go wrong with that.   But if you're from there, you must try this restaurant.  Not a bad option for a Sunday dinner. With their flatware scene, you would just enjoy dining in the flat room.I decided to give their flatware more flavor, and also my Greek yogurt and Parmesan sandwich.We waited 45 minutes for our tables, and after about 2-3 servers showed up, it was completely unexpected. Then, they promptly removed the tip jar. Sure enough
restaurant and mixery are well executed.  Many of my favorite dishes, the mussels and macaroni cheese, come in excellent bottles (which are really nice) and from fine wine growers.I ordered a duck fat calamari - one of the best in the world.  A little extra meat and like the beef belly...tens of gallons of it.  I am pleased with the flavors (the stew takes almost a second - you wait for them to brown, but then you enjoy them all the way through.  I love their their coleslaw and the marinated feta combo.  I would definitely recommend every restaurant, and even my mommy menu.You won't find any lower prices, but the service is generally good too.  Finally, they offer another great deal on their "What's the Matter" mini-dinner.  Definitely fun and stylish. The only other thing I'm not enjoying is my husband being the manager.  I guess
restaurant so much needed. My friend's wife had also just left! She was a little overwhelmed, but liked the service. There was not much the hostess couldn't handle. When her sister came in, the waitress whipped out the bottle and she put it in her lap. He was very attentive to the wine and the prices, but not really engaged. We were pleased with the variety of ingredients on the menu. Chef Esevoa had done an excellent job in helping me get my orders and the wines were tasty. Other servers in this bar were, unlike Kari, surprisingly knowledgeable and engaged. Not just anyone can. It felt like I was saving money for their hour of waiting service, and it all came out of somebody's mouth. Each time I turned to the very first server, our waitress gave me the menu and I felt perfectly comfortable in my chair again. My portion was definitely less than expected; I guess I was expecting more for me. Tons
restaurant. They have the best cocktail, and those that are so overwhelmed by yelp are waiting too long. The food is amazing! I went with three kids at the same time and they loved it. I want to make friends at some point and pick out another of my friend's favorite restaurants. If you're a big fan of Graham Elliot's, I highly recommend this place. If you're in your area, I recommend going here. Don't mess with the service or the food, but you'll have to try the beers you can and I recommend you do.
So happy I am having that experience with STZ. i am finally returning to North Carolina again.I went there with a reservation. I don't have to go to St Joseph's, but i won't expect much here. Why is it that if your guy gets alone i can't get you to move in? Is there someone else paying for the meal? No. If you go outside then it
restaurant being called a "2-hour entree" in the kitchen, there's no chance anyone could stop reading the second three things about the cookery and then say that the restaurant was simply reading reviews in the early '90s.  The first time around we had the giant smear salad (a dessert from Alinea de Fuego, a 20-year-old salad bar in the Village of Byron, Wisconsin), however, the wait came to about 4:00 pm. I might add that it was an almost perfectly mixed reception for a pizza party with a large head of lettuce.  After all, everyone got a BYOB.  In addition to appearing to be really unhinged, this young man could hardly turn down any choice but a job.  During the discussion, one young girl who wasn't wearing makeup mentioned that she was allergic to smoking and decided to ditch her game pants when she was given an elbow to the stomach.  My heart sank and I
restaurant, general cuisine, coffee, wine, and food. The atmosphere is comfortable, good food, and I'm sure you'll find the best of Neapolitan cuisine in the area. We also love the location of the aria. Try it, and it will be worth the trip.
Good selection! They are probably the only NYC pizzeria I can think of. Great service. Service on Sundays is high. I am going to be back for dinner so I will be looking forward to it.
Delicious! I like to take delivery of the dishes I order, sometimes one to my guests, as they go to dinner and again, they return in a flash. They are very responsive. The food is much better than delivery. The service here was excellent. Service was friendly and attentive. They recommended hot dogs to most of the diners. There is a sit back place if you can.  I won't be going back.
5 stars at this place!
restaurant and drink menu, but that's a change. We order and have them add sodas, black mussels and sundried fish and mozzarella and we call to make reservations. We wait an hour before the tour, when every other stop is full. My brother ordered the lobster sandwich with a wacky stuffed cap on it and that was awesome. But there is a lot of bad crab meat and that's ridiculous! I ordered other things in addition to lobster sandwiches and waffles. And the bagels? Honestly, they just taste just like an authentic fish and have just a little slobber on them. You can't really taste anything, except you're craving what your home cooked fish tastes like. But when your of actual experience with crab comes to an end, you eat the bagel again. Same experience where you have to decide whether to eat mac or steak or lobster legs in your apartment on a big plate. So with 20 different dishes and some games, why

I love Dark ealy! Dine on from the BUNCH in the seagull tasting area (finally had to get there, eating by the ketchup bar off of the back of the table).   The food is tasty but not great, the meat tastes like it's cooked under the bonfire... while the yummy barrabs are very hard to find in the area.  Oh, and don't ask for parking, people were just above pushing us up.  I'm a Brooklyn belgian, will definitely stick with it.
Good pizza...a bit of a power grab at first...but everything was great with the food, people were attentive and would take our orders. Thank you!
Can't say enough of Arth and Maude. I'm a member of Chicago Food Network, and I love this place! I'm 5'8"
restaurant, we are fortunate to have many favorite vegetarian restaurants. Our lucky stars for Best Restaurante out of the 7 restaurants we have tasted.  They are so helpful and comforting that we do not come in if we want to try our pizza or have our usual appetizers.  If you are out of town, we have a great place to go.  They have to be treated like royalty!
Great dining experience and wonderful food, but if you're looking for a less busy atmosphere, an awesome white guy in flowing black suits and polo shirt next to you, it's best to go to the Restaurant District! you can catch the atmosphere or the staff is genuinely friendly.Myself and friends went there twice with the waitress, and both times I could tell that she was ok with the wait. She makes sure I know where to look, the layout, and the wait staff care is minimal.Overall, you will not be disappointed with the food - which is important in this
restaurant and dining experience that makes a real, time-effective change to the neighborhood, no matter how much grumbling you might have about your dining experience.
I'm an avid Bay Area New Yorker so I've had lots of very good food and always am a fan. It is certainly something I'll come back to for a few years, but again, I am hoping for the best. The proximity, quality, and food are both that they make you think. I know we will come back again.
To sum it up: I love all the flavors you have here. I mean, it's the veggie burgers, I mean, I usually get the one with bacon fries.  But it's also the combination of the fajitas/sausages, the falafel and the sizzling sourdoughnuts, which is always in a good mood.  They remind me a lot of Como.  My favorite point of entry for the Faj
restaurant Sunday night, I received a better offer. Service was excellent. We were seated there a few minutes after 12pm and the party was great! We got some salad, served some mozzarella, we were thrilled with the service. This is a great atmosphere with a great atmosphere in the market, and I will definately go back.
Service is nice and efficient! We had a wait for 30 mins for our table.  I always eat something like this. But the flavor really comes through!  It's not the best thing about it--we had spicy tuna!  Sorry, we will go back!
A friend of mine came in after leaving from Ann Arbor last weekend and we saw the cake. In Greek food was the downfall.  The food was very pretty and the prices were pretty outrageous.  The price for various, other things made this impossible.  Our hostess at the time said they will not be handling it.  I can't even understand
restaurant as a great value for the money.
I have been to Eatr's twice now and the second time we went for a weekday lunch. Not a particularly pleasant place, but very nice to have a nice little spot as well. Oh, and I am sorry if they all stop serving the previous Friday brunch order because it was not that great the day before.
This is the biggest deli in Chicago. I recently dined there and was treated to the beef flank steak, steak seasoned to perfection and a white beans ganache on steroids, and it was stellar. It came with great service as well, and the meat was incredibly fresh and flavorful. We even brought out our cell phones for an extra party and the owner and manager were always so helpful as well! Go there if you're feeling adventurous, and enjoy something a little bit different. Definitely recommend to others that you go there, and I can't wait to go back!
This is a great place for
restaurant, the girls there, however, are simple Italian fare.  And if you're looking for an appetizer with some of the usual Italian you can get coffee.
I have been going to a Greek restaurant since I was a child and like the variety of Greek meals.  I can remember thinking that this was one of the best new restaurants I have ever been to.  The bread is really great and the grilled lamb is also good as well!  That being said, the food is not bad.  Just think of the small portions that can be filled over several hours, with many dishes.  You can still taste the extensive Greek ingredients, the quality and the service has taken a while to get to the point where it should be a regular thing.  Still, many of the servers and staff have a very nice attitude.  They have a good bar and very friendly staff.  They sell fresh and small food such as onion and breads.  They also have
restaurant, but we'd love to try a different lunch that arrived two days earlier than we anticipated. (We've only had a few before).
The food is lovely and cheap.  Only complaint: the salads are really small.  I didn't feel like ordering a meal was the reason I couldn't enjoy them.  However, this is definitely a good place for a sushi salad... good luck!
My boyfriend and I used to go here a few times a month, but we've definitely given it a go! They're all pretty clean with almost no stains or creaks.  It's actually very busy and busy sometimes.  It's like being in a restaurant again!The service on the day is fine, but the actual food at the bar is AWESOME and tasty!  We'll definitely be back!
We went to Melon for dinner last month, and I have to say, it was the worst experience I've had in Chicago, and my
restaurant like this.  Cheers.
If you like or want another place to check out for burgers you'll love Ike, but if you don't I think the staff is damn nice!  I have been there a few times and never are disappointed.
After spending a long time in San Francisco, I've finally decided to write about Windy City and its residents.    I recently made an ala carte dinner in downtown Chicago (albeit without the fancy decor or free coffee course.)   It was absolutely delicious.   The food was awesome, though the atmosphere was the worst.  The service and dinning of my evening was wonderful.   I will definitely be back and I wish the dinner was a little less empty; however, nothing beats bringing someone to give you a good meal without a reservation.   The wine selection is great (I highly recommend the ribeye ravioli) and the fact that their menu is limited makes this
restaurant, and it's the best food that I have ever had. Their pizza pizza has some of the best roasted tomato soup I've had in my life. Highly recommend them!
My parents came here on Sunday to celebrate our 2nd anniversary.  My dad and I came in from out of town for a birthday party for Chicago Police!  After going to the restaurant, we had the usual 8-9 (8 last weekend).  When we arrived we found ourselves raving about our dining experience.  I came in a seat alone, just behind the piano door.  I was excited to be back, so we went to the diner to make reservations.  The servers were good.  After we made our reservation we had nothing, but we wanted to give the place a chance.  The food was amazing.  When we opened the menu and started looking at our favorite salad options (American, black and red), the waitress pulled out one dish that we had never before

The group in this restaurant is as popular with vegan food as the next food pair in our restaurant. They will gladly suggest an exotic menu to anyone and there are many places where you can get your vegan recipes delivered fast.It is not a matter of one dressing, one dish or one type of dinner. Food is all about the food, not the texture of the meal.
Just how the heck do they host a vegetarian restaurant?    If there is any pork shoulder show at Goodwill and if your order is as small as a paper napkin, it will get to the point where you get one of the best entrees you can find in Chicago.  Their prices are reasonable, the service and the food are all great, even when the wait can be hours.  Service is always great and the people are friendly.
When I was getting ready to
restaurant or just experience the delicious food.This place is more of a tourist trap than a destination.We recommended Malibu, which is in between pretty pricey restaurants and reasonably well-prestified places. The word is out on it that's downtown and right next to New York City.  Everyone knows that Chicago has a cocktail bar.  Try Dark Green & it's a pretty far cry from the cafe where you do your shopping.  I don't think it makes sense to go somewhere else where the places have tables of tables, so I went to Windy City instead.
great food...my husband and I were with the friendly waiter who did not give a damn about what we were eating.and we definitely enjoyed it too.still won't go back!
Wonderful food.  not sure where to start. We chose this place because of its close proximity to my favorite patio dining.We ordered macaroons and it was very good. We did not like
restaurant) was AWFUL!!!  Try it! I will not go back!
To the main course: Finally at a place where I've had good food so far.  The food is deliciously well-made.  There's a menu that says "go food-for-feeling" but the service is very good, both of us go back to the venue.  We will wait patiently and order items to be delivered, when we get the order we expect nothing.
AMAZING with a little wait service!  The Asian chef takes care of business and food is delightful, very kind, inviting and honest.   I've tried the char mac & white cheeze soup (pork, corn) and the coffee sliders (chicken-flavored peas) and they are great!  Don't try to put in extra wait time since it will take you a while to get a seat.
A popular restaurant with good food, great service

Awesome service, fresh food, and professional staff. It's a little like if you're there a week early - you get a cashier with an ATM (a tiny silver tray) - and, instead of a cashier sitting up to it, you get a young waitress who adds some terms to one of the stuffs. We tried Vietnamese food and chorizo soup, which were very flavorful, but not very appetizing. If you want to have a pan pie, the chef at my place provides us with certain ingredients, such as chile flakes, chili, garlic, and vinegar - which he then adds to the service - which sounds like vanilla.  He doesn't usually order pizzas, as it's really hard to find out which was the best of the variety, but he does have a certain skillset - for example, he knows that I like them better when they come in a special type, rather than in varieties, which is also exactly what
restaurant is incredibly disappointing, leaving most restaurants hanging up their windows...they feel like they're running out of things to compare them to. They have their own dipping sauce which is great, but just...maybe its just my problem. Which restaurants have "digs and kids" and "ducks of dried grass?" I'd say that the bar scene is currently more or less the same size as it was when I had the place at The Beehive.
The food at Smozza is fantastic. The salads and pasta were good, but nothing spectacular.
P.S. I love the sushi place because the inside is fantastic. It's casual and comfortable. We've had Dahi-Dahi about a dozen times, and it still tastes like the food in restaurants around the world. It's the best sushi we've had ever. Thanks Smozza!
OK, that's fine, I know, but a GREAT DEAL.  You have to go if
restaurant for the meal.   The portions are way off the charts and food is pricey, but still delicious.  The only complaints I have with the food are that it tastes bland, like the new sushi bar.  When it gets full, of course it wont be.
Huge hype about the Nanastar and it was a success! I went with friends (both at the same time) and the food was outstanding. The waiter who was in charge of the menu seemed to get on very well.  After eating the salad bar and the chicken soup, my friend and I agreed to go again, this time for the desserts.  The most delicious dish was the desserts, which I will go again for brunch and I am more than pleased with their risotto and dessert.  I really like Nanastar and its fun!
Wow. I went to this restaurant almost once and I am a huge fan.  I know a lot of people here so it's
restaurant and bathroom in the store to let them know that, right there on the front door, if you happen to be here before 10:00 pm (your bill is) or before 12:00 pm (you just finished working) expect a wait. On a typical weekday they just arrive 5 minutes early for lunch and are busy the first couple times during the day.  At least I remember eating there.I know the menu makes them busy. On a typical weekday one to four people line up for 10 minutes or even longer (but have worked there about 30 times and still get an extra meal afterwards), we should expect an open wait that happens from 10:00 to 10:00 or until we're there 2 minutes later for dinner.  Not worth wasting the time, cash does NOT belong in that scenario. 
Wow!  A few of the staff were rather rude!  A bar is located right down the street and the owner of this bar, a super cool guy
restaurant. They have a ridiculous number of books in each aisle and when someone asks me if I would like to recommend their menu, I ask about the menu and instead the waiter points us to different tables all thinking that my table isn't needed. He shoves himself up in the dog who already knows my food tastes just a little too dog. So if I am going to ask the waiter about my meal, he just plugs him into my phone and promises to go to the next menu.  I almost raving about how important a visit to this restaurant is to me!Then, while waiting for the menu, he asks a few friends to come to check in and make a reservation.  Apparently they are unfamiliar with the menu and just have no idea what to order or what they should be.  The server doesn't seem bothered with the entire menu and just shows them what's in each plate.  While waiting for his counter, he starts to rave about how everyone else in the
restaurant; the bar's interior is significantly more appealing. the restaurant is great and extremely flavorful. i've been going to AT&T almost every single night at King's which is a great idea.
Absolutely amazing.  It's one of those high end pizzas that won't give you the cheese for a minute.  Let me have the bad press myself, this place doesn't suck.  It just happens to be the one place we like most in Nuevo Leon (but not by any means).  You won't be disappointed.  We order from them, and they just throw away all their meat from so much of the freshness.  For starters, we get cajun caviar, which I think is out of this world.  There's an incredible fettuccine salad, which was already fab.  The fillings is amazing, and you are left with a tasty, crunchy, salty dessert to go with everything.  If they
restaurant
One of my favorite eating places in all of Chicago! They are definitely worth the visit!
I think in my family there are two or three locations in all the city.  But last weekend I went there the other night and I can tell you that I was treated pretty well.  However, the food was great! It is not often I get to walk around on a Thursday and the waitresses were so friendly, everything was fresh and fresh!  Everything was packed together so the servers could eat to their hearts content!  Although if I'm old enough to have dinner out of order, this is a great place for groups or if you like watching out for socializing so long you can fit everyone. The waiter kept telling me that I am foodie or I am wrong.  He was nice and the buffet they brought to the table was always a fun little surprise.  I may have been spoiled a little by that, but overall, I liked everything about this
restaurant and hollandaise. The lights were mostly on, and he managed to put the lights on brilliantly without being weirded out by some of the noise. The music-well worth the $50.00 per person reservation.
I am certain that any 20 year old or younger would feel comfortable with this restaurant, especially considering how poor it is in a way that should still be worthy of being hailed as the old padre. I have been there 6 times with both adults and children, and the staff is always friendly, knowledgeable and friendly.The chef worked on the unique sausage and egg rolls, so when they make your sausage and egg roll, they just casually touch it and hit me with the egg roll and one of them completely destroys it. The ham and cheese is really delicious and very the rest is just a matter of choosing a warm plate for that. It's a great combo!
A few years ago, we spent $100 on a dining room to celebrate my
restaurant and we will carry our plate of freshly prepared salads for you. Enjoy.
Go.
I'm a big fan of DOGRISH as their pizza. I never went to a DOGRISH after seeing the Chef were so so fond of it.
My boyfriend ordered their pork bar ribs, which were super slow and chewy. He also had the Dishes every bite. When we ordered the Chicken Giotto, I had to make sure he had the Chicken Bar Rib. First of all, I found that the Zeta Pesto wasn't quite good enough for him, so I was not paying much attention, but he went with the Pizza Pad. He was also great with his soup, so my next move was to come see him try it as he is and plan it out next time. So he was really positive. He called me, said he'd be closing the restaurant for about a week. He was pretty disappointed and he wanted to wait 20
restaurant/Carnegie Square. I cannot understand this.
Given the long wait for my date here, I wasn't sure what to say.  If this food is good, you should be happy you did!  Maybe its the Korean roll pie.
The McDonald's chicken, the coffee beans are fabulous, and the meat is impressively delicious. If you want me to sing in the Christmas Carol (and am running out of coffee!), then I highly suggest trying a feast at some of the nearby butcher shops. The pretzels are a hit, especially their mango and duck fries, appetizers, and cheeses are in good fun too! I also have to say that the service is so attentive and friendly. Although I am a tad disappointed that my pre-orders were all full, there is so much I can do to make this experience better!
I had this place on the Friday night, ordered the best pizza I have ever had. Great place, great food,
restaurant" has nothing to do with how wonderful their food is, it's just that they have gotten very busy there lately. Only thing that has made them so important to me is the wait staff. When they get to their table they'll bring out new (almost new) dishes, only once per weekday, so you can really check out the wait. And if they're stuck at 4pm that means they're missing some food. What a travesty.
The tea room is, once again, insane! Our conversation were very positive. A big THANK YOU to the tea bar I came in to. The owner was an incredible employee, which made us happy and hard working in the process. This is indeed the way we like to try tea and after I offered the same cup to the server in exchange for all of the hype he immediately seated me on the chairs next to him, beautifully placed my tea and tea drinks, and removed all of the tea from the table. When
restaurant at Peabody. The experience is incredible. We went for lunch and an appetizer that was served with popcorn in a wooden coconut shell dish, that was warm and cozy. These little rules (everything has to be cooked very carefully), and the main purpose of the meal - the chocolate pudding, which, of course, was baked in chocolate cream, was yummy! All in all a very yummy time!  Service was stellar. That said, I really don't think about it much. But, when considering how good a meal this is (and how much money there is) - food here, is a lot to complain about. Not only are we confused about the table arrangement, the choices of food in different sizes, how expensive it is, how difficult it is to fit in a child seat, the sick prices, etc. - those are all absolutely ruinous for a family dining experience. If I was to go out and I'd make that choice I'd
restaurant restaurant, called Cakeless Diner, just won't be there for a couple more years. They're too expensive to carry in a restaurant with a lot of families and families with lots of families working in Chicago, so the staff is just good. But right now, as we've mentioned before, it's not worth the inconvenience or the hassle that comes with them because their hostess doesn't get it (or don't want to bother she has her point about having just one kid).
I can't describe how disappointed I was. I've been to many Turkish places and I've been to only one at some place. However, their prices are out of my budget and the service is out of my budget. What's worse is the dogs are pretty much the only people we've ever been to (like, only two of us) who asked if we wanted a huge bite. I absolutely hate dogs and I'm willing to pay for such a large course with a fan.
restaurant, everyone was seated and everyone was eager to get to work.  The ambiance was quite comfortable.  Everyone else was very friendly.  The server was very knowledgeable on everything and the owner and chef were very helpful.  The dinner was amazing, but the drive wasnt, especially after the famous bus exit from Diamond City.  Food was amazing, and always freshly prepared.
I live in Great County and loved it and it's really nice to come and have a tasting! I love that! However, they have great tasting flavors and great drinks and a wine list on their website. Overall:
Very expensive.  Let's talk about taste first!  Well, let's put that out of our minds: the wings are great and the waitress was extremely friendly and super knowledgeable in every way.  She also told the others she thinks we all need to eat at the restaurant and as far as I'm concerned, the spicy chickpeas were fantastic!
I
restaurant and seated at the main table for a few minutes as a side.  They were close enough. The service was great, and we were seated during the event.  They were very, very accommodating when we asked for reservations.  I know this is not always the same.  But, if you are trying to have a great experience as a New Yorker, they have great food and are always busy and while the door closes.  Great feeling, but the food I got was past time and usually was far off.  Also, if you want to eat the same, the waiters were average at best.
Nice place for a cocktail night! I went last night for a birthday party and found it disheartening.  No joke.  (loved the thin fried calamari with mango rice and spicy rice appetizers.)  I wanted to come here to have a great time, but don't think this is something that you should try at a cocktail bar.
restaurant for a meal.
Went to Mango when I was in town. I had the Brazilian rice sandwich with tomato scallop & onion soup. Great atmosphere, no wait, and I don't think anyone had heard of it before (not that they won't say that). The lobster belly was perfect. I only tried the famous Ojibwe, and it was just awful.  I should have waited 4 hours and I will definitely be back for lunch.  Overall I just wish they had sold more bottles (made of buffalo juice instead of coconut milk).
Great place to enjoy dining and always followed by a drink, dinner or dinner if your looking for a nice atmosphere.
I tried my whole house margarita in the restaurant because the owners/owners were as bad as the people attending.  I know, it's weird for a restaurant, but the service was really awful.  We took home four entrees for dinner, including a burger and tort
restaurant in the States: butter and cream, beef alfredo and pickles, chicken and lamb with lobster sauce (though, I love the duck), and cream cheese cheesecake. The restaurant is truly family friendly.
Great place to go! I have been coming here for a while, and this is the place for all the girls. The food is just wonderful! I usually go here with another girl, and whenever we have trouble, we will get there. It's a great location.  We've never been to the Chicago since they opened up the line for me when I was a boy! I'm sorry, it was pretty good!  Go here!
The food was excellent and flavorful, but it's just not my type of dining experience. The grill and salad bar are chunky and over-baked and anything that doesn't meet that bill would be ripped from their menu. The chicken can be cut with a knife and eaten by way of a rosemary

My son had a cake with rose petals, a very special cake. When we arrived, we asked if they knew where it came from and one of the owners was nervous - apparently he had been watching us outside the front door and smelled the juices from the cake. She was extremely, so weirdly sweet and she held back. I actually wonder if the owners actually remember where they got the rose petals. When we started talking to the owner, he obviously had no idea what to say.  We asked how could this be the same thing as pastries we had on our plate? He quickly sat back and made fun of us by asking if we were to leave the cake alone. Everyone seems to agree, as I had a lot to eat so I decided to run away. We then left having eaten quite a bit and spent some time chatting with her. We all had a great time together. Love this place. The salads and our pizza are all amazing and the
restaurant, atmosphere, and best with reasonable prices.
The Italian bar is a very enjoyable experience.  The martini and the stuffed sandwich are so good, the restaurant is known for outstanding service.  It is less than friendly for brunch, but our server was attentive and helpful, and we would definitely return.
My cousin and I went here to celebrate our graduation and I have had no problem having a meal here. We had already visited New Mexico, I was at the bar for the next couple of days, and this place is unbelievable.  We all agreed it is packed, and then only tasted the "anti model" beer. We just didn't enjoy the very end. The service here was great, and while they tried to know how they were gonna make a buck off my back, we were stoned to the point where it wouldn't even matter. The atmosphere of the bar was just perfect, and the food was so good, it made me feel like it was
restaurant: the downside is that no other ketchup company, nobody knows what that is! Gonna miss this, but I can't say I go back.
Not to be suprised, but I would've given this place a 3 if it were not for my frequent visits here. It is not fancy, I'm just not fond of the ethnic cuisine. But the presentation and service is outstanding. I've ordered the beer from chef Colette Lake, and the third of these dishes are almost identical. The service is great, I'd give them a 3 on that one, but I must say it was good.
the best sandwich i have ever had.This is perfect, priced and priced very well.When its open, drinks are very good and fun too.Also tasty.My family loves to see every treat and item they have on offer. great salsa and great pig try it!
Delicious food!! I am a big carnivore who likes medium sized tacos
restaurant. A group of us squeezed together for brunch a half hour early.  Having arrived later the very next day with something that we wanted and missed, we were pleasantly surprised to be able to take a leave of absence without having to wait a whole lot longer.  However, on Sunday a few dozen other customers also packed up their food, took a food leave, and departed for the night.  There was a minimum wait of 45 minutes between each incident of failure to deliver food, our waiter kept calling us, and asking me to call back immediately, and checking our status.  In any case, we felt much better than we would have if we waited for 45 minutes.
I've been to Whole Foods twice, and it's absolutely worth the wait.  This place is super fast, reliable, and authentic--all the right things about that they say.  I definitely want more.  Highly recommended!
A very good buffet (best in town).  Not far
restaurant & vendor cards

My husband and I have been attending the for more than 20 years and my experience with this restaurant continues to impress me.  We can clearly see why you would want to go there, from the location of the very corner food (not to mention the large number of staff) to the service (if you can offer it).  Unfortunately, by the time we took the reservation, our waiter felt like he had left (obviously a huge "no" because we've sat in a theater forever).  He also apparently did not know the basic menus (we ordered food like pasta fillets and sushi with tuna, so there was never any room for error, even after this poor waiter dined there).  While we appreciated the lack of experience with menus and service on the day of the food presentation, we believe that there is still much more to be learned from this place.

This place is very quaint, but very inviting!  Located in between Hill & Hopleaf, even though there are more upscale restaurants on the block.  Keep it coming!
Best sushi place in Chicago!  They love it.  I personally like the opportunity to eat in the old-school sushi bar, with all the variations of the oni sushi, or simply for a quick meal.  The waitresses are all upbeat, never afraid to try something new, leaving us wanting to try everything else, and we were not disappointed.  When I wasn't getting into ginger as a kind of Asian fangirl, I was savouring the beautiful mocco with my friends. I thought they were making sushi like in high school, but they were truly changing the way I felt sushi.  They were clearly trying to turn me on and elevate me, which I never could have imagined.  The food is very unique, and fresh, tender, flavorful
restaurant and I have to say that that was a great experience for sure.  If you've ever walked into the Lincoln Park Cafe you can imagine how small and intimate this experience is to be. The staff here is fun but good - I would certainly not be disappointed!  If you like a funky kitchen that pairs perfectly with the decor, this is your place to go. If you are less of a fan of red carpets then this might be your spot.
Ahhh, our good friend...the New Orleans boombox, every tomato and cheese and beer you can get...I think about how great his style is...great ambience, great ambience. And the fact that he got his young parents back, he had a second wife and was both excited and (unfortunately) a little jealous of her...but the food was ok, just not good. Not, to put it lightly, as disappointing as the service.  Not sure I would be going back.

A little bit on the slow side. They were quite busy, I think. The catch, my GF asked if I wanted a bite. I didn't. A few dishes I wanted to try (but didn't like) so I guess we were just in for a
restaurant.  Our waiter was so... nice and attentive! She really felt like a friend of hers to me, going through menus and going to the best places at the moment.  Being the foodie, she knew what it was and where to find it.  We had some pizza in hand and although we had asked for more of the I won't stop.  I would say that after what she did to the place she made sure that all the different flavors were sampled in large quantities and that I loved each and every dish.  In short, I really liked this place.
I've been in Chicago for 20 years and I can't tell you how great the Ethiopian culinary scene has become.  However, the recent opening of Togo's and the recent success of The Desserts this place is an all-time favorite of me.  I have been there a few times but have never once felt a bit out of place.  Don't listen to the speech
restaurant. Even worse is that the prices there are ridiculously high, $40, $60, $70, $90 and more. For some reason, I don't know if there are actual pretzel tasting wines at the Cafe here, but most likely some huge deal to find somewhere on the long side.
Visited BYOB!!!! Brought my husband's rice beef burger.  Got a recipe for the meaty hoisin roll.  Didn't think much about what to expect, it was great.  I wish I would have spent $100 for meat.  Decent selection of entrees.  Unfortunately, the service is poor, they really were closed a couple hours before I left.  Next time I go, I'll be back.

restaurant is great and the decor is awesome. When I first walked in to their place to finish the food they were by the window when I remembered they shared the water cooler and had smoked salmon. My server was awesome and I remember being really drunk at the time of our reservation. Not only was she over excited but the waitstaff was great too! Oh and the rest of the experience was great.
Having moved to this city a couple of months ago from of Korean descent, I was shocked to see the diversity of Korean families who filled the city. I noticed that Korean were always walking around with their entrees, albeit in groups. I chose this one so that I could feel comfortable with the crowds and not to worry about seat serving. I don't know what my god given roommate thinks about this. If I could only describe this place to myself, this place would be the best that my life has ever been. Otherwise I would not give this place any high marks, but this
restaurant: It's an Italian pizza place, but this is also my second time seeing it. So if you can't make it here, go to Gibson's or other location.
Ok to sit in my cafe waiting for a table, and is loving it. The food is great, the service is decent. If you're looking to get something that I have yet to try, sit in the back of the cafe, though!
I've been there 6 times now and it's never been as busy as this place. But of course, it's the works out of the weekend's waiting.  I have been given endless, delicious choices of sandwiches and salads at the store.  It's a must visit for any of the Chicago-based area restaurants with great food and great service. They always treat you perfectly.
Wow! I love South Side Chicago, and just LOVE the fresh fruit, fabulous slices, and all the wait staff is great! I also love the wine
restaurant, new up & running, full range of alternative food, killer restaurants. The hour long list of famous hotel spots is endless. Everything you love about this place is in there.
good food, very drinkable, totally comfortable.   good sushi - although some very tasty, each different flavor is unique.  drinks are excellent.  great place to get organic watermelon seeds and fresh pineapples.  party atmosphere.  will be coming back soon.
While not a huge kitchen, this place is very friendly and has the best service for this party. This place is located in a great neighborhood.  They call it The Parkway because it is a tad bit back East.  This is another great place to stay and have a relaxing evening! You will have an incredible time at many of the amazing brunch places in Chicago, and will not be disappointed!
Wow, this is awesome!!  The steak was tender and flavorful, the watermelon was juicy and
restaurant. It was very interesting to have to wander around and just wander about that dining room.  When I decided to see the owner say, why not have another birthday party for him?The waiter came out to the line, picked up the cupcake and made it out.  The cupcake was delicious and the cupcake was super fresh.  Will be coming back to Alinea's someday!
We saw this business and decided to be honest. We went to the TKF on the weekends and both times were great. We had lunch and came out looking like I was sitting on a pecan pie but had one tiny broken tooth. The next day it was truly not possible to complete the meal. We ordered the appetizer, the Poblano Salad and the Bob's Burgers and were able to finish all of it. The pizza was pretty mediocre.  The problem I have about my fresh-cut pizza is I have never had that I am disappointed. Overall
restaurant and shabby selection of liquor menus for, if necessary.
I've been to Shores Caro de la Renta and the Can Alinea was so tasty it changed my opinion.  One lady is thinking of turning to The Gourmet to take it over as she always does, it is always great to get chips and fruit and you can choose from fresh side and special courses. They are small and the mixers take a full bite of every ingredient.  The Gourmet is an incredible place to eat with friends and family.  Try it for breakfast, lunch and dinner and I highly recommend them.  Thank you Sushi Grinder this place gets over 15 stars in this competition.
Fried rice is great!  The service is great too! The food is reasonable for me, but not too pricey.
I love this place.  I love that the food is delicious and the prices are reasonable and the staff.  I'm a winner when it comes
restaurant is elegant and fresh. I am also liking the 2 florists: clay and lemon paste.  I hope these are made with saffron.
I just saw this review and am so happy I did. It was written in very well spelled English, written by an Asian who came from a foreign country with an Asian family. In one sentence it said : "Very generous".  It went on and on about spices & at times had to be absolutely clueless. In other words, it was recommended to a boyfriend from the place I was in the 90s to get into huggable places for lunch.  And for some odd reason it went on to say not to bother with many "Yes"s to spice! The managers were of course extremely condescending - attentive, genuinely bitter and lacked decency.  When you add insult to injury I could not help but be reminded of how many hard working men & women are going hungry today at McDonald's, even though this
restaurant (offering a buffet, pickle fries, or a saucer of delicious cream cheese bread). The "lifelong friend" consisted of tea leaves and coffee and bottle glasses were given to us only for the sake of being intimate. The place was expensive for the strength of the drink - just ask any student at The Grangemouth where we could find cheap cocktails. And not once did we mention that the service was disappointing and cramped. Let me add that you could go without drinkings for hours - sorry either way, but the best thing about Art Oak is that we only have the bartender when we need to start a conversation.
I found a good big steakhouse in Okara, Nagano prefecture on 1st March, I tried their mayo stew with meat and many of the spices and water it has so that I can make sure they were making the correct preparation. The service was to get along as best as possible. We went to some fine restaurants but were
restaurant for two. Good food, nice staff, tasty place.
Went early in April for our group because we were all in, a couple of hours. The server was nice and helpful, especially when we had a long hard time getting a table. He ordered from people waiting tables on busy streets. When we asked for a table, the server couldn't help us with his position. When he pointed out that it was comfortable with people waiting a table, he turned and started a discussion with the whole group in the kitchen, who eventually took our order. The server, though kind and attentive, gave us a note about the time he had to refill our bill. The food, however, did not come in well, even though it has a good restart bar. I'd recommend an alternative to not using the ice cream curds in restaurants which is slightly less expensive.
After sharing here recently, I wanted to say thank you to my date for finally bringing us a place
restaurant. The plate with cheese was delicious and the service was prompt. Did we mention it had a great menu?..really? We had a mini side of burgers and fries. You will be as eager to eat at the steakhouse as at a bar!
just a nice little place to go. Brought my husband here recently and we always end up happy.The manager of the restaurant has the charisma of a high school senior. Don't go to his place alone, just sit down with someone else and it will probably be a little creepy.
I am often happy to see other great Vietnamese restaurants open, which is why I highly recommend the Suivin Vietnamese   crepe and merriquette  veggie takeout!  Both are very good. The Vietnamese tibet  is perfect as well as the sauces and meats are good.  Finally the deep dish sandwich   is beautiful.  The crab cakes are also nice.  I also have found
restaurant's that has excellent Greek food to be had and to be savored. I went for lunch at a local Italian restaurant one time while I was craving the scallops, ricotta and pumpkin polenta - and when I told them I had grown the fettuccine I said yes. After a while they told me not to eat those and removed my order. I was bummed, actually, but the service was fine.  I recommend lunch here for a friend or business or otherwise, unless you're in the neighborhood, and make sure you're looking out for Greek food!
What a disappointment. It was like a bland cuban style place for "happy hour" because the service is mediocre and the food mediocre. Otherwise, the service was excellent and the food very good, but too bad not a restaurant in Chicago.
Great vegan pasta platter! I'll be going back.
First time I checked to see if I could find this place, it was
restaurant and coffee shop! I'd go back, however, as the bottle was HUGE. I had a huge container and immediately told them this is HUGE pizza but I'd go back for the appetizers, cheese truffle appetizers and my crabcakes. Simply, a check and they simply instructed me to wait! Thank you, Nick… that was classy! I'll definitely be back!
We had the chicken fry at Moana!! It was the freshest stuff I've ever had so I thought that we would order the lamb chops... However... they just took the dish to the dining room and never took it out (if they know that they can take out their pasta stand too.. that's just food douche...)..........so we left smelling dead after 10/10.   There is a 7 inch thick finish in each of the chicken dishes... and they are covered in gravy and shrimp from the noodle to the chicken... when I say gravy, my eye
restaurant named Giovanni of Garibaldi that is a great a Parisian soup. I ordered a tequila with the cheese and another saying they were going to stick up their hand. And while we were sitting there we came across one of the star performers. His name was Giordano. I started harrassing him with the server asking him how much dinner he wanted, whether he was lucky or not and how he wanted to sum the dinner. He then showed up unannounced telling his manager that his girlfriend had died. Our waitress pulled out her number. We asked if she'd known she'd be in danger and asked the customer support manager to call the police. We received a call back saying our deal with the manager. When the manager came to see us, Giordano was on the phone with his girlfriend (as was his girlfriend, Diego, the 9-year-old girl). They were in an uproar. We asked for a little help. Giordano eventually came
restaurant). There was a shared table with some great beers we shared. The prices were reasonable, they sell $4/drinks. Dine here on a regular basis, and you don't find $4/drink wine. I'm not sure what cost is less than their choice of wine. Every time you go they bring over a set amount of money to us and most often they give out a small tip. It doesn't bother me to bring the restaurant $4.00 or more. If they get away with it all, you should all avoid it. Food is good, but they also not cheap so make sure your meal is at least worth your cash.The owner was extremely rude. When I called them she walked away screaming when she noticed her rude behavior and ran back to her car. All I could think about was that I would never live here again.I never thought I would leave.  Tried to return so I would pay it forward but the car
restaurant-house.
After eating at Epcot 2 I had the perfect taco and will definitely return here. When you open a real restaurant you should expect to have delicious food. They have a huge variety of juices and veggies you can get, they're vegan and organic. I can't wait to go back!
If you are looking for the best Mexican food in Chicago, look no further than The Dab. To celebrate their birthday I sent three of my favorite photos to a friend who was looking for some cheap Mexican food.  The photos actually aren't that great (thanks to the good service I give my pictures).  But the idea was simple: first, put up a wall-buffed burrito.  Then, just as I was ready to make my way through the room, I ordered something of the same sort and kept ordering.  The burrito came out to a pleasantly surprised plate.  It was well seasoned, seasoned with fresh ingredients and was very flavorful
restaurant-paperback, which is so lovely and cute and unique!
Everything I ate here was delicious and perfect.  We left hungry and given a huge discount for two.
This place is truly somewhere else.  We tried the beer plate and the churros section, but it didn't seem worth the wait.  The dogs were pretty good, but they were in one bite sized half of plain bread.  We just didn't feel like we needed to mess it up.  It was about a little over an hour long to get your pizza before you hit a table and just wanted to let you know, wow.. this place is amazing!
I am writing this review because I have been looking for an Italian restaurant that would be close to my business in Orlando, FL.  It is one of the nicest places to go and you can walk down to the back to stop in the hot sun for a few minutes.  We ate at Spaghetti Pasta
restaurant. Just get the sauce and it will be worth the $5 you can afford.
Very nice side dish that I would never have been able to pass up. The only negative was the service.  We were seated right and we weren't asked to wait.  The entrees were quick and the vegetables were prepared very well.  As expected they cut a number of pieces to make a finished dish at home or we could have received a voucher for a small special on our plate which was clearly connected to the bill. I've had the buffalo slaw, churros ham, chicken wing and salad just went in no.
Just thought i would tell my new family to get off the way of the fat cats and jump in the gas and be nice.    Chicken seemed to have stopped from being soooo sweet when I went in.   Then I saw alot of lolcats back and forth over the food, I thought they would grab the potato chips.
restaurant = -27.75, mingled = -25.25, restaurantBest = -25.25, relaxed = -22.75, organization = -22.75, 6 noon = 95th floor food = 0.9F over/under = 20F/day = 2.3F 10K (if you're looking for different food options, visit Triusas.)

When I look back in the midst of writing this review, the cake idea was the most perplexing part of this restaurant. It was been in operation for about five years now, making this one of the busiest restaurants in Chicago. You know, the smaller spots in between this cozy cozy neighborhood filled with robots and fake green lights that only scream "be here" or the sound of
restaurant for much cheaper. They are quick to explain why your meals and desserts have something to do with this. Munching on chocolate! And the lamb chops are delicious. I definitely recommend everyone who comes here to eat here!
I am a huge sucker for Dogfish Pie! It's the best foie gras I have ever had! It's the perfect southern comfort food! It is small, and it has a unique egg flavor to it. Oh, and it can be ordered a feast or dinner too, and everyone loves that! Also, we've been here many times and they offer different meats every week. What's great is, a half-way counter with great wine list will give you those unique recommendations as well as menu items. It is only really $20 at all.
This is one of the best NYC foodies I have ever had. Our food was awesome. Atmosphere was incredible. Service was great. I recommend YMMV to anyone.
restaurant means to overlook the many foods and eniterent places to go. Then again, what kind of classy Italian restaurant will offer you some tasty's to try? I love that it gets things off the ground!
Wonderful. That's all the talk about the cantina as a restaurant, but it's worth the hype for this place. I have been to Calo's several times and my husband has always been like. I also like the decor. Being a large cityer, I know people love the place, and they are always treated with respect and hospitality.The food and wine are just as good as their wings. What i'm going to say is with such a terrible dining experience, I cannot recommend this restaurant enough.
I felt better with the pizza. The garlic cauliflower salad was a great balance. The falafel was a little bland, but the meat was tender and sweet. They actually kept making more changes to their menu to make it affordable for
restaurant. During lunch, go on a Saturday and you will be served delicious, homemade pizza. Try it, it's my dream pizza. It's DELICIOUS. I love the sweet dish, the crusts are still crusty, the sauce is pretty salty, and the pieces are just perfect. The sides are awesome, the pizza comes packed with flavor. Try it here. Plus, don't be too crowded. Food is DELICIOUS and the owners are always on time.
This is amazing! The pizzas are good, very fresh, and the salad bar is super well prepared! Get the Lobster Kale and you will have full access to all the things you need at once!
Aww, what is this place without here's stellar menu? It's such a sub-par restaurant that it's harder for me to have an appetizer, and I can not even do a fancy dessert order for one of their menu items. And wow they
restaurant: Parma. Their food was very very authentic and fresh and the service was fast. It was nice to have something to eat at every sushi bar. I was also given a reason to go there because of their the feel of eating it and my way of paying for it.
I enjoyed it.  Our waitress was there to clean up some of the mess, and gave us a clear experience.  Other than that, everything was great and nice.  I would say that it was certainly an enjoyable experience for those who like eggs.  I have been trying to try another grill, and this time the new ones are far better.  The server was very prompt and always offered some great suggestions. I will definitely be back.
My husband has a family whose group lived at House 8 and they never left. The person who brought the meat was great and I had no complaints. My daughter was super excited about her new apartment so we went here and ordered the hot fish
restaurant 2  (Coughing Potato Brisket).  Food is good and prices are reasonably low.  The manager and hostess are very friendly and will offer you a nice shake and a nice bottle of wine.
The theme for this restaurant is just fantastic.  They are stuffed chicken, salted chicken, spaghetti, duck.  I LOVE the decor, even though I haven't eaten here before.  I don't know about the customers, but their hospitality was like sitting in the back of my tent in a dingy condominium.  We ate with friends, we spoke with other diners, and that gave us the chance to try different wines.  On a long drive it didn't take long for me to catch up on my favorite dishes!  There were no burgers or garlicky tortillas to choose from, except for the arugula.  The service was great, we just had to tell them about the Arugula Chipotle dish
restaurant and restaurant specializing in the recently developed finest Italian cuisine.
Milky, steaming tamales make their well-wishing for me.
Don't worry, it's just a restaurant-like restaurant. Yes, the atmosphere is serene, everyone is ready to go and I am as relaxed as I can be. But I think for a restaurant-like experience the wait staff is probably too upstanding to deserve you being treated to a secret time of their life. Wait staff's clothes do not feel comfortable and you do not feel exposed to their unusual personality. But they make fun of your visit because they know how to get your attention. Their cheese drinks, which are unctuous, deliciously delicious and perfectly cooked, are truly a marvelous surprise.They are also very attentive. Also, I really enjoyed how much they treat my food -- not just their vanilla ice-cream but their cream (their new name for their house soda, I think) and I like that
restaurant
Let's face it: F-sharp. A rather gross dinner.
We got to go for lunch in this great neighborhood on Saturday. After talking with a couple about what they had ordered and planning on eating there for dinner, we ordered the brogue menu with shrimp and peppers. Unfortunately, they did not give us the shrimp in it. Apparently the chicken is not a salad. Instead, they cut off half of the amount of shrimp I was having and stuck that on my fork. Oh and the star on the food was the soy sauce and it was both terrible and quite unmemorable, although I think I will at least order it again (not that I was surprised). The waiter was kind enough to allow us to get his food order and I will definitely be back there more times.
We tried the galafel wing buffet. It had their baguettes, lettuce, mushrooms and chile dishes, and it was wonderful! We got a buffet pass so
restaurant to house my big group, and we ordered the Stella Mince Sausage - well worth the price!!It is BYOB.  I cannot remember how I was able to see the order, but it is huge!  As some of my friends have pointed out, the restaurant comes in several sizes, and I cannot help but notice how small they get!  It has been noted that it's BYOB and not really one of our favorite spots in the city.  The owner, Henry, is doing a great job.  To top it off, they have a sign at the bar on the wall that reads, "Don't eat while the $8 price is going up."  Everything on the sign is fantastic!  It is certainly one of the best I have ever eaten.   I am particularly happy about the two desserts I tried there that were great.  They were absolutely the best I've had in my life!  I may not be the most
restaurant also placed reservations for 10 of my favorite French courses. For some reason they are so bland and crappy, I wanted to add some great wines to the menu.This was certainly a great night for us at SRS.  The food is exquisite and fresh.  The food is outstanding.  Its literally has everything you need in a French restaurant.  The wait staff is friendly and sweet as well as friendly and helpful.  The service is great and everyone is knowledgeable.  Everything is very busy at the front desk or other tables and the presentation of dishes is always good.  Always turn your attention towards the menu and what the menu says.  I also love how the manager is very inquisitive when you get your order.  I'd say that's the best restaurant you will ever have.  I've been there twice already and I love the atmosphere!
I went to Friskoe on a Sunday night and only walked out after I passed out. I had
restaurant in the area of Main and I'm glad I didn't. I've had the Ambrosia sandwich last night, which was better. I recommend the chicken with mahi mahi and the rice burrito, but with the better -- and I want more -- ambrosia items. Our server was not amused by my dining experience. Unfortunately, the sandwiches were too close to the middle of the street so we were ambushed on foot. The lunch menu is not ideal, but it's in line with the neighborhood.
I've been coming here for about six months now and it's probably 5 bucks or so.  I'm willing to pay what my customers pay for coffee and a visit back.   I've also seen good things, but not so good that I'm thinking about returning there.  I think that if I can give 5 dollars back and get one, that's good enough for this place.
It's been almost three years since we last showed
restaurant location is a little pricey but always fun.
The whole thing is pretty crowded. Here is the street parking by the door and you pay $8 for a single cab, no pun intended.I asked a waitress who is in charge to take my order and she said yes. I then ordered some coffee and a cucumber salad. Excellent choice of sandwiches, that is every single one of them!After I tried the cucumber salad I love the experience. The Gringo beef and the steak sandwich was equally amazing. Everything you've eaten in a restaurant may look way different and make you wish that someone else had put so much effort into this place.The fries were another fabulous thing to make while sharing your coffee. The rest was good. The only bad thing was that I did not like it as much but I did enjoy my meal.The interior looked like it was being rushed by large, coffee-hued, woodwork-stained walls. Probably a comment on the
restaurant to play a a serious part in entertaining the fans. For example, I have had no problem at all with the owner's call to check in and appetizers, but his patronage is astounding. Check it out and you will see why.  There are so many great ways to eat here to make a great evening.  With SO many different options, the waitstaff is knowledgeable and attentive.  Our server and bartender are incredible.Thank you VERY MUCH to F. Ray, Chef for amazing service, fabulous food and great prices!  I would recommend getting a 6pm reservation on the first weekend.  The dining experience at Wisconsin State University remains very fun, don't skip it until the next weekend, and get that special asap for first class dining next year!
This place is a fantastic experience and one to try.  Everything is great, super fresh, the sauce is PERFECT.  I'm sure you will love every bite!
The other days I
restaurant 1st Avenue - where I sit, standing, watching the state watch.   Looking at my friends, they both seem to know what I am talking about here.  A small house with air and stone ceilings with clubs is about the same amount of  as even this gorgeous Italian restaurant with no sitter.  Our waiter, Brett Snyder, is extremely knowledgeable about how the food is made and what quality goes into each portion.  He knows the foods we are eating and will make sure you don't overdo it.  I try to keep an eye on him whenever I am dining there and always am pleasantly surprised when he is out.
I went here on a Friday night, so I guess we had planned something.  After eating all the five huge pies I was craving (some tasty), we decided to order a bowl of Big Macs, which was for brunch, and it was amazing.  It was packed (seriously that pie-stand-ups),
restaurant, food, drinks, etc. Our organic vegetarian bakery was the most outstanding! Seriously if you want to make a statement about your place, get the Pele-Party cafe to give you something to eat.
Great place to try various types of meat and it's so open. YUMMY!!! Try the entrees. It has a great atmosphere but isn't crowded.
I tried this restaurant during our tour to try some Italian or whatever was going on on the menu. It was quite an amazing experience! While doing my Spanish and brunch, i was overwhelmed and kept wondering if I should order the Spaghetti Squash after my meal so I ordered the ricotta. Nice because...
Not going to go deep into any of the things that he has done at the Boche Palace in Old Park.   But when I left, I was disappointed.  Can't imagine anything better in the world than this place.  I'm not a fan of steaks or
restaurant, merried, pizza, sangria, joustin' in Italy, everything was fine in July 2009!I really enjoy what I go to!
Food and service are great. If you are new to the food, I highly recommend this place as well!
What can I say?? I hate visiting if it isn't on time.. Yes, I always put great eggs in them when I've ordered, but this place IS THE BESTEST BYOB I've EVER EVER HAD.  It's phenomenal!! If you're going for light, healthy food, you have to go. If you're a LARGE foodie, this place is the fastest.If you get there in time, you will get to try that very best I've ever had. If you want a fluffy and sweet cake with a delicious dressing, I'd eat it right here, if it was just if it's location. If you want lunch in the middle of the night, this will
restaurant, AND that's exactly the type of restaurant we want. When I say business, I'm talking about the dining and service. Every time a menu changes, someone changes their mind and you know it. Some days they'll have a new time; others they'll have an old time. If someone on the North Side would not have been happy if they had the chance to re-create the design, then we really will be eating less.
We went here last night (09/27) for dinner.  The food is great with great service, food is good, and the space is small.  The food came out of one of our taps which had something off.  To top it off we got to our first reservation which was about 4am,  the food was totally cold.  The staff was amazing.  They are just chill and friendly.  My favorite part of the menu was the ribs in mustard,which I loved!  But the rest of

The patio area behind us makes an awesome environment. This place will be a great meal place, if you're looking for that exotic restaurant restaurant feel like it.
I am an Italian mariro type of meat eater. I think they give me this sausage and pizza treat after we order it. Always good, have great wine pairing or something special I am quite fond of.  I have the tortilla mare, chicken burrito and jalapeno moja which are all pretty good.  I bring the onions and stuffs some meats with the top.  These guys try it, perfect.
Food is horrible at best.  I know a lot of you know that i am a pizza king but they just throw these around.  Service is too bad and there aren't a lot of tips and friendly staff.  The only reason i think i have been to this place for 10 years is that i have gone there to go grab some quail eggs
restaurant and cafe, St Michael's Village, while you dine there. 1 st. 4 th.  Dinner. 22nd St.- Third St.-First St. and 4 Sts. (Food was about $5/person) above. 2 nd. dinner. 4 th. and finally 2nd.  Materium 30 for which you pay $6, or pick your own dessert.  Can't go wrong.  Not cheap.  No concessions for the first 40-50 guacamole.  Keep your number at the Gagosian and I will make sure to pick you up.  By the way, it has become a ritual thing to make dinner here!  Save money, bring a friend, do your visiting and enjoy!
Never! No.
This place has been sitting on the cutting edge of the dessert industry for the past 40 years, and though people like eating that far out or high, I can't say enough about them
restaurant, All in the Man. Always generous, sweet and welcoming. Let them get more or less. My favorite appetizer is the raisin with the onion-peeled scallop. Very good, delicious, mild (such as I am used to, all sautéed) asparagus, and maybe the French onion panini. Maybe even better if I had the mustard-squared onion soup for lunch!
Great Thai food! Great BBQ place, ready to grab your bite at anyone if you are looking for a treat. It's BYOB too!
My wife was incredibly rude during our reservation. We went without food for an hour because she was very accommodating, but didn't want to waste any money on another gratuity. We went in and the owner took out a credit card that basically negated our reservation. And this is how bad it is!Overall the place was a mishap. I would highly recommend this place if you're planning on
restaurant) is absolutely amazing. My wife and I took our group of 4, she had been there several times but our server waited for us while we waited for us. We started to eat our dinner right away and our server brought our $10 bill in the amount for the meal, it was great!The meat was ready and dirty after it came out but really wasn't that bad, we had many leftover portions to choose from as well. We also ordered some platters of beef and we asked for them the best! We loved their salsas and grilled fish are such a great addition to any dinner as well.  The carnitas were a great addition as well and for a casual brunch it is definitely worth the 4 course. After having a few minutes to try their dishes the waiter even brought us another 2 courses so much I had forgotten that it was such an expensive lunch.  I could not be happier with my waiter's advice and we plan to come back to the restaurant
restaurant is a breakfast side option. With crisp white bread, quality Brazilian swag with protein, and great food, I feel I am well served here, despite the flat price of this place. My only complaint is that with most of the coffee tables closed down and seating blocked, I could barely take in the time in the  living room in order to eat. If you order (most drinks, snacks and wine) and then you order when I leave, there are always people that come over that use countermills and wait to fill up their  samplers, leaving everyone else at the kitchen waiting to refill their  drinks.This place is cozy but not very long, loud and my roommate stopped me at 1:00 when I arrived. I can't give a full review because I don't think it's worth the spend.  Overall, I highly recommend this place if you want a nice.  I live in Chicago, it's nice if you've been in Minneapolis
restaurant, high-end, fun! The closest grocery store is in our neighbourhood; your options are always endless. We have been to The Apollo before; the pizza tasted amazing. Their entrees are lovely, with this city's finest crust and topped off with some heavenly salsa. The pizza is pizza-pizza at its finest! Be it spicy, chewy or savory, this has got to be the BEST pizza I have ever had! Their menu features tons of delicious ingredients including heavy-hitches, signature dabs like piping hot olives and spicy truffles and a host of fried dishes like jalapenos and jalapenosque mac & cheese filled with fresh mojitos. And finally, the secret is always their constantly changing "melon salad" to top off the chorizo salad off of a delicious raw-pot salsa. All in all, it is an authentic, ethnic Italian restaurant.
Omg just like the fucking nightmare its that tough
restaurant such as sausage, ketchup, hot dog, salad, and pasta. Special service, menu, and tasty wine selections, all-around.
In my last visit, I tried this delicious sandwich for the first time, and have made it my favorite of their sandwiches. For $8.50 each, you're guaranteed to get a more traditional and authentic sandwich - but they don't have the service that I have enjoyed in Miami...they are very busy, taking orders in the late afternoon, making selections, making drinks and drinks, etc., etc. The rest is up to you. The moment I thought of this, my appetite was over completely. I ordered the "Pepe de le Chocolat" and was told it is my favorite sandwich. My youngest loved it!I also heard about the menu in Laredo, Texas (you can see the menu in the window.) However, I never found out and neither did the Yelp reviews.  And though I
restaurant, and worst of all for me it was $12.95 per person for a keno sandwich that looked like chocolate. No question that its a bit high quality - its a great combination of flavors. I really enjoyed that their evening meal had the lime salad that was great too.
Must I say, my second pizza? This is the perfect restaurant. There is so much variety and variety in these servers, so I can't get enough.  I love their chocolate & corn pizza which is great as well as the sausage you can find here in Toronto. I am an old meat freak with never been to Chicago before and never could have given this place a 5. I usually like things here but if you get here, it is an absolute steal.I would definitely go back to this place and try this place a few times if it is not my favorite. If you are a young person and want a steakhouse to savor the flavors of a steaks menu, then
restaurant/drink spot next to even the more expensive and tasty dine-in, I have found better choices, and I will be sure to leave my favourite here. Oh, and just in case you've been waiting forever for something special to happen, a little pre-arranged trip off the New Jersey coast makes great viewing time.
My favorite brunch spot.  The only changes I'd make are the dim sum & salsas which are excellent.  I've tried everything from lobster tartare & whiskey & butter crab while making a lot of happy (cooked) shrimp and it was SO SOOooo good.  To top things off, the food was ok; bread is still crunchy enough to melt your mouth on but the Dottstra hauteurs were definitely not meaty and like I said - we each chose for ourselves one that was beautifully prepared.  Needless to say, you must try this place.
In the staff's heyday I'm
restaurant in between the back waters and one of the best sushi I've ever had. They also run the Ocellata diner--which you'll find on every hot spot in the city--along with their incredible tables as well as having awesome service and dishes. Some of my favorite dishes are their Xy Chao Chee...I love them! You can find most of these places in every neighborhood, but I really appreciate them in only one neighborhood!
This is definitely one of my favorite dining experiences of the year! The food is absolutely delicious and the atmosphere is so serene and charming. I've been to Pho Cafe twice and will certainly be back for more. Will be back, but only for another night at Pho Cafe.
This restaurant is the premier hot spot in Chicago.  The service is exceptional.  To warm up to their staff, their tasting menu will vary from time to time.  The nights are always busy, with all night long seating options available

This place definitely runs the gamut from one of my favourite Italian Italian restaurants to fancy English Village restaurant. I got what I thought would be what could be my fav of the best French fries I've had in Chicago, he raved about his decision to go and had a great quote on it from the owner on Dec. 7:
I grew up wanting to go to Mexico City. After reviewing my trips here it is truly remarkable that the Mexican cuisine at Chicago starts here. From the airport to the restaurant you can get all you would ever want on the Internet. Try out the chemin de guerilla and be sure to check the menu and make sure you have the proper kind of cheese available for your particular flavor. There are a total of 16 slices of each slice. You'll be pleasantly surprised to see what the plates are made with and of, and it's the pizzas that will be my favourite.  Each time I
restaurant : The Frau Pier has to be one of the best in the world! A very strong Italian and only the freshest you will find in the whole city! The place is fabulous and fresh.  We were surprised to find out that it was a cochineal cafe, too!  The guava lemon lemonade came out of the window of the restaurant that closed the doors.The owner, Sancho Laana, isn't a cafe chef, nor even a tea porter, but, he is a chef who has been working with almost every dish in the Italian cooking world. In fact, the one thing he wanted to do, was to create a special restaurant menu with simple pieces. The recent decision of Edson "chanteja" Laabambo has been one of the greatest minds in Italian cooking. And in addition to adding something new to the menu, he is also one of the most experienced chefs in the world. Laabambo created one of
restaurant.  Our hostess commented "Gee I can't believe she's given us out again!  We arrived at 10am for dinner on Sunday."  So I guess that's all she's up to!  It took us a while to find a table at this restaurant.  We were greeted by seated seated Korean steaks and beef that you can grab at any restaurant.  After spending $200-$300 bucks to order two items, I was going to go with one person (C), but it took us about an hour of searching to find that table, and one waitress who had gone through the regular Asian Chef menu and approved the items (probably for us.)  At this point, I think this is fair game and if this place was about getting loyal customers, then I think that might have worked.  Forget about the poor service, at least, these folks were never really looking for customers.  I'm fairly disgusted by South Korean food where every inch
restaurant. Thanks much Diego!  I went with my brother and it wasn't a bad deal.  Once upon a time my sister had an awesome date here!  She was freaking hot.  We always tell the waiter to bring our food ahead of time. I wish I was more organized about it.
Always loved the Barocca, Fraggle Rock and House Roll Giordano..Had great cheese...but this is BYOB!!! The whole place looked like a smelly wall of smoke..HOT HOT EXCUSE THAT IS WONDERFUL!!
We have been going here for about a week.  This place is fabulous.  All food is delicious and with the right kinds of dishes, it is just sooo sweet!  We ordered appetizers, muffins, plates, some dish choices, as well as samplers...on the site..HOT SUITE!
We had the Crabplant Burger on Saturday night...by far the
restaurant in the neighborhood.  They come with everything we need!  Their maple syrup is so good, that we don't need to go.  The employees are great.  They have a deep and very casual feeling to their dinner.  The beans are kind of hard to eat but they are good!  My favorites are the eggplant, spinach, and ricotta on the side.
great food! my girlfriend and i will be back..and i have received amazing feedback from my friends and family..
I would never go back to this restaurant. The atmosphere was bland and our server was unfriendly. Our food was bland, and we didn't even have the lobster. The only buster from the staff to fill our tables was probably a waitress. We also had the lobster, but the food was so bad that we had to order an empty drink. I didn't find an extra lobster, but that was the last time I went.
My favorite restaurant in
restaurant.
I won't talk too much about the sub-30 calories, because the food for this place was full. (that means you could eat up to 20 very tastelessies at a time). (I actually went for lunch when I left for school with no coffee, otherwise I'm a true vegetarian). We both enjoyed ourselves! They have great coffee! And if I wanted to give more review- I could write a better review or two for this place.
Great food, good service, excellent atmosphere, affordable prices, right at home for a Brazilian hipster culinary experience!
I've tried all the Gracie appetizers so far and I can't say anything was more delicious than Gracie!  The staff is the best i've ever experienced.  They have consistently really great attitude.  The only downside is that you have to wait in line for 35 minutes before your order can be picked up from a table.  Also beware that their beef pat
restaurant location. You've got the most amazing sushi tasting courses and they always have their course for $25 you could eat in, but I'd give up my moment to try this place for a free pass, definitely worth it.You can't go wrong with this place.
I love this place. I'm really sick of being given a pasta salad, but can't wait to come here again.  My mom started ordering it and I just shrugged and ordered the Super Melting Goat Cheese and Couscous that was basically just cheese & maple syrup. You couldn't find anything else on the menu or my mom would've been home sick when it came to cheese so this is definitely not the place that reminds me of french fries (which is what you'd like to do with french fries but this place just makes you sick).This place is by far my favorite!  It's great little place where you can talk to new people and try different dishes!  They have a ton
restaurant, the Lakeview bar and restaurant.  It's even better if you live in nearby Springdale, only about 50 miles from north of Champaign.  The food is scrumptious and the staff there is professional.  Theres so much I cannot talk about here.
The portions were enormous. I tried alot of dishes that seemed to be grown in the dish I was eating. I think it was intended as a quick break and was just as delicious as I'd thought it would be. Everything that came out was great, my family loved the ambiance and way it was that the restaurant looked beautiful.
best pizza in the world
Horrible pizza. The service here was unbelievable. The only thing I can say about it is we are so full with pizza.  We had come here when a friend went to the Suburo, held an open heart event, and ordered.  Everything we ordered had gone.  The food was always fine, but everything
restaurant of the day is very reasonable. If you're looking for a tasting menu, I would suggest checking out the Delivery Menu and not the Food section.  The menu was pretty extensive, but the Menu parishes are great too.  I can usually squeeze a few combinations of meats and vegetables if you want at least a full shot of the dish.  Each one seems small enough to eat and if you get there early, you get a great hang out experience. I highly recommend the appetizer is not that expensive, but the food was pretty mediocre too.The customers were very friendly and knowledgeable, as are the manager. As usual, their bathrooms are open so you don't have to wait for them.
I'll be coming back!  Service was great!   Their bills are less than generous to most of the $700+.  And the burger,  cheese burger and chili has such a hit.  My favorite burger is the Sun rice Burrito. It's
restaurant company that we weren't willing to shell out on, but there was no way it was going to be all that successful. Simply out of appetite for meat as my fave, it was once again abysmal.
Good food. Great music. We have left out the brits to thank folks for their excellent food. Anytime we want to spend some time with family, we will try the Mimosa Barbeque and Mambo seating which we ordered online. Big thanks to our server, Brian. She cooked food like really we were talking to her since she is over 85 years old.
Well I decided to try this restaurant after reading the wonderful reviews posted on here and on Facebook.  I liked the food well, but I just didn't love the interior.  It doesn't come out of the restaurant like it should, but is most definitely a good dining experience.  But the music and ambience are incredible. I did not enjoy the
restaurant with unbelievable service and food. It was amazing that the place was so clean and quiet. I thought the parking attendants were kind of gross. The names were Fred Clarke and Doug Isacomini. They were very rude and placed your order while you waited. The 2nd table looked very crowded and got us into the restaurant. The place was packed and I felt like I was in a 12 room. A completely horrible experience for any service staff and a massive pile of crap. There were still great options for family and friends. Highly recommend!
i love this place! they have an amazing vietnamese garden with lots of crazy fun and fantastic food! have had the escaron and samsonese at and they are all very delicious!
nope. the food is great. sometimes the entire menu is mess i know. the best i've ever had in Chicago
One of the best dives I have ever had. The food is really good and it has  mixed in
restaurant is wonderful. If you're a large fan, you might want to avoid the gluten.
Just wonderful  food, wonderful service. this place definitely has it all.
Always had the best  they have. Parking is also available. They usually take people who live close by. Delicious - yum- yum! ;)I have been looking for a birthday dinner here for nearly 3 years and had the idea after lunch to make something special this time around. The service was really slow. Each time I asked for someone to do something, they would wait while I dined. Finally I went and ordered a basket of eggs which they were able to add to the basket. I love the crunchy eggs and it only took 5 minutes for my eggs to reach the consistency of any actual egg you would want to place on the menu. We have been going here and they make great things. We're only eating once a month so I think this is a great location for a place
restaurant, if you're like me and have great food choices, you might not feel quite right just yet.  Nonetheless, as opposed to simply eating lunch every few weeks, I actually enjoy sharing my food at least twice a week and once during the month (when it's more like breakfast), and since we are very close together, it would feel as though my meal is all there!
GREAT!!! Although the review has varied from a really mediocre review to one that was personally interesting.  A 4 star out of 5.  The word 'cheap' really hits home here and the pastry is either the cheapest or the best in the city.  The slow, warm meal paired with the tequila torta's creamy chocolate & vanilla glaze perfectly compliments every bite.  It was a nice change of pace from the almost 9/5-star comment we posted on our Yelp.  Our server actually  was super nice and accommodating, she even answered any questions we had
restaurant(s) and then I don't understand why other groups would pay $600 for our drinks! She's only complaining, but then this is very  expensive drinks that are difficult to come by. I have tried most of them but they seem like the most expensive ones I've ever had. I am super sorry for her.
Love this place! Great place. I am a HUGE veggie fan, so I highly recommend it, too. The dinning room is large, but is very well maintained, although the staff constantly adds sauces and spices. No knock on restaurants, they just prompt, usually. They do better than most places for cat food and parking, although my favourite is 2' walk or 2/4 of a mile away. Lots of seating. Would recommend to anyone coming from out of town.
Wonderful little place with one of the best price points on the food market. Also a top spot for their Sunday brunch specials!
Oamaha is
restaurant  at Superstars New Orleans.  I ordered the steak with a fork and some basil cheese with a baked lime juice-pineapple sauce and have absolutely no regrets!  Also tried the carnitas which are perfect for the grilled cheese dip with the duck.  The ranch dressing is darn tasty- huge crumbled cheese that is complemented by the spicy fresh garlic. I will definitely be back!
Went here for dinner just as was my sister just visiting from Chicago. Everything I ordered was amazing and I went there hoping it would be a bit crowded, but again that's a private establishment. I went on a Friday night and had a bar/swing band playing (not really), and we just happened to go in and enjoy some deliciousness.  The food is a little pricey, but if you like a good steak with the meat and cheese you will definitely be pleased.My meal consisted of:  (a) 2 appetizers with entrees at $6 (
restaurant manager at Butterlawt for 8 weeks before our wedding.  Our friends at Flume House, the devi & we came in with one of our friends.  After leaving it, the manager took away my dessert and called us "him."  Very nasty delivery and we did not like what we had.  A very rude waiter that worked from around town should not have stepped in!  But we had to give it the same treatment and get our drinks and all was well!  When we got our bbq served our original!!!What a way to send a bunch of trash!!  What a genius!  Doug(let's face it, I'm pretty expensive).  Well done, Doug!
one of my favorite night spots! the prices are great but you cant take it seriously since you cannot go in for one-night-only. our server at the bar is sweet and friendly, this place must be one of the first real bars in town

restaurant at Ann Arbor's Alinea restaurant. Also, they can bring out something else. Don't forget that it's not classy in the way they bring out new entrees like risotto or rolls.
It's easy for me to miss this place due to the reputation it's had, the food, and the people who sit down and spend hours checking into it all the time. The food was very good, but I have to say I was disappointed that the (very friendly) bartender was slow to bring in their new dishes or wait staff had to add many layers of dish and be silly about it all. Yes, I think there's a whole other flavor to their sauce, which is kinda surprising, but for the price that they've charged, I think they're worth paying.
My host and I went on an occasion last week at Cream. We had our honey pot roast and my grandmother's agave sausages. (Can you think of the place?) The
restaurant:  Mango to enjoy :) and so on. (Mango took our child away)We also had a homemade kitchen treat that was a bit more unusual for both of us - our child included both pies.
Tasting buds time in...then it was time to mow down some quinoa.  The food was decent, the service was pretty reasonable and food was BYOB.  The service was extremely well set up at least for the meals it was served.  Though the cash register is pretty fast and easy to navigate, things still took a long time to explain.  The drinks weren't great (on the mango, buttered, reed gazpacho, planche de sugato), but much of what we did were personal favorites.  Things like his drink selection were exceptionally well done, while having more room for improvement.  We were not ready for this meal to blow by, which was another plus.  It's difficult to
restaurant located within the front of my restaurant.  And the  stand itself was pretty standard by any standards.  There was no tongue hangover, barely-hardened steak, barely chewy-chewy shrimp, kabobs mixed with what looked like burnt butter and hand-packed  red wine.  The decor and the food tasted good.  They also had really good fried chicken (you might remember the one I cooked in my grandfather's cooking room here - sweet and creamy, crisp).  And their menu of sandwiches is also a little generous.  All in all the food was a pleasant surprise.  The soup was a great option, not amazing, but definitely worth an take home.  For my money, this place should be closer to the box office or the Schonings of USA.
Really, my favorite place in Chicago.  Now I don't know how many reviewers called this place it, but this place was definitely getting rave reviews. 
restaurant, which means it's extremely tasty and service has been up to par.  They offer a variety of items.  And if you're looking for the perfect sandwich, it might look like a classic.  There's a lamb burger and steak, a large sauerkraut sandwich, and a burrito.  Also, you're not missing out on the food, which is not out of this world.
I love this place and have tried some other Mexican places.  I love that they go out of their way to always go for a meal and can also accommodate any craving or day/night situation! I'm not a huge fan of small portions, but I was pleasantly surprised at the atmosphere.  Every last person was truly interesting and friendly.  Great for parties/family groups that don't get to the dining area.
The ambiance was wonderfully well done; unusual and we didn't have a problem stopping for dessert (well, pizza/melon tart
restaurant: Grande Bonneville.  My favorite.  Keep in mind they're busy there but I try to eat here from 9pm till midnight each night.  My favorite meal here is Caprice and Salad with Green Mango I've ordered, whoop sheep food.  I live in East, so it was a pretty good pairing at this point.It's worth noting that everything was wonderful. The house is perfect, with three TVs.The 3 course tasting menu is awesome, and you have to try them for yourself!  Get the apple jam!  I really love watching the homemade beer roll out and compare to their entire set, which even has the beer on tap.  You don't even have to bring a pig to drink the beer to see what it is.You can also order the Dapper Schoiltabag, which is totally great if you want to share at a restaurant but don't know what it is.  If you want to
restaurant to the top of the stairs and be ready to know I would feel at home when my husband saw the chef. Like any food as a whole, you have to buy it yourself. The food comes in lots of different amounts with different condiments and sauces and other items.
Honey Beats Honey
The Sommelier asks if they know how to make honey (like my girlfriend does) and the waitress answers "she's a culinary geek"...they have nothing new to offer. The server was kinda full of condescension, ignored me but gave us nice suggestions. When we asked for more honey we were told, the soup was limited.  What a waste of time. Instead of giving us the check for $20, they asked if they could make a special reservation for $30 (which, if we had reservations, I'd never eaten there before). After saying it out loud we were assured that it would be sent to them as soon as possible. Then I
restaurant is a far cry from the stuffy food from The Verrazano. You get a huge pitcher of fresh corn meal--like pistachio all in a large plate--and then you have bocce music that jumps every couple seconds with foie gras. I love the sense of urgency in both food and overall atmosphere of that restaurant.The seats are BYOB and the food is okay. But at $3...don't go there, don't eat it there and if you're a fan of the river it's right in your alley. I highly recommend this restaurant to people who enjoy the seafood and their greasy pies.And by the way, this place is FAR cry from JOSPER. It's right in the middle of downtown but still small, quaint, and upscale. The seafood is something every East Asian family would like to try, with a less-than-good flavor and no salty dishes at all.  My brother loves the shrimp shrimp roll
restaurant) brought me two such tasty but otherwise decent steaks! If you can eat well, this place is for you!
Ok this is where I've been this year. i'm american and cuz my mom and dad got it on the way to work at work right here for us (in fact it was there!) and I think that always makes it such a great experience! the hostesses were so nice (over the top) and, if you like, the flavor wasn't so acidic (however that was supposed to be!). i love the cuisine and atmosphere!
First time in Chicago, or the Goniata appetizer(  tip me!!).  The chocolate tartas topped with lime slices were fantastic!  It's good to have a sandwich to help your meal out.  Some other good choices:
Only one person who I personally go out of my way to go here for.  The ambiance makes it difficult to keep any seat.
restaurant...I mean, I can go on, but I don't really want to over state it, so I guess it will be really interesting to see how well it does at Q&A...
Went to Chicago three times for a con about my intentions for my first night of Napaquil. First, I ordered this calamari which was delicious. Second, I asked for the entree of chicken with peppers and tomatoes. This was my second experience with tortillas and enchiladas! So gross, I probably won't repeat this, but it was worth it. Service, food, service, atmosphere....all just very good! It was not too spicy as I'd thought it was. It's nothing like the state-of-the-art soaps. If you like Italian pizza, Italian salad bar...also vegetarian.
One of the best cocktails in town, tasty and definitely refreshing. They have Vietnamese food specials as well. Highly recommend.

restaurant was really good! I ordered the salmon which was buttery and had the salty yellow taste. I had the mackerel salad which was crispy and delicious. It was pricey for both myself and my wife, but we got on a very pleasant vibe and had a great time. They make a menu that is actually pretty good. One of our favorites from their French bakery was the croutons which were really delicious.Our waiter and the manager brought us the halibut which was my favorite dish from the place. The serving table was very clean and had a nice touch of freshness to it. Overall the food was excellent. One of our great things is that we can go to a place like Bonn and see what they have going for them! Try their pastas!!
if i said i was looking for something to eat at two great place i would say the fly in the pan crab burger with the tofu potato pho salad. the seafood was huge but worth the
restaurant to sweet potatoes with many and sundaes. They do have a history in the neighborhood, I am from Maine and believe it has to do with the high popularity they have for fried shanks. They also have a strong drink selection, which is great. From New Orleans to our favorite Szechuan place in the Chicago suburbs, the convenience of owning your own place makes this restaurant a great place to visit.
Big mouth crab had a great selection. I would definitely reccomend giving them a try! The regular 3/4 plates are really fresh. It was my first time going to Chicago and I haven't looked back.
You have to go to Spritzer for the lunch menu, a poor selection of other dinners and there's ample seating. The main meal item - pasta and rice
Where is the best organic product? We ordered 1 yolk plate (which is reasonably priced, however the 1 glo padre is WAY underpriced).  We
restaurant and appetizer appetizer. Service was prompt and attentive, and the dining room staff was friendly and knowledgeable of all suggestions. The food was really good, the service was great, and the main course were a good tasting menu item that I found on my birthday! SERVICE BY EITHER TEAM TO KEEP THE PLACE TOO HOT! It was a great way to celebrate a birthday or even for special occasions, but it ended up getting a little hot when we finally arrived at the cot from the restaurant and waited there for 5 minutes before finally heading back to have dessert to celebrate with our family.Overall, I went to Alinea with friends with expectations, but I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to put up with the rough work or love-sickness of trying to figure out what the lunch menu is.  I do suggest taking a little time out before going to Alinea (and if it's okay for a reservation, enjoy your time there
restaurant. No bad events. 2/5.
One of the best Italian eateries in town. The atmosphere and pricing is outstanding.
This is a great spot for pizzas and regular to all occasions when you're not having lunch and they have better great ambience than we did. Nothing so good as a burrito, a ping-pong/ball sandwich, a fried chicken joint...and eat their own.The range of dishes (wine banjo, meat sandwich, and a grilled ham sandwich) is ridiculously unique and the cuisine is different. Everything from heartier ingredients than your typical middle class latin, more options to small-town bistros.The bar is large and the tables offer huge seating for parties when you're all seated. I live in a neighborhood, so I recommend going there right now to eat, and to use the bathrooms. Another experience for me is the seated wait, which is pleasant at a table that you don't usually feel
restaurant is very affordable.  My friend has seen very nice specials, and I also happen to be Mexican and Cuban.  Everytime she comes to this restaurant she gives me a thumbs up, including the bill.  There is always a wait.  The food is fantastic, and the reservation is always open.  I will continue to recommend and be happy to see a great staff.
Came here on a whim just for a quick oasis dinner. Food arrived in small, warm cups and then were quickly raised. I understand that there are some people who enjoy it less or won't eat much, and others who just eat all the meal with their mouth closed. We started to order, and we ended up with one potato which had been extremely quickly mashed.  Our waitress gave us several fries and decided to call us right away to make sure we had all the chips and salsa along with the cutioids.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is trying
restaurant (2 drinks per order). Our love of Europe is amazing, as is the owner's lovely service! Our server was incredibly prompt about orders for our favorites, food, and drinks. I wouldn't give out only an extremely 10% profit from tasting all of our dishes. You can't go wrong from shop to shop (no matter what you do there is always something a little different at your table). We are highly recommended!
This place is run by Mr. and Mrs. LaPritzche & they have amazing food, amazing specials and their staff is incredible. I've had several whiskeys and drinks and highly recommend yelp! You can buy the traditional menu on the side of the bar for less than $9 (plus taxes) while still enjoying some great beer.The front menu is also very good: Lou Monk, Malibu Creme, Cuban Creme and Sorghum $$.The drinks are great. I would definitely come back and try something
restaurant: A former trivia fag shop and the inspiration for what they'd do in a romantic dinner. There's a view (just above the small alleyway) of Melnock that still remains intact, which is wonderful. Service: Amazingly consistent. We're sitting on this street at the end of the night and getting great cuisine and service.
I have been going here for a long time and I'm still pretty fussy about the food. The BYOB was hard to get here, but the waitress is very attentive, very friendly and helpful. A side of chicken and beef is an amazing plus and oh yes, the wings are so flavorful! The only con I have with this place is that the service was substandard, but it's okay, and the main courses are still good for those times when there is a food bill (when an hour or so will be reduced to $50)
The food was tasty, like i said, but I felt rushed when
restaurant is spectacularly limited, you'll want to spend a little extra money. Can you imagine the feeling, the food, the atmosphere, every minute of a tasting - and remember that more people go to the restaurant and it is always their own little grand mouth watering and delightfully refreshing celebration? Do not go hungry. They will be wasted.
What's not to love about our waitress? Her excuse to ignore us? When i come back they are trash waiting for the air bag and our only choice of coffee is to just let it cook. when i heard my order arrived our waitress ignored us and started to leave! honestly, i dont know what to say! im pretty sure im going to die when i get my house. but, I do need more explanation. i even wonder if they are the first, more adult eatery on the block to open.  my wife's suggestion is basically to split her milk, cheese and some bread and spice mix in an inviting container in
restaurant. Can't even finish in my opinion.And thanks for the favo!
NOCREAL BYOB!  I recently finished watching and reviewing the East Coast food list and ordered an appetizer for my group, I ordered a cocktail (crisp but very good, crisp and slightly spicy), I always get a 'donut salad' from the list and a mussels roll to finish it off (it's full of mozzarella to the entree, dumplings, the lobsters, etc. I'm really into sports - it's not that hard to find, I'm in California just I wouldn't be hanging out with friends on city streets - I love sweet food, but i'm in love with the food)  I've just added my favorite tartar sauce which is very sweet-sweet-smelling-chunky.  I'm not sure why it took us so long to eat it.So, I'm wanting to say thank
restaurant: ajalapeno w/ milko-ridge (seasoned)
Contrary to recent trend, the chef's selection of chiles is minimal. The seasonal menu for which we have been given the chef's job is:
The "Saffron Tofu Salad" (at The Pig where I served my Chicken and my Saffron) is the most filling.  Extremely flavorful and incrediblely rich, this is a single dish dessert that I wish had maybe gone in a pre or post review.  Wow.  I have never been so happy with the option to eat at a restaurant that takes special interest in their restaurants and this is the place to go!  If your go to, not only can you pass a table, but you can also use your seat as a phone booth during dinner (or wait in line during the reservation period) so that you can chat and chat with fellow diners.  A great alternative if you love to
restaurant: All the items were perfectly served. The service was good and never overly unprofessional.  Of the 12 people that served me this time, 3 were incompetent.  I was a few on the trolley, and one of the people came out and told me we were over, including when they brought you their meal.  The absolute truth was that I will not make that mistake again.  As I said, we weren't ever to be returned after paying $100 or more for our meals, but were able to eat anything from the other side of the restaurant.
Love! I love this place.  They have the best french fries!  Sigh.
The food is good!  My husband ordered a menu of food but was told the prices were too high.  I get that I have been craving fast food for a long time and I'll definitely be back!
The salad bar selection is quite decent, but the squid at the head is a bit
restaurant

Hands down my favorite restaurant in that area. Don't forget to go there when you're visiting their co-op.

Not too big a deal. Too bad it's not worth the money.  Their sandwiches are really bland, and the service is seriously out of this world. This place IS one of the best restaurants in Southern Illinois.
I tried Tempequil, was disappointed, and loved it.  I love the place with the food, and the service.   For me that's their beef tapas.  There are more if you like the ambience of the place than I like the food.  I will be back.
This restaurant is THE BEST!!I have been going here many times and the food is so darn good!    The sauces, yummmm yummmm...all the dits always deliver.   Other dishes are amazing, but very basic.  I recommend if you're a
restaurant...the atmosphere is too raunchy for the time, the beer list (some of the best all around beer you can get, if not a must try) may fall out of the top-notch. The pizza in particular, which I came away from, is one of the least impressive I have had! Try this place if you want the hangover-flavored pizza.
This is NOT one to rest on your laurels for.  It's just that the reviewers have forgotten to mention it by name. I would go back if I had to do it over again, as they might have managed to do with this place since I went back home, but for my purposes here I have 3 different reviews to review.  For the positives, I would not suggest this place over frozen pizza at all!  With the pizza, I usually go for the Great Bread/Biscuit 1. And if you are going for Calvados, just the raw dough
restaurant and bar.  We have been going to the bar for about 30 years.  The bartenders were very nice and had the tempos perfect.  The coffee table was a little pricey, but I still can't say enough good things about the area.
This is a must try for any Valentine's Day or anniversary event.  I'm very fond of the Lining Room and the free "Overalls" because it's so fun.  There are amazing woodcut slides, woodcuts and outdoor music sets in the wood ceilings, an outdoor bar area at the top and dining room on the left side.  If you want to sit right near the music and then be left alone, they make seating in a fronted area convenient.  With their upscale cooking and ambiance, the menu for the occasion is a fun addition.  They have a great patio too and it can be cozy.
Delicious Italian wine made from fresh fruit, a fried pig breast and
restaurant on weekends like we did when we saw them.  We also ordered the salad bar as well, and received most of my reservations free and alittle good! Everything from the pizza to the coffees were awesome.We are pretty picky about the food at The Pizza Bar in El Dorado.  We order the pizza- bacon chicken, rabbit sandwich with lobster and taco with guacamole.  And the pork belly!  I love it and can't wait to go back!
This was our second meal at Fits on Sunday night. We really had a great time with the staff, everyone just really had a great time.  The server is great and the food is delicious.  We ordered our tamales, filled with flavor and delicacy, and I'm not sure how much good that flavor really did.We also had a croissant.  We just ate it and then they made it whole so you have to order extra sauce as well.
restaurant: $12.50 
Never been disappointed by my steakhouse. I had great pizza and had to order one every 3-4 days.  We are highly encouraged to bring this restaurant back with us and we have been having quite a success.  I hope you are as excited as I am about this dining experience.
I wanted to rave about the energy, history, and funness of the restaurant at Two de Mayo.  However, we had to make reservations because the food wasn't good.  We ended up with a big group of six.  It took about 45 minutes for us to get back to the main course.  No experience from my standpoint, but we really enjoyed the meal.The lobster was the worst of the worst.  For the price, the lobster is filthy, the sauce (specifically my plate of Chicken Pho and Wild Mushroom Sauce) does not meet the standards of the food.  When the bartender did push my plates from
restaurant/style = cocktail, dessert, pizza. WOW! #squishyary!
I had one of these on the Monday, February 15th, and it was amazing. Had to give the review a little a crack after the appetizers were ready, but after I had them and ate them it looked great. First, it was a breakfast bar (let's call it fries before fries). Second, the interior is lovely, but next time I'll eat at a secluded place with a view out the window.  Once I go, I'm sure I'll go again for a side of the sandwich or something, but for now I think it's worth it.
Yes, I was surprised to hear it is running, but we had dinner there too. She made the time decision to try twice, so I spent about $20.20 for one entree instead of $8.50 for three. Of course, that has to be paid for when I go
restaurant, stand up bar, great service, free stuff
The food is amazing!  I am sure that its not a big number but its worth it if you have an appetizer on hand for dessert for extra specialty treats.  Be prepared to wait for someone and you can definitely tell you are ready to go!  Pesto glitched me!  Happy bday everyone!
We stopped in for a reservation with a friend yesterday.  This is just another memorable experience in Longmont.  We ended up joining two families that had just decided to split their 20 dollars to start a business.  I highly recommend this restaurant.
I recently stopped by (admit it), and ended up going in to the Greek Market.  I didn't think much of this place as I probably would have expected.  I got a complimentary ticket for an appetizer and we all got the money we paid for the appetizer.  I had the beef short ribs, and
restaurant is great. They have chicken noodle (I will go back) and onions, which I am a sucker for. The total menu is over 6 items. Too bad I spent about $20 on dinner for four pieces of food and then went back for the 2 slices I would have had if I had planned a different meal. You get the crackers and then their pumpkin oil. Your mouths are stuffed. My brother had about 5 of the $5 pieces of his budget. Hmmm. Ok, I said that in comments section. But over a month before I had eaten the three pieces, I had gone on a really sour weekend night and felt it right. At the time, the atmosphere was all uglier and everything seemed not to even come together like it did on a Friday night.  If there were things that changed I would have been totally on a hungover ship, but nothing (except for the tonic at my door!! :-)) changed my trip to
restaurant will work just fine.  Don't bother with the $25 spot!
I love this place! I can't wait to go again and I will be back :)
You will probably feel completely cheated if you come here twice but we're really into the classic diner.  The staff is friendly, and the menu looks incredible as well. If you aren't in Chicago, they usually bring you a visit in person to see if you're interested in their food.Their menu is so plentiful and it's usually very low priced. They have fantastic cocktails available to try in the kitchen, and the patio is so simple and refreshing.  Staff is friendly and the atmosphere is romantic and quaint. However, their wine list is very limited.If you're hungry, and want something just for the cheap -- try only one.  Try it, and enjoy yourself.
Bad-Dog Pizza is simply atrocious! YUM! How would you feel if your wife ate at a bad
restaurant for my entree was a chicken. For this sauce, they cooked it well with 3 meals, I thought the chicken was good. The pork belly was pretty salty, and it was not completely cooked down, like it was beaten. The buns were a little greasy on the inside, but they were very nicely seasoned. The waitress made the wait pretty easy and patient. I will definitely be coming back to the bar in the future!
Great BBQ Steak!  Did I mention the hamburger and fish salad are amazing?  A great choice as a smoothie for the classic BBQ, and best of all, they serve great beef and eggs!  Service is always great and I would definitely come back again.  We would recommend eating there!
First time I ever tried this restaurant I was so happy when I first saw it online. This is my new favorite steakhouse in Chicago. I've been coming here since 2010. My boyfriend and I were blown away
restaurant/food). I like the taste of burgers. I didn't eat here that day and was a bit overwhelmed (I do eat at The Cracker Factory often and will be coming back). Sorry (sorry) but no serve.
I had the breakfast burrito and the cake with mushrooms was alright.  I thought the sunfire the other day was an odd experience because I just had to wade into it...  I guess it must be such a ridiculous thing but its okay, though i think its cool seeing that people don't want to even walk in the door on a Saturday...  bring the lunch or something...  My girlfriend and i also got the burrito yesterday!The meat was fine and although the food was good it was hard to find ingredients.  I didn't have much of anything, and also got watermelon slices and chicken nuggets.
I decided to try it and I was OK. Everything was very good but it lacked several flavors
restaurant no reason to have your  food eaten out of your mouth.   Not saying I like their food.  Only 2 stars because I enjoyed them.  Hasselbloom needs some serious hate. 
Good food, but not the best.  Had more than one order of egg rolls and it was also not a stick salad.  Other than that, nice home cooked duck a la carte and no positive review whatsoever.  Food delivered pretty quickly, but not by the times.
Reasonable beer selection... or only beers if you have an older sister or friend.
I LOVE this place.  My favourite beer is Czech (Fogo Broglie.) at 9/10, which is also a good thing.  Loved how their ice cream was so fresh and fast, and the back wall of the hall was nice and welcoming to sit down in.  The servers were great, and the food was tasty and prepared.  A great
restaurant(s) on top(s) in the restaurant is great).We paid about a dollar for the valet pass and they gave us coupons on the website to pay for something that went on our table. The restaurant closes early. If you don't have a reservation then no worries, you can just go with another group of people or take a short private ride.My personal experience with the ambiance is where the reservation go. We had dinner at 6 AM at the restaurant (6 for dinner and 2 for lunch). There is a note for when they close up the patio, that's for a band and it's a good place for that band. Everyone at the table was really friendly and attentive. We then had a quiet night, but seated in the same table and enjoying a good meal (of course, even if it's dinner). We had the Beer Brunch, and both the children's and adults were absolutely amazing. All the beers were delivered right to our door
restaurant: not that shabby, super clean.  Of all of the cute little sandwich's I had, the lamb appetizer was the best.  A great addition to any family meal - these are pretty fresh and non-stuffed.  I didn't bother mentioning the date and location of the diner.  I would like to see if this place has food that is as good as it gets in Minneapolis.
Great wait!  When I walked in I noticed that there was three of us to eat. My friend was in a great mood and we both agreed that we would be okay. When we got there we took to our valet and they were all super efficient. My friend was talking a lot about the food and salad bar with the manager. I walked right over. I could not understand it at all. They opened up their entire salad bar menu for us and explained how good the chips were! Great surprise!  I won't be back!
OMG
restaurant: Rick Zinn
Rick Zinn is one of the rare remaining Chicago super rovers.  His favorites are their Cuban cheese and their Avocado noodle dish.  I think their Omelette pizza, Italian Topo, and Big Mac marinade are some of my favorites, since there are a lot of great Mexican or Mexican-inspired pizza places.  My favorite is the Chuck Klosterman and Chicken Pot Salmon.  So pretty.   They have large portions and work well when it comes to specialty items.  Some place I like is their Steak Tenders (matcha crepe or chicken and salad) or their Swag Hour appetizers, which I think is a must try.  For the price, they have a great steak, a great salad, and plenty of seafood to choose from.
After my review of House Luv Exotic, I started noticing a change in San Francisco -- not that I would have considered my group to
restaurant and dish.
Don't get me wrong; it isn't special. What sets this restaurant apart is the service. Although so many others have made such a great restaurant, I just love the atmosphere. It's still crowded during business hours and you can eat the dishes you want. Food will be sent right back to the kitchen, and the amazing waiter will take care of it. That's it. We do enjoy the ritz or the steak dinner. Go there often, but get in early if you like spicy food. Oh yeah.
I am often disappointed with certain sports chefs, but there's no reason for that.   I think my point is that their burgers and shakes are horrible.    That said, with me the Hogsdon was a hit.   I'm not going to waste much time in their land unless they give me another review to add to my list of failed chefs.   The last time I saw some Hogsdon
restaurant tastes to life. Keep a watch out for those on vacation, toadies and vegans out there.
There's not a place in town you'll find overpriced. If you like $11 you should try this place. All in all, the staff is very friendly and helpful.
Food was great. I had the Portarrale but it was a great meal to try. Service was second to none, which is disappointing. Will try again, but I would be coming back.
Good food, great atmosphere. The only complaints are if it takes more than 2 hours for the pizza to come out. This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago.
I know that it's a first for me and I am not much of a pizza fan...but you have to wonder how bad their pizzas are. The quality of the food is quite average, but it looks like it has a decent selection of good Italian pizzas out there! The owner is always impressed and
restaurant, bottle, chicago beer & wine, and not an 18-year-old.My recommended stop for me was the jazz bar, or somewhere to go. I'm a Jazz boy and some Wrigley's  pubs are the least expensive you can get (not to mention the closest after-hours glitzy bar.  At this rate, I would have to change to newer ones.)Best food in town for a sassy hole in the wall reviewer.For me there was the Chicken and Chips combo with Deep Fried Rice (same yummy experience as the hummus!) and Italian Pizza with Goat Milk (Again eating the same level of ceviche)The other three were food delivery and the quality was consistently exceptional. Not only does it have the best wine selection in Illinois, it is also the wine heaven I am constantly looking for.Good sushi gets a 2.5 out of 5.  I don't even think there are those who don't want to
restaurant. So was I, and has been since we were too young. First 1, they had hot dogs and if they did not open up, they couldn't open a factory new location they might not be as big in the area.  After we checked out, our hostess arrived and ushered us in. She brought out a sauce that they liked and set it aside for our table.  I ordered my soup and it was also good.  We also found out that they had had a new beer selection.  It's good.  A bottle of Bud Light isn't a great deal either, but it is different.  We will be going back to try.
My husband and I went to Geja and no service.
Food was decent, drinks were decent, vibe of niches and I wouldn't go back. Service was slow, almost rushed with all the food crap there. Food was good. Atmosphere was good, reasonable prices on anything in the place
restaurant at the Samutta Bread & Bakes. I've ordered the pizza from Fred. Our server was awesome. Overall I'm impressed.
This is a great place for a romantic night. As simple as you expect it to be, this place has more flair. I've known Margherita since I was a kid and don't feel like I have an obligation to describe it exactly.  I've always been intrigued by what Margherita has to offer when I ask.  The ambiance at Margherita is very relaxed, you can usually find a chef sitting at the bar with his hands on a cup of hot coffee.  The ambiance is also better than one would expect from Samutta Bread & Bakes, which makes sense considering the overwhelming amount of room at the bar.  I would definitely go back in the future, and I'll be back.
I love it!! I love you too! I don't want to go back (nothing
restaurant...including the giant lamb frites, which are topped with a dumplings-and bevy of regional sandwiches. As the server, I live in Northwest Chicago and got my orders before we even had a chance to order anything. I was really trying to enjoy my takeout, but I actually had too much garlic toast. I wouldn't do it again. I really like the more gingerbread but I will wait for the same. And, the one big change is that you can't talk to my aunt about it anymore...with clams and their beer being sold in booths across the city...so stop playing sports!
Went here on a Saturday evening for brunch, one of the Best pancakes in the city.  I won't go into it too much...if you really want a double good, then that's okay.  By far, best pancakes I have ever had.  We ordered two special sauces: Maple Butter Cane Stick Red, and Hot Sauce
restaurant later in the day. But I do wonder if some of the more "island-friendly" dogs are holding back because of my obvious appreciation for the wonderful environment in which they lived. For those that want an inside look, I suggest the Blue on Dickey Rock.
I grew up in the area and I remember moving to New York from Michigan and moving in here the morning for my birthday. I think there is something so sweet about the crackling and love at your neighborhood outdoor dining area. There are always new dogs (if you happen to be one). We have a lot of different options every single night. These include inexpensive rib eye, small island sandwich, and tartar parmesan sandwich. With all the great deals that the restaurant offers, it is very hard to go wrong with the Halibut service. Service is very professional and fair.
They have a taco selection in the outdoor patio area. I did see this place mentioned as an area to try
restaurant and given that he has tried all the Grub Chopas, Fried Chicken, Angus Chicken, Texas Roll in 15 years, it makes me wonder how much of an influence will soon be taken away from him by food fans.
This one is great. Service is fast, the food is delicious and the price point is great. Probably my favorite meal on the menu. Service is often left to the interpretation of the waitress that's a bit too jaded. All of the entrees are delicious and all of them are very well priced. It was great getting together with my sister who is from the country and loves Dr. Pepper, and let me tell you she doesn't even even look at the menu or the prices.  On her birthday party she came with me to the park and found out it was the May Day party! My sister also went with us on her birthday to and eat with me and went to great lengths to try out everything that we ordered and the food.
restaurant on 12/17 was outstanding! We also got the banana pumpkin pie which was great! Food was impressive. We ordered an appetizer and it was absolutely delicious! I ordered the eggplant plate and i thought it was delicious. We both loved the three courses, the salt to potato plate, and the risotto-coupled lunch salad. The desserts had a nice cream sauce and the pesto was perfect!The music was outstanding as well.  I did have one bad piece of food but that was after the calamari and cheese pizza was so delicious.The food was a bit pricey, but the salad bar was spot on with a good selection! I only gave 5 stars because I am not a fan of seafood and chicken wings.
Hepatrice......hot sauce is of course the best. I give the same rating to the sausage. I think it's a delicacy and one should give it at least 1 star. My advice? Don't make chicken
restaurant and waiting room when they finally found the old castle.  They definitely had that style.  The waitstaff was very friendly and very accommodating.  The prices were ridiculous, but I would order a list of what I wanted, and then reorder them when I was ready.  If I was serving as part of a group, this wasn't even possible.
I am one of the people who has never had to wait until lunch and how late is it for which side of the menu you are being served. The portions are good too. The restaurant is more of a joint, but there is no counter on the dinner tables. The steak mahi fish is also outstanding, however you will probably want to get up here in a hurry to eat your dinner there.  I also have reservations which are both big and huge. Check back regularly if you are not happy.
The bread!  It's YUMMY bread!!!  I've had Hot Dog first time,
restaurant (two tables up) and I ate three of them.  We were fine with a friend's experience but decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and given ourselves a chance and asked that if we could come over and take a table and get more space for appetizers.  The waitress was delightful and there was never an issue!  She told us we would be much better off in a three or four or even five size restaurant.  We waited five and a half hours and all of a sudden the waitresses told us our reservation was canceled, there was no one in the restaurant, we had all of our dessert and couldn't come back.  I think the food was the same as before (I can't remember the exact price, but it was $3.95.  All my favorite courses were the Sprouts and Sweet Potato Soup.)  They even left my personal table here, without even having requested a table.  Then we asked for more drinks to

7.00pm: Gourmet party with specialized bistro, Thai appetizers and yummy veggie scallops for a $10 with unlimited water (and unlimited chips; & the kid!),
8pm: Bar with frozen margaritas, drinks, and desserts;
9.30pm: Music by The Neptunes playing on the walls;
9.30pm: Pizza, ice cream and sodas for $1 each;
9.35pm: Souvlaki at 5 p.m. The ever changing menu is awesome; food options are endless and flavorful. Super tasty ($7) and super affordable ($6).
Every Saturday you try Sand Line at Chris Porchin. We want to thank Chris for his years of service, especially his amazing food selection and for the fabulous atmosphere. Enjoy!
Terrible soup of pizza (and other food). Oh, and no stew of chicken. Soup needed to be 100% rehe
restaurant #13 that's full of cheese, joe cheese, burgers, margherita and wraps.  If you're ever considering going here, be sure to check out the salad bar/chicken booths/spices bar and food area...
Nice place to hang out and try some work-out food like Whiskers in the spring..
I got the week of the Spring and the hype was certainly at a premium. When the sun came up and the temperature was cool but not heavy and there was not much the food tasted like what you get from the Steak House and the Cafe Huevos Grill. We received a pretty sweet cappuccino and a little French fries which were great. Also, the owner offered up dessert for $12 and was very honest and honest in explaining that he found himself stealing $10 off his customers in Chicago when he took them to the cafe at home. I was most disappointed though because the waiter insisted that he would take care
restaurant, everyone I have ever asked at my table; people are giving me thumbs down!
The food and service.  I recently went on a date with the staff, but we were reluctant.  There were several situations of great help that didn't pan out. One was the attentive staff and the customer service was outstanding, but I had to stop by one time so I could bring my family back to visit me.  The alcohol selection and quality was outstanding, the wine selection was outstanding, and the complimentary drinks were amazing.I gave a 2.5 and will be ordering from both of the wings again. I just wish I had the better gift request, but since this place is listed as restaurants that accept credit cards I am a bit off.
I felt a bit rushed, so I ordered the tbeuseonti salad and sandwich (also the sandwich was frozen, but the salad was just the same).  It was good and everything was tasty.  We stayed
restaurant. Sausage and fries served with homemade accompaniments. I found all 3 of our tasting menus on that list even more taste like someone was trying to come up with something extra special.  The lights were blue and the soda fountain was in ruins.  Not good enough.
I like it here because there's really nothing out there to go on in, really. So I just decided to order the triathlete slices and their salsa, and it really did turn out great. As others have said, I love taquerias and mango de guacamole, but I really wanted to give this spot a 3.5 because the food was outstanding. I must say the staff was knowledgeable and well-mannered. I went with the youngest child in a small group, so they are my base and family...which is what this is.  Love La Belle de Sauvage, and the staff was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable.  I think that includes the restaurant

What better way to provide another little calamari than with a name. I came here for brunch in May. The appetizer is a little more spicy than I could possibly imagine, but they have more flavor than I can manage. This comes out of nowhere too:  Their eggs, BBQ chicken, potatoes, and their goat cheese rolls are all very good. It was definitely worth the price of entry and the food was exquisite. I came with a table of 5 people, they brought some a kitchen towel and a couple scissors and a large 4x4 of free ice cubes. You could tell the staff were very attentive.  It was a one on one, extremely intimate dinner with so many choices that even the one with the smallest bandit at home would not notice it.  It was a little pricey to come here, but you can't beat the price. Overall, going with friends was wonderful.
It's a nice restaurant with a cool decor. The prices
restaurant selection is exceptional!  The fruit and vegetable cake is perfect for a night out.  I love the raspberry and raspberry flavored chocolate cake too!  If you love yummy yummy chocolate it is a must try!
First stop on my bucket list with their brunch special! Great atmosphere (same specials, same breakfast staples). Lots of food options and a fantastic selection of beers. First impression: their weather is nice. We had breakfast and the only thing that stood out was the chocolate chip cookie dough. I wish I could have eaten this right away, but it was so cold that we had to cry for it to warm up again. BUT, our boyfriend and I loved it. We also started with chicken in the pot (they have delicious beers). If you can find a bar, you can. I am super stoked for the brunch experience because we went over to there earlier today to celebrate. It was so overwhelming. My date asked how my baby and I went through the
restaurant course, Sunday afternoons, sometimes during lunch, sometimes dinner.  We've never had any complaints about this place.
Mmm, don't you have to be a diehard surferkinley types in the USA and every few weeks go deep in the desert to watch someplace else do it.  It's a shame it's not at the best in New Orleans.
Being a Mexican waiter, I was greeted by a head waiter (throwing around "what the hell is I doing?" in the mouth) as well as a nice guy waiting at the counter. He reminded me that if the tomatoes are ok, don't let a medium sized, ignorant person scare them off!  He was done giving us a free visit to Torta! (chicago, not Chicago...) and left a delicious, refreshing impression of the restaurant.  We later reviewed our specials at the bar and decided on this chicken dish.  Will continue to go back.
I
restaurant, but still very good food. Prices are great. Thanks Pork!
I was living on my own a few blocks away from the factory.  I had recently taken advantage of the close proximity of the Factory and the Pianos as a safe night out for my girlfriend and I.  She had visited her sister last year and had been very excited about what she had been doing here.  We had been trying to bring down a bit of noise in our apartment so we decided to try something different and try to make a change, if that's possible.  The best part of the experience was that we didn't have to spend several hours staring at the orange sun staring us in the eye.  I think they do a good job of having a menu that is genuinely unique in its own right.  We had no idea what we were getting before we opened our deal.  It was one of those perfect, traditional lines that is like high water mark on the food I
restaurant at del Mar in Barcelona! The thin crust, the velvet torta and the savory yolks on the slice of savory with the juices of the spiced torta have to be my favorite dishes. I'm not sure I've ever experienced a dish like this before. Get a reservation at the getaway carillon or the fancy seafood restaurant! It's best to go when you're on a budget but if you want to come on a budget this is an excellent place!
It was great when I came in for my dinner there on Tuesday night for a bottle of just my favorite wine. Had a 2 min wait. Second time on the plan, was very rude. But it was very reasonable. From what we saw there is no such restaurant anywhere in Chicago.
I had the Chowder which was medium priced.  It was medium priced.  It was the nicest meal I've had.  I would say if you are looking for a classy gem
restaurant
Very nice cozy bar.  5 stars.
The best sandwich on the planet  both without the torta and it leaves a long impression.  I recommend a bottle of soda, as well as some fresh fruit juice.  Make sure to pay a visit before stopping by for a diner parking space.  Go here for the traditional entrees and the Cuban fry. Also if you have time, I would recommend going to the stage if you can help yourself by taking the BBQ out the back door.
Worst sandwich ever, bar gets busy and has crappy service
I have always been a fan of Carnivale Pizza and am a resident of Chicago, so it didn't make sense to write about this place. My girlfriend and I went for a night out with friends and everyone at Carnivale was extremely polite.We went there before 11pm on a Friday and it was packed. They said they were clean and we were not clean. I would say they brought
restaurant for 25$ every 10 months. Uniquely, it will work out of the box!  A friend recommended this place for dessert. Very nice customer service.  The pastry presentation is much better and we love the fact that this location is known for the cake and the specials that the employee gets for his dessert.  It can be pricey to find food, but it can be a must for this year's foodie trip.
This was the most delicious Mexican food I've ever had!  What could I say?  After waiting there 6 hours, they have a coffee table.  I had the homemade horchata, the chocolate guacamole and the pecan crepe.   I'm eating my next group of people, too.I must say though, that there are really good tacos in this city, well put together. I've never been back, but I think we will!
Fettuccine Party has a great food, service and
restaurant shop.  This isn't Yelp anymore. It's listed as yet on the list of places to eat on Chicago's most visited reservation.  Tighter prices and more to look forward to. Don't go without a nice bottle of wine.  Then get a try.
The portions are fairly small (there is only 1 room) and the food was incredibly good.Service and food were just ok, since our server insisted we go to one of his diner's as soon as we tried the staff recommendations and offered to take our order. The only downside is it costs $3.50 for dessert while a six pack of ice cream on its own costs about $7.50. The food was a little bland but I liked it more.
My boyfriend and I were visiting Chicago and he chose me to go to a fantastic restaurant and experience everything he has ever been through.  He has yet to experience a restaurant in the neighborhood in the last 3 years.  It's
restaurant,  they opened their doors for you...  like scoops of oil and the chicken pot rolls.  They let you carry it in and are very polite.  Don't like the food and do not eat that way.  My only complaint is that the chicken pot rolls are also very cold.
OMG place to go.  My friends and I love them and we will NEVER go back again. Not sure if they are still in business but everyone tells you not to go there anymore. I haven't come here with a big crowd so I would probably leave at the end of the day. But they have the best people and price is right. I would definitely recommend Yum!
I am with a large group of Cuban food and experience that restaurant like nobody else has ever. Service is quick and we love our meal. I just decided to make a few friends for brunch and a date night in May. I brought 5 food items--10 different duck and nine
restaurant. Our total estimate for a delicious brunch was $5.50 per person and a couple more for free.  In addition to that the decor is amazing, with its lovely decor including dark brown chairs and platters of sandwiches.  I am still amazed at the amount of patrons we get and I highly recommend this place for a mid meal. I like the fact that they have an outdoor patio and also open rooftop dining. There are always a couple tables to choose from and also that there is seating during the lunch hour.  You can also order from the tables and have an intimate conversation during the brunch with our server.  The BEST servers in Chicago!
Great cold weather, good pizza, no wait, but hot dogs! Fresh!
Fantastic beers. I am a big fan of the exotic Belgian lager but am a huge fan of all the different selections of lager here.
I've always been looking for something to go with my back up meal.
restaurant,  cleanliness, and my party of twenty came for brunch just to enjoy it.  We have a fondness for brioche sandwiches, if you want a little more artisan look. I will keep making sure we see them.  I hate to give out a 5 stars for being so cheap.I am not an entree killer either.  Not just because we do not like the dry bread;  I want the popcorn.  Pizza is VERY heavy duty and the water is so salty.  We prefer to have a more salty and better batter since we do not want the drier crust to become an impossibly warm soggy mess.  The bread is a joke.  The pieces in the croissant and the salsa don't compare in substance to the croissant.  I prefer the salty, melted salsa because it becomes delicious by itself. I just cannot wait to try the dry bread again.  The dough can be so sloppy and frumpy
restaurant with oil in the dish.
Butter Ceiling was great. I've never heard a word of poor quality dish from Alinea. The owner had yet to receive any counter business, so I guess that the wait staff is accustomed to this kind of treatment. Only problem, though, is that they charge me $40 more for the service. It does a fine job at each meal, but the chicken entree was cooked to perfection and the real beef flavor is inside-out.Overall, I would definitely go back there.
I had been to this place many times and it finally became me - and it was time.I had been to Nick's several times, most recently at Mr. Toco's, and it was absolutely delightful!  Simply stunning and delicious, the decor is mind blowing, the food is fabulous, and the service is quick and friendly.  And thanks, to all the customers.
I came here for the first time the first time on
restaurant. There is nothing about this place that is not unique in China, anywhere in the world, from what it used to be in Seoul. Highly recommend it to anyone looking to get a taste of the pan fried rice.
you get here for the fun way, a giant smile, a cantaloupe - usually of the neighborhood which, you know the staff and they all love it. then you come in for lunch, and try to eat some--and the food will go away (aside from the soft drinks!). You get to try all the specials - the last, but not least the best, and they have all the great prices - you take a tip on the hot dog that you order - they're worth it. I have also been there several times - if you're not going to pick your favorite from there (that's the main reason I came), just come and check out. almost every experience I have had, it was a family outing (over 12

- Car and food at least $30 onsite? Check it out.
This place has a great selection of beef dishes.  There are all kinds of things you could try, but the best really comes out as your food.  Most of the time you just order one of the pork and pork chops on the side, order the rest and then start playing with the rest.  The price is reasonable, but we also suggest returning your order after the meat is finished in half or half-drink, although we would never advise doing that.  You can even order the raw spinach/watermelon/whatever else and drink it at home.  On the other hand, if you are looking to date the fish, the duck, and lamb in between portions, you should go ahead and order the better offerings.
Favorite Chicago home bar, be sure to leave us some cold baked goods.
Few of the restaurants i've been to are Chicago style, so
restaurant, quick service, great ambiance and great food.
Service was very great for me. Great fried shrimp, grilled crabs, gatorade and mahi-ja wa were all great.
I hate this place, and the pork dish is disgusting and non-existent for pork back ribs. It's awful for our table, and the food is high quality even if your order is for a large portion. Nothing to write home about.
I've been going to Salty, this place has been going since I moved to the area in the early 80's (is the TV on) and I've been extremely impressed by their food and service (I have to agree with a few reviews, this is still my favorite restaurant). They have this Great Fresh Pork Burger with Pig Chop sauce, lobster mushrooms and soy sauce, mustard, and onions and cilantro. Definitely a loyal customer but with all due respect, everything I've tried at Salty goes seriously over the top.
restaurant (Donut, Popcorn and Peanut Butter) and Food and Wine selection has always been superior.  Our ambiance is elegant and bright, though we do wonder if there's a menu that covers the so-called "have to eat here" menu too.  The food is truly of utmost value and we are always thrilled to see amazing food and wines throughout the dining experience.
Awesome Grill and Grill. I know what you're thinking; they don't have horrible food, and it's impressive that everything is right in the restaurant's favor. It's not just the entire menu that appeals to everyone who's ever been there, they truly make sure that every menu item is appropriate and innovative.   I won't go back, but my friends and I always go to great food places and love their food.   Try it.
Food here is fantastic and very well priced.  This is probably the best BBQ in the city.  It's not cold
restaurant my friends from Soho.  I love the ribs, for sure.  The service was ok but my husband/ girlfriend loved it.  It was a bit pricey as well, but it was great.
My partner and I got here with two of our Chinese friends on Tuesday, June 5th and 8th of this year.  So we went for a coffee and coffee drink.  Our Champagne is a nice drink, the liquid tea is light, and the berry sauces are lovely.  We ordered our dates glasses and large & small & were pleasantly surprised.  The same lovely tea and coffee was being served at the bar bar as the other drink.  What's up lady, these dishes are fresh and tasty.  Our boyfriend ordered their Avocado, which was excellent.  The other addition was the pickles, also excellent.  Good berry soup made with prosciutto, or you could even choose one, but the bacon and garlic
restaurant. Polite, courteous service. The menu will definitely take you home again.  I'd definitely recommend it.
I love the shrimp! Great meal by far.  I have had five great meals here.  The service was exceptional!  My only complaint is that they have not posted the menu before they are closed.
We had lunch here today and was disappointed.  The food at the bar was not authentic.  I feel like if you want to run through a selection of different meats, I would use the kitchen.  I really like the opportunity to sample a great Belgian stew which was very nice.  Overall, it was a good experience but the food itself is overpriced.
Sooooo good.  But its not that I don't like eating here, I just feel we're really in the middle of a restaurant.  It's better on the weekends, there's some seating options, a la Budweiser.  What more do
restaurant & pesto ($15 each). The service was fun, interesting, flavorful, no matter where you are.The sisterhood seems to be able to have their own wine list and an extensive wine list.  The olive branch salad is the same, but the olives for example come with some interesting ingredients, which may be why my friend and I have come to this tasting room to dine.If you are hungry, you can order the wine list at least 1 person here if you don't mind the odd taste that may have been leaving when you go in for the meal.  It could come in a variety of flavors that just aren't there in the individual plates.  Maybe one of my favorites.
I don't mind a bad restaurant if I can afford to eat at it because I go regularly.I will come back for future occasions and see what quality of food I choose.  Never attempt this place just because you want a bad meal...give me half a
restaurant and ordered a salad with "Trinity of frozen pig". First thing I noticed is that at the last minute they removed the serving spot after speaking with Chipotle customer service as said the large outdoor sign (a huge problem for the taco restaurant) saying "There are no tables for people 18 and under". This is pretty obvious if you think about it. I was also seated to close a table immediately after I waited to order dinner at the table and ordered 3 colognese steak (1.4 oz....11 oz) and a pineapple. After waiting 3 minutes for table service I was sent to the dining room where three men (5 lbs each) were seated with great credentials and for my portion of the dish. All three, took my table away, refused my request for an acceptable portion and for coming to my table.  I paid for our meal.  All three men assured me that our dinner was not appetizer and that we would not eat it until we had
restaurant service to purchase food at King's. We enjoyed our 20 day stay but were impressed with how busy the food was! Did this restaurant share our dinner or something? Thanks for your visit we really appreciate your thoughts.
Battlestation is generally quite small. A couple, who eat like tourists, do not have to enter the house to try breakfast food. The other couple live in the middle of the street.  If you're looking for comfort, wait outside and check your phone every once in a while!
Nice place to take a drink and drink with friends! I wanted a good price too. However, nothing will get me going any time soon. No friends or family it. Sounds awesome... but I'm actually a girl who frequents HALLOWEEN and is this place for girls with no compunction to get dessert, food and other treats! A definite thumbs up for any girl who has eaten here but wants to eat undergrads soft-bo
restaurant, since they've written 'bartender cork', but is that really what that food comes from? I'm a sour person and think you might want to wash down some of their old 'cocktail' until your sanity returns. Like, what?? What?! Are you, shitshow hate them?!
If you have the inclination to eat here, it is still worth trying to find what you like. I enjoyed the chicken burrito, habanero with tomatoes, and meatballs. They are also pretty friendly to customers.If you don't have the patience to fill an empty stomach in at the train station, then it is a shame that you can't order anything at all from the Bakery.    Service is decent and friendly.  Their salad bar has really strong flavor, but that only gets you so far.  Service doesn't suck (I got the sour cabbage though).
In 1995, Sales got their wings.  Since then they
restaurant, Grub a bit expensive, but worth it for the real deal!
I LOVE THIS place.  It is amazing!  Their fresh seafood and fried chicken are very special, beautifully prepared and loved.  And of course I love their beers and the A'O beers.  They bring with them some great items and really provides a hostel atmosphere!  Then it becomes a little pricey to go to Faus du Diable too and will cost a few bucks.  My main complaint is the cocktails are a little pricey because of the salt and water.  The prices may be lower in Mexico than it would be in the US, but it's a good place to have that creative and unique variety of ingredients.
Sometimes I wish the internet was more like Whole Foods.  However, we tried the Chicken Chorizo Trio at the largest Indian restaurant in Colorado and The Staff at the same Mexican place in Chicago.  The food was amazing and the service was
restaurant. A delicious selection of  beer, wine, and snacks from this place provides an amazing date night atmosphere.
Very pleasantly read.They have coffee table. The staff is on fire. My favorite? Whiskey with a burnt maple leaf. Perfect dining destination!I loved it so much.
fano at 30 times less a place with better service. it took so long but i had the coffees in the chocolate cup with the almond milk flavor the first time. he both patted us down like a puppy. Would not recommend.
I love this restaurant!  The food is really good and fresh.  Your best option.  Relax & enjoy the ambiance, very good bartenders.
Every other time I went my boyfriend was always amazed at the food and amazing portions of food. We ordered 10 different types of dishes and each dish received 4 to 5 stars on this special occasion. The service was fantastic. The food was everything i was expecting but I also
restaurant. Their meats are the most greasy ever, weird on both sides. The chicken spicy dog dog ones are so much worse. Well, let me explain that once you go there you are going to know why. After coming in from a shopping tour they ordered something to fry, here, under the pay, for a gift. Everyone was so shocked. To explain the insanity a little more. "No, thanks for the gift, my wife and I have never had a thai birthday dinner or this fancy restaurant for lunch that didn't last a week. The service was in  unbelievable " slow -- walk out of the shop on Friday and order another menu while waiting for the return customer. Very funny service, but the minute they left we were in class  RUSHLY CHARGE.They ARE the ONLY KOMBER food company that has NOT been ripped off. AND if you have never had thai hang chitons with their pho, can I give it 4
restaurant - those were some of the best I've had.  It's not the best ambiance but it's worth having on tap.  Get there early and be prepared for some pretty exciting, funny wacko menu dishes.
We went for lunch on Monday but we made reservations early.  The waitress was lovely and answered many of our questions.  After we left the restaurant, we walked down the street. We ate two dishes at once.  I wanted to say thanks to my waiter for not paying so much as 10% more!  Thank you blacksmiths for taking care of the house and town!   I will be back for the regular fare menu and reservation info.  It was good to have something cheap as well.
Good price!! The food is good enough but the waiters didn't seem interested in the food or service.  The bar area is very loud which made it difficult for guests to hear any of the dishes.  They even
restaurant through the entire city.
Next to the bar is an outdoor patio, with walls of space and leaves across the street. We had a great time (as we always do).  You'll find us by parking on - it wasn't crowded at the time, but this place provided many portions.  There are alot of vegetarian options, and it had a bunch of different choices as well.  I think that the meat tasted like fresh mozzarella and the meat was dark with salty and spicy.  The only other option I could think of was for their pineapple croquette.  Definitely a side dish for the little people.  It would have been great with a little homemade calamari.
My great aunt did not have friends (but I can't believe we did, because I just took her from Chicago and had her take the food as ordered) She is a huge Chef at Alinea who is known as Quawr. She serves low-carb Italian pizza
restaurant Dessie, pho pizza. Great atmosphere. Got here as a family for our vacation.  Our favorite part was the cauliflower and wine pairing. Our server brought us a delicious grilled chicken with fresh spices.  Good time at Dessie. No reservations.
This place has a lot to offer because the food is always fantastic.  Excellent that any concert, event, or business needs!  A review will be coming soon, but this place is doing something right.
I went to Boston Hop Festival with family last year and have been going to Kountna with a group of about 15 who took turns in entering the adult section to the Kountna.
I don't hate my food, I hate my service, I love my food.  But my favorite thing is to order with your date in the evening? There's only so much Kountna can do!  The closest I've ever been to a stranger who's still enjoying our fabulous
restaurant and perhaps best Michelin star is Ordina, which is the restaurant I visited when I was a child. I was not sure what to expect but Ordina is a great sandwich.  It is large, decent service and attractive decor.  A small wait would be nice, but a welcome change.  I would definitely go back for that first time.
Reds toast! :)
Awful Food and great service. I've been to Bon Jovi a few times and thought this was the best place to try it. It is a little pricey and although a fantastic venue I'll definitely be going back.  Our waitress was quick to meet us. We ordered a doughnut appetizer that went with the salad, a grilled torta which was also fantastic. After raving about it, my boyfriend and I ordered the banana cream cheese confit. The savory one was my favorite part, I ordered a desert bean stew that looked like it was at a Sunda
restaurant/menu/ menus:** rice & potatoes, croquettes & margaritas, flank steak, caviar, crab and shrimp, etc. great dish selection after we ordered 8/15- *salad bar. my favorite part was the tastiest rib eye that i've ever tasted (the sandwich was amazing, oh god). fast, passionate service, cool decor and the love for variety of items. total ensemble.
Best ever (then trendy) light dive!
I've always wanted to go to Pust'n and Shop'n: one of their local Italian restaurants.  It takes all the size (of its patrons) to have a great experience here, but try it out and you'll love it!  This is one place I don't miss!
Great place to eat and drink Italian food.Great food!Steeped in all the flavors!
Hands down best Ethiopian Ethiopian restaurant!!!Yummy and loud!   
restaurant, most important serving is: comfort.The roasted cheese tends to get over cooked when placed in a wok, but the actual combination of steamed vegetables and herbs is quite impressive. This one's unique texture comes from the grape mash in their antipasto, so make sure to try it. Unrefined, homemade in Southern Italy that is perfectly cooked. It's always great to see!
Great food! But not worth taking out if you plan to try it again! We used to go to Lush with the aioli and mozzarella which made for a perfect meal.  The pizza had a good crust and lacked some thick crust.  However the rest of the experience was good. Maybe that's because we're super casual because we're more into something fresh or fresh then the entire pizza.We love the organic beef joint and the decor definitely draws attention.We went on a Friday evening and were seated about 30 minutes before the food server and she let
restaurant, one of the best we have found. Make sure you don't fill your mouth with stale, uncooked food after getting there; and choose the gravy first!
Went with family and also a guest who is our date and asked about their new remodel. Also looked for a waiter with an open mind and appeared to have a good attitude. Would love to see more recommendations from us and are it someone more experienced? Would be honored to be served. Absolutely must try.
Drinks' in Season: low
Melbourn's, Longbow, and Burritos: great! If you go with the other patrons, please drop by to refill and refill out of season.
We come to see it at the weekends, and in my experience most importantly to be able to continue to do so as long as I can. Being able to get the same service every time we are there was always something we could get away from. Food, prices and attitude was
restaurant and became lively with a small group of people that crowded around the bar at the back. Then it came around once I started talking with friends that had had already been at the bar. The food was very flavorful, hot and tender and well packed. As we went over the menu from one restaurant to another, we seemed to find a category other then "outdoor" restaurant quality. They tried to eat like they had been eating at that restaurant and all the names just stuck in my mind!  The meat was chewy and well seasoned, but good.  We stopped to check in a few times to try on a more "agey" look.  Great dinner, great atmosphere, excellent music.  I must say that although we thought it was something out of a traditional Mexican restaurant, it was better, cleaner, more modern.  Would recommend.
Great food, great atmosphere, nice service, great atmosphere!
Always feel like I am heading for a rockin
restaurant served my family: sweet potatoes  followed by churros, and no mention of dessert.  They waited so long and didn't serve food.  Who thought the flavor came from veggies or meat, but I actually ended up having really good tenderness.  Not good at all!  When they refill the water, just ask for the water
Tucked away somewhere in the middle of a cabins, you will find a pleasantly smooth, relaxing place to sit. (I think it's close to Pequod's, but it's off West 30th St.) Lovely bartending, and the food is good.  It seems like people really get the sense the experience is just a fun place to hang out, and if you go early, it will only be a short while.
Best pizza anywhere at night in this city.  The crust is ok but the presentation is superb.  I like the flavors of the crust, and the things that they call the
restaurant, world famous pizza, delicious, service! Yelp went over our thoughts of why the gem was expensive, and did a great job.  When we sat down we just got out the door to talk and enjoyed a real treat.  All in all, it's a great new experience for all those who are excited to visit Buffalo Bayou.
Great pizzas and sandwiches on almost every menu. Service was really good, but made it too lengthy for my personal tastes. We loved everything about it.
I've been to Second City five times now. They have provided me with excellent food, great service and a large appetite for their wide selection of entrees. While my meat-eaters consider Second City their favorite, I enjoy each time there is a dip of hotdog dipping sauce on the side.
This place really rocks.  The menu has great flavors and the staff has a great attitude.   You may be sitting here with a date at 11:30
restaurant was really wonderful.The best lunch option I have ever had!
We were going for our holiday dinner and we didnt mind the grilling.   They get the mussels for free and the lentils are delicious too!  We were also enjoying grilled meats that come off the bones so you'll have to share it with your family.
We had a Friday night special and everyone at the table got food that was no Beef. It was great everything was amazing - the pancakes, pancakes, guacamole!  The rest of the time, we had a certain amount of beer, wine and a sausage on special, no joking matter how much it was.  It was a great time - a friendly, relaxing atmosphere, as advertised.
Ok. The food is a little pricey, but I'm sure they would not go out of their way to give you a reservation if you can't beat it.  If you feel like being a fan of craft beer in
restaurant. I could see going over my own concept with our table. It's a tiny space, but I thought that they were making it even bigger and better. After a few glasses of wine (very regular wine) I got the mousse cap, which was creamy and moist. When I talked to them the back of the bottle came open and a tray of classic dishes were sitting on it. One came with chicken fat, one with cheese cream, and a third with olives. My go-to bowl of pasta, with mushrooms and a few sauteed spinach was sandwiched between the bread. My wife had the two quail legs to remind her that you need to hold your spinach in your hands, and I actually wanted to consider putting them on my greens salads and sauces. Here's the kicker: I forgot to take my salmon for my entrees and left my egg alone. My beer list was filled with suggestions to squeeze them in too. Unfortunately, the main seat
restaurant, funky mauchieu, delicate wine, and a pretty lovely cast of musicians are best known for his special occasion music selections. The concept is simple. It's a great place to listen to a great album or listen to some strong tome, chubby guitar chords, and bunch of fun songs at your leisure.
I know this place is not the best in Ohio, but this is a MUST have BYOB BEER in Chicago. The food is good and has some great options for some of the favorite beers. My favorite was the Macaroons, which I prefer more than any other, but some of the pastries will always make you think of the adventurous brew. Prices are reasonable for their cost, service, and ambiance.
Maybe they should get all the rest of the food and stop the complaining about that black belt cleaner, this is my favorite Black belt Stew in Chicago. I still think they make really good food with the snobbery and beer
restaurant.  Besides, this is my go-to place! It's my go to for being the best sushi in New York - if you've ever been there - you'll find it's worth your time!
It's a way of life. From the intimate, with a nice dessert, to the just awesome presentation, visiting this place is a dream come true. So is dining on the wood-fired grill, snorkeling around deep in the courtyard as a tribute to the bonafide summits, to the unique little story of the dining room...you get it. Its great and the kids enjoy it too.
The hostess will tell you about my favorite dishes. All the different dishes are very fantastic. Every single one of them is definitely good, and there's a great food selection, too. This place is always a great place for a romantic evening, especially during their lunch hours. I always order a takeout date, and this was one of
restaurant, lovely atmosphere and service at a perfect combination!
Service is friendly and attentive! Very romantic in the mood for parties and intimate.
My birthday dinner at Save the Night brought me such an unforgettable experience. I thought a neighborhood restaurant should have a glass of wine here, but was disappointed to see that the owner of the restaurant, Mary, is obsessed with chocolate! I love dessert, especially filling desserts, but this place was nothing but impulsive! I'll definitely be back, as well.
Service is excellent, and the local hostesses are pretty good.  I think it's good that things like seafood are used so much of the time.  If you're in Chicago and want to have a perfect brunch experience, go to Cheyenne.  Otherwise, a last minute reservation to Go Wild for a spectacular dinner and a small budget make it a little harder, if you go.
I don't like the big plate, but it's the perfect size to
restaurant/salad bar... very comfortable and classy dining, excellent appetizers, and service... not a very big menu, but I was happy with how much I ordered and the food came out in a positive order. But I didn't like that the food was too salty so I won't comment on this one.
This restaurant is a beautiful place! The ambiance is amazing, the service is great, the staff is amazing. All in all I enjoy the food. The sushi was fresh and beautiful, and the buttery, very flavorful fish mixed with buttercream cheese was great for a casual dinner. I tried the chicken risotto with chicken wings and was shocked at how yummy it was! The meat had a very nice spicy flavor which I find very satisfying in a sweet and spicy dish!
I went to any of the chefs I could for dinner here. We had to spend our time trying the amazing dishes from each of their restaurants as well as a small selection of
restaurant is a conversation starter for me, and The Chill is often the only place that allows me to bring a favor. This place is packed, and best of all, it's quick and one-of-a-kind!
This place is worth every penny of the cash.  This place is packed.  What a waste.  They even make sure they deliver the quills to your desk to order.  Good service is what counts.
I usually am not so excited about the food at dinos but I was surprised to find out about Burrito d'Soiree at around 2:30 last night. I am now enticed. A friend was very fond of it and showed her to the manager after reviewing his order. He brought in a box that looked like  a large piece of cake that had been baked on a pan. In the end, only one piece of cake was prepared that I chose to eat. I also ordered to order menu items,
restaurant?" I said. She had her margaritas too. Everything was great. There was not much to tell me, the waiter was nice.
A true American middle east side-eye! Quality, service and food aren't enough to meet all the time demands, but its a great casual environment. Thanks Chef Elylee and the staff for having us here.
Food was excellent; wine list was strong but average. I would make this my top 3 favorite restaurant in Hagerstown. Big shout out to Gus Iserman!
Love, love. My daughter loves this place. She moved there in mid-80's and loved everything about it. First time in a long time, she went and started ordering. Every time it came up it was ridiculous.  When she returned she just hadn't ordered anything at all.  The only reason she came back was that we had just a couple of burgers, right? Then one of the burgers was so bad she had to
restaurant of choice. All drinks are brought before (cheese coated at all times), food comes and goes on my table with my guests and they can just sit down and enjoy the food. They have such a unique twist that I never think of it. The desserts are also very tasty and refreshing. Their food is perfect for those looking for a truly midwestern bakery style dessert but would love to have the specialty bread and gnocchi variety...They serve a medium sized menu that includes lots of options but feel that some can be more entrees if so desired, although I am also excited to hear from different ethnicities!
This is the best dessert on the planet!  Fantastic service and ambiance, casual atmosphere, great crust and apples that have been on my menu for over 30 years.  A friendly place for a dessert dinner.  This entrees always end up being a hit and miss and a must-visit if you're looking for a Belgian dessert.  Great
restaurant menu like this, but because we do not usually go to several different restaurants, and because of that, we don't often order anything off the menu or receive suggestions from other customers.   Our suggestion will always be our preference for an upscale Mexican restaurant, so we've decided to give it a try and hang out at the patio area.  I was overwhelmed and would definitely recommend this restaurant if you are a big fan of the normal approach in Mexican places. I'd say stay away from this place... I think it's better than much more upscale Mexican food!
Best brunch in Chicago. The wait staff were friendly and delicious, our waiter was equally as awesome as everyone else was. The place is small but inviting and the environment is funky and lively. Its a great place to hang out while you wait in line. The grilled chicken at, relaxers and waitresses is different than any other in Chicago. Chicken steak/rice at, breakfast stands out on me. The
restaurant, gentlemanly, funny and light.  That's why I choose the Miami spot.  I love the food and the service. I always order appetizers which are more delicious than my favorite appetizers, but I don't have much choice when it comes to these.  Here are some of the amazing items I have. We started out with a hit of shrimp to settle our score: -A small albacore or lobster sandwich. They have very good choices for sandwiches such as chiles or salmon rolls. The cover of the roll adds flavor to the sandwich so I just ate one. I loved the experience of a large deep dish salad at the end of the meal. The salad was from a recipe called "If Someone Is Really Being Loved." A small platter of ricotta cheese, black olives, sweet potato cake, and egg rolls followed up with what looked like a bowl of soup with crusts. A spoonful of the gravy followed, and
restaurant and soup dish. We'll tell you where it's made. Out of the oven!!!! Will try to wait 15 minutes. Will only come back if ordered in advance (just in case it's from out of town). But if my husband and I want to go back...just in case...I'll wait. They have a lovely Thai food menu. We tried their Shrimp, Thai Yogurt, Risotto, etc. and they served great. We love sharing their chicken, pork, beef, shrimp and cheese. So that's it. Dessert? Just some teacups!
I was disappointed with one of my dining companions for breakfast, even though she was not very knowledgeable, very knowledgeable, knowledgeable, and attentive (not like a gentleman on a cold evening!) by all accounts. We asked her to explain why she ordered salads and cookies, and she seems to be getting the same answers that people were getting back. Food was my first problem, although the
restaurant is a good choice, but the patio is confusing and the food is so fresh. As for the drinks, they're mediocre. Would this be worth a trip?
No, it's definitely NOT.  I love this place. The food is always good, but really a smoke or candle tasting or beer, you get a high quality beer and that's a special experience. The bar is great. I wish it wasn't so crowded.  But the store is busy.  It's an offbeat place and worth a visit.
Best weekday brunch ever. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is simple, inviting. The burritos, italian dishes and the spring rolls make everything a pleasant experience.  Service is attentive and the service is prompt. Their lines are full for the hour and up to 7pm the tables are often overcrowded as they are only open till 3:30pm. (look at their wait list! You are missing out on a fabulous
restaurant. So good but can't make it into the training camp lineup yet. As for RINFELIE-the shrooms we have can't meet his needs as a trained black person, so I had to give them another shot. I don't like looking at certain people in leather while you are waiting in line, but even I don't like having to give a ratty wait.
When you ask to go over to go to the atrium, the service and the food are outstanding. We had a great time with our friend.  She shared her experience and I recommend the BBQ place to others.
OK, back to ordinary food with good service. We went in for a date with a couple of friends, friends that enjoy the service, the food was good, you have to try it again and again and I can't remember the last time I've been a meal that we ordered or the food was delicious. I'm not sure how easy this is
restaurant, but not my best. Otherwise we tried the main course.  The soup was really good, but not as good as the lunch option we had.We had the duck and my husband had the beef, which was good.  The specials here were great, but I should have asked for the seafood and butterdink specials instead of the meat. I just didn't understand their management.  I guess it's a little too weird, but I was sad to leave a spot on the table.My only complaint is that the thin pieces of french toast often turn black.  It's the perfect balance of humor and overall experience.I can only wait to get back to this place again!
My boyfriend & I got the lamb here and we liked the smell of the meat.  We chose the fish since it was actually cooked in rice or even higher quality seafood.  We also took a drink of white wine, honey, cookies, even free juice.  The only
restaurant is too short for our liking, we decided to take the 4 star rating from the service desk and decided to return the favor.The meal included lemon curd fries and a perfectly white lit soy sauce with lime zest. OMGOL!The entire thing was insane!  Aww.. and the waitress and the staff was a bit snippy but the person we had wanted the next chance to smile at was amazing. The portions are huge! We ordered rice and scrambled eggs. Was my first experience this Yelp with Vietnamese food. I didn't even bring my daughter because she's from Michigan and it was really late, so this must have been an awkward experience.. SO I dined with the girl and she loved it! Great meal, but not great  and a bit hard on the palate to understand. When you are going to be making dinner, remember that you go to a good restaurant with care.
I am still waiting for my date to come over! As nice as
restaurant, despite having never tasted anything so thoroughly and deliciously as the delicious chocolate chips...this was definitely nothing special.I might try a slightly less bitter asparagus instead. I would call it a BOBOB!
First of all, I think they should have updated their policy, which reads that pancakes are - err, pancakes. Very salty and a good reason to eat sugar and fries. Second of all, the game was very rude and cliche and it seemed like nobody saw it. I really don't know how rude and cliche it is, but the staff somehow forgot about our appetizer -- which was served on a whipped cream sundae wrapped in pine nuts. Granted, I enjoy these kinds of desserts - if a couple of their regulars could really handle pancakes, and I'm one of them, they would totally eat their dessert at home. This is in the group of "biggest failure" moments I have ever had in my life!Also, because I
restaurant, It was packed at the time with just enough people to hold the dinning.  It was both unexpected and welcome.  A little pricey for what you order but they're really serving you excellent and affordable food.  We had the T. rex and I had the pho and it was fabulous.  I'd say the Asian menu is as unique as the steak.  I think they have opened with so many options on the menu and this is just in the old west-restaurants days.  There was a pool table downstairs.  I think it's a bit on the short side but I think they're putting the spin on it.  Finally, there was the Zorkian Chicken which is great but I personally had the sampler - a small plates of meat and vegetable dishes including shank lee, fried chicken wings, and pork leg with shrimp.  Sadly, its so busy that I can't finish it.  Great quality meat?
restaurant/food service is good, but was a bit at fault for not accommodating all sorts of patrons.  We must call that out, however.  Love it here!  Service is great, etc.
Had an event here a few weeks ago, including seating in the upstairs lounge.  Great food, good atmosphere, great music and great drinks!  I can't remember what it was called earlier in the night, but I definitely should have the honor of ordering this pizza.  It was not hard, but overall a fairly disappointing experience.  Not even close.
This is the burger joint I was going for with friends. The owner talked me out of it when I was asked to place something but his information was incorrect.  I was forced to put it back.  If you're in the city of Chicago (even though you'd get a chance to live in it if you live there), this is still your date's place. The atmosphere is not meant to
restaurant hot, a hangout, dining and comfort food. Since his dog was sitting in his lap before her dinner and had just been out of town, we were shocked. It was the ultimate dish, hand-delivered, crispy sandwich. We didn't get the usual side of prepared meats, such as beef tenderloin with sauerkraut, or gyros, pork belly, or guava sausage, but we got a completely fresh kind of torta with two of the best burgers I have ever tasted. Every time I bring home a plate of this experience, they all come up with different things, well done. Not to mention, the portions are huge, such that you can eat several more. For all of our cocktails, we would pay only half that for a fresh one at first (I've only been to Limehouse twice and the pairings aren't so bad). We were completely blown away, but still hungry for a couple more bites and oatmeal
restaurant

Apart from the best bars, first to behold is the Diao Ting, its presentation. After the first 20 min the service is often slow and disappointing.  Generally the food is very good and prepared in advance.  However I have yet to experience this.  The menu is as follows (wishlist (off-seasoned: 4.50/cheesesteaks, salad entree (from 5-6:00): fried chicken, salad, mashed potatoes, fries, gravy, grape sorbet, and special).  The service is generally quick, but within the first 20 minutes you should be able to get a snack at least once a day.  I had just the last entree.  As of noon the staff were not there to help but take out of the restaurant a variety of orders.  The platter menu and menu items must have been taken out within 30 minutes from arrival.  A sandwich (deluxe with a dollop
restaurant: Milacini's fried rice, fresh diced tomatoes, scallops and ono quesadillas. This restaurant has a good selection of meats and drinks and is one of the first in the country to serve authentic Ethiopian food. The food is great and I like to order the salad to order (and have it sliced and served at my party, too). We also have table service, which is very nice because it allows us to always see their prices.
2 years ago I went to Sushi Bar in Wicker Park with an old friend.  Great food and delicious.  We went there by ourselves and we had too much sushi and the bartender lied and came away saying they were all $9 per person.   My only complaint was my wife asked for 40 rolls...it was really the only roll I could have ordered.  I told her what I needed and she left a HUGE smile on her face.
Awesome spot for anything from very cheap,
restaurant. (Not sure why the Fried Chicken sandwiches in the restaurant are the same since they're in the same space.)
Dining in the Natural Foods was always romantic and delightful. I had the 2nd floor terrace and shared in with the pool table. But the owners found it to be confusing because it seemed that half of the 4 visitors to my room were on the 2nd floor, so the table itself was pretty comfortable with the ceilings up and even the windows open when they would like to hang out with the family as they drive by the river. A total of 8 people waited at my door, no mojitos or anything. Just mediocre service.
The PB&J was just as good as the beef, which was cooked flawlessly, and the pork belly was among the best in town. The shrimp was succulent and the seafood was spectacular. Service is outstanding and the food was tender and clean. You can't get enough of the perfect experiences and the food
restaurant and the seating area.  However, not everyone can stomach the numerous, rather awkward sit-ins and will not come back for dessert.  Having eaten there several times (mostly the sushi sandwich rolls) I have yet to enjoy it in its entirety, but the decor is what it seems.  Nothing special.  Look at the menus, you will find that much more meaty goodness - fried on pieces of sesame oil - than good meat (especially those try these pastries from Olive), cheeseburgers, you will be blown away.  If you are coming from a vegetarian group, this is the place to go for steak, but be careful if you come here to desert meat dishes - it will not be so enjoyable.We did try the wings, the sauces were the breading goodness of consistency, and it has always been great to catch the subtle dish in life.  They are all solid and quality, and it takes just the right amount of patience to
restaurant. We also had the Peruvian pizza, which was tasty. It was wild at first and was a little expensive.  We also ordered a pizza which was very pricey and didn't really have to.  We were kind of disappointed as their menu is filled with some of the best restaurants in Chicago. I think its fair to say that their chicken will carry over to Chicago the rest of the way!  At $30 per person for a house served, the Peruvian pizza at average is $30 for 12oz. They serve 6 person restaurants so you will get their killer pizza.  I don't know how the loli food works so how could I have asked for it better.  I will definitely be going back to go check it out once again!
This place has tons of good food and is well worth trying.  The establishment really deserves the way it is.  Everything on their menu is absolutely fantastic. My favorite part of this place is the unicy
restaurant in Skokie - Churro of the Pot Roast served by the DJ Shonquerys! Never have I tried the same thing twice but I am sure this place will one day be next... will continue to please!
As I was only a week away from visiting the nice Italian restaurants in Cari, I was a bit hesitant.  There are some outstanding places in this city, but they never disappoint! I love big tortas. When I visited Nicomile I took one group to Giordano's on Grand Avenue that only served the broth.  While my waitress took some room to give me water while my waitress took her time trying to watch over my food when she came back over. That was a true shame.  On the plus side, I had the latin sauce so on the cheap!  Try the spicy oil sauce which also came in the tin for about $12!  Also this place has great menu design.
It took
restaurant waiters, customers were sipping on hot dog, while they were sorting through her.    These waitresses don't care how long it's been since they've been seated - but never did she ask if they're busy.   At the start of the journey, we had 2 small entrees - a green tomato and green peppers - and the skirt steak was okay because it's bland at best.  We added another entree which didn't take as long as we thought.  Afterward, the waitress mentioned to us that we can't keep the women sitting, so we decided to place our order by reservation - but left without saying an extra, which I explained was just our last reservation and our wait lasted so long.  She told us to go ahead and list all the other "special" menu items we've ordered and they'd give us reservations.   We politely went ahead and ordered another meal - that's when she said if we wanted more
restaurant. We found ourselves eating here while we waited for people to arrive.We had a large menu. The seasoned shrimp was very good. I highly recommend this place, we loved it so much that we made the choice to stay. There are a lot of sushi places around Chicago, so bring a few in your order to experience it for yourself. Besides the crab rolls, their Salad is the best salad I have ever had.Their dinner menu includes shrimp. The shrimp is homemade and they like not to over cook it. It was delicious. Even though it is totally canned, it was very juicy, so I would definitely be back.
I don't recommend this place for the food (and wine selection).  The atmosphere, presentation, decor and atmosphere reminds me a complete stop off.  The meal starts off with a little change and then you quickly move on to dessert.  The portions are plentiful and fresh and sometimes much larger than others in Chinatown.  The server used to
restaurant can be extremely crowded. Also, it is not regular customer service. I thought that was interesting,  but what could make this place worth $15 or so?
Something to be aware of, I suppose.  At least it has lunch prices, for the most part, and we were free. There are 3 dishes that were better than 15 bucks each. But still, it was the best.  If it wasn't for the decent serving of inferior options, this place would've been dead a few years ago.
My wife and I celebrate her birthday yesterday and have been coming here since the beginning of the year.  The food is, overall, great, and the decor is great, it's a nice little neighborhood addition to Chicago's Chinatown. I'd definitely try this place again, but to start I'd ask for a favor. The food is fresh and fresh, and the decor is absolutely atrocious. The most important thing about this place is the nice
restaurant and the parking lot is probably the most romantic place I've ever been to. Also. I can't decide whether or not to go to 5 of the four times I've been there, but I'll be going.
I'm not a fan of overly indulgent sushi - but I love the ribs and fish.  But I do like the soul salad.  I'm very fond of the ginger and purple cabbage.  I also like the tortilla soup that comes with the dish, and the pineapple wedges and salsas.  It's ok, since I usually order smaller portions of meat than the whole thing.  I guess the younger you get, the less you need to spend time cleaning up dishes.
great place for locals to share delicious food. i love crab/fish so much it's called Love. this place takes us one step further by offering free parking. i love lobster-wood. the owner is truly the chef with the warmth, courage
restaurant. Take the 1 of the 50 minute train from Warm & Rachael's to get there. Its just really good food but its hard to get the food to sit well over 30 people and get a table just to eat. I ordered one fish:  It was fine but they handed me the fish and and I took it. Very expensive for a small fry at this point but i was really happy to come here.Food:  Ice  Gravy, Ethiopian Peppercorn. Oatmeal (ignored because of where the thin crust is). Everything tasted delicious and the idea of some world domination was huge.  Our server did not mention "the usual rolls" but just described it as nothing else and not the usual dessert rolls that I have. So it was great. Service:  Really nice guys and nice staff. Got to check the fridge twice a week for food.  It is crowded in there but if you want plenty of people, get there early, enjoy
restaurant and spare, second-hand, onion ring of my life. Yum, I didn't taste like a fucking gag. I did imagine that the food tasted special to me but really nothing less than absolute LALA. I wanted to enjoy the service, the atmosphere, the food, and serve the meal here. If I ever visit Chinatown, my experience in Chicago would be to miss such an experience.  For those of you who live in the Deep South suburbs, I'd suggest doing the same thing here.  This way, we're able to indulge in the same fun-filled food that our great-grandparents will have to wait and wait till a particularly busy working week when their plates become soggy with pizza and coffee, but with better service and customer service.
STAY AHEAD!!!!  I LOVE THIS PLACE! And if you happen to walk by for lunch or dinner, PLEASE FLY OUT ON YOUR BABY TO GO TO SAVE
restaurant, parking lot, etc etc.....but oh well..not as busy as its going to get, it's probably just the prices.
This place got back on the street, except for the filo! I was so disappointed in their food, service and atmosphere -so rude and rude...I called back to ask if I could try the pro-boyfriend place and what. I don't want to wait in line when I have a great time or group. Not for me, honestly, but we're on 2nd floor. The most crude food I've had in a long time.
Arrested in a 5 nightz last week for an illegal ticket. I am incredibly surprised to hear that you were caught here! I just want to say that my gut instinct tells me this place has all the character, class and standard that someone who is anything but a street kid would enjoy in the city, but I will never go back and if you want
restaurant to party, used 2 service employees, a patron and a waiter to seat us. Shove me a basket of delicious salads, smoked salmon, soups, sandwiches and baked soups that were delicious. Everything was freshly baked, healthy, well cooked and prepared. They even placed french fries on the table. She wasn't surprised by the good portions, but I really wanted to enjoy it!  She was very attentive with the food, as well as the the chefs who gave it the best taste of what we were eating. We also ordered our homemade version of oatmeal pancakes, and she asked for our fav! Oh, and she really made our table feel like their own home.  She was definitely the best I've ever had!
On to this place! Here is my review (please don't forget to come back anytime before 7:00 pm...)  And yes, it's BYOB, so check out the bagels and non-free rolls they have!
restaurant way too much. I would not reccomend such unhinged cuisine any time soon. They should be in town.
I was always amazed at this place. If you've never been here before, this is the place to go. I've come twice now and it just seems there's nothing that holds this restaurant back from wanting to return. But, you have to bite your lip and say, oh wait a minute, we've moved to Napoli a couple of weeks ago and we already eat here every weekend! Wow! Seriously! I love this place, but I highly recommend not taking reservations! Never in Napoli's history has a reservation table been open before. I think it's worth the wait.
If you're a tourist wanting to find an Italian food experience, look no further. If you're looking for a legit place to go Italian once, the place has you covered. They even came with samples of their famous, delicious, marinated beans
restaurant (dessert, bread, drinks, etc.) served on a grassy area of the lot. Not only is it hard for employees to get in the green room, but it also would be a terrible location for our party if we only had a few seats. So, I just went here with my friends and we waited. I was stunned at the wait. We walked in the door but there was no time to let them in, they never called when they arrived. Luckily, it wasn't that difficult to come in and say hello to all of our friends so that we could be in a lovely atmosphere. The food is really good and by the way, there was no wait when we tried the app, they just did not have it up. Considering it was a private experience I am very disappointed. My next party will be staying for the night at the Bell.
I've had another carne asada in the South River Loop area. I love the deluxe leather
restaurant, nothing on this menu offers us much in terms of what we normally do. We were able to get a sandwich, but took a trip to Chicago Park to grab some water. The service was pretty lame. It was an obnoxious atmosphere to waste hours working. After 10 minutes I gave up and called to show the manager and say I'm sorry it took so long for my little brother. We immediately spoke to an employee. The manager didn't understand the situation and, ahem coincidentally, no matter how I felt about his reaction (he was clearly trying to send a positive message), she got no response. After that she apologized profusely and said something came from my phone. The manager went back to her as if he wanted to get a better quote but unfortunately, her face was completely disfigured. While she was having a terrible experience, by this time I was starting to feel really bad about things and hoping there was some other waitress that could help to help. The
restaurant against the drenched love-filled crowd, they decided to get a new restaurant in Chicago, one that is the perfect addition to the area. Though there are some nice restaurants in my area, this one takes off when it is close to the attention of the crowd.  This location is full of flavor and would have been great if it were open any longer.  If you like homemade deliciousness you will enjoy your new restaurant here.
I love seafood!  I went here with a friend for dinner, which was a treat!! I got the brisket, which was amazing. This was excellent quality (75/75 seasoning).  The pasta was a bit bland and my heart skipped a beat! They added dill, which is a perfect accompaniment.  I ordered two different breads and a side of beef.  Good things from a butcher who used to talk about his style, but the only real success of this place is that he didn't cater to everyone
restaurant's opened tonight at 8:30pm. A great time to grab a drink. The wad of fresh fruit and desserts will be perfectly paired with lunch and dinner!
My friend, dad and I started from scratch last Friday evening, when we pulled up at Neato Pizzeria. The menu was great. The concept was still fresh and on, still functioning as usual. And the overall service was awesome. The other patrons felt like they had a place to go because they could easily get seated without incident. Everything was written in nice Italian and all was well. For dinner I got brunch. It was great, but not fantastic. The option of a seat is limited if you just want to eat outside and not have to be disturbed by the staff or tables. I prefer the Pacifico restaurant with the comfort of a standing table, but I prefer the La Bettenelle-worthy Chicano Villa with one small patio. It's great, but you also have to ask
restaurant and sample menus.
The atmosphere is gorgeous, noisy and full of personality. Though there are most likely spots that make you wanna go out that evening, the atmosphere is fun and fabulous. The bar and patio is nothing intimidating, but the service is very decent and consistent. I will definitely go back if I'm ever in Chicago.
One of the best places I have seen anywhere in Chicago.  I have tried Cattos and Thoughtroomba in Chicago and even have brought my friend over there on an occasional basis.  Once I'm in the right spot, you don't miss the delicious taste of moto.  You get to taste all of the amazing food in this place.  If there's anything that I cannot get enough of, it's raw food.
Good food, great service, great ambience, and some very sweet complimentary wine to pair it with. Not a big eater but nice atmosphere!
I love yuppie restaurants, so
restaurant, as indicated above, it has NO traffic (since they tell you no color over there) and is often visited by our friends who ARE vegetarian-fast food enthusiasts!Food is totally good! Sooooo good, at least for what it is. Definitely not everyone's favorite, but, if I could go back and try it again, I would. Here are the other great things I find out:1) Do not ask for service at the bar.I stopped by the place the other day because my friends ate there and it was a lot of fun (like a burger vs. fries) and I felt really sorry for the staff, especially our hostess who was probably a bit off. I mean, who do you think is a good management/manual?2) The customer service is great!You can give them a whirl when your looking for their "last" service before lunch or after they have taken your order in there. In fact, they are so
restaurant, I had the Tea and I didn't think it was a traditional Chinese place or actually another place I'd go to. However, the counter is a bit too large, the staff tends to waste much of their time, and it's not around very often. It's an awesome restaurant and they're at my recommendation.
Never had a burrito place before so I'm stoked to keep going back...If you are craving Korean food, you have to try The Original! I know this is a joke, but their food is very traditional.The cutest they have is the baby corn tortas. Check it out!
We went here recently and have had great service. The dresser used to be the better than parlor and has since taken over the dressing room as well. We like to say that after the restaurant has closed, they will send the service down to their owners. Overall a great place to eat lunch. The oil and the chicken are all delicious
restaurant is the best I've ever had!  Everyone enjoys them, its always a plus that I dont have to wait 30 minutes to eat!!!  We have no reservations when there is no wait at the bar (door closes).  The dessert is amazing - appetizers are plenty of blueberry and strawberry cheesecake.  I love that they have beer specials!!  If you have never been to my place please note that I've been there twice.  So if you like fruit on the menu and plan to stop in the morning enjoy!
Service is okay, the shrimp might work for them. Service is all but terrible too.
Food:Ok it's kind of hard to choose which one to go with, I'm a sucker for more of a sushi/alligator/dragon joint but what else was there? I've been here a couple times, have always loved it! Everything looks incredible, the decor is so comfortable you can walk in and grab a bite.There
restaurant was wonderful and special. A little pricey but worth it! The little stall(which I would say is better) is still working perfectly as long as they don't have busy people who are taking care of you. At least after 6 hours of each other talking and eating (take a good look at your purse/purse if you don't like pasta/curl hair/dressing/nutty enchiladas. Bad food!) I'll keep going and going back.
Hershey's makes it fun - a little pricey. Everything is huge in terms of unique pizzas, fresh ingredients and heavy cheeses. You have to try the meatballs which were fairly plentiful but there are probably too many to be worth trying, the salad - it's a plate full of incredible meatballs which are very deep-fried. Any toppings they add are high quality which makes the atmosphere nice and fun.The huge portions of food (and the rather large waitstaff)
restaurant to your table, yes? Yes you can? We've been here for more than a year and it's gotten to the point where it's not just convenient anymore. The restaurant always really stood out. We always walked in, always had our order, and whenever it seemed like something was off, we'd leave the food (but sometimes the food didn't look out of place). I won't be spending the cost of a meal on beef, which is generally the fine line between anything else and heaven.  My main courses were burgers, empanadas, and even veggie pancakes. I was happy I went on a Friday with two entrees and started off with the burger and I was suddenly told that my order couldn't be gotten until Wednesday.   This line is hardly spot on, but for 10 minutes the food wasn't available and it really was extremely annoying to feel like we needed to get every single meal out of our mouths. I did find a table after
restaurant.  Fried empanada!
We're completely new here.   We went here recently for brunch but I told them we had a reservation.  That was last night and that always happens so I made sure to come back.  The food is great, the atmosphere is nice, the service is great, and they do have an extensive menu.  Plus, the draft is great.  It was better than we thought it would be!
...was one of the best sushi sashimi in the city....great in soy sauce and warm lemongrass sushi the sauce was amazing!!!!!the fresh tofu bisque was always very good and always better!haven't been once in my life and my fiance and I eat at Sultan twice a week..we got there and there was a VIP wait so everyone else was super friendly. feel free to bring some sushi you can keep in your comfort box.
I never want to go back. The service and the atmosphere
restaurant places, the way it was presented is a disappointment. Everything was burned in your mouth. The opening door looked just like a bag. I was at the end of my meal in the bathroom, instead of my small check (which was only $25). On the table below and under the table was the very picture of Aunt Eliza, Mama Al and Mala. Wounds were so evident - tears so hard they seemed to come from my eyes. I had my plates and a towel, and the only dishes I'd ordered were my favorite dried fish and seafood that was on the menu. Our waiter did not stand by and talk about this - like the one I had at Sunda's! It was disgusting. He seemed to ask for even more spoons, and talk about the plates that were sitting in our front freezer. I won't eat at Sunda's anymore. So I left, disgusted and really disgusted.  I still wish they didn't send me to the
restaurant and wannabe soup dumplings. Sushi portions are absolutely beautiful. Food was good, but the drinks were average.
My father always visited Chicago. The tempura is very good, and the homemade pico de gallo was just ok.  The ambiance is neat but the food is atmosphere is not.The staff is always out on the town with her greetings, and the greasy soup dumplings are my favorite.  I really like this restaurant, and hope they continue to.
This is the Chicago style buffet! It's awesome, but if you have a bad experience with cold drinks and don't know how to order it and all, it's a work in progress! This is one of the best KROQs I've ever had! It's BYOB and everyone gets the food and makes the bill.You'll not be disappointed, It's like Wodehouse going up to Imogen of All Souls for dessert
restaurant, noodle dish with crispy egg white served with white sauce.  I did not have an issue with the owner going out of his way to bring me a big pizza with an open mind.  He always seemed very kind and polite and helpful.  He also seemed generous when it came to giving me a chance to try his speciality items, which I recommend checking out to see if you like this slice of soft-serve pizza!  I highly recommend their charcuterie, I will be back for sure!
I'd strongly recommend you bring your dogs with you if you're in Chicago.  Their chicken is on a high in the tradition of the jackass crowd that brought them here.  I've tried to make reservations at multiple of their restaurants, and the food is delicious.  They recommend cutting off the wings and duck fat with butter and olive oil (not to mention the beers).  Be warned about dipping into the soft drink to take a bite of
restaurant, with being the single most important place you'll ever find a plate of Mexican food. In the past, sometimes dishes and meat would be hard to find at my noodle joint. But a bit like a regular regular noodle joint or having the sauce sauce you get from duck does save you a ton of money. Well, it does the dishes the customer is telling you about. One of the most popular joints I've visited is the Leenihui Grill, which offers the best Chicken n' Bacon (with garlic powder and quinoa).The exterior is spectacular, even if the kitchen doesn't seem to be as busy as they have been. The air conditioning also has to be memorable, as it adds yet another layer to the interior decor. The coffee is a favorite of mine. Just have a group where you go to Geilu and speak to it directly. It's not a difficult conversation for any Mexican-American, it's just really clear with the most annoying
restaurant, but thankfully it still runs, so if you are a repeat, ask for an extra bottle of gin just before dining.
Do you like hotdogs?   Are they still going to be good enough?  Do you have to sit out a wait?  Do you know how to just warm you up a little?  Or, what's one delectable dish of fruit I have never tried?  How about an apple sausages?   On a quick note, I will make every single one of my staff here a service dog.   They tell me when I ask about hotdogs, and when they recommend cold water they all agree.   If you want a gift with a full hotdog (or two) in your stomach, a nice treat!  And finally, I'll take a beer before getting anything else!
This place is great! I love it here and am a big beer fan.  The list is long but everything
restaurant at 5:30.  Two sides are open and there is a chance they may be open again as soon as they are available for business.  Their beer is very very small (3 beers per person) and most of the dishes are covered with maple syrup.  There is really no value in the average waitress.  Her assistance with prices will go a long way in taking care of this establishment.
I love this place, totally live in Chicago and love the food.  My favorite is Milly's Chocolate Bread.  And I will go back again.   Service is good but nothing compares to the service of the people over there.
When it comes to flying coffees, the Cafe at Millennium is the best.  I'll definately go again, or at least as a special occasion.  Wings are perfect. Food is consistently good, great service, and great seating.  Perfect venue for vino chorizo.
In the past (in
restaurant said on several occasions that he would "break into the right location" for a hamburger place that provided its hostess a workable lunch, but I found it hard to believe it would still be serving the "best" food available. Until a customer came and found out I can't even pick his salad with the lettuce we had on their menu, the spot was full of star reviews. Since I'm going to go a little bit more into detail on how I feel about the restaurant and the food being used as per the world's most famous restaurant, I will only bring you the experience I have had at the Piccolo House. If the idea of going to a place like Piccolo House is appealing, but does it make for a crappy experience? Then I will gladly turn back and take back my money, because it's already been paid for. These things I could have walked away from, a favor I certainly didn't deserve, but there is no such thing as a
restaurant. What a nice experience! I was more impressed with the food at Ittulu's. I like cold brews here but these foods were presented very nicely. The drinks here were really good but were limited. Also take the mistake of leaving out the popcorn and popcorn king I wanted. After dipping the popcorn in, it tasted just a little dirty and burnt. The antipasto was good but not as good. The lobster will come back. The rest of the special menu is only too good. Also, imagine at least one more place to enjoy something fresh and tasty, a speakeasy and BBQ joint (maybe even another location as well?) would serve just that.
This place rocks. They have a charming food menu and there are tons of reasons to go. Don't be offended at their Pizzeria and it will definitely be back (I guess on some days a super heavy drink or something will get you in a rush).
This place IS wonderful! I
restaurant meals: :DD DD
Beef Soup and Salad was outstanding.   Had to go somewhere else but ordered the veggie plate with the maple bacon, which was good.  Service was decent, but the food itself was so imbalanced that I was in no mood to go back for drinks anymore.
My new friend and I have always been fans of this place, they always seem to like to do work.  In addition, this has always been one of our favorite spots.  We've been waiting a long time for the specials and it has always been a pleasure to wait out there.  It's just more fun to eat your way to go.  Since we have lived in the neighborhood for about five years and it always has the same feeling, we only always come here to eat my way.  We usually order the rice kurayoushi, that's my favorite part of the food.  We ask that the place have seat for us while
restaurant/people/giving..are not nice - a little trickier - but we got there quick and couldn't be bothered with a line...the place was noisy and unfriendly. Even if the lamb salad was tasty, the salad was not. Not if they put a lot of fat on it.  There was a sign on the door saying if you come to CHARE you're out of luck! lol
This is on the food block and i think the pizza was just okay.  Just a bit slower than their bread but it was worth it.
Randy Perez seemed to have a very laid back atmosphere but also a few other folks who went there to enjoy their meal. Their brunch and eating appetizers...seems to me, not quite just an Apple to taste version, but also the very reason for this review as the Tasting Line was all  alittle long, especially as we were coming out of our door, and not  doing anything
restaurant is great and we had enough to make over their price (it cost us a lot of money, I think).  Still was a great experience so if you go, be prepared for a wait to go.
i was a college student but not on good terms with many of our friends.  So much better than I anticipated and had to move my parents away and move out of there.  The building is their "kiss request", so no matter how tall you were and how adventurous you were I was still excited for the food and the great service.  I am fairly nostalgic and couldn't go wrong with the lobster (burger egg) or their heavenly paprika w/ fresh basil sauce.  Bored of a date and wondering if I'd catch a bus to Melting Pot for the night.  Not trying anymore, why not?  Must go back again!
Fantastic sushi. Love the waitstaff, friendly service, cheap prices. Pretty decent service
restaurant - and very helpful staff - not to mention great food and service. I am only a vegetarian, and at one point I just found out the waiter/pilgrimage is a slob who works at McDonald's.
The shrimp section was ridiculous. The lobster I saw was my worst lunch food experience.  I don't like lobster, but sometimes the fish is on the dollar.  If I had to choose between tuna and shrimp it would be grilled and then that would be it.  Go, burger, sandwich, dog bbq and chicken or chipotle taco stand.  I prefer to go to Frontera (we have to go there again) for a simple option.  My  review-the shrimp, bacon, eggplant and cheese cutie are even better.
I love the cuisine. The margarita's are great as well as the frozen's.  I just stopped in after my meal and ordered a little of their chicken wings

Jacket.  Nice.  Keep up the good work.
This place is sooo loud, you can't tell it isn't live music. I was here for dinner and a large portion was not for breakfast.  To be honest, it was for breakfast so we opted to split my dollar for dessert instead.  On the plus side, it was for dinner so I didn't have to wait for my partner for dessert because he was just hanging around at the bar.  The side of the dinner plate was amazing.  We tried another chicken roll, flat and crunchy and it was delicious.  We had a side of chicken - beans, rice and curry - which I didn't like.  We ordered the smaller appetizer, and it was way more spicy and small compared to the stuffed
restaurant customers, There was never a fuss at the restaurant.  Every time the staff brought something they had taken from the  food,  were gracious and took the time to convey the meaning of the food - but that was my fault!  It was all done in the condescension of the owner, treating the customer like a prude at best, and all too often being a jerk on the entire service.   If I had been around several years ago, I would still be that kind of guy.  It didn't bother me that they would treat my young customers like VIPs, that most of them did not bother to come to their place and were ready to go without much waiting.    That is because the owner is just a jerk.  The only friendliest customer is a lie!!!!  I can hardly believe it...
The food is delicious. Everyone was excited about it. I have heard that the house meats will be perfectly grilled for a couple hours
restaurant, had a message from her hostess which told me that the soup was about to be packed but that they couldn't find the finish.  The waitress still wasn't happy with it.  It seemed like the special food we're talking about for a standard dinner entree like the food in under $15.50 is practically all over the place.
If you're like me and you like the mannequins, you're not going to like this place. I wish it was at an overall 2 star, but I'm not so sure about this place. I find it to be mediocre. You get the basics like shrimp and shrimp soup, and there isn't a ton of it. There are kind stones that have served as soups and the entire menu can be split into different flavors. If it were on the same menu it would add up over and over. The burgers are terrible and it's especially impressive that it is just 9 bucks for a food that is
restaurant, no reservations.   If you're in San Francisco, this is a dream come true!  I'm glad you went, too!
4 stars is highly inappropriate.  Just maybe they have somehow morphed a few dishes that weren't worked properly.  So in no way do they deserve the 5 stars.  They had some really good but pricey drinks too, no better
This place got my girlfriend a Valentine's Day gift and we want to go back. My boyfriend is from Chicago so he came out of town and went with us with his entourage.  So we both ordered our dinner, although we never tried it.  We say the food was the perfect dinner and they are right!  The service, the food is fast and friendly and the atmosphere was perfect!  When our waiter did all of his dishes I was surprised to see, it was early in the evening.  My boyfriend kept telling us to get in before our phone service went. 
restaurant, but they did NOT make it because they're way understaffed, unbelievable prices (awesome, hype)
My husband & I would be going to TruCAL next week!! We ate there last night and it was a shoo for 3 beers. Our waiter sat down in front of our table at the counter next to our table as we waited for the bartender to arrive and to step in. If I had to sum it up, and now that I'm in town, TruCAL is 3 stars!
This place is out of this world.  I don't know what they have in St. Louis, but I am the type that regularly hits F! Not to mention the reason I ended up coming here.  The quality of food was excellent.  The pizza, wine and salad were really tasty.  Don't forget about the beers! The coffee latte combo was the best of the rest.  We had a ton of old-timey
restaurant, dining, over-priced fare and a number of other negative things.  I've had rude service for weeks now and it just doesn't seem to go on.  The price I received has never been the same.  The reason why so many people chose to go is the service and prices which, when properly judged, would be a bargain.   I have met so many people who have come to the restaurant and now want to start their own.  This is all just fine until something steps up.  It's going to take some time to realize the true value of La Vieja, and maybe not for a while.  However, I will be back soon, for sure.  You can find more and better places at more of the best restaurants in the city for its uniqueness and value, or for your wallet.  I live in Chicago, but it is better to go to Las Lux and let your money be better in there.  This is more
restaurant from the left. The salad bar at Grand Bahama Nuevo Leon was great. Overall I was very impressed.I am very looking forward to again.
I started with veal, and cilantro, and I love it!!!  I wish I could tell you why this place is such a place to go when you're sitting in downtown!  It's such an awesome place to eat and enjoy.
It is not a table sized restaurant, but if you have a lot of money, this is for you! I am a huge fan of The Five Stripes and I must admit that having the pizzas at their restaurant after the meal is such an amazing experience.  They have such food and service that I'd recommend going there!
Really great food and excellent service - so full that they let us sample the stuff they had! The broth in this dish is delicious. We had a risotto salad with tomato sauce and a veggie grilled cheese cocktail that I
restaurant, of course, and with a check that people were getting something here late and they were forgetting about the extra wine list...what a great place for such a great evening. This place has always been about service...sorry not it was. the prices are hard to find and sometimes they have to pay at a very high price for some at night. The food is very decent...not worth going to Sagertown for.  That being said, the atmosphere is cheap, I had a short time.  It seems like they have been hiring more people there.  I've given 10 to 10 other people an opportunity to try it.
Great location! We are a few steps from the Westgate Grill and look forward to getting back!
I think my parents have liked it so much, that the Michelin Bayreuth has been staying open for more than 2 years. I mean, the food, as all that space makes it seem, always reminds me of the sushi
restaurant.  They were basically a group of two who had been going together since the spring and wanted a more cohesive experience.  It was full of great art and top-notch restaurants, and the food was always impeccable.  I don't have a complaint about their server nor is he a guy that you go to for any other reason, he seemed like the sort of guy you have to call up.  We were all very impressed.  It was definitely not the same as the others; but the staff was nice and accommodating.  The bread is a little tart and delicious, but never did it drop.  The salads were beautifully made with fresh vegetables that were superb.  The staff did not seem worried about changing the menu, just excited to bring it up, share with you who actually wanted to try it, and have fun with it.  And as we waited for the food to be delivered, it really ticked all the boxes.
I can't
restaurant and a good place to go.  The wines of the day were excellent.  We ordered five of the food that night: Confining crab (cheesy lobster) with apple salad sauce, crispy ceviche (sausage flan bread) with whitefish, peas, sauerkraut, pork belly and etc.  Good, fresh ingredients for a good dining experience.  My wife was aware of this place but her recommendation was not at all good.
Great fast service, great size, fantastic atmosphere. I've been here 5-6 times and I know what i'm talking about - this is an amazing and made me cry.This is where you go for simple lunch and dinner and fun things. The old-fashioned oven cake is so good, you don't even have to split.  Great chicago style appetizers which are as good as you could hope for!  Wishes are great too. I've eaten so many crazy burrit
restaurant:      Red Dragon Salad. I have also had Red Dragon for Sushi, and Honey Peppers, as well as Crispy Neapolitan Sausages and Split Sausages, as well as Crispy Salmon. The presentation is outstanding, especially the service - they make you feel special and well packaged, and no complaint. I have had the Cafe version of everything on the menu, including all, and the owners were so great that they have installed more'review(s), essays, etc. than I ever imagined could be worth the wait. Overall, a great place to hang out, enjoy a good time, or just relax.
Went and got a table for dinner for 3 of us, there are none to compare the seafood. However, because of the size of the party and they live in the South Bay Area and usually enjoy their seafood food fresh, we wanted to leave a positive impression. The Green Dragon Salad (2.9
restaurant and restaurant in Ithaca, NY, was quick, friendly and delicious.
First I looked at this place and I can only imagine how excited I was to have found such a wonderful place.I had the course and  attended the course as an undergrad there had never been before. I was really proud of the food. I ordered the falafel  whoops and pizza which was the best. My brother ordered a special which I cannot remember.He said the falafel is not good but he expected a dish they didn't. My wife ordered some cupcake which he didn't eat in the course.I was happy that I was there but not impressed. Anyway I was feeling a little anxious for my family to come to town so they did not return for the last time. Finally the wait time was 30 min. My sister was so nervous about it we walked back to the restaurant as if waiting for three months before going home.

Best pizza i have had in Chicago. I have loved them all! 2nd time was good..
One of the best dinners in the country.  Would like to have been more upscale.
Over the years we've made many friends here, and she has made it her mission to raise the bar here.  She is more than just an expert server, she takes the clients up on their offers, and she

The music was lively and fresh and different at the same time. We never went outside or walked around in the area. We had dinner here about 7-8 minutes prior to their closing time. I want to say that's because this place is a very personal space for us and it is so close to The Spot where my daughter grew up. I am always on the lookout for great places to sit, so I always try the place at Lincoln Park.
Was brought to this restaurant by someone who asked if she could order one pizza at once. It was pretty well priced, which was somewhat unusual since all of our other meal order was already here. We were able to have 7... the bill came only 5... and they also charged us 6 on our debit card. The staff at the restaurant were great about bringing us our pizzas but they seemed slow to be there. Also, the atmosphere was really great. The service is a little off, although there was a
restaurant and food was amazing. I highly recommend this place, try it now.
I will definitely return again! I just went to Boston over the weekend so I can visit Glenview or my favorite dining spot.
I love sushi. But....and why would I give it a 3 because of how chinese the food is? I love it. But I just don't agree with the reviews.  I love it when the chef is a gorgeous guy.  I would sit in the place and nap next to him, and eat over my counter or just sit behind him.   I guess it just adds to his dining experience.  As someone who has been to much of East Coast Asian food, I thought it was a nice place to try this place.  But...when it comes to sushi, they just don't go as fast and long as others recommend.  Like, maybe a lot less fast than I've been to in a while and the "fine"

We were seated right away and I loved the way they had red velvet bread.  What a great meal! It was so tasty and fun, I was glad I did go.  Amazing!  But we came back, and for some reason not to be seated.  Very disappointed in the restaurant and really trying not to be offended by customers!
Harmony on the Rye was one of my favorite authentic Indian dishes ever.  Not only is the dish super fresh, it's deep fried and it comes in a beautiful-looking glass pan. It's also tastiest - every bite of it comes out tasting amazing. My husband and I are happy to have them to share with us as well.  The chutney, the corn and rice, are both wonderful.The portions are packed soooo full, I would only be giving 1 star.  If you're out of town I suggest heading there early next week - even though this place is pricey, very
restaurant is great--thanks guys! - Moja... OK.
I am impressed at the food, the service, and the atmosphere at this restaurant.  These two recommendations make it look like you don't belong here but don't get me wrong, the service here is a blessing and a curse of the bowl-liffle reputation of Chopwerks.  The service at this restaurant gets better than the experience it usually gets.  But the rest is all that matters.  the staff is very friendly, with regular re-assessment of individual dishes.  We've had many great dishes from this restaurant that we thought are good to order but have had them all over the city we are yet to have them brought up.  I have a recent takeout and only wish they added some more information to the menu but I will gladly do it and have no qualms in feeling pleased with the overall experience.
I'm pretty sure this is Chicago's worst.  So
restaurant and flavorful, this cafe is great, 2 adults with 3 kids. Food was as good as they get.Service was reasonable and friendly
We used to live in three blocks from O'Hare, and thought it was impressive what each neighborhood has in store for you to visit. The bar is spectacular!I really miss being to eat on Saturday and Sunday when you do not have the choice. So while we waited to visit, we shared the same menu; there were two items; 1 tortilla and their bread. The whole time we sat there I thought this is some sort of doujiramisu bar for most people, but I loved it. Simply amazing.We could not be more delighted!  I have read so many negative reviews about them, and felt happy to see the great things the Cafe has to offer. I love it!Try any of the other awesome places around. I'd recommend trying the Chipotle Ribeye and stick with it for a while
restaurant list is overhyped.  But the artistry comes from the actual ingredients.  The dishes are cooked so well, they melt in your mouth.  And they are addictive.  It's one of my favorite restaurant experiences, just a little bite if you're hungry.  We got the Eggplant Basil Brunch and we'll definitely be back.<|endoftext|>
restaurant pricing. During lunch, we sat through a mixed menu, which was very spiced up and enjoyed each customer's choice. During our walk around the main dining room we have been to a few events in the past and one of our favorites is from that tapas bar at Paul's.After lunch, we decided to bring a friend from our party so we could eat there on time. After brunch, the burritos were delicious. Service was good and we will definitely be back to pick up the items that made this experience so special.
Loved the sashimi, they would take a great bite and know they had it all planned out. Gotta try another place but will do it tonight.
It was awesome. Wow!! And would like to find out more about the place. Oh and for the food, it was  addicting.  Cute.   No way the usual bowl of salad is going to cause you problems (not that its true

I know that some of you have wanted to come for your lunch date, but you haven't done it yet. Luckily, we've been here on the weekends with great food, great service, and fabulous service. We've been out there for about a year, and have never been disappointed. The service for what you get is spot on, especially if you're trying to figure out which steak to eat first. Our waitress is knowledgeable and helpful, and if you have any questions, that is wonderful. You are always impressed by the server's professionalism, his experience, and his candor. They also have an incredibly cute girl who is always ready to greet you, if you just want her attention. I love the ambiance of the restaurant. My server is always a fun person. If you want to experience a different aspect of New Orleans, I'd suggest coming to this place at least once a week.
My experience in Chinatown is so unique, so unique
restaurant by the night - I never felt that after we finished our appetizer.  It was  so great the next morning when we arrived we were seated with the hostess and knew exactly how much attention we had received.  We weren't impressed at all - it took us several days to get a refund.  Some people brought me things from the kitchen but I felt like some one was trying to sell us something.  They also mentioned to have sent out 3 items of New York style the evening before.   My luck was in the nose.  I tried to make it on the weekends so I was absolutely certain it would be there all weekend.  We called the restaurant to pick up at the store and we thought they had a great set.  It was amazing!  It was pretty dark but we have only had 2 items we will be taking home and a clean dish.  It was fun for me to spend a little time with the server who looked at all
restaurant. 3 star service, with another star for the coffee is definitely a bit overkill to me. Definitely worth a visit and don't be a fan of "Crop some beans in coconut" style food. You'll love it!
This place is great, too.  It is full for brunch.  I've also been to this place twice now and then.  The decor is especially well done, because they have a lovely store that makes great gift cards for this week.  Parking is good, but walk just a short walk.  Don't overthink this place!
I've been there a few times, and it is just awesome.  I don't mind when it is crowded, and the number of people is always outstanding.  It can be a bit noisy, but if you want some entertainment then consider the setting and seating -- I've had a couple really neat sit-down-appetizers that were super small (the Taro Choprice
restaurant/memorial location.
This place is absolute be in it's way. You can't compare to the other places I've tried; the service is average.  The food is everything, but the service is just atrocious.  From literally checking into the bar, to waiting at the table, I was sitting pretty nowhere at the time.  There wasn't anything to go around.  The menu says it all, but then the food is terrible.  We'd like to go back...maybe come back to this place for brunch, or some lunch.  You won't be disappointed.
THE HAPPY DINNER IS GRAND!!!Here are some great dining experiences!The owner  has great service, great atmosphere and Great dishes! The bowl is so light and the meats are so moist!All in all, great atmosphere, great food, great wait staff and I will definitely be back.

One of the best Southern restaurants in Chicago.   Our waiter was cool, always pleasant, and the staff was very well trained and knowledgeable.  We would definitely recommend this restaurant.  Great store.
Great neighborhood pizza restaurant   The food is amazing and the ambiance is fabulous.  Food is great too and the waitress is not unprofessional.   Oh, and if you go with your buddies, try the appetizers.  If you are lucky enough to have dinner in a couple of weeks, I would recommend the spicy kimchi pasta.  Great deal.
I love the English fare here. The company is small, and really good too.  The fresh or frozen cheeses are spot on and I can buy a sampler of them all of which
restaurant, however, was in fairly good order. A little slow, but cooked to perfection. Three cheeses: famous, tiny, and uncomplicated. Nice to have them in there. Everything was fresh, and the meats had very crisp portions. The prices were well priced (plus the possibility of a retail trip). Parking wasn't a problem, so if you were coming in from a less expensive location (probably around a mile away), you were OK with that. If you were paying $20 or more for drinks, but opted for beer (the best tasting beer I've had!), feel free to park for the beers.
This has been a gem.  Every time I go there I must agree that my steakhouse needs to be perfect.  I cannot wait to go back.  It is  amazing that they do not give a discount for the awesome steak.  We were two years into my one year of serving the food so we could afford to leave behind our

Really a big go to. The server was nice but professional. The service was alright but it was pretty disappointing. The staff are busy. If you need to go out in the middle of town for lunch without dine out if you have that kind of thing just wait and take pictures of it. He didnt give you any preference and really should be more of an acquaintance or home rule.
It is a spicy dessert, so please please go and have a cold beer while you have your breakfast.  It is pretty good.  If you haven't heard about it already then it must be spicy.  My girl went with her mom.  Yum.  She was definitely pretty polite, helpful and kind of her usual friendly personality.  The only thing i would say is have some extra tomato with it as opposed to the (stuffed)-less-sweet tomato sauce that they use.
restaurant/francake course...THE TAKEAWAYS.SUCKERUNNER!!!!!!!!!!THE FOOD IS LIKE STYLE!!!  When you finish eating you should be awestruck...they have an extra half cake that comes with each meal.I love the sound of the food running around, so much I am eating it with goosebumps or all over myself like a punch. So much yummy!Salsa, cheese and salad! I LOVE THE SABER CRAFT!!I love the BABY EVERTHING!!!It gets under my skin with each dish so they should be happy for each other, especially with their takes on Asian dishes.  We all started at a late date, only ended up getting one dish each time, so the dish selection was good and the dishes came on the order.We were able to only use one dish in our meal, and we could NOT eat more at the table.We will NEVER EVER regret going back
restaurant & restaurant reviews, and a little, we felt compelled to share with you the only way we could think of to begin our blog conversation. The new dine-in schedule was a little tight, and while the hostess wasn't especially comfortable we were able to confidently offer her a seat and tried to assure her it was within our comfort zone. The two tables are seated before her when we put our order and we are able to choose the size of plates we like to serve. She admits that we all could have told her that we only serve small plates and dessert, so she told us that we need to review them, and we would give her our review!  I will have a better gourmet Mexican restaurant around town, I know we will.
Huge Yummy first time to go! I highly recommend the Yolanda, the first place I went to here that I am very familiar with. Atmosphere is very warm and they have one of the nicest
restaurant: The red meat is just really, really good. They even have a vegetarian option: And I mean, it's usually vegetarian (which is always good) to know that it's vegetarian.
Shrimp lover in here.  Make sure you check.  A great table to explore if you are in the neighborhood.  They are a little bit pricey, but I personally think that if you're a restaurant kid, you could go there.
Great BBQ, exceptional service. Great tip and wonderful burger. This place is great!
This is the best burgers i've ever had, what so ever.Best pizza ever, based on reviews.Sticky crust...fantastic, long-term salad. Delicious.fantastic spot for Groupon - never ceases to amaze!

I had the pancakes and it was the best I've ever had. I would definitely be back again.
I will not be returning to Southern Italy again after so many others have stopped by and posted their review. Last weekend, I went here with my husband for my birthday and I was the only one in there! When I arrived we found the bathroom waiting, otherwise, it was open! It was with a lot of interest and also with the money being spent on food. I had to go pick my date up for a date, and we both love this place.  I went with husband and girlfriend and it was over-the-top.  The food was good too and was definitely worth the fee.  I'd recommend the Black Angus Corncake or anything else for someone that is looking for some options.  But definitely over the top.
This pizza joint was my favorite. We ate, although the atmosphere was definitely poor
restaurant with vast quantities of new ingredients. Crisp, crispy beef chunks and light flavored crusts are unbelievable!
The atmosphere was excellent. The staff was very attentive, very nice to us and very attentive. Our waitress gave us directions and we were on our way from eating lunch. One of the waitresses reminded us that we are prepared to die! Everything was fresh and delicious, including the BBQ pork shoulder. The service was quick and reasonable.We recommend going to Wall Street for dinner once in awhile, if only because the prices are lower.
I'm a huge fan of the Sushi/Shrimp Restaurant, and my family is vegetarian.  My favorite thing about this restaurant is the food and service.  We ordered our Sushi bowl from the dishwasher (unless it's cool out because it's fresh) and were stunned at the work surface.  The pricing is amazing!  I got a seat on my chilungo dumplings, which was also
restaurant, on the big stage. I made a pretty tasty glass of wine after doing a couple tasting for some people.I was going to enjoy my food there. BUT  it was not going to be much of an intimate dining experience like you would enjoy on a one-way street that offers entertainment/unruly chaos.  There was no atmosphere for a good night's sips, and I was feeling a bit weak in my left hand.  After over 15 minutes of people standing in line to get their wine, I felt that it was over-rated.   The bar and staff looked rather "cool" and for $50 they were willing to do what they could to get something for free that they didn't mind paying.  Maybe I felt like I'm a big drinker but was really not that hungry.  I did not even notice the existence of a tiki bar or its gilt roof.  Sure there was a real sense of closure from their service
restaurant on the main stage, not only was it helpful but also helped us eat a bit better for a fraction of the price. Try the chef's favorite beer and wine, or the pub wine cellar wine bar, or the wine cellar wine cellar. Love the food, cozy bar area, lovely wine selection. Filling the room with the best wine in Chicago has never been so easy. I love the patio seating area. Sit close to the bar and just feel like you are in a bar where people are supporting you, even if you are looking to dance or throw something around. And make sure you leave ahead of time! You don't need to wait 45 minutes after paying. It's simply the right thing to do.
Wow, I am a huge fan of this pizza and the ones around me love it! The portions are small and certainly one of my favorites. But the pizza they were talking about is really really good. The one that came with the chicken wings were well
restaurant-braised pork with five different kinds of salt cubes, which you can mix. This was similar to their regular SAO such as Sriracha Dip. Other than that, this was the worst rice dish I've had in 4 years. Also, I was expecting moist, dirty, kind of rice -- totally lacking. I was really pleased with my review as well, so hopefully I won't have to make those types of suggestions.
FRIENDS A FICON. LOVES fresh boi, it is really good.  Tasty, simple dishes that are packed with flavor.  My group was totally not impressed with any of the initial dishes, they had several others, so it was disappointing.  They did give up some portions of the beef and ribs for lunch (when I went back) as you would expect from a restaurant that allows them to just charge for the dishes.  They didn't even ask me how I like my food and knew
restaurant is really good, but the steak is low quality, undercooked and about 1/2 full.  A nice waiter served with real beer and some homemade pretzels and couldn't come up with a better menu.  Service was slow and at times frustrating.  It is hard to use a bottle of wine because there is still a lot of meat left and the dish just goes overboard.
Wasn't disappointed by the restaurant, but worth getting.  Service was fine, but not outstanding.  We recommend going there once your in town or visiting as a friend.
Nice food and really good service. The hot dogs were very tasty. I dont remember their size, but everyone in the restaurant said it was very small. I have NEVER been very good at eating chicken wings but i don't have much of a problem with that.  Service is okay, but not great.
This place is fabulous for adventurous people and you can't beat it. The food is
restaurant - Melini, ceviche, sandal and avocado.If you're looking for a cheap table seat for only $200, try Vota; it's still the best hotel in San Francisco.
My husband and I are staying at Key Bridge so we have had better food and the atmosphere is great. They have an outdoor patio which we love, not that it's particularly hot for it, it's just that we usually have to ask our staff for their work orders, which means we can't get to a table unless we want. On the plus side, it's got a patio seating area so if you just sit around the bar, you can have a little feel for the food!
An amazing deal for a late night taco spot in front of Chinatown. Really sad one off here. They have a variety of tacos that are about the best.
I just left here Sunday, still absolutely craving oysters, spicy potatoes. I was pleased with the service they
restaurant (soup, beer).
Love it so much. Well worth the 5 star.After a long week on the Apple, we had a great time with them. The music was wonderful and the service was good. The bill was low. Then, I saw a friend visit the bar. My mind went blank, just really not interested in food.The waiter would make a quick comment and just strike a smile on you face and remind you to try it out on the bar menu to see what stuff he wanted. On top of that, he was too friendly and carefree to look at the customer. We left hungry, unsure of what to order. The local management staff was just trying to say good thing about us and everyone else who asked for anything was taking it out of their hands. We will definitely try again.
Great place, great food, great atmosphere!! The meal is good though.
San Diego, CA is known for incredible food but I have never had
restaurant in the area of the Rosh Hashanah store as well as the 24 dollar diamond mine and parking lot, right next to the theater, and one of the premier entertainment venues in North America!
They definitely are their best... I feel like I'm in a hot bath.
I've spent a great deal of time here lately, enjoying creative foods and succulent drinks. I always love free wiener gnocchi to eat on Thursday nights. They have a large variety of meals from some of the best restaurants in Chicago and they really do have you covered. Since I got here early last week, my experience has been as positive as you can expect. Staff is super friendly and welcoming, and you can be sure we will have a great time. Service is always impeccable and always on point. Keep up the great work.
This is the best lunch spot in Chicago!  My girlfriend and I was to eat at Argyle, but were immediately removed from
restaurant, none of the dishes were as similar as I remember, my favorite being called the Big Fifteen. Instead of courses like 'The Big Five'... that'm all they did really.  And the every time I walked in the door and was greeted with a lot of 'good food' and great people behind me... I was having all the fun.  These people can live like this forever.  The finest restaurants in the country are located in great cities that have real bars.  Can't beat that!
I am very surprised to see so many great reviews and I think the staff is very authentic! I really hope they run a little different as they seem to be on the good side too!
One of the worst things I have ever had.  A bit crowded and not generally flavorful.  I wouldnt hesitate to go back to the bar though.  the atmosphere is "tremendous" it always feels like you are at a bar rather than
restaurant--the owner has "re-raised the bar" and his service--has become the norm. I suggest him their MMM Pork Rancher. They have three different portions--just for the price (dont buy the off chance to eat the stuff out of it's mouth!). The owner comes by only once a year--he will come back again to eat at their place and still be there...$4.00 for 6 MMM Pork Ribs?Not right at all! Oh, and no out of the bottom half of their servers are human beings!!  Oh, I just think it is about experience that your owner was about to give you the worst. But it doesn't matter how hard you try to bring it up, no matter how hard you try to change your mind or voice as long as your job is to "go". He gets irritated, and thinks he is dealing with a giant "bucks addiction" at him. Really??*so good*
restaurant to the right of me. I would recommend this place, but I also like to go back to Italy or New Orleans!  I recommend this place if you're looking for a great pastrami pizza; other than that, I just gave it 4.5 stars...
First time visiting   India, and first time going to a traditional romantic restaurant. Great selection, the decor is contemporary, and the service was helpful.They had fresh ceviche which was delicious, I've never had pizza in Italy. There is a long list of similar types of fare - but here was my first. Overall, yummy, tender and savory.
WOW! The food is fantastic! The dessert menu was great, too! If you are into top brands in the country, it's worth coming here. The food is always delicious. The staff were really friendly, the dinner staff was awesome. Definitely the best I have had in Chicago. The tables are tiny and
restaurant, you don't have to go hard. The drive thru bar was just as good. The quality of food you get is exceptional. Will definitely go back and try the great brunch/design/tasting place!
Just wanted to say thank you to the owner for bringing us one of the best pizza places in Chicago. We had a guy come over from South Park and had to arrive at our table for our Saturday dinner. We said hi to him, we were intrigued and we had to wait for them to show up to our table.  They took our order and they quickly went from the menu to our table and everything seemed to be ready to go. After our waiter was placed in charge of the great service, we were treated to excellent food. Great pizza by each of the restaurants we went to. The only thing that is not great about Riverview Pizza is the only food I will ever order.  If you are an avid pizza enthusiast then Riverview Pizza is perfect
restaurant. It was lovely. Although I may have had more personality, there were definitely enough creative choices to make this restaurant taste as good as it could be. The food was delicious too. I loved the Pad Thai, Ramen and Thai. The Khao Ya Chow was very interesting and healthy. I think that Khao Ya Chow is the most authentic dish to come out of Chicago.
Hands down this is a excellent place to try something new and have a great time with friends, especially if you're not into chicken or beef. The service is great, and the atmosphere is quaint. Everyone I know around here says that the bar usually has very crowded tables.  The food was some of the best I've had this side of wine, just you wait to order. The only negative thing about Hopleaf is the soup they have in it. Both those things are terrible, and the food, the whole thing is disgusting. Definitely not a place to be eaten in the
restaurant experience on a Sunday morning. The prices are right and good.   I could definitely go back if I wanted some cheap Italian soup with parm and carrots.
My last visit to Timetable.com was just as terrific as the rest of my reviews.  Don't worry if you can't wait to go.  Just don't take your breads out of the oven.  You can't eat the bread any more.
My friend/family always has been coming here for over a year! Every time we've taken her to this location we've come back for more reasons. They've been fantastic for us! Our website is always up-to-date, helpful, and friendly!
Juge is the best dessert I've had in Chicago. The flavors are extraordinary. I grew up on butter and soup with Greek flavor. The pastry is superb.  Heh. Heh. Good morning.
When we were looking for something better than
restaurant prices are reasonable, but please make sure you order online as some are out of my budget and we can't attend. We order online for most of our dinners so we will not be in the mood for each one at each restaurant. Instead of paying for individual items we purchase locally and know we will get them right away. Every time I go to Tony's, I know he will be the next waitress. There are going to be waitresses that do not want to talk to us, but if they do make it to each table they will be super nice to us. So,  check with your local waiter to make sure you decide for yourself, and go and have a friendly table after work. I can't wait to go back and have a good time at Tony's. You know what I am saying?
My wife and I have tried so many places we love them all, although it's definitely something to get around! We went to Tupelo for dinner on
restaurant is breathtaking. There is no middle ground when you get into whether it is family style or part of a special dinner meal.  Please go and watch our couples culinary training show.  It can be intimidating or leave them frustrated and confused.  I do recommend heading out, get in and try a great seat, and learn new techniques.  We never, ever need to tell anyone and will never go back.
We love their food. Service is super friendly and helpful. Nice place, you can experience it and not think about it.
Absolutely has the best Indian food that you can get. The bahadani is delicious and the eggs are still very fresh and tender. Food is such a good experience and though we only ordered one entree, I will come back.
I always have a huge hankerem who will accept it. All I got there was a drop of water, just to make sure. I will definitely be back!!!
I had
restaurant. Each component consists of two servings, which can be ordered from some local joint. The usual menu items include seafood with red beans, seafood salad, and sandwiches. Service from the waitresses is also impressive. There are no waitstaffs in the dining room.One of the worst restaurants of this age. And yet we really did get my asscheeks out.  I would go back for food and drinks. I did mention a large variety of beers on a menu, which you'd probably try a list of. Yes, I'd just try a list of at least some of the beers I had...not so much the 5 years of Bayou that I spent there. My friend Gia asked how much I should order and as a compromise, she provided some of our martinis which can be found on a bottle tab. Well to our delight, we got some of their wines. It wasn't like I was wandering around in the kitchen wondering about a few raving
restaurant style for yummy dining. Having lived at Melrose since 1991 and may well have lived the journey of the Restaurant itself, my favorites are the Pequodish Bread and Black Beans. This little sandwich, despite a great service, is a superbly recommended meal. The quality of the crust was also excellent, and as I mentioned earlier was not overly greasy, either. The good thing about this sandwich is that it offers excellent wood-fired dipping sauce and an amazing mustard sauce for a dipping sauce that melts and goes into your mouth. Since it was such an expensive meal, the Fish and Chips were a home run, as were the Market Grub and the Omelette Stew. They're just great breads, just as my wife always wanted. There's also a plate of Italian, chicken and meat dishes here, all with a lot of pickles, cheddar, etc. That's a shame, since it's more than a little cheesy and up to par
restaurant menu, nail rudman bars, and we were handed the blue "Wizadastas" pizza from Big Chicken.
The atmosphere was fun and made some strange and unfamiliar places. We had the crab salad and the mussels and seasoned with garlic, thyme, oregano, and lemon juice. the staff was loud, so there was lots of chatting and happy people. After I sat down I was greeted by a couple dozen people. Then I asked if they have cubicles that open in the upstairs corner. They informed me they are closed for Monday at 5pm, so I am taking them for a date.   I didn't think about it until I was seated and there was no one around. There is an outside patio next to the big end table, but I wouldn't recommend it, especially considering they need a place for a coupe, roll, and a salad.
Fantastic decor, nice staff, wait staff, good place
restaurant is always such a nice place to go on a day-to-day basis with a group of friends and a group of friends who enjoy gastronomy, panini, and more.  There are many locations and locations close together but you won't be in any hurry and there's a lot to discover.   I have always had great service from the staff, but you can get your popcorn and sausage here once a month.  I'd definitely come back to Danno's in one fell swoop.  Keep up the good work!
I feel like I got to go with the server, but it wasn't full in the one weeks of the weekend we ended up on it. We chatted at the end, and the hostess said no thanks.  From the inside, it was a creepy experience.There was a big, white table that felt small at first. It seemed to pass that. But once I came in, I was asked what kind
restaurant and I recently returned to Bangkok with my friend, she loved it.  We had an excellent dinner.The food was tasty!I won't be doing other reviews of this place if I don't get one from someone else this week, but check it out! Overall, I'd definitely come back if I could!
For all its flaws it seems like this place really looks and tastes like it comes from any other restaurant in Chicago.  This is probably due to the fact that it does not take long to catch a bus or drive to the main drag.  And what about those fritters on pizza?  Because after all the lovely food you have to get with both hands before you can put on a sandwich.  Like this:
It's cozy! This is in its own neighborhood, and the hostess is nice enough to be on hand to make sure everything is just as it's supposed to be. For dessert I went with an entree - a pastry
restaurant, service, and style all combine to make this place worth the pilgrimage to a location where visitors are seen in awe of the sumptuous hotel.Himself a Marmite fan, my two things were a sandwich, etc. The drive of the restaurant was delightful! The service was ok, but they could have had a napkin sized red roll taken from the table. My taste buds loved the beignets which were perfectly cooked and full of butter and oil. Service was excellent though, as is the entire experience. I just wish they had made more entrees. Everyone who has gone to this place was perfectly happy.Service was great with $5 Mexican foods. Surprisingly it cost us about $7 which I think is over 50% of what we paid. I really really do hope they have more to add about $6 food! This place is so close to the panpaw (well they call them it) where yuppies are usually puffed up and
restaurant provided with my in addition to my wine list.  We made some to celebrate and everyone loved it!
There was one thing I like about this restaurant: the menu includes creative dishes!  We made choices of bone marrow's, potatoes and mushrooms from a menu of 30 kinds of meat, oatmeal, macaroni and cheese, lentils, veal and pork, chicken, bacon, steak, broiled eggs, oysters, deli meats, fish, entrees, sauces, and other items.  I can't remember the ingredients listed and it's basically a big list of things to choose from for the menu.  Our server, a salt island kitchen assistant, was extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  And, it's always nice to have such great quality!
For very good service this food is great too.
No. 1- eat here, eat here, eat here. My mom moved from cuz i have boyfriend there and he was never
restaurant in our neighborhood, and to die for, we are certainly not going to let this mmmmonger fail. My mom was kind enough to let me come here, we ordered the sausage, pizza, appetizer, and dessert, which tasted excellent (the kids had chicken, bacon, and a lot of toppings!). We were all pleased with the outcome and a loved tail. However, I have to warn you that this is one of those times when our table is packed and not even the front desk. My bad. Thankfully, we were able to order some other entrees and I'd say it was rather busy. We got the coffee, which was good, however the service was poor, and although I would say that our group sat more than a full sitting (although the medley of not all good brews was generous), we have tried several different coffee tables across the country and, among other things, we had the two sampler. Of course, it was
restaurant. I've had a few different rolls this season, but I like the Cheesecake rolls or Salad Rolls. And the sandwiches are a bit too small. However, they're great! I'm sure you'll love this place!
i am hungry a lot when i go this place is AWESOME and all i do is turn in the 3rd time. most i order on our night 5th btw, they already put the truffle dinner on there, never once did they tip and i just left feeling guilty i want my boyfriend a slice of cheese with something extra i'll try.. i have been hungry alot when i go here though, even though it's a 20 minute walk away. i wont be back and i won't stick to this place for the rest of my life.


This place takes care of me, when I am visiting. What I really want is my wife to go with me and take my dog for a holiday.  My sister
restaurant is the pizza.The other problem I had with the food was lack of service, which was even worse. Once again, I ordered the spaghetti and everything was mediocre. If you enjoy spaghetti for it's sauce, this is a bad experience.Loco is not every day i go to Italian places (I think it is a bit on the expensive side because it is not in my neighborhood) and I recommend Ezzo. They have nice lines. The decor is lovely, and it has the feeling of being a kitchen. Most of the people on the bar, even the owners, have moved on to give it more trendy appeal, so that is very appealing. The seats are very small in the rear area (all seats are completely covered in white linen) and the chairs look like leather chairs. It is really hard to find things that you really want to bring. For example, you cannot find what the manager calls an "on-white" white wine tasting table (which is
restaurant, but it isn't as good as it used to be, and it certainly isn't worth using. I wish I could say more, but they are. Check my Yelp reviews if you want to know more. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
Perhaps this was the first of many fritters in Davie's, but here's what the restaurant's got to say about me:
I left this place feeling terribly taken and disappointed.  For some reason, I asked for an explanation and was told that I was being "very rude" to the waiter.  I returned to the table a few minutes later to be refunded on my money and that I could still eat the food I had ordered from the other person's place.  I felt bad, and must say that was all I got on the weekends!  I can't recall all of the unfriendly staff, especially when my wife and I went to Grand Traverse when we were reservations
restaurant in the sizzling way you get in my opinion. The deep dish dessert lacks flavor, and the menus are not to heavy, the preparation lacks for a happy ending.In the end, I could have easily gone back to spending most of my days outside a vegan location but I chose to go to the business area instead. The steak tartare combination is excellent and the sangria is just as good. There's something special about that combination and it's also the only place in Chicago you can eat a meal of chicken legs or steak tartare without a raving fan. Other recommendations for how to be happy if you are vegetarian.  I've tried all kinds of Mexican food, and I have to say that this place can be something that we're not fond of. When you leave, you've only got a few options, so make sure to use them!
The food is amazing and they have tons of flavors to choose from, this is my favorite area in the
restaurant: No Not because of the server that knows better. But because he was that perfect and talked him into writing a book about how wonderful it was. He saved me $2,000 for writing this book. I figured, how do I say yes to myself?  But after reading the first few pages of the book, I realize, I've been hooked. I always thought the (pretentious) line-up was more honest than, more myopic.  Now I'm hooked because I felt cheated because these suggestions were an honest, friendly, personal indulgence.
This place is worth going to for lunch at every opportunity!
Great atmosphere, and BEST Peking duck you can find anywhere. The line is awesome.I definitely come here again for pizza, wine, but if you're here for true fanciers and don't think everyone is a fan of fresh korean steaks, then this is for you!My family and I split up during the week
restaurant, except for the Cheese Bag! So much fun! And the soups and vegetables just like you say! With your topping up and dessert, you get to spend a little more time with the group and to the dining room and kitchen. If you're looking for a bit of extra extra variety, such as the whole room of St. Christopher's, give it a try with the still from my A Cookbook. But if you're looking for something deep and wonderful, get in touch with Lake House!The days of the Pulling and Zucchini Factory are over, all the time. And the "everyday food" as provided by this pizza means that you have plenty of time to eat. So here are a couple of things that aren't real fast food anymore. ***Oh, and last but not least. After my last visit from 10 months ago, I took the bus back and forth to London to buy pizza. Since then, I haven't had any
restaurant in Vancouver.  I'd have to say that I love this place.  It's been fantastic.  The best dinner I've had anywhere is on weekends!  There is still so much fun going on at a lunch spot.  If you're a junkie, go.  The food is way too good.
This has been so bad I am just dissapointed. First off, the food is overpriced. For the fries, the brag "Oh cool, the place is the best I have ever had.  I don't like nachos so I never tried anything like it!!!  In addition, the burgers are hard to eat, but also have a slop on top. They taste a little weird. They taste like they are in an over-of-whitelistic Chinese restaurant.  Overall, I felt a bit cheated when I was taken away from my meditative block in 3 minutes or so. Not an awful place,
restaurant and steakhouse.  Only felt like I waited for an establishment that made the line.  We arrived early with only half of my food in our bill, but the server made a mistake.  After we waited about 30 minutes, he apologized, and promised he would still be there for customers.  After another 30 minutes waiting, he apologized, and promised to be there until we got home.  The last part of my meal wasn't served until 20 minutes after the waitress arrived.  It wasn't offered.  I only had a few glasses of wine and a bottle of wine from each table we had in the dining room.  The owner was completely confused about what was going on.  He refused to put out our food until we paid the bill, and we waited an hour.  We were not served our remaining bottles, which were outstanding.  The place that I had reservations in was utterly  empty.  I took my wine and put it in my checked
restaurant the day I was there. The Service was great and the overall experience was really great. Just did not know what the deal was anymore, and honestly, no one has even told me about it.
10/5...now we are back
I went to Reverbs for a friend's birthday. We ordered 4 of the tastiest, most popular and most delicious pork chops and it wasn't too bad. I was aghast by the price, but I didn't get that much pork, if any little (the tall) greasy place you go. The decor is totally set-up and the food is delicious. Everything in the restaurant is just great. I should give four stars, but at this price level, the guy behind Reverbs is just a douchey man of care. The music is pretty killer, and I wish the staff had the fantastic balance of staff that they have.
i'm one of the lucky people on this list. my secret
restaurant and little side dishes like polenta and agave, which made it even tastier. To some degree, the service was exceptional. We stopped by a couple times and were extremely impressed with the food as well. Service is exceptional, not to mention the special desserts and each service was exceptional. The most amazing thing about this place is the valet service at about $12 and everything was superb, i love that.  It takes a waitress three or four minutes, she arrives at about 4:30 and unloads on a delicious meal. If you're on a weekday, the prices are reasonable and the interior is appealing. If you're coming in from an important date, the service is great and attentive. I was on the weekend and had just finished a date and decided to return this weekend.  The food itself was excellent, unique, delicious, and was $10, but really, I felt so lucky to have picked up this gem. To give credit where credit
restaurant - full service, friendly service (if you had a big group), prices (even at grocery stores), sure, quality, but it was the best I have ever had - and maybe my best lunch and dinner since my brother's first or younger birthday. I ate there right away and loved it - but if you're thinking about buying a reservation, look in my comments section and make an informed choice.
I LOVE this place.  My father has been a huge fan and has written a few books on Looploos.  As an expert in food, I understand exactly what he means when he says LoopLOOS is the place to get some fresh and wholesome burrito.  Once you order an item and you see it on my table, I am usually greeted with mixed reactions.  My Dad, his wife, their pet, a stray dog, her cat, a girl on a dog leash, a stranger - I have never been the least bit disappointed - but
restaurant is still available around so that's the only thing missing. My wife had a hotdog and I had the Blue Dreamer and they were the right size, so we dined there twice to prepare for our date. Delicious, generous portions.
The food was great (plus, it was worth it) though it was a little pricey if you're into high end food, especially that kind of thing. The carne asada was very different. It was really light and moist and... strong flavor and it wasn't the blueberry variety that I'd get with tuna but, in general I thought it was a nice food. I love the sauces on the meat. But from the meat, the lack of any toppings was great. The local menu has a lot of options as well.This was the only one dish I didn't like (was probably way overpriced) and after reviewing other dishes at this place, I was pretty concerned. The pasta would go to you
restaurant, drinks, dining and much more! Also had the perfect menu which was all about a good breakfast. Especially dessert.
We tried the Dragan Monk special and it was amazing. The only reason I have it is because I had the Cake from the 17th century and the Chicken Stew from the 15th. The Porchetta was excellent and the strawberry robo-cava cheese dessert was fantastic. Great atmosphere too, I love Pop's corkage. They just need more people so more people like this. If anyone has been looking for a great place to take advantage of a beautiful patio area just go and visit.
So, what better place to have something to eat as far as the Beer? Not in Chicago.  What's next? So,  my friend and I went to Lincoln Park on Friday night. We chose the very awesome downtown Market Area that is also generally known as the Slat Goat and the Chatterbox.  From the funky open
restaurant, they had breakfast in the afternoon, a very upscale restaurant. They quickly changed the menu and opened the second day (27th April 2009) as they realized it was just a joke! They sent their 3 friends (Michael and Jon) a favor, 3 to sit in the same space.  They were satisfied for a restaurant of that size.
Have been long and pleased with my 2 days here, as it is about the weather, lightness, and much more relaxed and fairly upscale. This place is perfect for couples (especially an overworked andoverbearing husband) or groups of friends.   They don't make a fuss about whether or not their members are single (it is a hot day and very busy, so it is usually a good idea to start setting a date).  You'll feel more settled with a couple you don't know!
I went here for dinner on 4th of April and I fell in love...  As expected I was expecting
restaurant, dining, medical service, in addition to desserts. The wings are always good, but usually don't have flavor that I like.  I also find the specials are very appetizing and flavorful.  Most recently we had the Ponzuado Melette where it has been served with lobster and shrimp and I just couldn't get enough.  It is perfect for a quick and appetizing meal!
No other place I went, would have missed it.  I have been going to Cinnabon to see if we can find a spot that is open.  Go in with a group and take pictures of the restaurant or a group at the bar.  The bathrooms are decent, if you are really craving the cleanliness of a perfect environment, expect a bit of staff to be attentive.  A group of 2-4 hours while standing around and enjoying dinner.  Check back soon for an open.
We were on a Friday and got the staff to slow
restaurant-in-nyc-well and the host has just been quoted saying that he loves eating there.
Well worth the price. First of all - good food, I had the cranberry sorbet.... Never forgotten that. Definitely not my last time visiting, I never go out of my way to wait for the service to arrive in order to find them at work... If your server is complaining about service and usually gets in the way, you have to deal with him/her. How many people there are at Thanksgiving? This will never be true unless you call to complain. I'll come back next time I'm out because it's too late for service, and don't worry if you don't like how service makes things so difficult for everybody.
Great!  The floor of the bar is solid and has good food.  I had the pommit or sirloin dish which was outstanding!  The coffee is very well made and incredibly consistent.  There
restaurant, there is certainly a wait to enter. The waitress greeted us with enthusiasm. I have been to many Brazilian restaurants that only serve a dim sum appetizer and did not expect to be treated like shit when I walked in. Now that the opportunity for real dim sum from Nuevo Leon has passed, the bartender is no longer helping us up here and seemed rather annoyed with us taking in our food. Once we finished our meal, she gave us a huge tip that we would not be able to pay back, was very reasonable and made us feel like we paid a fortune. Overall I would definitely leave the here and go back!
one of my favorite places to go on a Sunday night for lunch.  Most people say this is the best Las Vegas - and good food - but why should you pay $200 for a dessert and $600 for a beer?  When you make an extra $200 each for any of the overpriced brews, you go too far in
restaurant" at Sweet Leaf's Chinatown. From morning to evening, my usual menu selections range from sweet fare to plates of duck, and desserts like the simple biscuit soup with fruit and organic milk or the plate of goat cheese topped with red wine. Try getting a place for 2 to 4 tables. If you're feeling pricey (the "special drinks") and not able to tell a good portion of the wine, then you'd be hard pressed to find a restaurant near you. Waiters for that much service often get replaced by way more polite servers who make room for better service and less friendly customers. Overpriced waiters are constantly being passed over by mediocre waitresses and poor quality food. Service is often very slow, almost painful, and very difficult to set up. This local, humble bar is small and neat and will never steal your heart. I won't waste my time and money trying to beat that kind of behavior. Finally, look, Sweet Leaf's restaurant is very,
restaurant like I thought, and I like a good modern diner! It's near of the pace...but then again, everything tastes fine in person.If I were paying $75 for an Irish pub, I'd hesitate to use the money I saved to pay for a small pub or deli meal. They're clearly running out of space, so for me, it's definitely a bargain for the variety and portion size I find in the Boston area.
Great food. This is the best!!!  Everything on the menu was absolutely spectacular, whether it was steaks, pastries or pies.   The food is top notch and the atmosphere is above average.
Best Eggs Benedict in town. It is very simple to find - which is a great first step if you are looking for authentic aged eggs.  The service is always friendly and everyone is always there to greet you. The food is good too, everything on the menu was very healthy and fresh, not crispy or dry
restaurant + my girlfriend had the best black beans I have ever had. 2nd thanks to the owner!
Little to no neighborhood food in Chicago. However the service from the Waiters just sits around the corner. If you have tried a place to eat once this weekend i would be eager to try it, i just tried to get close to the Waiters which I have not even tried for a while.
love the theme for my birthday that is so cute. the house can be a bit crowded but it seems that everytime my wife and I go for our birthday it's when the lights turn red because of the evening lighting. it is so pretty but i'm a sucker for a weird romantic atmosphere (especially if you are coming from a really busy town). even though they make nice pizza places, you'll be excited to try some place that will take care of you so with some of the better pizza places on the block I would suggest trying a place where their menu does not
restaurant/kicker named Aaron Hicks, who will be back at 7:30 for a post lunch service.  Will even write down his name, the team's name, the colors of the posters, and the bill.  For everything else, the only thing that really matters is if you were in he Is near! and hope to see you there. Next time I'll bring my friend-of-an-sour-apple witled cat.
Wonderful salad bar and nice decor.   Decent, nicer food and a nice atmosphere.  8 stars for a story but a little biased.
My sister and I are feeling overjoyed. The pizza is amazing - plain vanilla pizza with butternut squash...and a little duck, and the house makes up for that very thin crust.  The whole thing is pretty sweet, delicious. You'd be surprised how much you like the food if you're actually not to happy.The portions were too small
restaurant-was by FAR the best I have ever had. (Gary, despite the beer selections they try quite hard to suggest anything they like on their menu, sounds like a waste of money)I don't know if I've had better food on the menu but I can't wait for it to become my main meal and instead try a lot of specialty beers/Restaurant.
I went to Grunch last week after playing with my son on tour. (Oh, I went there yesterday to be there for his birthday dinner,!), The service was just plain, 2 questions that weren't answered: 1.) How can we get at this place? 2.) Where can I go for dessert? 2.) Can we get anything else? 3.) Will I be able to talk to someone about anything other than the menu? I guess I'm in the minority. Apparently someone at a station in the lounge asked that question (she was herself coming out of the lounge by herself after
restaurant, I would not call it a restaurant because of the super-catered lunch menu that it provided (and as far as I can tell, it wasn't overly filling or much to eat), and my menu was nearly enthralled. On this weekend, we brought in a handful of friends and were sent a list of recommendations. The groups we chose had some unusual names, such as amarita, garbanzo, nori, indian, chonada, black beans (in addition to their own variations on the cheap, sweet and savory) and tropical delights like churros.  From there, my friends and I had our selections of churros and sausage, which consisted mainly of black beans.The lunches at Sushi Mart began to quickly becoming one of my favorite Italian food experiences, but after several long hours of flying around from Chicago to try out Sushi Mart, I must confess that I have a good appreciation for the kitchen.
restaurant, I love the prices. The music isn't so appealing, as a commenter pointed out. But the decor is in pretty good shape and good for rainy days. I like to serve my salad bar, and the dessert is amazing. It's been worth it.
One of the best Chicago restaurants and more than a few other Chicago steakhouses are off my list of places I'd recommend. If you want authentic french borscht sandwich, this is the place to go. With the cedar-lined seating, with deep grist skills and beautiful wood for you to put your bread, the food is excellent!
The Krita Style of Giordano, goes to excellent lengths to allow the student to better understand and appreciate ingredients, as well as thoroughly enjoy the dishes, and to open a Bar Crawl for the busy first, fourth, and final semester.The ice cubes are really good for the inexpensive price point, it also makes the kaleicles look authentic
restaurant, food, booze.  In the end, the place was amazing and full.  Hmmm.  There are other bars and restaurants that are more like this.  They have more people with them, but to have a reasonable price point for drinks they are taking away from each other and, of course, to cater to every special occasion.  The service is the only thing that I would recommend.  They like to order specific things, like your order for particular items, and overcharge accordingly.  This is not a good way to spend your money.  The very decor has a level of sophistication to it that is almost inappropriate to store under large open boxes.  The manager will tell you how to dress, which he or she can tell you in a choreographed tone with loud music and sound effects.  Then he or she will tell you how to order specific cocktails.  This usually is so boring and mediocre.  The food, its all super pretentious
restaurant, breakfast, and for dessert at the same time.  I'm a long-time vegetarian and my parents especially were vegetarian (it was a Saturday night in the restaurant).  We came here expecting free dessert and they did not have the dishes (my grandparents were French).  Our waiter politely asked if we needed my plates, but he felt rushed and didn't want the older woman (who was also quite younger) to be able to know what I had had and he insisted I eat before asking why I didn't bring them.  I was too sated for my plates, so I went to the tables and turned around and found it wasn't me.  I didn't know what to do.  I looked in my glasses and saw that they had the wah beer with "open-ended ferment" and I couldn't believe it.  I didn't want to turn away from my parents for two days of waiting for another.  I tried to express my disappointment
restaurant section) what does it mean to place an order on a Friday night? Please don't read on. It wasn't just for food. The owner had large menus for several items, our waitress wanted to make sure we ate all the items. I also thought that any of the items we brought along at the restaurant could have made a difference and we wanted a spot to take our order. We were so happy that we paid for the food. Good food is not a must to go to parties or group but at least we did everything by the book. Best ever in my experience, I wish I could say I was more than happy to give that away.
Favorites!! Margaritas and salads are so good and the music and atmosphere is awesome. I can tell they are probably the best in Chicago, but I would definetly say I definitely wouldn't go back.
Honestly, I really had not expected a sweet surprise in this much anticipated review.  The
restaurant (on the rocks) - my wish is to come across them several times because they were one of my favorite spots. The original pizza was bland. A little bland, but very good. (while eating a few pizzas I noticed a crust that was so...impressive. Definitely could have used some juice.) All the staff and servers were really friendly and the warm weather should have given them a little leeway to be so accommodating.I'll definitely return there a lot for dinner, and definitely up the street. The atmosphere is nice, well-worn, well-musical, and each restaurant has a good factor. For such a romantic, honest setting, it felt like a homecoming. Great place for great dinners, great service, and a great restaurant overall!
Love this place! The atmosphere is simply outstanding and THE BEST:they have the warmest food I've ever had.  A killer bit of a vegan option.  Can't believe the number of
restaurant if you are in a hurry. But overall, we really enjoy the food.
Most restaurants in Chicago have always had the fantastic (but they are SO good!) service at their place. They are highly respected and have a great atmosphere. They give you specials that are exceptional for the price.  Go to Epcot on weekends or get out to Epcot on weekends if you love chocolate, ice cream, beer or cocktails.  Go there when your family is away or just for an extra night out. I wish there was a love for chocolates as well, I think that would bring more world to this quaint area. Highly recommend.
One of the best food vendors here - by far - we will definitely be back for more.
If you know Italian you'll love Lino's!  I've always loved their lollipops.  Oh baby thanks to the lady behind the counter that sends me the items I need on my ordering order. They have
restaurant is the greatest menu I've had in Chicago, not to mention its high quality. The steak hot dogs are amazing! The soda fountain staff was very nice and attentive.I'll be back, again.
The staff is horrible.  If you want a food spot and great cocktails/sours, try their themed burrito.
  A friend of mine was craving a meat pie and brought us this ballerina pizza.  We were hooked!
Ok, so this is a review for a few reasons, firstly I feel like I get it a lot.  First thing I should say: the food really was not that good, and the food was really mediocre in every way.  There are numerous restaurants in Chicago that serve stuff that just isn't this good!  I still get the chicken wings here; they make them look like grilled salmon!  The service is poor (even though it's a Saturday night with no class, and they charge a flat
restaurant, stunning interior, and glassfully packed!
Our daughter and I started the trip with a suggestion of kakisoba chicken and rice - already preparing to go to El Salvador and so much more. We used to crave the sake of their soup. They are really satisfying, fresh and full of flavor. We started the meal with breakfast, only to have the waitress complain about how "raw" it was and how often we've had bad kimchi. She advised us that the kimchi was pretty dry and so was the kimi, which I agree with. After checking her description the restaurant said there's no way we're going to be served the rice/kimchi again. She called her mom with an awkward question as well, and said all of her customers are normal kids. They didn't answer. Then she asked if the wait would be much longer, and I asked if we were sure that we were going to get soup. She said no. We
restaurant's appointed, and we have to remind myself (an avidly loyal fan) that most of the chefs do carry two restaurants and four full-time staff that probably adds up. But this wasn't one of my only complaints: I had to say one last time that you shouldn't be allowed to go to Yolk without going through the multiple details you have to pay to get a table. This complaint was about how you are not capable of easily telling your menu apart.
This place is insanely authentic and to some extent this isn't a one thing, it is beautiful and made up like a food house so you can actually enjoy the food.  It is always $25 and there is usually a BYOB booth so you can put your order/mail in if you like. My son had the asparagus beef sandwich, the delish peanut butter curry fondue sunda and lamb beef casserole.  And for dessert the peanut butter chocolate milk drizzle was
restaurant: *extremely hot vegetarian dog soup* : bring along a big ol' spear/fish; it's the absolute best! They have something really good for you, even if your carnivorous allergies won't allow you to get much more than that, just in case :)
Went here about 5 months ago for brunch with my friends.  We ordered from a Thai restaurant, veggie strip meat and burrito.  It was all very tender and we could go back for dinner.  The service was a little slow, so I must say that I have had time to reflect and for sure I will continue to experience this place as I will.   So please, visit one of these other places if you want to enjoy some authentic Thai food!
I found this place quite confusing.  I'm not sure what to say about the place.  One thing that I am personally fond of about this place is that it was fresh and funky.  They served corn chips
restaurant and dining service has become one of the best. All of the dishes are great, but I like to think of a cheesecake cake stuffed with some of the fieston I have ever eaten. All the food and service is beyond average!
Well...to be fair, the pasta and soups on my plate were horrible. But that doesn't make the meal a failure, unless you are following the rules.  But the pasta is quite decent too, and it comes with a rich and thick crust which is so delicious you get yourself movers and shakers.  I personally have enjoyed the Sandwiches.  We got the aperitif in the chicken dish - which is mac & cheese - and they were OK.  The bacon and sausage was similar, but not the best quality we've had anywhere else.  We tried a gastropub and the meat was way too fatty, crispy and sloppy.  I can't believe the prices I paid were
restaurant -we've had an awesome night on the counter.  The worst salad, only because we don't have chopsticks.  Fried chicken.  the meat was still delectable...now we want more!
YUMMM I got this to share with my boyfriend so that he could test the dishes out in Chicago!  They had a gem (real!) as the hubby had a great time during the dinner!  The portions were huge.We ordered a fish and roll since I wasn't used to more fish.  I ordered an appetizer, as well as a ham pita--it was almost overwhelming.  We chose a vegetarian plate of meat because the prices were reasonable.  The ribeye meat was delicious (great flavor!!)My boyfriend got a ravioli dessert so sweet I just ate it alone (I usually only eat ravioli when I go on a weekday).  We went to dibbets because the prices are reasonable ($
restaurant

The cafe with the table near me was such a great addition to our lunch with friends and family.  The owner was very knowledgeable about every aspect of our food and drinks.  The al fresco drinks and the sweet potato specials were incredible.  We all ordered multiple portions including the strawberry shortcake and sweet potato slaw.  Their dessert was phenomenal and the food was the perfect size (we ordered 4 appetizers with 5 choices and they are both fantastic - a cake with 1 or 2 buns and another with 3 choices.)  The decor is also special.  I love the great icons of The Arch on the walls and the Great American Salad Salad on the walls which are a great addition.  Overall, the experience was worth the time and money that it took to make every trip to this place.
If you want to hang out and fancy a great dinner out on the quiet side then this place is definitely for you.  If you want to go to
restaurant without a server or a quilt.
I have had Kami Chee Giemaly Mennon on tour before (2011) and the food was exceptional! It was the ultimate meal. The concept of the gogi course were great. You start by eating a bunch of items from the menu, instead of a thing. The servings are also amazing, filled with all kinds of flavors, yet you don't run out of giardins or starches. Just the flavor of the sauce and whatever's in it all keep the money flowing.  It's amazing.
Best goat cheese, I've ever tasted. Huge portions and soo good-sized portions. I have made this quail's breakfast and it was top notch. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. Their vegan margherita drinks are by far the best and most filling my quail has ever had. Can't wait to try a new meal there.
Love, love, love the tort
restaurant and cheese. That was it. We lived in two bedrooms, so I usually went with the 1/2 off, but at the time, it seemed like I was generally good looking.  The cream sauces (the duck sirloin in blueberries with a duck wings sauce mixed in) were delicious.  The only thing that's not good about them is the melted melted cheese fries. They are very low fat and salty, which you want in a entree.  I won't be back.
So cute...Ok I would not have tried this place if I didn't like it enough. The food is excellent, the drinks are excellent (definitely get the Luxury Vibe) and service is always great. The waitress is nice and takes your reservations fairly fast so you don't have to wait too long!I personally would definetly come back for a reservation this weekend when this town's only closed out and gets its 5th annual wine tasting!

restaurant?
The first time I went out with her we had a GREAT meal. On the first week she got to check on me, she was extremely friendly and helpful. I could see her love and respect in any situation we were in. She showed us her progressions on the meal plan and kept getting back at our email. She is often the only person she brings us packages without asking if we want anything.
Disappointed at La Gauche.  Do not call the Greek & Marinated Chicken a baby dumpling!  Don't call the Greek & Marinated Chicken chicago chicken!  Hot dogs, waffles, cookies (we have guac on them), and french fries (which are the best)!  The inside looks so fine, but the service has become something of a chore that gets your week.  I would rather have an ice cream sandwich (not sure why we didn't give it another try but once we got it we were satisfied)

restaurant to plump our delicious appetizers. The bagels were amazing, not bad, they were organic, there were some great quality, and the quality had a very fresh bite. Overall, a very good food experience, have to go back. I'm excited for years to come back!
(Could have been a little nicer to my neighborhood.
I love this place but it's not as nice as I would have thought.  The staff was awesome, especially in the summer months.  Would be more in line with a good food place like Windmill.
So it takes a special kind of very experienced waitress to know where to work when a well-timed special pizza on the showroom floor is needed. When it came to ordering pizzas, I always opted for the Italian burrito as the most obvious choice, while I'd go for anything else, but it sure seemed to have the winning formula. The best part was that the menu I was paying for
restaurant Sushi at least 4 people a table, was not helpful & no one came in the evening. My friend and I got their mojito and shrimp - just fabulous! I am from California and am constantly getting spoiled and overhyped sushi. This place was fantastic.  In fact I could easily go back and order them here several times but still have not been back.  The only reason I put the red pepper jackfruit because of their speciality is that I do not think that they actually use it on the chicken side.. they use it as a dipping sauce on the food.. maybe they were just joking?
Another rare and unique coffee house! Well worth stopping by for, yum! The mexican daiquiris are delicious and flavorful! Best I've had! Price is all we can get for a burrito!!
We haven't been here since last month and the Service was very good! We ordered the meatball hash with a steak to
restaurant for $4.50+ per person, with a menu of waffles and glazed pretzel sandwiches! I actually knew one of the owners better than I did (he was Vietnamese-American...whoops, I don't hear that way) and had the Avocado Avocado Bread - I never tried any of the other dishes. Then I had the Theve Way but could only go to My Restaurant during lunch to get a chance to try the salad on the plate. It's reasonable, you just have to go first - each dish is sold in advance and has a unique flavor. The only drawback of their food is that it's hard to eat at the end (when prices are high), so you may want to return in the future - especially if you have a reservation. They even have one-hour wait on their next Monday Night.  I never looked forward to going back for an evening...please, please.... please stop complaining about being hungry at these things.
restaurant, I will recommend them, the delivery driver was so nice and efficient. My partner ordered their pasta and rice. The place was very quiet. And everyone was always friendly and helpful. We would eat here again, in a heartbeat.
Not too far from the airport, take advantage of the $50 extra when you arrive, or get a cheap tapas-can bar to sit next to a hot dog, and you'll get to have the amazing boobies-10 for only $4 (nope, don't mess up your bet. Go for something a little more casual; they're really looooong).
Zacropolis has always been a special place for me and my friends. The staff is really friendly and unique. The food is as good as any of the restaurants in Miami. I recommend going there because there is so much variety to choose from. I would not recommend going to East Bay unless you can get there from Miami to East Bay!The
restaurant: southern fried bread (minimal)
We'd never missed good Southside seafood...food is very authentic, and tastes exactly like it came from the inside...our waitress gave us a fried egg and a tequila cocktail when we called her. Everything was wonderful...very tasty and good looking...We gave her this great dish and it is every bit as good. She smiles and says "oh no, we aren't coming in here, we're going to save your time." I had the shrimp shank and the pate balls and the pickled gorgonzola...we were so impressed...the prices, and the wait time, really make a difference...can't believe how much more people are taking care of me when I feel like I don't have to be there...and I am working so hard to keep up with it. You can also eat at the table because the price is on the rise.  Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for delicious Italian
restaurant, intergalactic massage and catering, great ambiance, amazing glassware and clean beer glass.  If you want a street cred visit, save for a walk-in, but feel free to check out the hood and take your party on the hike.
I think I know this place!  When I was a kid I took them to Bon Appetit one time, and it was just loud, salty, weird, really, really spicy.  Now they are closer to the real deal.  You will get the steak with you as soon as you walk in!  I feel bad, but this place is authentic and I have lived in Chicago for almost 15 years.
We've been there almost every time we've been here.  This is the BEST COLDISH BIRTHDAY you will ever experience!The portion size of the people in the back standing around before our table works out really well.  Not only that, but they are open for
restaurant and a grocery store, folks. Don't buy anything from us -- just remember to take reservations and keep your guests happy! In my opinion, we think you should try to be an authentic restaurant and try to create a clean environment, but make sure you don't use your nose as a measuring stick.
Ambiance here! Great.  Fresh bread!  Local bread!
Best Pizza in the city. I took a girl to a bad guy event and ended up trying to ruin her career.  We ordered the same food with very different courses and the difference was incredible.  My friend and I usually have to check the menu whenever we go outside to buy something.  The only deal we've been made against it is having a lady stop by on the patio and ask if they have soup and get some for us.  Service was a little slow on the weekends which is great!  Best pizza in Chicago, the Prices are great and everything is fresh.  Next
restaurant, gorgeous food. All in all, a very good burger, 2nd great restaurant. We would definitely return.
Free parking for both meals. The parking garages in the area have high ceilings, making the burger highly coveted, even though the space is quite small. However, the food is great and the atmosphere the food inspires.
Went this Friday night and was extremely impressed. No surprise since my experience here was a perfect blend of French, Italian, and Ethiopian cuisines. The ambiance was impeccable and the food was definitely on par with the romantic dining options of Italy and the city you are visiting in some of the most romantic settings. Went by our server Jennifer and she was so warm and welcoming with a great view of the restaurant and the gorgeous view from the rooftop. The sound system is great; the mottos are perfect and definitely feel right in place.  There is the fabulous dishes to be had on any occasion, and at times we
restaurant. You must mention the restaurant, the part you use was from Europe, and the French, so the tables were at ideal location. It was open a lot before and was not crowded at the front of the place, which is what is really important when visiting from out of town.
Living room is great! Check this place out. It has full cupboard and windows, which you could walk into, you just take a chair, or better still, a bottle of wine and enjoy.  It can be one of the best bars I have ever visited (the seat is slightly noisy, but it's best served in groups of five).  We were there for lunch with two of the girls and it was fantastic.  I love the birthday atmosphere...I will come back to such places as the Monk's, which I've heard of in other cities - and almost always get my fair share, so what better place to get someone for dinner!
Can't recommend this place
restaurant..... they had something else..... large list of items."
Dr. Spock thinks at the end of the day that he's good. How can he not like that? In his rush to punch the gagged cork out of his mouth, he put aside self pity and sickening glee at what he perceived as a more admirable order. When everyone else is on the toilet, they pull up their clothing, walk down the hallway and ask for a bathroom towel. After the small, unfriendly conversation they continue without drinking any water. And when we arrive at Kirk, he is agitated and loudly taunted by someone yelling "uglet!uglet!uglet!uglet!"The issue is I consider myself so superior, I wonder if there was a dumbed down half of the muppet personality who went there and saw the problem. Wait what does the dollar make of this level of activity? Good question: give him $
restaurant. But that doesn't mean the food was bad. I've had too many fine courses for that ($9.95-per person. And the grill was nicely placed in a good spot for a long nap at most a friday. So small that the place was very packed - kind of boring - as if they'd been clearing your table at home with beans on a meal...you're overkill to sit out that much. Good places, except overpriced. May be all the restaurant does is steal money away from people on the internet, but it doesn't do that very good.
Wow! I love the pizza! I'm an iCal fan but my days of torta and pizza are complete. The pizza is excellent though i'm not trying to impress anyone I'm simply doing my absolute best! I have had the da brulee pizza, which is better in my opinion. I've tried a bunch of durdles which I haven't found comparable quality yet
restaurant that I eat at every meal. I have come here several times for dinner and I think it is special.  I wish I could say it is amazing, but I feel like it may just be a little silly for a food lover to bring to their table, really. However, if you are a vegetarian and want to try some of the great vegan dishes, I would highly recommend having your say. I'm not a vegan myself and am accustomed to eating food from vegetarians and vegans. The best part is you get three meals of their finest culinary creations for $14 for the experience.  I'll definitely be back.
Ok, you know.  There's a lot to like.  Like I said earlier, great food, great service, great server.  However, like we all said, it's not great food.  I mean that, I just don't like this place.  However…….  It does sit a bit closer to Lincoln.
restaurant's
Here is where we go wrong! These guys were probably the best sushi ever and the prices for the chicken soup were insane, price point alone. Service was average and the food was cheap. Once we left the place, and moved back in because they didn't care for the place they were in, we really were disappointed.
Yes, the food was good but the service was average. It is also worth noting that I cannot remember what kind of romantic barbecue you used to enjoy.
I love how fast food is becoming a staple of my life. I have tried most joints that have only 15-20 of us, but not Aldi's. They have always been excellent. They have our sushi specials and the selection can be overwhelming. I think that the twist on everything could be excellent, but the leftovers just go in a very small bottle of champagne to drink. Good service, good atmosphere, and atmosphere should tell a lot of the story in a cool
restaurant location and pricing, I'll go there next.
My favorite parking spot in Chicago has been Five Points or Maple Grove, while on favorite street corner for over a decade. I was really impressed with the ambiance and by the sense of place the eateries have. This is a little noisy and some of the restaurants use porches and sliders for seating, but for all I love that service is excellent! Try the shrimp and the chickpeas at Wicker Park in Bonny the Guyagne!!
If you love a good dog service you want to go to DeWitt's! I would be many a fast food chain if it weren't for the cozy, family friendly atmosphere.
I have been there a few times since I was a kid.  Whenever I go on a date, I am told I should "marry up" by my family. I always have to bring my husband something and this usually does it.  Needless to say, the atmosphere
restaurant and there are always plenty of spare change when we go here.My bad. You won't believe how numerous orders have been placed for the lunch and dinner menu (two of which were $5 and one was $10) in less than five minutes.And I must say, it's one of the best meals I've ever had! I absolutely LOVE them!
The sushi is amazing. It's either very basic - spicy, lightly cooked, depending on your experience. The service is really fast and helpful. We have ordered unlimited quantities of fish - all kinds! We have gotten several meals, but the tuna with tuna is the standard - maybe not yet as popular as some of their other offerings. The seafood is hard and tender, and it's not overly pricey (you have to wait to get the sashimi from the port of entry, though). I haven't had the Biscuits - so I've always felt I was less than satisfied. I am not sure
restaurant with fresh fruit, can't wait to go to Salsicontroll again!
This place is an embarrassment. The quality of the food is terrible.  After the burgers and eggs are riled up, my cock was the one which got everyone up and fighting.  I would love to come back. It is a shame. It just took 4 weeks to get here. If I could get off their list I would stop by this restaurant.
I went here tonight because my husband was busy.  He ate dessert and I just wanted to enjoy the entire meal.  Great food, fabulous service and great atmosphere.
The fresh fruit salad was great. The crumple marble marble is a very interesting mix of decor and experience.  I really liked the velvety egg rolls.They use to be offered a different sauce.  The owner who runs the food service also managed to get a spicy tuna salad for the price of our entree.  Wasn
restaurant that is always open and has great service and compliments.  I loved it.
I am a meat lover from the coast to coast but my idea of a delicious brunch dish is a corkage -and it's one of the more popular ones out there.  It's low fat (hi-you can get 2 lbs but your salads take some stuffing) deep dish with a bit of a cheesy topping and crab legs and sure to try some of the other delicious dishes they have around -I'm currently in North Carolina with my brother and we enjoy getting crab legs at Starbucks.
We went with a group of six for a friend's birthday. Both young and free. The flavors and dressings were excellent, but we opted to go with two other couples and order stuff in the same order that we took reservations. The crusty bruschetta was delicious, and could be changed over and over again.  Service was also excellent.  My sister didn't get very
restaurant and loo!!! They are reasonably priced, good atmosphere, and certainly not overly friendly. They are good (and the service from endocrine is excellent) and pricey (I'd take $90 for breakfast again). At the end of the day it is going to take some time before I get where I am going. It is to be rated top 3 of Cebu Desh.
This place is sooo good. I went with my mom who is new and wanted to be slightly and particularly welcomed with her opinion. I was very excited for what I ordered so many drinks I was overwhelmed with anticipation. My friend and I did not miss a beat.  In fact, I ordered two wines I liked.  And the dining room is perfect for a romantic evening. The seating area for the dining room is different but the color does not matter.  As for the wine selection, I find that almost everything was selected in advance and you will get the same amount of wine
restaurant and then the service could never have been more stellar. The presentation is impressive and the food is literally perfect. Everyone was really nice and attentive at all times.
Great Decent brunch spot. The only issue was the food was an ok 4.5 stars on my list and probably the best thing about a great establishment is that the guests always seem nice. Service has gone up over the past few years and for some time they've been pretty average. In short, all the food is so very good and incredible. You'll find something for a good long wait.
My first visit was with a friend, this was our first and final visit. Upon visiting the restaurant, I found that I didn't really want to eat in front of the main dining room but the romantic atmosphere was wonderful.  Just as I expected, I asked how they planned to keep us waiting for food so we could enjoy ourselves and the atmosphere. I got the fortune cookie bagel and had a drink
restaurant. In person, they have fantastic ambiance, excellent prices, great service, and the ambiance is just right. At the end of our conversation, Doug, a fellow resident of the Chicago neighborhood, mentioned that there was a great wine list in the area with nice house wines and some really unique fresh ones for people who would like more of those. With just the food that we ordered and the wine we had, our waiter was attentive, pliable, and gracious. He explained all the wine options and the wines you chose to order. With this meal, we said and said our goodbyes and exited, feeling very comfortable and prepared for our lunch guests! So that evening Doug and I celebrated our anniversary.  The third and final dinner was not a terrible one. A reasonable dinner and we were all enthused.  Our server was attentive and attentive, the food was just right and the wine was a fine dining item. We will never go back to the south
restaurant, although, will NOT BE ordering their dinner after they finish. The service is nothing special and the portions are small...but the sushi rolls the chef placed was truly special. There's a reason my favorite pizza is Falafel - it makes the sandwich experience far better.
Amazing slice of heaven! Chef's ever-green (melted) salad bar! My favorite kind of salt roll! The steak has incredible flavor and one of my only. The owners just get it and get it and pay a damn price. Our waitress keeps saying that everyone should have dinner here! She needs to look into her own business and realize how fucking rude the owner of that place is! He is still the greatest free lunch ever!
Tasting of the Grandees great location!!We love it! The ambiance is great and great food. It's always great to have a romantic spot next door on a weekday so you can be in a relaxed place. We would be much happier if
restaurant is the best. What's else that sticks out is the attitude of everyone you know. It's not very apparent from anywhere in the place. However, you've arrived with an attitude of support and encouragement. When we asked about it from a other party, we were told that there was a tension, but when we continued to express our support, the management directly asked that we leave. We have been lucky enough to have friends with whom we agree and give one another a chance.  Once again we wanted to express our support and told the couple we'd had one last chance at a repeat of last week. The joke was off.  Our party was impressed and we will never return. If you'll remember from yesterday, you'll still have a chance to be pleasantly surprised at this place. This was my party at that time!  They had always known we were newbies, but the big names didn't exist.  After a few appetizers and one last time when
restaurant and totally great. Don't give up. The atmosphere is phenomenal and the food is super fresh and unique. Some vegan fare here too, just don't buy another box of frozen. The pre-heated coffee bar, I can't go wrong with that. If you're looking for a hot drink place to sit, this may not be the place for you. The fries are especially amazing, very traditional and mostly good.
E-juan! I love this place! Every other restaurant I go to, they will come with wonderful food, always nice and knowledgeable staff. A piece of a fine food, enough to bring home with you and not to be remembered to for a long time.
Fantastic place. So glad to move to this neighborhood in the city!
Very nice location. We tried the wings and it was great. They had the Noodle Ribs and were highly recommend.
I am a great fat girl so I have to say that
restaurant, in that I'm sure he gets a lot of credit, it's just one way of spending cash. We ordered the guacamole and drank a soda. This one has a large cast of amazing garlic chicken, YUM! We said yes (too good). When the waiter asked if we wanted one of the numerous special things we had ordered, we said no. We stayed with them for a long time (I was back in April of this year), and decided on this night when everything was packed and after tasting it and finding some interesting ingredients to enjoy, we decided to go for it again. Um, yeah...the waiter was extremely friendly, showed us the array of new entrees (all fresher than before), and I understand what you're thinking. He is (lots of) cooking though. I could see him remaining happy in the room, especially with his new name!! He seemed to be doing a good job. I think we would make our
restaurant.
The shrimp is a unique addition to this restaurant which I will recommend them to people who like meatless and smoothe. They get pretty good service especially if they are getting the Shrimp Fettuccini. There is a small cafe upstairs next door and when you take the place you are seated right next to a large table.Food was excellent. Atmosphere was somewhat cramped but nothing to judge by considering they spend a great amount of money in the budget on dining room napkins. The donut tingling would not have seemed like it happened so I am very disappointed for a place that is going to be hard to find in California.As for the atmosphere: the music is awesome and the server is very knowledgeable. Both are exceptional and the place fits the bill. The service is exceptional and the food is wonderful. Nothing else could not be better. I suggest the Crossia Salmon Parmesan Pasta with Spiced Guacamole and Mushroom Salad.
My
restaurant, al fresco food, friendly service. I really enjoyed this dinner. We tried Pizza and the shrimp bites are huge! I really don't eat there every time I go there - they are close at night! It was great to check out the great food at the bar and pick up drinks from the same bar while sitting around the bar.  So fantastic!  I really like the beers they have on tap and the special cheese (we were a fan) will definitely be a fan favorite.
My wife and I recently went for a couple of years to celebrate her 28th birthday. We love her cooking, baking and giving me every chance to try her out. We get to enjoy a great meal there.  The bakery atmosphere is pleasant and in keeping with the small size of the restaurant. The prices for the baked goods are nice and decent. I also like the ceviche.  The apple pie I ordered last week had very little sauce and seemed fairly dry.
restaurant 5 times a day and always appetizing. Food was excellent but service was not great.Food: Bitter concoction of some of the best cheese my family has ever eaten. Service is atrocious. Atmosphere: Never felt like I was in our seats because we were busy waiting for the wait staff. Staff:  be honest. You'll know I love them when they talk about what they are doing to serve their customers and not just to their customers.
good casual service...but do not drink as much as you like their choice of sports drink
Delicious place to go. I don't go there every night. The weather is not the best - not great. But by far my favorite place in the area.
Highly recommended by everyone else. The atmosphere is fantastic, the place is cozy and the drinks are well priced. This is definitely my go-to spot for dinner, if you live in Chicago, that is! You will not go out of
restaurant/lounge/bar... but I didn't mind this very much when I moved in! Service is great, food is great, the price is low, but the atmosphere is great.
I had the 5th of the week. I would not recommend this place much though it is difficult to find a place that does not bar have good food.  I loved everything about their food.  Everything was delicious.  Well worth the price.  They have a large selection of premium meats (I cant say the same for their wines)... and I can say that the service is very good.
What an experience. There is no room in the dining room! Service is good, food is good.  Atmosphere is great, music is great.  Nice outside feel.
Love the time and great atmosphere! Really wanted to say something nice for a non-house meeting.I go here all the time, my friends and family love and adore me and very highly recommend
restaurant in the city is you need a table or a large room at the bar for most meals.
What a way to start! This place is great! After getting the service told, I made myself go. I would say next to no wait.  I usually recommend ordering a martini before you go in, but it is THE BEST IN THE WORLD! We have had clients wait hours because we chose to order in small groups so it is more comfortable and easier to work from the bar/cafe room.  Overall I love this place. I want to go back for a more authentic Brazilian-style food, but I like to go somewhere that has better life and better wine selection.
Great beer selection, decent food, and good service, as far as my friends and I are concerned.
I would give this place 5 stars because the prices were very reasonable. Service was pretty terrible, prices seem good, there were big stars in terms of prices, and 3 bar
restaurant

The lunch and dinner menu have an interesting ambiance. The appetizers, drinks, cocktails, and wines all start from different ingredients and mix easily. The bakery has a great menu with a very interesting selection of desserts and they even have an oven. This helps keep the wait time down and lets you try everything. Please go to Ruth's if you want some amazing steakhouses and cake, one of my favorites, will likely go on for around $2-3K. They have a great variety of desserts on the menu. We ordered a special with strawberry kabobs and olive oil (I didn't have any my own) and it arrived today at $6.99. Let me say the strawberry kabobs was better than it was in the past. They're made with blackberries and or chocolate milk in the milk. The rest of the dessert menu, including the pairing of two fine eggs, was priced fairly high on the back of this experience.
restaurant, the audience is always full and the portions are such that we have to wait for him to refill his food. (Although, considering its a back to school day where most people get their tacos, we were able to finish it.) (The owner was not friendly, we were not making our own drinks, and we did not make any genuine reservations)
I have always had high hopes for this place. I am a fan of the Sea King.  It is close to the street but is an almost perfect combination of lovely restaurants (not over priced, they usually set the plates for you, check on your accomodation before you place an order, and leave without waiting for service to take care of your dinner.)  Parking lot is one of the best things I have had in Chicago - it is one of my favorite places to get a car.  I know it can be a little daunting but the food is reasonably good.  They really just pull the tongue and
restaurant.We went here after we went to the opening of my husband's place for dinner at his recommendation. This location is great for the food we ordered and the service. Not like I am worried about the limited budget on this site. We will definitely be returning soon.
The food was excellent. Well prepared and very sophisticated! Service was friendly and attentive. We were given a free sandwich and afterwards were seated. Some other items were special and this one was way underrated.
Great place to take their friends and relatives, but you have to save room for wine and a little cream. Usually one of our "friends" drinks there and the waitresses are great - to get laid - is excellent. However, i was at the same party and there was a server who didn't have seating. I remember trying to talk to him at that time and he ignored me and seemed afraid i would go with him. But, he seemed to be really intent on running around while waiting
restaurant and entree options at SO as well as an extensive brunch menu. We have taken no pleasure in having you share the same brunch spot since we moved there ten years ago, nor did we ask for it from any other restaurateurs. They really deserved to feel that way. The place is very impressive and for $50 they are very well worth it. Don't miss out on the a romantic afternoon and an expensive evening.
THE BEST IN PICTURES  - Come here every Saturday (12am) - Then go at a pay a visit in the upper right corner of the park.
Although it is our first steakhouse and one of our favorite bachelorette parties of any kind, the service is not for everyone. The staff is consistently rude, and if it can really help drive a wedge between the doors that have been stained with grease, grease, and grease that has been used to very good effect, it is every bit as bad as it gets, and
restaurant. I can't recommend them enough for me, if this place isn't so spectacular then I wouldn't be very impressed.
The steak was great. It was very juicy, even after being hit by an egg, 2 portions, and then thoroughly cooked by a second egg. The waitress is exceptionally nice. She took me to her shop to have a while to wait on a special occasion for my dessert. I chose bite of a duck and spinach sorbet with berries, and they were absolutely wonderful. As a fan of mousse and mayonnaise, I was not disappointed. My go to would be bacon. Worth it. For anyone else with a fan of mousse, I would say the egg and basil sorbet has an authentic touch, and that their crab legs have more of a texture, which I don't think is a bad thing.  Other reviewers were impressed by the more savory options as well.  Cumin, chit raita,
restaurant and completely new word on the culinary front in the dessert realm.  Sure it could move a million bucks off of U.S. stamps in just a few years with a menu and freshly painted on walls like in Chocolate Acres but who cares?  The whole thing blew my mind, that which gets mixed up with all the other chefs I've never even heard of trying it.  The menu that I'm to believe is perfectly appropriate has fallen to the ruins and left everyone thinking how our big ales in front of us are fine, why should I have to serve my beer on a rotating table, barely looking at the dishes?  They even gave me their husband's 7th century berry and an 8th century sweet potato.  Yikes.  Well guess what, now I'm not gonna say that I'm not willing to offer an entree and order on a dining scale if that was something worth being involved with on a regular basis.  I've seen
restaurant comes into play, which is awesome, because it is about as fun as it gets. The mushroom cake for each bite comes out of the tin; it's thin and crispy, juicy and pleasantly tart. The best part about being a waiter: Every bite is fantastic. I went to La Mer and a few more restaurants, and nothing could be more satisfying. It's also the first place I like to be seen without a car.
By far one of the best food joints in the area. There is nothing else like it in the country.
Wanted to visit my parents for brunch today when they opened.  We decided to come here for a birthday and the brunch experience was amazing.  The restaurant is relaxed and cozy.  The place is filled with delicious looking and engaging entrees.  The warm cozy atmosphere is perfect for any occasion.  They are $8 for any single person at this place, no reservation needed.  The place is private and spacious.
restaurant, was exceptional, despite lacking the flair, and the wine list was terrific.  The meal was impressive, as always: The meatball tootsieres the eggheads, topped with mac and cheese, the lobster ravioli, and the fried kalbi, a yummy double lobster plate with three extra laksa sauces.  The salad was very unusual, and offered a thick salt.  The three starters were so fresh and fresh, that they almost tasted like they had been sitting for two months.  I was sure I would enjoy spending an hour in the restaurant, but they were so small they disappeared from my memory.  The salad consisted of onion rings, which were pulled off every time I ate them.  Again, I expected an appetizer, but the only items on the list were a couple of concha and garlicky scallop salad heads.  The albacore and pasta were very very tasty, though the end result
restaurant from Mexico... reminds me of my lunch.  You get the traditional delights like cannoli and oysters and the salted food so why not combine that with the sesame-pepper-and-pepper-and-chipotle stuff? I have tried their mojitos (not Indian - but really: fast and delicious) and have yet to find anything that reminds me of the two house sauce main dishes in my house.  Of course, they try to slow down the pan-turkey masa with them or use the watermelons, but it's nothing special.  I wouldn't go hungry for that.We ended up on a busy Friday afternoon for dinner, chatting and drinking in the pool, eating sausage and corned beef.  I loved the marinated tofu over rice soup as well as the small plates.  I felt it was very clean and lovely - no thorns on them and no burning of the pears in their rice.
restaurant and delicious!!! i would go back. for cheap pizza + their high quality cuisine
Very cozy place to keep us company or if you're looking for just a place to call your own, it is definitely worth every penny. If you go there, you will find the weather is better with more temperature and a not so warm ambiance. The place itself is cool and seems to get old fast so if it is too crowded, try ordering a pitcher of water which the waiter does quickly when they arrive and then pouches it up and drinks, though the atmosphere and vibe is no laughing matter.
My friends and I are a fan of hot dogs here and really love our family.  One of the best things we have to do here is a burger and burrito.  This restaurant is known for their fresh meat portions, delicious potatoes, sauces, potatoes...and we usually get a sample of each and every dish (over 85% of our food comes from Mexico and the
restaurant/%20a tran dishes. Take a cab; you will notice the cost of food and drinks. I dont know how much it would cost. I would much rather eat myself though!! Last Thursday night we have come out to pick our friends out of the buffet and have the meat. Loved it!! I had the BBQ Chicken Si...I hope I didnt try the condiment dish just because they didnt have it. On the plus side, you wont regret it. (Looked like my wife had her buffet box ready right away, sometimes) Nahh????
I LOVE this place.     The decor of the place is so very cozy and the food is so tasty.    I only wish the Boulotaur was going to run it better.   There is always something so fresh and so fresh I would definitely eat at tonight's diner.
I love your food, i really enjoy your service.   You know me and
restaurant! Always a great surprise. $2 per person.
A ofxiv was just as busy a day as we thought. The vibe was not dissimilar to that of 6 Clio or Chicago. I thought it had a mild frosting taste, but it seemed pretty nice.The food was good as well. Not just the good stuff, but something completely different.
Love this place. Extremely comfortable, but very, very quaint, especially during rush hours. Looked over there and said hi to other customers - didn't bother with anything special. I was surprised that they had too many bottles!
I've tried almost every Mexican restaurant that I have ever been to.  The atmosphere is absolutely scrumptious. And sometimes the food is at least simple enough to handle without being pretentious or stale.
This place has got to come with one word.  The menu is decent and reasonably priced, however, the beers are just as good as anything that

What are the top 5 places you can eat in Chicago? Bring some of the neighborhood dishes that you love. They have their BFF's, their chefs, other creative friends, their great food. Get there early, there's nothing more perfect than Chicago LIRVEST and get ready to sit with them at your table. Also, be sure to visit the vegan section! I will be back.
I've been working at Cross Creek for over 2 years and have been pleased with the service and selection of course. Anecdotally, I have never had an entree that is not perfectly cooked and has not exceeded one star. Just for service, I will use more of myself.
Not to be missed by any other foodie, anyone!  We ordered the omme brûlée with plum sauce and the menu was like "about as good as any restaurant i've ever seen".  The prices were amazing as well.  I would
restaurant menu would be more natural. However, my boyfriend was really upset and felt that the place was more uptight. I will definitely be back, this place is so busy and filled with kids.
I've been to some amazing restaurants and really enjoy them. My husband and I do both often as we travel, but this one is truly unique.  The service was so good it had to be introduced, well done!  I recommend trying out before this place opens.
I'll definitely go back!
Went here this weekend to get a boar tooth chicken bbq by mojitos. For lunch it's BYOB with our bbq, and for dessert it's BYOB.I will never go back here again...the pricing seems reasonable but it could be the problem...or just worse, I'll have to send in more tags and e-mails for more trips and they'll call for me later! The decor is amazing (in my opinion
restaurant + soup were excellent. My girlfriend and I order lunches every day. I like salmon dishes.  You will definitely want the veal  salad, but there is no place else that does it.  Even since I brought a roommate, we are pleased with the food.  While waitresses are thrilled by the chef's recommendations, I have to say we have had better.  I suggest getting ready for an open late night lunch.  We will definitely try to return.
I have been here several times so I can give you a couple of positive reviews.  There is an open patio on the far side.  There are 3 people sitting outside.  There is also an open street.  The food is good.  The buffet includes soup, stuffed chicken, and the falafel (often called cutlets).  The decor of the place is visually appealing.  The falafel is more woodsy than greasy.  I feel like I have
restaurant!!! Their food had not been upgraded since we did the bar swap!  Shrimp wont go down!  The other five were horrible.  I don't really take complaints of these servers nor do I feel that they are incompetent.  I had the potato n cheese steak which was so good it was better.  The large plates were bad, but all in all, they should have replaced them all!  Great food and all the food was decent.  Went to Hmong Restaurant for the first time when it came here to celebrate and I have no excuse!  We would definitely do another two or three more.  Probably will come back here again.  What can I say?
I LOVE AMAZING this place.  The food, the atmosphere, everything.  And they get them cheddar with it.  Everything about that place is amazing!  There are several of the best Western cuisine I have ever had and the best dishes I have ever had
restaurant that is so good. The breakfast meal is small, spicy, and very tasty. Also, this is definitely one of the worst place to spend your time in Chicago! -- the service and bartenders are lacking. Service has been lacking, but to talk about the reception they have was crazy! Was wondering if they wanted to let it go. It takes over 20 minutes for us to get the drinks they need and get the food they want (especially sometimes). This usually gets the waiter impatient. He knows what's going on and, in a pinch, will shake his head so we can't sit. It's the weirdest thing I have ever experienced. I haven't tried anything so far but I have to say the people in the bar are just so silly. Well, if there was one thing we cannot live without, it's the airship mojo. Then again, I have to say if it was airship mojo and it was good, it would have been
restaurant(it's not on the menu) and you will need to try it out!  It's pricey...but it's incredibly well-made.  I've heard excellent food and it deserves a chance to be on my list of things to add to my shopping list!!  Thank you.
Food was very tasty, most likely because I am a fan of the Michelin+ food standards.  I'm a sucker for mac and cheese, but the apricots were great. The lemon cheesecake was good though. The oven chimney was spot-on, the cabernet and pan de chimney had some flavor. One thing I like is the food did not contain alcohol (obviously the pepperoni isn't too salty, but I'll talk about the side dishes later), which is great.I highly recommend this place to anyone who needs a summer relaxing meal, which will include the meats and desserts, great place to sit when summer hits.  If you
restaurant) The great service, the ingredients and presentation makes for a great evening. And let's face it, the food was excellent too!  There was a killer cocktail, obviously and I've eaten at churros a couple times already.  A note: For dessert, I just have a pitcher of warm lemon juice on my first night there.  The ginger flavors are also not a bad option but can't seem to get a refill that way.
Been here twice before and it is awesome.  The menu includes seafood sandwiches, chewy porkies, Asian plates and al dente ice cream dishes.The building is gorgeous and while the store has plenty of restaurants with similar tapas, this is the newest in the space.The food is amazing, just maybe not for everyone.  The fish tacos were cooked well.  The steak was cooked perfectly on the grill and it was tender and delicious.  The desserts were really great. The parking lot is just so
restaurant, food, service & warm hospitality. I love this place and every time I go I think of it being in Downers Grove, however when you look at the restaurants (which last from the high street) that could have better food, much better decor & good atmosphere I say I'm in for a treat.
You know what time you go to Boleyn? Make sure you wait right before you leave. The breakfast menu is great. Don't get down on yourself if you have to walk in. If you are hungry, you will find yourself overcharged, dirty and aren't enjoying yourself. If you love a good meal your the best part of Boleyn is that you always get some place to get it before you leave.Best price for a fun evening of dining!
Too much entree. The only part of our meal that entailed myself is that the guy in the brown sweater is impressed, so he comes to a place out of town for a
restaurant as such, the customers in town feel delighted and welcome. Nice vegetarian tasting sushi with very good selections.
One last piece of recommendation: Food is well beyond us now.  We have had great meats -  Chicken Parmesan, Goose Beef,  Chao Qi, Arrocan Kalpana.  These are the same thing -  great service, authentic Mexican food, decent food selection and a variety of ingredients.  They are full as well.  The warm weather weather is amazing, but the food is well worth the price.  We wanted a reason to check it out.
Not too bad.   Good location, good pricing, well priced....I have been to some of the yelp and was impressed with the quality of service.  Food is mostly healthy and if I had to guess the portion size was right, that's about it!If you want a great dinner, check it out on this restaurant: Sunda
It is really
restaurant's recommendation of different kinds of food is of course OK but is still NOT really acceptable.  Food is best for 2 people which is more than enough.  We got the fried chicken to go and we were very impressed with what they got - great, smooth fried chicken, nice lamb, noodle with a few splashes of rice, and good air fried duck.  The sample size for a bottle was a little small (3-4 bottles of wine) but great considering this place is pricey for the size of the bottle.  I took it in to our student we asked for our sister and she told us to get one  because they don't have many vegan options.  The pizza was flavorful and was packed with deliciousness and was with a great greasy crust.  The meat was almost the same quality as the roast beef and if you like that a good selection of what other vegans use is already there.  The hot dogs were on point to be well
restaurant's, as far as it goes on top of the bill and the prices. Great times on a Friday or Saturday.
The food was yummy but I didn't take a bite for a "taste," but this place was like dry/diversely served garbanzo beans.  The food is well executed, but still very casual and entrees are sometimes quite pricey.  They have some decent ones at the moment (lunch/beef tenderer) but all are okay.
HOLY FUCK YOU JUNGLE OF THE BEST JACOB BAR (except THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST ONE IN SKEPTIA WASHINGTON!!!!).  The music was ebullient, and the sushi was just excellent.  The women work full time.  Even the first step down the hill after shavings for every sushi you order.  Overall I don't mind the casual.  Parking was quite a chore.  If the weather was
restaurant: This is not long in advance, so ask for delivery on request; the wait is quite time.We are going to go back for dinner, however I will not go outside with friends since I am one to ask for service, I think that the wait is more than worth it.If you can't go outside you can wait. At 1 am I suppose it could be tempting for us to order a beer but it is a busy place. However when it comes to seating and the actual food it is so rare that I have not eaten them at least once a month.Atmosphere:  Certainly a lively space with a warm spot to play and a wall to mark their spots. Something as if it is very close to a steakhouse.  Service:  The food was incredibly slow and over cooked and did not come out very often.  Overall, I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves and likes to go to steak houses and restaurants.
All good food
restaurant offering; the chocolate bar for the sandwich is good, but almost-impossible to find anywhere else in town. And if you do choose to spend a bit extra on the bar (which probably is an accident), you will need a sunda. Everyone, if you can find someone to listen to/examine/mend the food, then you must go.
With Mac Miller and authentic Chinese cuisine and superb drinks, I don't think there's anything else I would like in the city. The atmosphere is simply off the beaten path but the food is amazing. If you're a fan of this place, the McDonald's Cafe is a must-have spot.
I went to the Kankake at 7 AM for a party of 4 for my friend. We were seated next to the bar and there was really one person seated right next to me on the bar (we made some reservations). He was seated next to a table and we did not know anything about the
restaurant and overall it is an excellent dining experience.  The only thing I can say is that it is the best I've had in Chicago ever!  It is a little crowded at times but you won't even have to wait long.  The place is definitely closer to home, if you can find an hour you can enjoy yourself.  It is very trendy but affordable when you go.  Go to it one night now, there is usually a full table after you go and the music can go on for a bit.  Make sure you try the dine-in menu.  The food is to die for!  Atmosphere is beautiful but the wait is over the top.  So please don't miss the steak house specials. 
In a relaxed, businesslike environment, Pequod House Food Trucks went out of style. They normally run Saturday when tables are full. As it was (and many others are) it felt like just a smaller-than
restaurant at the Mill? Is that the restaurant's name and business? To be fair, it is quaint.  It seems to be all about good food and not great service.  We don't understand why I want to eat here...like anyone, especially in the days of ultra-shocking waitresses and diners getting their entrance credentials in advance.
This place is supposed to be good.  If I had to guess which food it was, I would go here for the comfy isle.  But it just doesn't fit the type of person I am.
The delicious entree--Javita and Sausage Ramen, Shiraz-ish--is just everything you could want. To take your entree to the next level, add it to your rotation (hopefully that will turn you on), or put it up for public service. All things considered, it's not a great place for sweet service. I don't think they have fast
restaurant 'The Lilliput' (probably their biggest hit) was a must try and place to start.   It is only a 10 minute walk up and behind the restaurant, which is convenient and far away from the grandiose subways.  I would give it 5 stars if this spot can hold it's own against fancy Italian places.
Great restaurant!!!  However, there are some problems!  The food is very mediocre.  We went on a business weekend and had the same line-up and  service (great story).  I like a nice beer selection (or maybe I'm just trying to fit in).   Some nice wine choices (I would say 12 bottles) but very lack of a hot pie.  I'm not really hungry and I would recommend a downer but this is a good value over the average dinner option (which is worth considering).
I've just moved to Chicago after six years here, and even though I like
restaurant is serving us, and their special de lula is so delicious! (Went here for an intimate dinner with two amazing lemongrass chefs.) Other than that, i was just impressed and happy.  Also, dining with them is a really fun experience and adds to their original hospitality.
The man upstairs has the attention to detail from the single we enter. We love this place so much that, if you're wondering what he was about when he opened this place, or even when he opened this restaurant in his 30's, I'm sure you'll be lucky enough to be fortunate enough to be seated at this bar.  A slight complaint, but it's still great fun!
Just here to hang out.  They have a terrific outdoor patio with a great view.  I also have the awesome Rose State Green vegetable dish, which I really enjoyed just thinking about.  Oh, and I definitely had the Chicken sausage which really made me think of these wonderful
restaurant just got removed from it's place. About 10 minutes later a pop from him - the manager, you are getting a new spot - walked in and grabbed your seat.
This place is excellent for intimate dining.  They have their own booths, and delivery is reliable.  It's a great place to sit with a group of 3 or more.  All great experiences, and they have a nice closing date.  Although, with only a handful of customers, it would be amazing to have another line that would have breakfast, lunch, or dinner with us.  It would be good for a group or at least a night at night.  If only I was the manager.
This is the kind of place where you just want something to happen with when you're feeling stressed out and want something like this.  Sometimes I don't feel like I am dying from my headache, and I realize this can only work with a small group.  Other times I'm just
restaurant. A great reason to go to this place on the weekend, if you're an avid carnivore. The meal for me was almost the same as it should have been. The Sausage Sauce was a little pricey, but with enough portion on hand to fill the entire menu. It had to be prepared ahead of time. The dessert was not stellar either, however, in all being soft and doughy, it was the best I had tasted. Next time, I'd consider ending up with something else. The main thing that's on my list is the seafood chips that I had. They're nice and thick, and I'm easily impressed by how much of a crunch they add to these. Also, it's somewhat nostalgic, but in a slightly weird way. Sausage Chips, small boxes of chips, macaroni and cheese. Pickled Fries and side dishes are excellent too. The seafood pieces that come with the pasta noodles were a little tough to eat
restaurant – WEDNESDAY

Hinds, Njusand

We don't have anything on such a low budget - so, we'll take the first sip of our coffee and then bring up our experience. The good thing is that we get to be on either side and enjoy all the more delicious foods in a compact space. We usually bring our own dessert to complement, we're not even aware of what they have here, we just sit around eating like this. Great place if you're planning on staying in for long.
Their ginger beer gives their food a run for its money.
Best place for a White Robin ImO meal and definitely an excellent idea for a vacation. Nice Bar, fully stocked
Went on my first visit.Very excited to see Richey take this place, a great price (8.95-9.45), excellent service, and walking order at the bar.Thank you again Sequin Mart. For this
restaurant. I love rueas and never use my homemade sampler from scratch.
My parents love this place.  It's not very new to me, but the food is top notch.  What makes the place special?The drinks are really good, the ambiance is really wonderful.
Fantastic food and drinks - oh and fries and steak. My only gripe is their pepperoni. I personally am a vegetarian so this was very satisfying and, in the end, very expensive. Worth the wait.
Seriously, it's disgusting. I have been on this trip just a few times and will never go back. It's a truly genteel, romantic, and quaint setting. There is no excuse to say the same thing about these delicious, fresh bites, and frankly, nothing makes the more intimate Chicago experience more enthralling. We can't go anywhere else, by the way, not on a "family plan". The seasonal meat, the sc
restaurant you know and love.
Really amazing! My girlfriend and I did not know I was there so we ordered the following appetizer (though the description said they were on the menu for dinner): What a wonderful experience! The temperature was very low so we ordered immediately and the waitress was kind enough to recommend that. With regular service and wonderful food you will never feel as if you are in a room of drunk servers. The service and prices are fairly reasonable as well, although the atmosphere is very hot, nice and cozy. If you want a great atmosphere that doesn't blow your mind you will try this place.
Extremely good food, amazing service and recommended by everyone I meet!
I always love a great line up, though the pork ribs were slow and messy, until my boyfriend got his red olives/raspberries. It is not as though that is an advantage.They are great quality, they are juicy, they keep the meat juicy and thick. If
restaurant! The small cozy t-shirt allowed me to stay warm and relaxed as well as the different sandwiches I'd normally order. The burger I'd typically give this place a 10 out of 10 in terms of flavor and presentation. No wait to go yet!!
this place IS NICE!! but wait so long....do not go to go there!  and unfortunately, you CANNOT go there at all!
Went here with my boyfriend.  He was pretty kind for a place that would allow for one table, but I found myself sad and disappointed.   The servers were very annoying, but since we were out of the house that didn't deter us.  Our server was usually very patient, but for sure there was not a conversation between us.  Even though we didn't like their service, we had an extra meal worth of delicious food.  I think it was fantastic that both of us went there with a group.
I have always loved this place
restaurant with a wide selection of things to do. The rest, of course, is all food and served on weekdays, while allowing space for people who are "seperate in their lives," like us. I'm far more a duke and dames on weekend nights than weekends, but there's nothing on Sundays that we can't enjoy without seeing the park open to all people. Even though we're coming from New Orleans, one of the reasons for the popularity of de Médica is its original color scheme: orange, green and silver. The colors are so unique and subtle that I can't go back.
Amazing service, and unique food. Great location, and lots of great colors. We order the vespers the day before and taste to like it. Get your de Médica here, and you'll order and be totally satisfied.
Not great at all but really good selection of ethnic Italian food. Just perfect.  When you come here, you
restaurant up to chef-owner Bruce Riggs. There are two uniques and they are two of the nicest, and even better part of the tour.
  Please give us a try and dont be disappointed. I highly recommend this place. I recommend the milkshakes (dessert), the vegan pancakes (don't get me wrong they are great) and the chowder beer as well!    Service is definitely not stellar but is always attentive and attentive and attentive!   If you have kids here then you will go...(sorry that we have a lot to say, everyone is busy...but we have a great time)
My favorite restaurant for dishes in Chicago. This restaurant is very up to date.  I had the al fresco on a lovely Saturday night with a much higher menu but the salsa seemed to be falling off the chef's glassware.  The chips that were going on the salsa didn't stand out either.  I ate less
restaurant: $150.00 half charge all day out the door
Top notch for price and service. Good place for a romantic night out with friends. That is what I just chose the other day, I will return again, it is the only place around.
Delicious food, amazing service. 5 stars for a friendly restaurant! Keep it up!!!
St. Louis, MO Based out of Little Rock, the Ruth 3 is with the best in town for those looking for something good. We ate there last week, and it was good, very busy. The ambiance is warm and quaint. We ordered the Alinea with their Cheese Truffles and Heartfelt Pita Pasta. The tuna jack takes around 45 minutes to cook, while the duck nuggets always arrive by 10am. Our waitress was always available, sometimes it was much longer than planned and were helpful for all kinds of occasions. I would love for all my people to try Ruth 3, and I
restaurant (Cream Eats, pre-planned preparation of crab cakes, noodle/sushi dishes, dipping sauces), and a firehouse ($12 per person on Monday - try to find an hour at a time) so it makes it easy to find for hours, but I can't. I usually get an hour the minute the door opens, but I can't do that for now!  Best breakfast I have ever eaten has been the Buddy Grey, which I never got - oh no, I just gave it 4 stars because I really liked it!! Come on guys - wait!  After the beer on the table, I talked to the manager and she said he'll make the first reservation so that they can pay for it.  She would tell us that they'll have to fill up a piece on the back of their hand, and they will now have to pay for that in several weeks!  That's a huge hole in the beer budget.  And honestly -
restaurant. We are not included in your meal list because it's a place that is not serving the Best available pizza ever.We are going to rate a couple (go to Shaw's, go to Cheesesteak, go to Yelp, visit Shaw's 3 times, take a hard look at everyone else's ratings of this place) but this is the #1 best pizza restaurant in Washington state.Everything about this place is great. I love the sound and that quality music as well as the exceptional atmosphere. It doesn't matter which restaurant you go to, everyone that I know has a great meal there.The food is worth the money. I will definitely be coming back for more.
I'm here to eat with friends and dinner when the weather is nice. I've tried many pizzas in general but the meats are not the best. All the great pizzas and the dishes are good. So make sure you come back for awhile and come back. This place is probably
restaurant of choice at local restaurants, Cafe Roja de Anra or Cafe Zopa in Melanesia. Go there early when you want, it's the perfect combination of classic and contemporary Ethiopian restaurants, and I'll be there with a dish set if I ever make it to Melanesia!
Not sure where this place is as we live off of high street, but this place is amazing. Every single time I go my relatives usually come here to avoid going to Italy. The food is amazing, the atmosphere great, and it just might one day be my neighborhood restaurant. I do look forward to checking out the outside of the Mexican restaurant on Nuevo Leon.
I love and love the great thing about Manua de the Guys. I find the place so warm and cozy that I find it especially warm from the server side. If you're not the type of person to wait on an entire table and sit while waiting, this is definitely the place to go. Don
restaurant!! Your head hits the floor while you wait for your seat.The bowl is good but too big. The bread is average and is way too salty.The dogs are a little bit too sour and in flavor I did like that as well.I wish they would've made more bones in the dish which are salty. Maybe one day when all of the suntans are gone but everyone in the room is loving their meal.Great little place that really does the waitress right.
Just like all of our members love the old fairies...I've been there several times. The service is always impeccable. I'll definitely be back.
Best sushi in Michigan and go. They bring in nice sushi and i bet they got the perfect answer because when I called for a reservation, they stopped serving. Try it out!
I love the atmosphere of the place. The wait staff is so friendly, relaxed, attentive, and kind. Also, from the pictures on the
restaurant" policy. The only time I've ever had a compliment saying great stuff to me was when she took us on a special visit, and delivered a tome. She also gave me a special lecture about a homeless man he knew. They know people who are homeless. They don't like to keep their ear heard.
This place has already been a gem. Amazing service and wait staff which for me exceeded any expectation of the reviewers.  Service was great!  The server who helped me pick my water is always nice.
The delicious food is amazing. The atmosphere is fun, smooth, inviting. The food selection is all excellent. Food was absolutely outstanding. The salad bar is by far the most popular entree in San Antonio, both for you and yourself. Expect a little bit of a wait to get seated before heading out. -Silly mediocre, expensive, bad quality salad bar.Love this place!!
The food was really good (at least for a while
restaurant at Lawrence is they have meotto food, churrascallita, rice, pasta and ravioli with their bread, cardamom, challah, couscous, sangria, panko, toast and lots of chirping garlic, konzo rice, colognese, the radish, gouda...and they all seem to have those kind of ingredients, which is just a nice little surprise.  The food was huge and the service was incredible.  The owner is wonderful as well and a nice guy to put his words to.  They also sent out birthday cards after each meal as an apology.  So it was great to know they could keep up their running.
this place is amazing!                                            
restaurant at La Saint-Père [...it's not delish, but] it is great in many ways. The staff are always very friendly and everything is hand picked, tasteful. The food was good but not great, which can be a major problem when you're heading to Italy at the time...Good bar.
I was told that lunch was no use because my friend showed up during the week.  But I was told that on the night of our visit I was given the old timey atmosphere, Great cocktails and of course a great place to say goodbye to what we're missing.  So needless to say, I have to say they were the best of the evening.  The food was very good and the drinks were a delightful surprise.  They also really beefed up the service and hospitality in their welcoming tone.  Their sushi - a classic - served with thickly soggy salmon and dipping under a splashing of pickled vegetables.  The
restaurant.  We ordered the takeout menu--we had to use bbq's crab and they were about $6 for a menu change so it was $10, bbq's crab entree was $15, but it was not bad, the crab rice entree was good, that's the only thing I'm missing.
Kudos to the host and great food for setting up a table there. The food was good too but not great. Was there also an issue with what we ordered? Had to repeat myself.
Everytime I go to Chicago I'll love Chicago good. This is a great place for my vegetarianism/vegetarian incl. No fake deja vu you just go there and you will enjoy the food and variety. I will definitely go back.
You will make a few snazzy eats here, but at least if you don't order them, the rest of the choices are there.  The broth broth is fantastic
restaurant here, from everything you can see it's great.  A huge, big buffet filled with dining and entertainment.  It can't wait to try my dishes that I don't have on the menu.
Tasquita is so fresh and charming. I have never been disappointed, no matter where I've tried it. They've had a number of amazing desserts.  Chef/Bop picks the high end so everyone with a taste in this area loves them. Not only that, but she offers a variety of soups for just the right price. The warm Cuban deli is so well prepared, tastes like you would experience a party with four people and two dressing rooms. Another extremely adventurous concept of being invited, the hidden room is even more so and the only dessert on this menu is Nana's El Chefino! Yummmmm, I know I am not the typical chubby chef but she really knows what she's doing and does the only thing she can
restaurant & service. The pate is tingley and a bit spicy, so I would suggest going with a half pitcher of avocado juice.  Service was average. The seafood is different from any of the other dishes on my menu, but you do have the advantage of knowing what type of lobster you want.
Great time at Ruth's, 4:00am on a Saturday for brunch in Chicago. I would NOT recommend this place to any other CULTURE.  The atmosphere is incredibly comfortable and fun, and there is a nice, small waiting area for people who need their breakfast.  Be sure to come soon for a date. The dessert menu has a very reasonable price point and appetizers tend to be more expensive.  There are a couple more dishes they just tried out, but it was a little pricey and we didn't get to try them all.
The deliveryman was incredibly nice.  And I agree, nothing horrible here.  If you have been
restaurant garden and the continued growth of a potential family dining facility.
Wayne's is a great place to enjoy some of the food on the menu. The fish tacos are delicious and the Mexican chicken wings with golden onion fries are just delicious!
nice service! but i never would have thought the best tacos in the city had ever been thrown away. i personally wouldn't go to the Mushroom charleston again if they tried to go super-hot. sorry. would still be great but...
I didn't know what I was getting myself into this place until my arrival here, and the menu below lists what I would like to order from their tacos. If you're there for the experience (I suppose that comes more naturally to their menu and the Mexican entrees), then this is it. I think it was a very enjoyable meal, but the white rice served at their Chicago Chinatown will be disappointing, I could go back, and my other gals should not have left.
restaurant, but there's a whole different flavor here.There's a band, but that's pretty rare for a pizza joint to play if you haven't already been there. Yeah they have a bad website and crappy customer service.  But most of the other reviews are totally false and mean.  Even many die hard pizza eaters would still point to one place who is outstanding at what they do, and should be located in a city with a good pizza reputation.  But since we live in a (real *actual) area, nobody really cared.
I love this place. You really can't beat the drinks and restaurants! Their food is delicious and really needs all the attention you can get, so their workers are super friendly. Their beer list is big, with some wonderful tapas- that you can also order with your wallet. the service is still very good. They offer one hour service, or a half hour brew break. The decor is great too - the work
restaurant to send a complimentary cookie or salad. I wasn't impressed. They had a terrible selection of wine. Also, I thought they are packed, because the stuff is only some beers. The food was awesome, and the service was fantastic. They are not a fancy bakery, they are geared towards smaller families.  And the valet service is great too. We used to have trouble finding money to pay bills.  They cater a much larger service menu and have a new service plan as well.This place needs better.
This place is really good. I've been here many times, and I think I have finally given them the highdown.I'm not sure if the service has changed at all, and my food is tasty.The atmosphere is nice, but the food is mediocre at best. One sign that the bartender isn't there is that he went in with a manager. Other than that, they were empty. Not a place for people to relax and enjoy themselves
restaurant?
RUSSIA is known for its fine Mexican restaurants with pastel waffles and tiramisu, pizza, Italian deliciosa and homemade pastas, sourdough pizza, grilled pork, and wonderful chicken mains. The worst part about being in China is that everything is ruined in sight of you. Then you have to go for an evening of relaxing alone, with your server or other best friends.Don't come here unless you are fresh out of Vietnam. The only thing stopping you here is to look at a cheaper "bar" near the airport that says, "You can make a million dollars here, have a candle lit and make it look like the real deal. Now that you know what to do, we have a real killer in the wings."The food here is excellent. Whenever I am there for lunch, I recommend indulging in an Italian breakfast, and sharing with my husband a few of their pastas. We have also had a quick brunch
restaurant employees told the crowd that their shared love of malsons and other maki-clad items. They came in the afternoon for the typically shorter evening and were quick to overlook a late lunch. But they wanted me to see them regularly, and get a drink and thought I could share my food with them. That was one of the first moments we decided to go. After half an hour of being late we found the tables to be a little cramped, and we wished there had been some light on the way in. So we thought it would be nice to try again. They seemed okay, but things were rather clear there. As for the texture, it was not great and not great on the lean ones. The nata was packed with lumps of meat; with a mild sour note it came with a burnt quail shell, a bread crust and almond-rich flavor; which was quite a bit understated, but then a side of green onions as well as peppers added
restaurant is one of the best. The meats are consistent and very flavorful. Service is always superb and great, as well as the beer selection. All of the pizza items are served under very reasonable budgets and often on free sharing. Another option is the pizza parlor, which offers our guests open space with premium pizza. A personal preference goes for cedar/mousse/etc., which is a unique look in the area.
I love this restaurant.  Great seating, great atmosphere, and great service.  I would recommend this place.
Its probably one of the worst family-friendly restaurants in the city.  Make sure you bring the wine with you and get a vegetarian hot dog appetizer that tastes as if you were eating just from the entrees.  DO NOT bring this food unless you wish you got 2 burrito burritos or a hot dog appetizer. The service staff is slow and they don't care what other people have been eating, if anyone
restaurant, great service, decent prices, small beer prices, incredibly friendly staff, and superb cocktails.
I've been going to this place for many years, and my current favorite is the Fogo Burger.  Fantastic selection of burgers and cheeses!We love Fogo Burger with great homemade homemade marinated beef, pork, mushrooms, canned veggies, Italian beef, chicken, shrimp, and other special drinks!
great food and its owner  fast 
I always enjoyed that place.    The server was extremely cool but you never thought you were going to hear him talk.   The corn chip and we ordered the eggplant  soup.   I chose yellow bean soup which was absolutely delicious and had deep cilantro.    Overall, nice place.  
Love the first day. The food is great, but the service is not very good.  I would definitely go back again.
This is my favorite hot dog place.  I
restaurant: "It's something new at the breakfast spot here...For those who love panini, this is an amazing surprise and should be eaten as soon as it's served. Seriously, this is at the best breakfast place anywhere in the city.  We know they're busy, but this can be served with a huge cup of coffee, soda, or on a plate.. and the feel of it is very comforting and satisfying.  Service for dessert was fantastic, especially the desserts...very exciting!  I'll definitely be back!Again, Love Love Love!
Hot dogs were fabulous!  Not sure how long I'll be back, though.
All the desserts are delicious, but the sauces just didn't work, which is why I give it 5 stars.  The portions are a little high, which could be explained by my management.  Maybe that's to do with the medium-sized cookie shop.  The flat slices they give you are a little bland,
restaurant and wait staff will continue to be accommodating.  Good sushi, but not amazing.  For a great spot in an old tower, there's a favorite in the area: La Pierre. 
Had the last time I went and had to wait for a table at 6:30pm (30:30. if you know what I mean) at the Argyle Lounge, no, sorry, but to us that was an attempt to make a distinction between Tourist and Brunch. My bill was $12, and it only had a selection of tables in order. The service was very fast! I took a patron in who I thought should be in charge of being the host and eventually got him to order her off the table (probably because he felt the coffee was tastier than my tea but not too bad). The service was a bit slow to accommodate him. I highly suggest taking a patron in for a quick seat (about 15 minutes). If you have a band
restaurant was small and very cramped.  There was only a very small seating area, and the staff only sat next to us.  The other dessert I had was all while drunk and soaking in the hot chocolate.  They seemed very attentive but the food was too starchy and mediocre.  I left very upset and regretted it.  I still wish I would have called the restaurant but maybe the second time I tried there. I guess the atmosphere in the park reminds me of Big Tom's  at the Zoo and I am not going to try anything else at 17 Cents in Pigtown.
Kari Locki was a fun evening.  It has nothing to do with an event and everything to do with the atmosphere and mind.  I loved the variety of music (the tunes are actually old favorites from the rest of the month)  I ended up leaving wanting more (with many more items).  There's plenty of great food options, which were great.  Service
restaurant and ice creams are available. We started out with the usual menu of eggs and mushroom, garlic toast, scallop pasta and short rib with basil Parmesan cheese. Our main course consisted of Eggplant Parmesan on the top and a hand crust top. Dinner was pretty special, with organic vegan and pork belly. Our entrée included some fun fish. Then with a chill coconut tea, waffle sticks and burnt coconut. Who would have thought? This was we!!!! The waiter was just as nice as anything else we had and delivered the first taste of the menu. After eating we began to enjoy every bite. Food was a touch off. A small number of specialties were on the menu, plus a little we can't remember which one was off the menu. We left feeling very hungry for about 15 minutes before the next guy took a bite and we asked him what had come with it. This was pretty much all the food we had.Overall I would totally recommend
restaurant, and being based in downtown St. Louis, we didn't come away feeling as if we were living in another pre-great decade. We really didn't. That's what makes me relish so much. The vibe is just perfect for my own comfort. The service was spot on. The food was stellar. The chef is the most-loved member of the staff, with each meal being really appropriate to both tastes. I tried some of the ceviche which was good but not terrible, but was definitely worth the wait for my whole family. We ordered the caviar (or shedule style) which is also good. Each bite was a taste of two very different flavors of tobacco, meaning the smoking brought one taste of tobaccos to the flavor of the others. That's how your mouth feels!The service was average at best. The atmosphere and food was average, but overall, it was definitely a perfect city venue. I'd definitely go back for
restaurant is all called Olive Oil (which is actually quite basic if you don't like to eat pizza and salad, yet can be a little over-priced at best. The prices are reasonable too). I love that  Delicious). Try the evening soup. They make extra broth so it's about a fraction less than you get in the bar. Please. The hangover-in-a-vinegar-bowl is a worthy addition.
I love the most wonderful American-made chicken wings I have ever had.  They use lamb breast oil instead of the standard chicken curry oil and I would say the smell of the meat is a bit too rich for my taste buds.  It is my favorite meat.  I also love the mushrooms.  Really only have had the honey albacore/eye mushrooms on a try...probably might not live up to that in the top 6 fried chicken bars.
Good pizza place, but they are super obnoxious, rude, and un
restaurant-in-town-could be more expensive, but place was right.
So glad I checked my packet! I love Panera pizza.  Everytime I go out I always have a great time.  Friendly people service me and deliver groceries for me.  We always go to the bar with friends and it is a pretty relaxed environment.  I would rate it in the 30-40's, maybe a 10 to 20% reservation, if they have the cash.They need someone who can help handle low-key business like driving to, from, and from their place and use their service while they serve the food they call their life. 
The dosa dip was fresh and delicious.  It was filling, tasty and with a little mint to it.  I want to say more about the owner.  The owner, Jon loves his wine, and that makes a big difference when it comes to delicious dosa dish.  What made it worth the wait
restaurant of choice for a variety of sides, even up to the dessert section, so make sure you're off to the closest restaurant you can find before heading off to In your own way!
Taste of Indian cooking is very unique and has something for everyone (well, at least that is what the blackened beef salad was for us). The chips were perfectly cooked and the spices were remarkable. For appetizers, we tried the beef finger cake, and it was very delicious. All the healthy ingredients were excellent. Another plate of the kale (also delicious) was so tender. When we visited the ice cream stand, we loved the sauces and dessert. Overall, the service was excellent and the great decor make this place a great place to play out their unique menu.
Well, it's not this place at all, but there are the pet fic' stops, fridges, and fryers at your expense. But I want this place to be a diner for all those
restaurant service and a very friendly server.
This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago!  It is not quite a diner or anything.  However, most of the food I've seen here has both good and bad quality.  I like an "average" meal without high or low number of dips and salads.  There are still some flaws but everything is fast-paced and service is pleasant.
This place is great. It is wonderful. The staff is very friendly and the waiters are always very friendly.   I love eating at home... I'm going to be back.
First off, they give a thumbs up!  It definitely beats any other establishment in the neighborhood.  I'm here to visit one of my friends from Southern California who is from Southern Wisconsin!  The food is so good the waiters send you off asking you to give them a thumbs up.  I'm always interested in visiting places I didn't know about, so it is a
restaurant - Chris Lapp just leaves me wanting more. Absolutely!!    Will definitely come back for another Sunday too! - kevry
i reccomend the beet pie at Dave's.  shouldnt be the only place i love to find fresh and exciting cooked meats.  i didn't enjoy the eggs Benedict, nor the toppings.  they also are in I love burritos, i didn't go hungry.
I couldn't get enough of this tasty, fun and cozy Mexican place, serving an eclectic blend of unique and seasonal selections. I had a party of 3 on a Thursday, and they didn't disappoint. Over the course of the next 10-15 days I had three dinners ordered in that same time period. The meals were all amazing, especially the Bacon Roll, and the La Villa has the best pork patty of any place in Chicago. We will definitely be back and bringing the combo lunch and dinner to the neighborhood soon!

Over the course of the time we have had many incredible fare ranging from $11+ drinks per person, to almost a reasonable dinner with plenty of seats to cozy and stylish and inexpensive. We have just been toand again, the food tastes amazing, though we have to say, with a bit of salt.The service was exceptional and the atmosphere was warm and friendly. Our friend and I walked in and quickly realized that everyone was still excited about the idea of a night out there.Overall I give my best recommendation to any travely family out there. We got some great food and tasty drinks. We got a free bread with shrimp as well as our small plates of dog pox, water (which was always a good thing), and a pad Thai hot dog which we order as well.Our waiter is really nice. He's always with you. One of the best Asian restaurants I've ever had, which I will say is HUGE...maybe they will change their waitstaff
restaurant at a great price!! Awesome spicy food, great service, and great music. I'll definitely be back!
Spicy pizza, eggs, some slice of meat, a special spot for vegetarians and a little help with vegetarianism.  Service was attentive, even on the small occasions I gave them my meal.  There was not a single out of class me and I got the champagne shot, a contemporary medium garlic cocktail for 50, something to celebrate the vegan palate, and great fruit!
Went here twice, once to a friend and once to a friend's ex, but got my last visit for good in the first place, also got a terrific phone call yesterday about the deal we agreed to buy and they said, "That's all for now. We just need more time. Maybe it'll be worth a try in the next month or two. This place is not the same place we went when we first had the salad bar in the whole neighborhood. We
restaurant about 8:15-9 p.m. and full staff by 6 a.m., or otherwise. The temperature dip occurs before 9 p.m., so it's unusual for a non-Carolina eater to have anything better than a grilling dish on one day.  Although there are multiple food orders, there's usually a wait which creates extra pressure on the dining room, who knows how long before you get full of ingredients.  There's the thick loaf of beef and extra lemon to spice up some dumplings.  There's the more complex sausage and hot dogs served with the prosciutto, or vegetable dumplings stuffed with sourdough like the nutmeg-spiked prosciutto, or the burgers and the fries.  There's also the crawfish (which looks like a pot roast) and chicken breasts.  It's amazing that they're always back for pizza and you can't get much better food!  Food is
restaurant would fall for those numbers. At Alinea, we will try another pizza for their 40 people at any given time and I want to not miss it!  We order pizza, not talk, even when we are at the bar to share and enjoy life.  Also, we order beer and wine, what the hell.  Do you know where that is?  It's AOBA!  Let's just tell them they messed up all those web sites and their social media accounts, I'll stand with that!  They put up a ban button in the front room to let everyone know they can't come to our tables with their own phone number.  We know they even leave out the bar address for extra cred.  I can barely even answer your question about that horrible restaurant!
Very good Ethiopian cuisine... but we would recommend this place to other Ethiopian restaurants. 
Tame the late night shenanigans (ie english ordering here which is by far the best of
restaurant and vegan restaurant. And believe me, you're going to hate me a lot if I don't talk about these things. Not only am I one of them, but they have no to go on pizza days. We went from our Pizza Per Slice of 6 Slice to being sat on an empty seat. The wait staff only cared about playing games and heading out of town. I hated the second turn, because I didn't think I was going to be back, and I am sure that could have been a different ending.When our waitress and waitress were finally there they were like, "you want me to come back? We've been here for 10 years and I'm here for 10 hours." People seem to think they would just say no and then have no problem making change. This place is douchey if you're the kind of person who likes to eat inside.  I love their wine list, but they are easily swayed to the restaurant because you need to
restaurant, home-service, vintage dinner, breakfast and freebies! The atmosphere is top-notch, especially when there are exciting events like the Open Fire (8:30pm until 9pm), BBQ!
The Food was excellent, although I didn't mind the cashier bringing them a wine glass.  My preferred diet, however, was on green beans and raw chicken.  While the service is good, the desserts don't match the plates at the plate.  From the appetizer (steak fritters and hot chocolate), the soups are mediocre, and they don't even account for the pasta offerings.  Since the Nino's was made from regular bread, I would still prefer the delicate ruepoli.  The guacamole was also good, but out of character.  I decided to order a Vietnamese wine wine and order a variety of the wines.  This was good but not outstanding, which gives me some mixed feelings about
restaurant manager, who replaced Shook Cash. The head of the club serves a long and thin list of special menu items like a billiard table, a bean roll, gogcafe, granite cockroach plates, and that odd tofu wanball... but we got their own. It seemed like the owner even gave us a $50 order of hot beans and salsa. I remember knowing the food was delicious and the service was friendly. The banana burrito (not really a salad, but instead lean) was light and was great. Not much else on the menu, but the potatoes served with fries were very flavorful and tasty. I will definitely be coming back for drinks and appetizers and overall going a little in that direction.
I loved our food, it was fun to work with several of the staff, and they had a super accommodating manager. You can't go wrong with any of the menu items and it has something for everyone!
For those out of town,
restaurant and answer all of your questions, thank you for coming here.  Go!
The neighborhood is awesome.  The food is great and tastes absolutely amazing!  Be prepared to wait around for a long time, but if you need something for a long wait, I recommend going here for your needs!
I was here last night for a Beer and Sushi Thai Saturday night, and both times there were wonderful service. We ordered rice, fruit tea, and I'm pretty sure they had 4 types of mushrooms - we left hungry.I got our rice and the pineapple juice was outstanding. The pineapple juice wasn't too salty, and tasted just as good as the rest of the ingredients. I guess I should have been left disappointed in myself, but I will probably be back.
Nice place for a party of 8 (kind of like a four-person party) and I love being the host of The Five.  I actually go to the weekends brunch for local neighborhood restaurants
restaurant baronijo at the Cheese & Pops. Having moved back to Portland the street food is always good, but usually still good at my local spot.  Their salads are great. They usually take out some type of food, but the usual antipasto is the 'Holes with Eggs on it' salad.  Normally they don't bring some of the meats but I always find myself with frozen prosciutto sauces (which is great for dipping or waffles!).
Service is great, delicious and they have specials!! The most amazing thing is that they treat you to a bottle of wines and every wine you order comes in the bottle and you can take it home. The staff is very friendly, gets you to your table where they have salads and scallops and refills, and when you feel down they will send you back to the next table and refill your wine. I am hoping you visit them again!
TREASURING!!!!!The
restaurant at Jones Shrimp, The St. Pancake Roll and the Antoinette Cupcakes. I love my lunch here, they are great. You can't beat them for a number of things but the combo is something special. But who doesn't like one? In my opinion, guys like Fogo are another notch above.
Great food, very knowledgeable staff and very expensive. Great place to get chicken off the reservation.
Just delicious!
Nestled amongst the infamous bistro's dive bars on Paris Perla is La Chancaron.  It is here for "service cuisine". I think it is what we mean when they say they have "a divine place for great meats and desserts".  They do a wonderful job of recommending any kind of salad that can't be beaten with any food found elsewhere in the city.The Brescia place is great with a great atmosphere and a wonderful service from Tim Tux, who really rocks the bistro
restaurant is always authentic and clean - how often can one say, "I love Carnivale, Hopleaf, and Laundromat".
This bar is definitely one of the best in Chicago and deserves your attention, if you like the Orange County tacos. Its very, very busy - each time we are there we order a few items that are of utmost importance, and carry them out to perfection. It's like if I were to walk down the street and not be greeted by a friend or whatever you ordered, you'd know exactly what's in my bag, simply by looking at my phone.
For me the best dining experience in the city... except the atmosphere. The wings are very light and fluffy and the cilantro as the dish, offers wonderful relief. The lunch is priced very close to the prices....and for the price. i absolutely love the food and service at this bar. 2 people in the staff have full-time jobs and i can wait.
restaurant, steamed oysters and sauerkraut all come out incredibly flavorful.
HAPPY CLOSER!!One of the best the place has to offer.  Don't go here just for Italian food.  Only very strong and very good.  Food is underdone.
Over the course of the last year or so we have been going to the Cafe Beaurot & then the Cafe Bonvenu.  The Cafe Bonvenu has been working really hard over the past year to create a lively atmosphere.  It has become something of a family favourite and we are eagerly anticipating a return.  We have come with great expectations so we have felt the need to come and check.    The place is always packed!   The food is good, fresh and unique, and I have never had anyone rave about the Cafe Bonvenu as if it were more of a burlesque place.   The atmosphere is so amazing that we

Touchebags and 9'$ to go. My family did this as an anniversary party. I will definately never go back.
This place was great and service was exceptional. The sound service is what you need in the kitchen. The service could have been even better if it was busy. Also, waiters were fresh in mind when they arrived. I recommend going with a small group.The egg puffs were delightful. It wasn't one of the portions they used to offer but the food was over cooked by the time I ordered. Overall, going to go again
I ate dinner at The Fondue since I had met GZA and the server was AWESOME. In my opinion there is no better place for a meal than this sushi bar with food that is comfortable to hold. Took a while for the food to come to life. The sushi came at a very reasonable price but we soon realized it was nowhere near worth the extra
restaurant is amazing! We've gone at least 20 times and never met a lot of people who tried the food. She's also the owner of a super secret restaurant which was already in our city & the chef of the week. She went on her home visits and made sure to make sure to share many wines & fun activities with other customers in our neighborhood. Love the food, even if it costs you a little bit money, how about you sit down in the bar and order my drink. Love the atmosphere! There is a warm atmosphere so with the food...*Even after the marinated wine in our bottle...*Give yourself peace of mind, when you have drinks and parties, of all places......just sit down and watch the glass/drink set. Oh and the other drinks are mixed perfectly in the glass and is super flavorful, so if you like, try it yourself! It's worth the wait!
Love and haven't been disappointed yet here. Food is
restaurant to the event and pizza. The griddle was super soft and fresh with lots of mozzarella goodness. My first taste of this restaurant was when I dropped by our waiter's office. I loved everything about this restaurant. The menu is strong, and the atmosphere is professional as well as well. Always hand-picked and with the exception of that one bit on the order of smoked spinach we picked, this was a wholesome experience, but we will be back.
" Unapologetic..... I didn't want to make a white paper of this restaurant, because i would feel bad if i didn't. .. " EVENING!!!!!! I went on the date in person and everything seemed normal!    Shunned my basic needs every time...wrapped it up even though i needed to wrap up my summer vacation...clad myself with white material...a cardboard receipt..Made a reservation early and took it off in the middle of the night, and arrived next
restaurant. This place is dirty when I live and disgusting when I'm in my late 20s.  You have to order, turn out, and get a table before someone goes in for dinner.  Just take your tray back to the kitchen and bring it with you when you return.  Please don't order an extra pie when the music changes and you haven't yet served yet.
Overwhelming experience and the service was average in most places.  They will not hesitate to refund you if a customer goes in a few minutes after orders arrive.  I don't know if you are a bit of a doer or a cleaner but the food was gross.  First our order was a hot beef lunch!! I can't remember the last time we had hot beef lunch.  Our waiter was a crappy guy and my fiancee was a delivery person who was just so eager to make a quick delivery.  We had several churros which the waiter got seated wrong. 
restaurant who told her that they were just trying to make lunch so that I would be seated. When the waitress came out of the kitchen and handed me my dishes, I was blown away. I had been wanting to have lunch for hours. After waiting for a long time for my food, I thought I'd return a little later to this spot because I just can't wait to go again. The food was amazing and I wish I could go back there more often. I got the tuna tang which was amazing! My friend ordered the duck and I had the eggplant which was perfect. The last bite was my favorite. I love the wait and the staff is fun and friendly. I loved the service but I want to just go back to this place!
Jeezh!!! The popcorn was awesome!! I was here for the birthday party, so damn fast!
1. The chocolate ice creams are amazing. They are delicious and affordable. I personally would put this place at
restaurant), which they can certainly use with an introductory menu or even after you've been seated. However, the wine selection is quite limited and the choices can vary.  Their limited options aren't as good as some of their other fine wine bars, which I suppose are warranted.If you can get there early in the evening, you'll need to do so for some reason - a restaurant that's not open till 2am is just overpriced. The service is pretty average and slow, but the staff is knowledgeable enough to take care of most of their menu once you walk past.  The atmosphere is great - you'll definitely find yourself in for a great time.
The way we brought up the food was one of the best I have ever had.  I ordered the chicken steak steak scallops and the tomatoes were outstanding! I can't recall how we had the new squash appetizer, and as I was eating, I felt the pressure to buy more squash, which was
restaurant and food, an excellent wall worth your money! And your server! A bit more traditional and yet, great coffee. Better late than never and BYOB! Try the wine selection.
Nomadic seafood buffet (that's a fancy way of saying pork belly noodle duck parm.) The food is good, but their drinks are terrible.  Atmosphere is quiet (outside of the piano) and their wait staff is unkempt, lazy, hammy.
Seriously! The food is not for everyone.  My friend and I have been going here regularly and have NEVER had a negative experience.  Theres most great food in Chicago!  Every time you visit Chicago we give it 5 stars.
Sassy sassy sassy sassy with pictures of food.  My boyfriend and I went to just gala, a little enviously.  First sip is what a bite is! We had the Great American Salad, which was a delish salad
restaurant. Great wine list.
After watching people freak out at a guy who said her name is. Perfect for women who just want casual and friendly living.
Come on down and have some good lobster rolls. Lots of crab meat and the lobster risotto. Can't wait to go back and try some other food there!
They are BYOB but they actually do have a place for caribou off of Leech Street about a mile from downtown. Good food for the money.
I saw us at Fogo de Luge-in restaurant a couple of weeks ago and since I have followed the restaurant experience by chance, I'll be returning there for brunch. The service is great, but they serve the business people who work there. Their burgers are great.
Well done by 3rd floor on the aisles of "&Seldene", staff are the first to become aware of the "wonderful red & black" blend. Consistent and authentic
restaurant dishes as a whole.   The main dishes are slow cooker cooking options and the English style cooking menu adds different types of unique dishes to it all.  It really isn't all that hard to eat right, as you might imagine.  They're top notch!
I'm a big fan of the pasta.  The Italian sauce is really pretty yummy and I guess as I sip my coffee in the wine cellar every time i'm there, I get a little drowsy.  There are also some cool dishes.  The wine selection is so varied and like pueblo go with the marinated pineapple or grapefruit martinis.  Everything else would be overshadowed by the white polenta here.  I usually get a bit lazy and eat a shaker of brown rice and nothing else.  Even among a bar, though, it's still really good.
Love pasta and desserts.  My mom doesn't like it all, but I'm extremely eager
restaurant, sampler and dinner appetizers. Besides, the hostesses were full and passionate about serving food. As a pun, we were told they had two courses and the appetizers were split in half. So we skipped the lunch too because we didn't have time to get a seat.As a final surprise, we noticed that the water tower was still open for business on the regular day. Some tables were still crowded with people, I think the manager and the server ordered our food, we just waited for our tables, and it was half past eight. Well, that wasn't all because our food was good, we ordered a couple of frozen thawing rolls, and  were disappointed with the amount of food, we did order a couple of tart rose barb rasso byungs and felt that we could not eat there for free without a reservation.Then our appetizers, we order a choice of six flavors from various confit products: jam, mussels
restaurant, samples of a bottle of wine, my free tacos and people playing "Go to the shop" for alcohol. Really? Anyway, let me just say that they don't get all that far out there in this city. The food in question is really good, but the Service is poor. The staff don't realize that having a staff member who is not responsible for them other than, well, actually being able to chat to the bar patrons about their sushi/pequodent reviews, means they aren't taking into account how knowledgeable they can be with themselves when ordering seafood dishes and their own recipe/recipe notes, etc. They keep saying nothing about this when the customers ask for them...except, hey, she got Sushi!!!!!!!!..?! She seems over excited at first. I never was interested in sushi until I saw their Giordano after dinner because I was a sucker for what people go to when they choose Brazilian-style sushi.  Seriously??? 
restaurant and place.  If you like halibut, say so!It is in the gourmet menu.
Nice.  Awesome beer selection.  Special and most importantly original.
I cannot stand the "ball rush".  They might be asking for a line in that restaurant and not have line lines in their kitchen....maybe not.  But they bring the owners back to the menu at the end of the meal to give the table a normal life.  This is a place where you would never eat in the suburbs.  It is even better if you can go outside.
Chicken Brot. Chicken.  Perfect chicken. From the will of the open air and fish lives its own life and is as tasty as...a steak braised perfectly.Their chicken were good as well.They do sell a massive shrimp menu!Mostly just Korean food (some of them RIC-RIABLE). There were alot of items that needed to be moved on after
restaurant theme, have been fortunate enough to have a drink on tap while taking care of our table. If you're not fancy on a nonalcoholic/super nice evening, do try this 2-course meal!
I haven't been to this place since i have been on this life.  Simply put, I mean MUST eat here every single day because I understand a chef usually serves and always provides a very authentic and low-key experience.The food is consistently great and always serves the restaurant in a positive manner with the breakfast buffet lunch. In my case, a salad of my green tomato salad with medium veg was ridiculously flavorful and the rest of the dish was really good. Food had to be thin in order to provide a healthy balance, and my server had quite a temper with my choices. Plus, the food was so flavorful that we thought the soup itself was delicious and worth a visit to.As to the service, they have a lot of hard work ahead of them
restaurant is great! I wish we could come here daily to share plates and salads and just eat at home instead of going on a date night out! I just love the atmosphere and feel comfortable in my seat right now and eating here is NOT like so much being here to go find a few people.I just LOVE this place!
There is an amazing variety of Mexican and Mexican food on tap. i went with someone from zilch to sign the certificate. I went with a different Mexican and the food was just wonderful. they have everything you could want. Loved the sandal and the steak fondue i ordered. It was well seasoned. The food itself was flavorful. we are a casual eater and  didn't mind the quick service. also in a little surprising they will continue this tradition and they will host about 20 menu live and offer a drink. the cabejo, their the blend pizza, great! yummy.
Nice service but this one took a while
restaurant of a specialty. We knew that at this time there was not one tourist wandering around with hemlines/stickies as they wait for a table.  When he couldn't stand us at all he came and said we are patrons.  We think we gave him the benefit of the doubt but luckily the manager gave us the case and returned a copy in the mail for us, to let us know he was looking forward to being there soon.  We brought him here with the request that they try again after a week if not months to come back.  We found out he was not trying to be usent for real and he was simply rude and disrespectful.  This is not normal and we were very disappointed.
This place is pretty sweet, most definitely not the base for a Popcorn Drive.  It is slow moving but it makes up for it by having a few phenomenal dine-in seats.  Parking (manipulative) is a little heavy but
restaurant (and/or coffee/strawberry), and this may possibly be the best I've had here in Chicago since, with a pretty tasteful menu.  For the large sample size of patrons, it's not a terribly big deal, although if you don't want to wait 15 minutes for your order, don't bother.  The boys, who wear just about everything they go through, spend their time in each of the three swanky bathrooms, but their entrees go well with the wings.  All the main courses are well worth their time and effort.
H.O.V.H has such a great food, high in the "hey man" category... and good music.
HOLY PB&J is delicious. I can't wait to try it. This place is my favorite place in town and a MUST try. Have had this place for about 4 years and been to many places in the neighborhood, and still very satisfied...now the
restaurant, great beers, great food and great wine menu.We found the Grand Garden on Broadway.  The decor was comfortable with the ambiance and the wisps of sun and sounds of the outside balcony.I can not say enough good things about this neighborhood. I have been to a lot of Grand Garden bars and great restaurant(hello friends and family) in this neighborhood. The location, its location and location is breathtaking!It is, unfortunately, located in the heart of Downtown. At first, we thought they were going to put it in a different location because some friends and I said "Ok, maybe they'll not be a stand-in for the high-end pizza joint anymore". A year later, we were disappointed. From the moment we walked in we were immediately greeted with enormous enthusiasm and great food. This is what a great pizza joint is. From the wait staff and the wait times we were really happy with everything. After going a few weeks and being completely
restaurant: I've never eaten at this restaurant, which means it is fairly pricey when the menus are full.  There's no buffet option but if you need to make a reservation at 2:30 PM, there are really no more places you need to stop by for a bite.  It's packed, quiet, and cozy when there's a lot of staff, plus you'll be disappointed by the quality of the food and very quick service.
This is my first read of the Lounge, but I have tried it once and it's still my favorite dining destination in Chicago.  It's true, both major new areas in the neighborhood have perfected sushi dining, there are absolutely amazing moments, both of which are better than your average sushi night.The food is decent, with great flavors and varying amounts of deliciousness, but the concept here is perfect: which brings us to dinner one night.  Save up some cash and get the perfect appetizer and serve it at home to
restaurant's noted at has been lovely and experienced,but I've also tried lots of wonderful cocktails and I wouldnt hesitate to recommend the FOOD portion.  You will definitely love it.  I've ordered their MAO with its are so refreshing I don't even want to think about asking the server a couple times if she ordered their her own (it's up to you.)  But I will say that I must give these wings 10 stars because of their service (I know, it's a 'you can't go wrong with that, that's just crazy').  For just the YUMminess of this meal, I would recommend they don't let me stop them in, as if they are 'isolating' me from other diners - but the service would be so bad and they don't go in and do a peep-off!  Really, there are really only two restaurants in the city that can have excellent food to offer, and so they will
restaurant here. My friends and I love it.   I come here because I like the casual, appetizer-like atmosphere at the bar, which includes a beer garden and communal table.  Not to mention the seating of about 40 people.  If you'd like to try something new and this place may be a little crazy, don't forget to check it out.  I also thought it might be nice to have a table and some shared drinks.  We have been ordered at a beer garden and a communal table. It's very nice that this small open space can help people and drive traffic down.  Also don't forget that this is a place for anyone with a birthday present, Valentine's Day, or a special occasion.  I still carry a gnocchi sandwich.  If you like excellent, tasty, informal dining experience, I would recommend this place.
FINALIZED: Our visit on the weekday afternoon was the best I've ever had.

Not one can beat it.  Let me explain.  "Taste the fruit on a bagel, you see? Delicious, filling, protein-fortified with soy."Ok, so you're throwing away a lot of food on draft, without actually tasting it.  How can I get that bad?  Well, it's important to make your own preparation.  Basically, make sure that the plantain you're eating is fresh, with fresh ingredients, or else you'll run the risk of carnivory.  To find the ingredients for your cup of braised sweet potato, you may need to find a dairy-free meat eater.  Try not to work in his specialty of Belgian buns, sour cream or better-than-

i won't go back here - I like their chicken sandwich in an ocean of choices, but i felt like i was taking 5 times out of 4.

This place is a great stop if you want to buy somewhere new.  The food is so good, especially the salads!  The decor was ok, they were fairly simple and a little thin, however I think the service was worth it.  Everything was well done, a bit on the loud side, and the service was a bit slow.  They also make a giant stick of a glass cake, which is good too, but I'm not that into their flavor.  Prices are reasonable.
Great little down time for a Greek place.  We have never been to Wicker Park, but have been to on a few occasions with vegetarian and vegan friends.  Great food, easy to navigate.  The selection is very varied and unique, most notably certain specials, then a vegetarian tasting menu.
Went to Staunton early Friday night for dinner.  The
restaurant; an incredible seasonal cuisine and stunning food. (You could eat at lunch or dinner.) I would make my daughter and I a special treat to go to Chamonix or at an exotic restaurant I live in nearby. The atmosphere was dark, dirty and service was slow. Prices for breakfast were high. At two-fence they felt like they had a line running down the corner.Overall, we loved the restaurant and really enjoyed spending a relaxing evening on this planet.
Went to Milly's in May 2005 for the first time.  I had the food my family always wanted.  We ordered the organic Chicken Soup (Dine at 6:00am & Non-Gage) and we ate at a value with a comfort food combo of many types - Black Pepper Soup, Fried Chicken and Rock Salt.  It was BYOB, however, the quality is excellent, and the service outstanding.  The seasonal specials are fantastic, ranging from Saigon Spring Pork
restaurant for breakfast. A place that is known for finding great options for it's prices, customer service and delicious food.
After almost two weeks of visiting, I finally find my home in Ine Park! Ine Park is my first time in Chicago!  Seriously, if I had to choose my next destination, I would absolutely go there.  The food is incredible.  If I had to choose one, I would just go here!  Their food is great.  They're all over the place.  There is absolutely nothing better than that.  The sandwiches are even better as well.  I've taken on the Cindy Pork Fried Chicken sandwich.  So many options here!
This place is impeccable.  I also love the fact that the menus are extensive.  A vegan menu made up the menu of two to four dishes, and completely menu packed to last time I have visited.  They're a great restaurant, but if you have the space,
restaurant!  We chose a 4-star because of how it presented itself.  We will be back and will come back.  Make sure you get the water mugs and don't want them.  Don't get me wrong though.  They are tasteless, and my mother will never wear one.  Too much plastic.
I am a vegetarian for life so I often go to Hal Milgen.  The salad bar is open to the public and it is a great place to eat with friends.  Everyone has their favorite appetizers with a small list of different choices.  The girls are both extremely nice and friendly.  The downside is that they work very hard to create elaborate dressing rooms.  The server which calls the soup is not very attentive and does not let me choose my order.  The PORK IS just so amazing.  I don't have a problem ordering as often and this place does not offer anything special.
If you're in the
restaurant)...so very good for breakfast.
Cereal hole!  Ah, the culinary value.  Highly recommended!  Very nice cuisine.  Really small portions.  On my short trip to Chicago, my grandma couldn't take a burger off of the table.  I couldn't believe how good it looked on a napkin.
Must try! The location was so quiet that I almost stopped in when I asked what went on.  Service was absolutely poor and it only took me 20 minutes for a table break.  Very disappointed that I ordered a hotdog (which I was actually going for).  It was perfectly ok for a quick meal, but the good thing is that the wait was so long.  I would not recommend to anyone that likes hot dogs to go elsewhere.
The first time I went here was at Pho Express in Chicago.  It's a great place to get for lunch and dinner.  I have been to better Italian restaurants
restaurant plus the guacamole. My husband asked how I was doing when I said, "how is it, boss?" and he said, "I haven't eaten that much or used it in a while." He sent out a check to make it pay off and came back and said, "he said it wasn't worth the wait! My husband said they could send him back a couple hundred bucks but you've got to go back to Pizza Hut right? Who else needs those?" He ended by saying, "they may be just not a good pizza location, but they're not good at paying for it. Go somewhere else if you can afford to be hungry. You can be out of here at least 30 minutes before you get a table." Next time I go, I go to the breakfast store. My husband insisted he go in the other direction and take us there to buy a cup of coffee in someone else's name. He asked me what I did with my money
restaurant opened, there was a catch at the end of the bill: no customer service there.The sushi was honestly more of the Samele Style, while the way they serve grilled fish was terrible, the way they dress rice was excellent (even if overcooked). The wind raves about a 20% cut of my money without a penny going to soup to push the agenda, The margaritas were naff and the batter looked like gibbet if you tasted it.
Good.
I'll probably never visit this place again! I like this place great but in a different sense. It's an interesting time of year in Chicago, and for all its thrills, the food gets a little late and the service is less than attentive. It's best enjoyed with friends, which is nice. I'll probably eat there more often. Their mussels are very spicy, you can't miss them. The bathroom environment is pretty quiet and comfortable, yet there is a lot of decor
restaurant + plan. Not much to say.
This place is definitely worth stopping by again for dinner just for the novelty and flavors! This is the place to get an oatmeal latte,
This is one of my favorite places in town. The opening food (as well as the dishes) is great. The servers are super friendly and understand the house, which has always been pretty hard to find in Chicago. They make sure everything is brought fresh and delicious! The meat portions are small and they have lots of delicious choices when it comes to the pork. Good place for a great night out.
Fried oatmeal latte! Wow! We ate here our first time last year, and it was phenomenal!    The staff was great, and when I arrived to our table, I was impressed with how everything was cooked.   The best part is that they were extremely happy to give us our opportunity to leave.    The servers were nice to us
restaurant may be ridiculous.  But you want to be sure you take care of your waiter, otherwise you would suffer.  It is so casual.  Try someone else's experience on that table.  Not at least not when I gave them $12 for a Cuban place, which is an overpriced lunch.
It would definitely take more time if people are willing to go with us. We live about an hour away from nearby Chicago Ave. but it's a convenient location. Overall the service is excellent, the food is delicious and it's all packed. The menu is to die for, and the avocado - the best I've ever had. I will definitely be back.
great food and the best cocktails ever!!! dont put people off going there if you dont like what they have on tap  though i think a place like PLACOO will have you hooked again. but prices are unbelievable and don't understand why the cashier has to walk to a cashier and pay
restaurant, steaks and more (still dining there...elegant table to view the menu).
I've been here several times and I can only remember one time ever having it that positive. It has a wood-paneled ceiling, good music in a place packed with people, and happy people (gotta love the beer). Everything is great and I can tell by the service that their cocktails are GREAT. I love the food and the chocolates are delicious! I highly recommend every in-person visit, but it's better to come before they're on the table than before the service is on. This time I was not disappointed!
Food is nice and great. The bathrooms are completely clean - making the restrooms a perfect set up for fresh office nights - only the last thing on my mind was why the menu did not mention my name.  I'll definitely be back.  Would definetly go back if i'm not a big fan of the ambiance
restaurant for some good old-fashioned soup and cookies. And then I want to get our check from here for $5 and offer to be seated next to this dimly lit dining room. I mean waiters, waitresses, waiters! And to be fair, I'm not sure that I'm being rude at all. I do know that there is just a lot of good stuff at this place, and I just found that out when I checked the website. Being that I go to this place more times than I'd like, I'm able to afford cheap, traditional, and healthy lunches. The only people complaining are the tourists. They're always glad you're visiting this place. For the absolute minimum price of admission, this neighborhood is inviting and entertaining!
Great location, food is great and atmosphere is good.  My wife and I used to come to the Dinners one year, and it's now a full time job job.  I wish they could give
restaurant never disappoints. Bring out your friends!
The food is decent, but no, I don't recommend you pick up a dog or anything. I would come here to eat at any of my favorite places, but not so often I do, to make ends meet. I come here for brunch (4p) and be fresh, even if it's Friday morning. Most of my friends have seen the line come, and always kept their mouths shut. Their service is always a positive factor. And the beer selection gets really good too. This is a nice neighborhood neighborhood, but I'm an avid beer drinker (AKA the Biodynamic beer cellar). They have the best food I've ever had, and I can count on sitting down for every beer and veggie meal. My favorite part of the whole experience was waiting at the cafe, but it was sooooooo efficient and something I had to deliver out of the box to them. The food is fantastic though.
restaurant and wine pairing.  It's always better in the morning because when I'm at work they have one of these great specials on their menu.The staff here is always warm and friendly.
Over the past few years, I have been looking for a new place to watch the game or go to spend some time with my family. We were there a couple weeks ago and my sister and I ordered the Seasonal Curios in honor of My Little Blackcheese.  The kitchen was wonderful and the food was definitely tasty, fresh and affordable.  However, we were completely disappointed with how poorly the food was.  The Chef's booth was really small and over priced.  Our dish list was very limited and as a result, we had to take our food from the communal table and run it down the alley.  The kitchen staff seemed like they weren't too happy with how the dishes were and the food was not delivered.  We all agreed that the food was awful
restaurant, but luckily, I had to pay for it to my friend. We chatted up my wife and we asked for a table. She asked if she could come in and told us we could bring her food. The owner said he did not want us there and did not give us anything for a reservation and said they would make dinner at 7:30 or 8 p.m. On his way home he did not take my name off our dining bill. Now, that seems normal, but I felt very nervous and there was no way we could bring this into the restaurant. I was dressed right up, clean looking and walked in so that's nice. There is a small table at the end of the restaurant where you can look down the side area, which I recommend getting to avoid. She was very nice to him and he also took my number to a friend of ours.  She did not offer any apologies or thank yous nor did she hold any hands with our waiter
restaurant and amazing. My wife and I ate here several times as her husband watched us from the porch. The food was outstanding and I am glad I had the same reservations as the food was also phenomenal.
Rice now is my favorite place in Napoli with the atmosphere, the food, food to die for, and they'll be coming back again! Atmosphere is AMAZING and all of their menus are so juicy you won't walk away from getting more than one. If you're looking for good value in an appetizer, walk away here. The menu is awesome, the staff is friendly, and they'll explain it in a friendly manner.
Love food. But you can't really say good things about it unless you live in Italy!
Went there with a group of friends on a Friday night just for some lunch and we were as disappointed as you will be about prices, ambiance, etc.  Overall a great place to go for lunch. My
restaurant Quesadillas. I have been to four of these restaurants, and the side appetizer is pretty unique.
I really did not know how I would rate the above. Maybe it's something to do with the fact that this place is all about bad ol' eggs being turned into sausage, but I was in no mood for the "cheese dish," whoops. There was a whole menu of what I was left wondering about, but for $150, it just wasn't on my radar. This is another restaurant that, if they could find another fast-casual casual eatery on a relatively short wait, would do it. I went there on a whim after seeing the food here were typically high quality, seafood for the price of three to four quid would be getting the kick.  I liked to go here because it's always the perfect balance between good taste and good service.  The service was fine, but the atmosphere was a little too loud,
restaurant. From total frustration I think I went to $8 for lunch which the service was exceptional and the food was great. No complaints, just good food and food. The wine list was nice, as expected. Pizza, sandwich, and dessert was very tasty. The drinks were the best I have had anywhere, just very sugary. I had the 'they made a raspberry and the raspberry bar go'so that's who they are anyway' drink list, but I guess we'll have to come back for something else that's better.
I'm like, why did anyone get behind each other when I went there? It was hot and I would have gotten mad if I was at Nick for breakfast.  Definitely worth going back for something special. The macaroni and cheese was good, the service was good, and it was pretty good. This place is 5 star and a little pricey.
This neighborhood is a fun place for young couples, with only one up for
restaurant and great service. My husband and I ordered some of our own. Everything arrived promptly and I will be back for more.
Loved it! You will not go wrong here. I am over all proud of what this place is. I had the Pork Fries at Casper with seasoned cheddar. It was very moist and the service was wonderful. I've been in city has tried the Greek salad and everything was so good. Keep coming back!
The prices can be a bit pricey for a pasta-obsessed gal.I definitely have to spend more and look forward to going back for good portions.
I am incredibly sick and will never return.  My favorite restaurants in the whole city - its very crowded but they have great food!  I've been to a dozen to get a number of their wings right now and it's not too busy!  If you need much help or have to order a full fry do yourself a favor and head over to Al
restaurant next door. Can't wait to try this in Chicago!
What an awesome, fun place to eat, I recommend
I have always loved this food. It has a good lamb breast in my take home and it's great for breakfast.  The milkshakes here are always great too. It was also great when we came here for dinner for a date night as the wait staff seemed to be happy to know where the menu was and the food was delicious, the ambiance was also stellar.I love it here.  There are always a few surprises from time to time too, and the complimentary beer on tap is still fresh.
I just love this place, every time I go there, I always try and change my mind. The weather is such a nice change!  The menu changes day and night, and they always come with several entrees. I can't say enough love for this place and also be sure that you love that they serve food with it
restaurant.
The prime location for me, the beer garden. Next time, next time.
This place is just spectacular.  Fantastic wines and delicious food.  Do yourself a favor and enjoy it all the time.  New Orleans food has a strong flavor. You can't get more good than this.  Your hostess should eat it yourself. We recommend donning some empanadas.  Wait tables when it's packed for more beers and casuals are welcome.
This is a must go!  Pick up some wine on Wednesday at the back of this building.  It really will make you feel like you are going to spend most of your time there, and if you arrive late, we will even get you a table for you. I'd have gone to a different wine house instead of a different establishment.
hope my reviewers keep reading.  A small selection of beers are offered at this cafe which is also a great outlet for English speaking customers.
restaurant operations and Food.
STORAGE HOURS:First, the bus is at 7:30. Every hour is just fine. There are a lot of great Southern Asian places to try so go on through some of the fast foods in the neighborhood.
This place truly, without a doubt, the best mexican cuisine you'll ever come across!  Specialty's can be ordered on the stand immediately to satisfy a variety of cooking appetites.  Service is wonderful, high-quality fresh ingredients and tasty options to try.  I could eat at this place all day, but I would have to try something else.  The wait is expected - waitresses are super friendly and leave a pleasant smile on your face.  Staff takes care of any questions.   Can't ask for anything more than they give you.  The prices are reasonable; overall the food is good and the service is always friendly.
yummy :) Thanks to my Dad (i was
restaurant.  Enjoy the burgers for lunch or dinner or go home later and give them another try.
I like to get sushi. I usually eat on a date so I go with a Thai friend to try some the big plates and maybe even make a reservation... (from Thursday to Sunday) when this place is busy then I'll eat at 5am or 5pm (30 mins before the start of this time) and then order a black bean and joe and wait 10-15 mins and say "cheetecchi"! I went with a friend but I was busy so I thought I'd order those first orders later (about 45 mins before the start of this) the food tasted less like salad and more like something very special.  Also, it's BYOB, so waiters on the weekends can't be bothered with the wait and the place can just get a little cramped, but once again, good value!!
Glad to finally re-re-order our
restaurant at West 36th Street & US a block away. We were in search of good pastel and fruit. As we got closer we realized we hadn't seen any catfish there, so a roll of pizza was ready as well. It took almost an hour to bring one from and even after delivery, the food was okay but didn't seem to come together. This places everything I would want in a pint.
Just getting Started!!! Great food! Ill recommend my friend a try to get a cocktail too!
Dinner spot!!! My family loved it here. The cocktails are huge, our parents had lobster bisque I never had on hand, and the area is great. I'd suggest heading back to the rest of the city to check out the Delicatessen and such.
The food was great, the service was smooth, and everyone was on the same page to what the restaurant was all about. I always look forward to getting back to Peabody and
restaurant at least). I cannot wait to have my cup of chicken wings again, and I will not go back.
My favorite restaurant in Chicago. How could it not be so.  They come with a fabulous menu and really need to cater to everyone. They take great pride in having a great selection of dishes.  Check it out!
Ok so I like the service at 3 o'clock. But no I don't love the dinner. They are so busy lately that they have to use the most expensive blenders that I can find. And since the food is always good i usually don't eat enough and this is my standard, why do I not give them more orders over the years? I would like to think they are better staffed but that's like leaving a house full of truffles on the floor.I have been with other reviewers and will try to sum up the reviews there more than once in the review section.
My friends and I are here many
restaurant and kitchen, but the food can get pretty pricey (please treat yourself to some of the nicer lamb joints we've used). (Also, please don't give up hope that the New England/Massachusetts leg is going to break that second). If you are not thinking about trying dessert, you're probably already eaten your lunch.
This place is great, I think it is the best in Chicago, and I used to frequent it for a few years. But how much longer have we been going there???
Two people; the host and the restaurant are great and the food is worth the trip. Overall, it was really good. Service is great too, it's good to get to know people who work in restaurants like that. Food is decent too and still enjoyable.
Food + atmosphere; high end atmosphere; great selection; and plenty of space!
Great pizza, great meat
I have been to restaurants around the world and I've had amazing pizza. All I
restaurant, personal chef, meet the world of plastidians, caterers and bakers. Plus, with a little help from his wonderful wife, he brought their favorite food to Southern California. Then, he finally decided to give us our first taste of the success he felt was coming of delivering a rude, overrated menu to both our gamedevians and diners.We had the Salsa Sandwiches, which took two minutes for one person to order. It was very unique and the deliveryman was incredibly friendly. We waited for the "servant" to give us a "a nual", as he would have loved it when he delivered. We waited no longer than an hour to get our order (or while we were waiting for customers to arrive). The perfect event for a time-out!  As delicious as the foods, the food is often bland and slow. By 10:00pm we were eating and just barely eating. Despite our outstanding
restaurant

I love this place. They charge fairly high prices.  My food here is sweet and very good.
I've been here at least 20 times!  I've taken my husband, his wife, and my daughter to every Sunday night on either of the following weekends, and the restaurant has been always welcoming.  We have constantly been honored with complimentary drinks, but this has always had a much different feel to it than the gourmet entrees we have tried, which are traditional dishes that are otherwise very gimmicky and expensive.  We have to go now because we don't get so much filling.  Try the blue cheese pizza on the sides; you'll be glad you did!
these is the best food I've had in Chicago since 1998
1st and only time we're ever away!  This place gets around 90 miles per hour, I think it's 4 times a week!!!  The service is awesome and the manager also makes me feel good
restaurant service and service is superb, the portions are abundant and the services well worth the price.
a must have if you are looking for a delicious Chicago date place -  Just try it out!!
Not too pricey - the event - is overpriced, but delicious, pretty decent staff, delicious food and generally stellar service.
Very authentic American diner --  good when in the US!
Feeling comfortable?This place is very self indulgent and available on the weekend, but  don't let it scare you away from the Sun Grill or have dinner that is about to come without a bottle!  The atmosphere is very intimate, fantastic and friendly! Have fun - don't waste your time, and take the chance on a fresh slice of lemon juice from your favorite lemonade stand or ask for a little to keep things fresh - this is one of my favauts for this place.  They have some great veggies and you can even order from the street and not have
restaurant a good choice from 4 times: 1.) Rachak's Organic Pig Chop Shop, usually $12, and 2.) Chocolate Chip Cookies or Asian Toast. Rachak is owned by EASY SUSPECTING MOON. That is by far my favorite place to serve gluten free waffles. If you have any complaints about the  gluten free pancakes you go now! Everytime i go I just try to give the oodles of vegan butter warm cakes I've eaten elsewhere. The oodles of cheese are the taste, not taste, of ANYTHING I eat anywhere. Everytime i go, I want to have my cake so no guilt; there is no guilt. Anyways, if I get to eat I get an infinitely larger plate! My dad gets them. His partner gets them all the time. Always everytime i go I want them to get hotter. They just not take away from a regular order. If you want cheese, take a
restaurant and add garlic. 5 stars because you can't tell.If you live outside of Chicago, give the cinnamon glaze a try. It is very nice to have a little bakery at a local location and enjoy some unique flavors in general.I am also a big fan of flavored deliciousness, so I have tried al pastor, lime crisp, and tresse. This is my favorite. The price tag is very reasonable - maybe $20 a piece - I would still pick it up if I could. If you do not want to pay for your food, you will have to go and spend a lot of money and not have a chance to eat before you return. The pizza is very good though - delicious, good size portions, and light flavor. I feel like a big time guy, so for $20 each hour it has something for you. Would never go back (or worse, beg for something worse). If you really enjoy gnocchi (a big hit in
restaurant "The way I'm still eating. Seriously. It's just like you thought I'd find my way back to that restaurant, but with slightly less trouble.  The food here is great. The prices are just OK.  If I didn't have to be worried about serving the kid, I would not have recommended it so much. I'm just making some pretty good decisions, but there really isn't much you can do here." #2 :)
Over the summer I have lived in the Bay Area, which is where my hipness first appeared, and my friends here think I am one of the early Bay Area hipsters. (Yes, the Bay Area is not in great shape).  Many people are making disparaging comments about the architecture, or about every aspect of the place, because the food does not exactly match the taste of the pizza delivery guy or the interior decor.  In other words, all of the food presented is substandard, and none of the
restaurant is absolutely fabulous. It was on top of everything we were going for!We ordered one spicy shoulder chinese sausage on a Friday night, as well as one hot pork shoulder and some hot green peppers. The meat was sizzling good, the chicken was marinated perfectly. Would I go back? Possibly!Will not be back
Awesome food, pretty extensive selection of wines, and great service. Also got a HUGE lift- and delivery. Great music and  exciting specials.
Here are a couple of courses. A very helpful staff staff member has advice on a variety of things (think, way to get to know a neighborhood and business area or one was actually a little into inviting people to get engaged)...I remember hearing this place once on an East Coast show with Mel Gibson and he never stopped asking me questions to find out what I thought. He even asked me to come on on Sundays...Can't wait to go somewhere else in Chicago for over 20 years...
restaurant: Sushi appetizer & served rice buns are my faves but for a wine I think the service is my fav picture. Oh and the soup is awesome. And at least it's affordable!I'm in the city in search of the Tuan Co!
I love South Beach!! I would make a BIG reservation to go from Amusement Park back to the place that I love. We will be back - and I will definitely be back!!I really like the classic dishes that this place offers. If you're in North Beach, I recommend waiting about 45 minutes or so for their signature crab tacos! It is that casual and good service and atmosphere that keeps you going so you won't regret it! I highly recommend the Burger King burrito, which is to die for!!!
I love this place. Everything here is great. There are not many food options because they are split. It has great flavors to it and their menu is always top notch. They
restaurant #5206 of Shop you can see a pink giant pushing a gigantic pile of bottles full of oil onto the table on the edge of a nearby bottle dock on an empty stomach. That's right, there was a full ton of sauce in there. People will stare at the bottle we opened that wasn't not even a pile of beer in it. If you are looking to live like me, that's the place for you. And if you have some other beef beverage to grab, even a little!
My food was great, it was also good quality.  When we first got here, it took an hour and we only had one bill but it was worth it to get two  and a half bottles of meat.  When we realized that at least one of the meat - seared meat from the tip of your chopstick - had been steamed in sauce, the server said that it was better that we give the steak another chance.  She was very condescending
restaurant selection. Best of all - great food and friendly staff. I think people would like to try other beers, too.
This food was always great, we had the truffle head that made my tummy melt and good, friendly review. Food and atmosphere was good and also pretty good. Good taste on everything and a positive vibe.
I have just started going to Indian Grill in San Bernardino and I am very happy.  The  fish curry that comes out of the sushi is amazing and the chicken scramble soup is delicious.  Just my personal favorite.  The kabobs  are my favorite place in town.  If I can get in fast at the door here, my party gets the offer of the chair or the  apron.  You can't beat that!
OK; coffee here.  They don't use rude.
If you are looking for something a little more original (kind of like Fogo on a must in TLO) this
restaurant's sausage sandwich made with spices.  Not to mention that we also wanted to try a martini which was packed with fresh-made coffee mugs. The servers were wonderful as well as kind.The Spicy Crust Dining Room is open 7 days a week and 2 nights a week. We live in the area, so we definitely feel pretty safe in staying outside.  We're also going to be constantly searching for restaurants that do more positive things about promoting young and healthy eating while eating well.  If your in the city for a meal we recommend looking at this place.
If you don't know what the place is, chances are good that you don't know anything about it or it will annoy you.  If you haven't been going here for some time now and see much of a difference, the food is very good.  From the lengthy menu they suggest meats to the cheesy-esque sausage patties.  The bowl is high quality and the
restaurant. Even with higher ceilings and smokey friendly service!
Great food and atmosphere for dining. Also try The Wedge buffet for just $15 or higher, it's really one of the best deals we've ever had.
I love the zesty flavors.  A little pricey, but I usually go down to $25 for a meal.  This place has the yummy asparagus and the super salty okra.  It's different from all of the other Zucchini Entrees in town, just simple offerings from a creative chef.  And the prices are reasonable for the service, the food is the best in Chicago.
One of my go to places around town for lunch and dinner.... Have to admit, though the food isn't pretty, everything in this place is totally worth it. I love the steak with a melted heart, and the drinks are just right. Very casual. And with their size and vibe you can definitely tell they've got a
restaurant/roasted pork/fresh baked or pastries/cookies with pork tacos) and a pork pancake.  Not that it's bad, just it's on point. I order my meal around 5:30 until 8pm, so I generally get no food to eat before I leave home. The server basically tells me when you should get away from their office that I don't have to wait for hours and I get no chance to sit and eat after I do. The meat is good, but not incredible, just not worth the extra time. Overall i highly recommend this place, great service, great burger combo!
Ok, so what did I expect from this place? The food was really good. Maybe the bacon for an entree is more but I would have liked to order the bacon sundae too. I would have wanted to order the mac and cheese the next day at the office so i could put one on the entree so I can choose to eat
restaurant, butter tortilla sandwiches, waffle fries, and tacos) most certainly makes a great breakfast place, but has become so much more of an after-thought in recent years as well.  Don't get me wrong, I recommend the M&L instead, but this is a much more reasonable fare.  If you need to change up your house plan, this is definitely the place to go.
I've been to a bar a few times now and the owners are always inviting me to come to their people's home for drinks. For a first party at venue like this, I find it not so unpleasant. We each agree to sit together in the bar area and enjoy a drink together. I haven't had any complaints at all from the service, wine selection and staff, as far as I am concerned. I've been to the same table a few times and can tell from the time I've been seated that this place is so accommodating. The bar area is certainly
restaurant selection. Simply go to Yuca and your food will definately be the best - thanks Yuca.
I was trying to take a trip to Chicago for a review and this is NOT a nice place to go.  I thought it was great for a picnic or a weekend.  The food is really good and the ambiance is cool and welcoming, if you are up for something fresh and entertaining.  The food is always fresh, easy to order, as opposed to the taste-abusing kangaroo and pork - and from what I have found from yuca and japanese.  The service itself is good and friendly and the place offers free pizza and various appetizers.  I have been to kangaroo/rice and had enough for a month.  The chocolate bar you can order for $8 or more is small and has some kind of caramelized almonds on it which tastes heavenly.  Their  seats are VERY comfortable and relatively priced so we
restaurant was full, making brunch a little confusing. I just really had to try it out in a span of five minutes...Bingo! I ate nothing. I just sat there, pushed my doobies and delivered on that and no one was anywhere to be seen. Why wait so long for one of those people to finish off that great dish. Perhaps it's the fact that I felt a special sense of a shared memory, but for me this was an extreme sight. For such a small spot, we're literally one person walking into an empty bowl of sliced fish and regret that we got another one.  We felt like we were walking into the restroom, where somebody wanted to say hello, and we were completely alone, one student at a time. I hate to change but this place did seem to suffer from the same level of ambiance, and had the eye for the real food, which was nothing special at all. Perhaps this is a positive, for those high school
restaurant, and a Ixican restaurant in the middle of 3. I suggest you take an empty chair. Then, by the way, drink the beer, and enjoy yourself as the other people sit around watching TV. If that would only be fun.After you finish, have an elegant meal, and come back to tell those people where the food came from. As you go, plan on giving them a check to receive the food, knowing you'll send that to the next establishment. At the end of the evening, come back and say, "I brought what you asked for, and it was great, and the waitress took care of the rest."You'll never know, unless you'd left a tip on the table in advance.I'm going to write another review of this place on this site, but the money didn't get a star.Go to Pho Vietnamese Week on Friday. The food was amazing and my son loved it. However, we haven't been back
restaurant in the school parking lot. It would have been a better place to go to if only they would have offered it a normal service. My boyfriend ended up walking back out to the car parking lot for dinner and as he was about to get out, an employee ducked behind the rear-view mirror and grabbed his tail, so we could get inside. When the door fell open, the manager came out of the car, turned the key on, and started yelling, "Man, man, man, man!" The manager closed the door on us and walked out. He had not opened a door since he had been down there for 30 minutes. When we tried to use our plate, the manager got us a smashed bottle of wine, and ordered us a few toppings. He took off the labels, put them in a trash can, and pointed us towards the bus stop at a stop in front of a public parking lot, where he kept kicking people until he could get a
restaurant, extra-special brunch, free wifi, extra-convenient service, and good drinks at $15+. While keeping costs down, some small businesses have expanded the menu to include high-quality ingredients and offers fresh food every other Sunday during the week.We would like to thank our vendors for their dedication to quality at Piedmont-USA!
I won't say this place is meh. There is a large group of patrons but at some point you'll not be in too huffy. But it's worth it. There are plenty of options, and there's usually a smoothie to go with your sandwich - they certainly don't carry everything.The wait time is great and the atmosphere is fun. As of yet, I haven't tried it yet but I think it will be a great event.
Good service and good cuisine.
Great food, great atmosphere and great customer service. I usually go here around 5:30am. I make reservations at
restaurant. His perch was among the most warm and friendly on the rooftop.  We started with a large bowl of soup, but the amazing tangy blue cheese (aloe vermicelli) for the toppings was also good and was solid.  I'm still waiting for some non-Chinese go-go style steak mao jian, but the brisket was tasty and tender.The drink list was very focused on delights, and was not as light as others I've had.  I am very fond of Belgian brujoles with wood-fired sherry and acai bean sprouts.  I would give them 9 stars if I could.  I'll have to go back for them.
the server was very welcoming, and the service and response was very helpful. the steakhouse i chose to return to was so good with fresh fish and was quality, but sadly it's also overrated. for a place that has made me appreciate Ethiopian cuisine
restaurant and pastry baker back at The RetroVentives.  The food is fantastic.  So many options!  The most popular takeout item to the menu is the Pizza that comes with my bread/salsa sandwich (about $4.50 for just a slice of pizza).  My favorite has always been the Antipollinera and that's why I've been making antipollinera sandwiches for a few years.  I've been to their small vegetarian and vegan restaurants but I've never seen such great vegetarian food.  Definitely a must try.  And I've even been giving out autographed photos of these wonderful pizzas.
I have never really experienced authentic beer fare.  But that's because I am not a fan of big fish beers, or pork.  Especially not in my hometown, Salt Lake City.  I didn't know a long time ago that a beer named C's was a dark rye and a bottle of spring water. 
restaurant to the front with a warm chocolate bar. He didn't need to be a vegetarian as he came with fruit and was very attentive, and I got my chicken enchilada bowl. The shrimp appetizer was tasty, but the rice broth was bad for me. Aside from the service quality, the prices were outstanding. I would certainly return in the future.
What better restaurant to have a great brunch with friends, than the Sunday brunch.  What a experience it was!  From the kitchen to the buffet and the desserts, I really enjoyed my visit and I can't wait to return.  All in all, great restaurant!
Amazing! The food was okay. There were a couple fish tacos and four stews. Overall not a great experience. However the night was best on Thursday night.  The presentation was great and overall not too bland.
The reviews say it's worth it, this is a place that I enjoy to feast on breakfast-good stuff
restaurant (i am somewhat biased as opposed to salt but the rice is definitely worth a try!). The dishes were fantastic. They share the main course, so be prepared to try different combinations and options.
Had a quick dinner which left nothing but churros. Its one of those old fashioned waitstaff restaurants with a super soft I.D., but the rest of the top chefs are ex-Pentatonix, Crispist, mufkin Tofu, Ducati by Salvino, Coconut Cabbage, and Chocolate for an Indie diner!  It was the worst food I have ever had.  The real star is the menu and the only thing you have to do to finish is bring the food which is limited.  Simply and obviously not worth the $30ish isk and those food items you must give away for a chance of winning!  That being said, I highly recommend this restaurant for a meal with friends and relatives as a celebration.

restaurant ratio, i think it is our best. I think we use wine made to order. It was great. After my get together, some salad bar food was delicious. We also ordered the ginger curry and cheesecake sandwich which is fantastic too. I'm honestly not going to go back if I had to.
My boss has been here a number of times and I have been really impressed. The food is tasty, the atmosphere is unique, and it is open 24/7. I went to La Salle for dinner today and the food was pretty good. I had the beef braised feta cheese rancheros with good caramelized onions, a wonderful tomato sauce and a great variety of other sauces. The mussels were also not only delicious but they were well cooked! I'm going to be back.
This is the place for this vintage band and music!  If you are looking for old favorites for our Napa trips you will not be disappointed!
My
restaurant on the Willamette.  We arrived there about 2 miles after our visit.  As a sushi surfer we were impressed with the atmosphere.  I mean this is California, you go to sushi restaurants, and this place does not care.  The people there are completely normal people and we also ended up eating at the sushi bar there.  Overall, what we had was of a fairly average tasting sushi experience at an affordable price.  The portions were the best I've had in Chicago.  I would absolutely go back.  I went with my daughter and my fiancee from Down Under and have had some great sushi there already.  The service is wonderful and it definitely deserves every dollar that it's at.  Our waitress had great service and the owner, Doug, was very gracious when we asked him to send us dinner.  Doug helped us during our nap so we were seated at a large table with half of our plates.  We were very pleased with
restaurant Mushi on weekends and occasions with special guests. The food is different and the presentation of the food and service are awesome! The lobster rolls are pretty tasty - some of the best in the Bay Area!
A lot of good food here for a good price, the restaurant is very busy, you might come down to go eat here or with friends.
Not a mecca for tourists...because I do not think it's really great. I came here to eat with friends and thought it was maybe not worth that price.  However, I loved it.  I'll be back for the rest of my life.
My wife and I don't go far as much to visit Chicago, but our favorite restaurant is an Italian pub.  This is an outstanding experience that takes place within one of the city's iconic restaurants. The food is nothing extraordinary like it sounds, but the service is excellent and we can get everything we want here. I recommend the lobster roll. 
restaurant. In addition to making it well worth the extra service.
Very nice restaurant!!  Very nice small restaurant to go to and grab a drink before going for dinner.  We go for lunch and have a very nice time but unfortunately, the food doesn't seem to get any better than that!  I have to say the bbq chicken dish looks almost done on paper, but makes the food so much better.  Otherwise, there is not much on the menu that's really surprising to say the least! I like the open kitchen but it's not that great, especially with the raggedy hostess.  Anyway, we're going to go here for lunch and my friend says the food is great but that people in their late 20s were still eating, so I will go back and try the beef bun instead!
I was talking with a girlfriend on Tuesday night and she seemed happy about my plans.  I did say, however, that it was a
restaurant for an evening and it was incredible, I will be back!
I was visiting to Chicago last week and I remember coming in and feeling like I was in a third world horror movie. I was expecting a gothic horror night, but I didn't think I was going to be disappointed.My boyfriend went to bed with an amnesiac headache (which seemed similar to eating whole broccoli) and it quickly became a full on nightmare. As soon as I heard his name came over the phone, he immediately rushed out of the room and started running, sending me the initial call as he heard some gothic screams. After I told him where I was going, he went and got me straight back, only to be completely bewildered. I thanked him and I cried for over an hour and a half of suffering, my stomach ached up a little. The next thing I know, the guy who was in the middle of screaming yelled at me for not shouting enough and
restaurant and cozy atmosphere!Our owners have been a few regulars during our wedding at Hot Doug's for about 30 years. If we wanted to have a simpler visit and have a real treat, it would have been all about the best pizzas we have had.  We had grilled tomatoes, sausage, burgers, fried rice, and greaseproof hot sauce (some are just a little like just dipping meat), but it was always worth it to get here.  It would've been perfect if we could just bring our kids out here and take over the restaurant and give the rest of us a bite to eat whenever we want!  Our friends who don't frequent the restaurant are coming back!
My husband and I both love this place and it's a favorite of ours so far.  I have heard lots of hype about the food and the great owners.   We came here during the holiday weekend with two of our friends - our first brought their kids and our second
restaurant and dog.
We had dinner there on another occasion. As you can see, we had a bad experience. When our waitress gave us the minimum rating of 4 stars, we promptly took a long nap on the spot. She called it inappropriate, considering we were sitting alone and not dining in on a party. Fortunately, our meal was healthy. We recomend spending something like $200 to recoup the wasted time we were wasting in the restaurant.
Soooo good food. That's the thing with X on either The Streets or Grand La Interior. They have the best wine selection in the country, especially the pizza, and an amazing selection of small plates that are catered to from start to finish. They also have a lot of their local wines on tap so that if you're in Chicago and want to dine at the Barber Shop without it being super crowded, don't hesitate. I am definitely not a favorite of their staff to go out and order dinner
restaurant, while we had the breakfast omelet. Hot off the presses, we tried some other favorites from the menu, including three salads; some entrees, which we both enjoyed. A small portion of the menu was actually excellent, but it was less than we expected.The potato salad and brunch came out beautifully, but the potato and omelet were both filled with flavor. The omelet was basically the best tasting, and the salad was not. We especially liked the wasabi oil of the wasabi bacon. The wasabi was very sweet and friendly. The delivery guy was very helpful and patient, too. The isabi had a very satisfying coconut buttercream. I think we enjoyed all three items.
Vancouver,
good.   I tend to be very picky with only 4 things I give the Blue Bell.  I can't beat AIM's selections on a daily basis.  Having served at Lefort from 10 to 15 times
restaurant prices are better in town. I've been here three times now and expect the service, well cooked food, and really warm ambiance to last.
Thanks guys!  Really nice lady! I can't wait to go.  Well worth the wait.
This place is so good! I love it!!  The food was incredible! I had the crab and the smoked salmon I had.  The seafood was tender and flavorful.  Definitely worth the wait.
  Stays high at $6 for a breakfast, lunch or dinner!  One of the better sushi places in town and I will definitely be back!
I love this place!  I am a new ht mom, and since we visited this place last year, I was about to try anything else in town.  When we first checked, they only brought us a selection of meats and a few specialties.  We ordered the lobster and lamb chop, which they split down into pita and
restaurant, there was simply no table service. We were told that we should order one drink to get to the bar and we were ordered three drinks. One of the bartenders proceeded to take our order without touching it before we could place it.  Our waitress, a serious waitress with a light complexion, and I do not agree with her but the other two bartenders were clearly engaging with our bar staff in a rude way that should not be tolerated at the bar. I have never been offended by this situation at any other place in Chicago, so we will not return until I have been through the experience.
Tremendous Service in amazing cuisine. Wow....
My new favorite restaurant! Love, love and love the unique mix of, appetizers and dishes. Try!
I am always looking for great food. Love, love and love the legendary Pimento pizza, inspired by muy llo the name.  Well at least we got there a little late though
restaurant to write a review on. While their food definitely isn't as great, they certainly have some of the best place in Orange County for vegetarians or vegans. For dessert I tried the mousse and order it after sitting down for the last 45 minutes. Pretty fantastic, though. At $15.00 it is not much compared to where the beef had it to be. I suggest getting that meal with your friends and try it out.
Yum yum yum! Great food, and maybe one of the best experiences I've had on the chocolate chicken wings. They have a great variety of desserts, snacks and appetizers, and a nice selection of vegan margaritas.   Yum yum yum yum, so take a chill-out, and don't miss their event on May 30th.
Came to Dans de Courcy for brunch with friends on a Friday afternoon.  The seating was small and our reservation was never filled
restaurant; well worth the 10% wait to get there.
I went for brunch on Thursday night with the dad when he was outside, and he immediately gave me his number.  We were sitting in front of the wall opposite of the restaurant and the manager would start getting a kick out of us.  I remember saying hi to him while he was probably entering the restaurant that morning, and he had the idea to open some food menu on one of the tables he had in the dining room.  I won't be going there again, as it just might cause staff confusion.  It was kind of confusing.  I am hoping this food menu might be enough to get me past what I'm dealing with.  If not, I will certainly do more.  It is definitely a different experience from what you would get on a Friday night.
Seriously eating better cheap food in Bunch- so why not try it?  This place has the best falafel in Chicago
restaurant, I liked what I read about Toulouse, and a pleasant atmosphere. I think they could have gotten out of that town by the way. I would definitely go back again and be disappointed.
Lucky open brat, who cares! Best WOW EVER! !!!!  The menu is massive in size and the prices are on point - my second and 3rd visit together is worth it.  The food was reasonably priced but the salad bar was well served by the owner and was excellent.
The food at Toulouse is decent, reasonably priced and it's only two months old. The atmosphere is cozy and cozy but doesn't detract from what's really cool about it. The staff is awesome and I really enjoy my coffee.
Great place for a meal with friends. Toulouse is located on two sides and is very spacious. Perfect for a BYOB or for your kids. I live in 10 mins and was looking for a place to sleep
restaurant. Will ever again!
Being from out of town, but remember this place has a totally unique atmosphere to it. Ima, the ambiance is great as well, the dine on service. Why not?
I want to suggest this place isn't too bad - overall they have a great sushi experience.  They have great karaoke, great pig roast, and famous Japanese pastries too.  They also have great beer selections, usually they go with steaks too.I have found this place to be THE cheap option... with no deal... there's nothing to complain about.  Come on down soon, you will soon be ready for a cold roll of wings!
I was extremely excited to try BLONDE at Neumat, as I was the first to have been there and we were all very pleased with our encounter.  The atmosphere and service is exceptional and there is never a bad thing about Neumat that we didn't mention.
restaurant can come out of it. Good food, great service, great cocktails, great drinks and cheap prices to keep up with the hype.
Food was good. Food was way out of line so I probably left with the kid at the bar for the perfect breakfast...I have been there and again....
I love this place and everyone is awesome!!! I can't wait to go back and have a nice night of this place and I know it is coming soon.  I would definitely go again!!
Love the octopus  but also the garlic shrimp (spicy, sometimes you need garlic shrimp to use this dish).  Also, I think the margarita is incredible as well.  I've eaten there a few times now and I haven't been disappointed.
The chicken bibimbap is the best thing I have ever had. My mom  has chicken wings all over the place, and this seems to be a huge influence on my food choices. Even
restaurant and add a high-quality complimentary appetizer.  The number one thing that I've found to keep me coming back to Perrie is the addition of the Orange Pizza.  This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.  I want to go to the dining room in most places like Andersonville if possible.
great bar and great food. come on, enjoy, there is so much that gets eaten.
Quick trip to Coworking on the East Coast. The food is great and it is simple and comforting. The service is great too. Great atmosphere and the staff is on point and knowledgeable too. I will definitely be back. I highly recommend checking out
Delicious Mango!   This place has always been my go to place for a friend or a family occasion.  The portions are all perfectly designed.  The size, product and selection of fresh mango juice is unique and adds to the flavor and enjoyability of the food.  When it
restaurant. We walked in with orders which were very polite but didn't match their expectations. Our waitress came by who told us the flight cost $150 and she thought our package was too much for some of the number of people sitting in the waiting area. She proceeded to yell about the service. When we finally arrived it was half an hour before our table. She insisted that we wait for another hour as she said it was a 'boys game' and that we have to pay for it. At that point I gave her a compliment that she was very hard working and asking for us a small difference. She later asked us if we could push it past her but I did not think I could. Once seated, I complained that the side menu had a lunch menu so that meant we could go from here. So we waited for another hour and the wait for our food had finished. I was disappointed with our service and money saved and we did NOT return! Another of our customers complained
restaurant: Bulgogi's Thai deli. This places an extraordinarily high end catch with tons of options and great atmosphere.
Little did I know about this place before coming here. The service is definitely top notch, and the atmosphere is very, very good. The pizza tastes great. We gave it a try a week and it was perfect. Our reservation for lunch was at 9pm so we left early to wait, but by 8am we heard it was time to go. The food was fresh, not just horrible, but I tried it twice. The place seemed old and greasy. The waitress was too busy doing something stupid to make a difference. Then we had to try it again, which was way more appropriate. I really wasn't enjoying the food, it was filled with killer. The baguette soup is amazing! The tuna soup was top secret, and there was great smoke but not almost as good as the bread. The Pizza sauce is terrific as well. The

It's a fun and wonderful outdoor experience but if you're looking for a warm, well-deserved holiday treat, this is it! The best part? Don't miss this place!
My roommate and I stopped in for dinner when our friend and I were browsing across the aisle and found a decent table. I can't imagine having a really bad time eating this place at 90hz. It's not exactly expensive but you definitely won't be disappointed!
My new favorite food spot! Great ambiance and the food is fantastic and welcoming! Great locations and happy hour!
My coworker and I lived in the neighborhood this year for two years. Not the best mexican environment for a local or international eatery. Great food, unique selection and friendly staff. I also love the buffalo chicken!
The Service was very great for my time. The wines on the bottle were very good
restaurant, ugh! has plenty of seafood. The weekend menu to go makes it worth your trip. Not to mention that we did order pizza for 12 hours! The Pizza Chop was loaded, it was great, and the chicken basil sauce was one of the best I've had anywhere on menu. I went with the kids because my bill is lower than the servers expect, and they are asking for "special and special parking." A plus, is that I won't have to wait in line! Thanks Dave!
Cheese is great! I like the textures. Other than that I think they are really good. I got to wait outside the restaurant hours and only had one table, so if you want a good dinner I would go back.
He... had a lovely meal. What else did you ask for. They have a lot of popular items here. Eat in person and you wont pay a lot for it. My husband loves fresh bread to go too, and
restaurant). Although it's more packed than I thought, the prices were right. The appetizers were incredible. My friend liked the mojito and love the red velvet soup - great! I felt rushed in there since it was mostly vegetarian. The jalapeno wasn't yummy and was quite cold. The chicken was also NOT bad, cooked perfectly with no caramelization on it. Definitely the best food in town for a hot dog.The servers were very knowledgeable, clear, and capable of providing a prompt service. Even if they weren't the type of person who likes to order extremely rare items, this place was in and of itself one of the best options we have seen. Highly recommended.
I love how this Italian joint is run.  This restaurant keeps the other components to themselves.  All things considered I am not going to go back.  Even though it takes about 5 minutes to open, and the service is stellar, I can assure you this is what

The place had many of the best Italian food I have ever had!
I am a sucker for basil and the crepes.  This place makes it difficult to carry around but adds to the taste a wonderful variety of dishes.I have gone to this place twice now and both times it was a very full-service service place.  If you want to try these dishes and enjoy the ambience of their dining, try this.  It's a true dining experience and fun to go with friends who love basil.The food is good as is the drinks you can enjoy.

restaurant at a very slow rate - there was no quality sauce on top of the crowd! It's like each and every one of us was drinking at least four glasses of wine, and at about 25 minutes past the end of the meal, we all got more and more drunk. At one point, I felt nauseous because I was so much drunk that it seemed I could go back and try to rewind a few times.We both agreed that it was the worst I'd ever eaten, and while it was at that point a little unsatisfying when we finally ate, I was not pleased at all. I'm glad that I've gone back, but this wasn't the first time I'd done this.
Food's awful. I love the food here, but I'm an egg lover.  This place is way too salty to order from a regular grocery store, so it would be a perfect little option if you are looking for fresh seafood.  The other place I'm
restaurant  Village Cafe   has something called Food Belly is totally excellent and is well worth the price.  I don't have room in my house so I wouldn't mind going back for dinner.  Love the ambience.
I love this place!  The staff is wonderful.  Their cheese is terrific and I love having the Italian Cheese Sandwich.  They always make the food stand up for me.  Friendly people and great food.
It takes about 1 hour to get around here on a Saturday night. I usually sit in the back porch with the wife and kids and when they come around this is really great because its very small and relaxing and relaxed. The salad bar is a dakimaro cheese roll topped with meatballs, marinated rice and popcorn. Their cheddar cheese is delicious and their pizza is good too.I recently bought a smoked paprika and enjoyed it!  Their salad bar is amazing.  They have tons of items on their menu

Fresh Baked Garlic Sunda Salad with Balsamic Dips

This was my first time eating here, I was a seasoned server in the kitchen and had wanted to take advantage of our great service. We are in a very trendy and affordable neighborhood and had not really been to be very excited about this place. The service and decor is really nice and was very light on occasion. We ordered the lemonade because I would love to try a full size sunda right now and the food was good but it wasn't in my taste. I had an entree with a couple of local friends and I love this place. The waiter is professional and the food is really good.
My name is Luke James and I grew up near D.C. and was introduced to veganism. My father was a vegetarian as was his mother.  I had never felt vegan before, but having a good reason to make vegan diet was a good idea and looking at other
restaurant.
Unfortunately, the entree here is ruined by the number of pasty sandwiches we have... then not only is the interior decorated in what they call pseudo-historical decor without the ornaments, but with a self-proclaimed "in the wild" brewery beer house running the show. It's ridiculous, and what a waste of that empty space.  One place will never make it.
I believe I know what's good and what's not, but this is the worst appetizer in the city. One of my friends had the Zucchini. It was ok; yummy. Filled with subtle notes of garlic and mushrooms and cilantro like a dollop of yogurt? I imagine cheese or meat will suffice. Even mediocre appetizers like the Bonito Pad are pretty good and honestly not too bad either. The other night a woman drove by in a motorcycle that was on fire. She demanded the bacon which was served, while she was lying in the
restaurant: the Cantina El Paolo. Bread goes beautifully with the tea in it (alas, this is a brick.  The staff is great; busy, but friendly). Don't miss their spaghetti special.
Great drinks with a bit of stuff added for a nice price.  Parking: I live about a block from the bar.
love this place. amazing chicken fried  wings (a little too salty and on the pricey side for me but still there) and bean burrito with lime juice.good vibes and good atmosphere and service.
This is a great spot for me when I wanna eat in Chicago, never stop waiting at my table. The food is good and drinks amazing. The cafe staff is classy and attentive and is also very warm.  My favorite part is they have the martini which is pretty good and spicy as well as light and good. If you want a better, but better, Italian beer, I suggest waiting on one of their
restaurant in red sauce.  The waiter of honor went by the name of "Stag."  He seemed to be very picky about food and service.  I liked the boss in this restaurant, but there was so much entree here that I never thought I would experience the way he treated my restaurant.  In any other restaurant I would eat here.  If I can't find any better dish out there, the chains will take my place.  You will not be disappointed.  I know people who have gotten the Michelin star for their servers but I am positive you will not notice any changes or get hungry for sushi.
This place is generally safe for business, but this is a different problem. They make food run out of your kitchen - even around here... always in a hurry. I don't eat there often, but there were so many different restaurant places that I just needed to eat some, but they made me feel like they were somehow open at least
restaurant was nice, but I had to go to Togo and it was very hard to find this place. There was no one there to greet me. I would definitely go back, especially if I can't find the place there. Thanks if you like it!
This is one of my favorite Mexican places!  I've been to many, and the best part is the menu is always very well crafted and very fresh.  Even the torta, with chicken and tortas - much like what you would get in that neighborhood!  They even have a rustic bar. 
This is a great spot for lunch or dinner.  We love to have a place where the meat is cooked before being poured on to our loved ones, and the service is fantastic.  The food is really fantastic too!  Service is good too, not to mention good, considering all the food that we ordered.  Food, beer and wine is great too.
Had this place this
restaurant - feel free to rue the face of my Restaurant. The chicago deep dish stand (yum!), the deep dish noodle soup (mildly prepared) sandwich, arugula fries, bean sprouts, and/or  beef steak will get you what you want. These amazing things that you get don't just happen. They come in 4 sizes.You MUST try them before heading to Japan for another bite.
We've been to Jones's twice now and first time both times were extremely disappointing.  I hope to give them a chance in at least three more years because I agree they are it's a mess.  They now have NO future.  We are not allowed to sit in a room next to a breakfast joint.  At this point in our lives we are overjoyed that everyone knows everything about Jones's.  No one has taken an oath of service to perfection like myself.  You must have been given the HASTEWAG
restaurant is really amazing and the atmosphere is amazing.
This place is definitely worth a visit because it has a large amount of room and it's a great space for those looking for really deep, quiet, intimate and unique dining experiences. Each night is different, but we were pleased to have this great open option in Northern California for dinner.  I have visited around the US before and it is definitely one of the best and tastiest in the country.I really enjoy their variety of products.  They have as much fish you can eat as possible, there are several variations on every flavor of seafood so you are never disappointed!
YUMMY!!!! Wow! This place is unique and one of the best tasting in the city.  We were ordered to sit down, appetizer and order something and it was awesome. The service was not much, but the food is top notch and we loved it.  Just check it out!
This is my favorite restaurant in Waco.
restaurant.  We tried our regular omelets and the omelet you find here was very healthy with a nice creamy balance of flavor.  Both the yummy food and the solid service are special.
one of the top pizzas in the city is one of my favorites. We've had the Mole dish that is the main thing for me... we had a goat sausage and pickled onion pizza. I highly recommend this place!
not this, though it's BYOB.
I've had all kinds of pizza here, most pretty good. On a Friday night, I went to Heart or Bon Capita (around 90 degrees) for a place to be yourself. In the mornings, or at other times, people were playing us some of their favorite cards.
I tried all the potato salad and pork belly salads for the first time at Bon Capita. I was very disappointed. It was a bit pricey, but it was delicious. I don't mind cheap
restaurant I've eaten at will make you consider it a wonder of yore! Save and enjoy!
The food is alright, but the food quality is dandy, the management wasn't so nice about the response they received to one complaint. The sushi wasn't very appetizing at all, but for a couple of things I found it of interest.  About an hour into the meal, the waitress told the waitress a wonderful description of the barista.  It is a six-story bar and I don't know about the hot sauce we used, but the waitress did not get into detail.  We sat down at the bar and enjoyed each other's company and complimentary wines.  The owner of this restaurant was a typical lady who seems to expect nothing from a bartender, as if he could not be bothered. The menu was very plain, which I think is a sign of deep dish quality.  Overall the food was just not worth the price.  And only if you
restaurant - hold up) $12.00 1/2 size less bag - get a parking spot and sit down if available. Very nice place to go when it is cheaper at my expense.   We order items and sometimes they forget to give us our proper money order.  They will just order the entire menu and tell us to keep it very simple, they only order their appetizers.   Also, they only serve tapas and anything else the don't bring.  So like much worse.   Finally, they will tell us to save the cash, think twice about it.  Nice place to meet new people and relax and have some beer before work on occasion.
I was craving dinner here last week. It was nice to be able to order quick and easily the appetizers. If you are a restaurant lover then this place is awesome. We tried a bunch of different items - as many as they could carry with them. The Chicken - a side dish
restaurant: Its a cocktail! Yes, a great place to hang out and bring a friend or two!
Try it! Come a friend if you need a drink. This place is by far the best place to grab a refill at.It is usually crowded, and its bouncy. If there are people at this diner who are sitting in their chairs, you should probably wait. If you are a traditional crescent moon eater, I suggest you try maybe another one in the back.
Food is great.
Went here for dinner while my wife and I were visiting (very busy, only one person wanted to make a reservation, we all paid around $10/gig), and it was great! Food was good! Will go back. The wait was great, service was quick and delicious. Will definitely be back.
I am a pizza snob so this place is a must go place for a good pizza (even if there are a lot of pretentious people
restaurant is often delicious, always providing a quality, old-fashioned menu of delicious Greek food that is full of variety and awesomeness. We love making reservations here!
Went here last week, and the wine list has gotten pretty crowded for us, especially considering the location and atmosphere.  Well, we definitely won't be taking reservations until we are completely satisfied with our wines (at least not yet).  What will happen to them, is that they will no longer accept reservations unless you include over-priced wine and at the same time go over priced.  And if I am the only Wine Advocate here, I'll send them a notice telling them they will need to stay open for drinks (they're two from New Orleans).
I had the first bite of Chinese char jiao at a great price. It was yummy. I went with two other friends and our waitress said the food was great, everything was in perfect shape, and they gave us an update
restaurant in the city is no stranger to fish. The pork dish is close to what you would normally order, i think this place has long tables. There's always something to be had on the atmosphere. My favorite in Chicago is how you feel when the young ladies do an open date and dress for the night, i have never been so easily beamed off at home by them to the room where they lounge. My favorite for young people and I was asked why I went there I said that I am always there and that i love the area, so I feel like I am actually in a good spot here.
I have a difficult time finding a server who can come across to me and give advice on my menu. When I first started talking to Flip And Flop I was unsure what they were going for. It's a pho place, perfect for a Vietnamese or all brunch, it's a quality restaurant and everything is great, it's fun to get away from that
restaurant is absolutely amazing. Very very pleasant service. The rice-bone dip is as fresh as can be while the lobster rolls are raw. Great for those that want a fancy view of wine country.We will definitely be back!
My daughter likes this place to an insane extent, and she hasn't been to his for years.  We were a couple from out of town here, and came in just for the chance to sample his offerings!  I'll be back soon for food again, and as we're looking forward to the Chicago/Restaurant that has America's Next restaurant growing up.
Best live music out there.  I'm glad to go back, it is BYOB - but the only real downside to this place is that a hostel does not allow wait staff from over 75 hours before an hour before their scheduled lunch time.  Waiters that have waited so long do not give their time.
I was a bit upset when my son's birthday
restaurant, lale if we need that, sweetheart.
Stable food and great service is nothing special that pretentious little restaurant owners would give to a random little waitress who apparently lived on Hwy 12, they didn't want to throw out tables.  Mayan cuisine never lives up to this hype, the yummy godawful ambiance is really 'pretentious'. As a waiter, you don't need to order the original Chinese menu but stick to it at Hwy 12.  Not good either but by far the best restaurant in the city.
I absolutely love this place!  I spent 5 bucks for the food.  The atmosphere was great, the food was huge, and the service was great.  Also, their sassafras are great and fresh and delicious.  I love their sit down beef dishes...well done Texas.
This place is awesome! We have been coming here for a couple months and i only had the dessert. The
restaurant, cheese, mozzarella sauce, and pizza. Also, this pizza didn't disappoint.The atmosphere is tight and the food is incredibly healthy.  Please get this one with the mac and cheese and it's great.Delightful fish dishes and full of variety.  Would love to hear any other reviews from you!
I actually went to Tempe New Ed's to take the students' tasting menu to heart.  The menu was well prepared, and the menu was well thought out. The best part is that we were given a free try!  The salad bar really was spectacular, which took a lot of work to figure out.  And, the pizzas were really juicy.  The combo plate was yummy.  If you aren't familiar with freshest pizza in town, this is the place for you.
Great service at a great price! If you are not a dog fan, then this is the place to go.  I prefer a
restaurant chef with nice son.
I really wanted to give this place a try since I like it so much.  It is definitely one of the best Italian restaurants in this city.  I took my sushi there and it was amazing!  Since they have a huge selection and their duck scallop salad is one of my favorite things to try, they offer everything I like.  This place can go out of its way to get you something.
I came here for a variety of reasons and could not come up with a single dish that I did not like.  When I came in for the night I got a pretty unusual choice.  I had this burrito! I was a huge fan of this particular burrito, and so I always get a sandwich and roll.  I also had the fried chicken for $6, that we both wanted and we both got a hot smoked veggie stick salsa when it was delivered!  I ordered the Roja Carnitas for
restaurant-priced menus. Its a little pricey, but it was a must try.
I love this place! It's so peaceful and amazing. So good with coffee and lots of variety.The atmosphere is always very lively and fun.
Super soft, clean, romantic, almost like another great little restaurant. Chicken hands are special.  Enjoy their chicken dishes and make sure to eat at their private library.The atmosphere is not too noisy or crowded or like real coke bar, which is what I would have thought. The only downside is that all they were doing was serving different types of food.  They are definitely trying to throw people off their food.  We all know that coke is hard and the food there is still impressive but the food in Coop is dry and the alcohol is still terrible. So while we can enjoy my short nap and book a friend-in-law's hot dog... you will have to walk a lot longer in Coop to get
restaurant.  We always had enough for our server to know how much we needed and so we waited until he ate our meal and then returned.  Our food was not impeccable but something to behold and as the 6 week experiment got better we were told we would get better again!  We still had portions available, but the sushi was not coming out quite as we had hoped, which is another reason why it is fine to go to a friend's restaurant as well.  When I suggested it to a restaurant manager we were shocked but still had something to say.  We will definitely be coming back.  We will enjoy the ambiance we'll be staying at and the food was to die for!!
Great place to dine or have a casual date!
I usually don't like Greek and don't usually come here for anything other than the tastiest food.  They have the finest selection of sandwiches, burgers, and veggie burgers!!
I have been wanting to
restaurant +95% Pricing.
I went to this place for lunch. Great!  Ambiance is good, food is great, atmosphere is awesome.  The service is very friendly.  I can't think of one negative thing that happened to my try these places since they were new and the owners told me I have to wait out the rest of my meal order.  They have 5 of the best dishes on the East Coast for fast food but will always come back.
This place will be amazing! I live in Arrington, OR and wanted to order from here!  They have a massive selection of grilled meats and appetizers and are truly really good!  Our server was very helpful and took us to a quiet restaurant for lunch.  She took our order and our names were added and instructed us to check our credit card and get our orders verified.  We was told by her we would have to wait 5 minutes to get our order!My question though is is
restaurant: Olive + sweet sweet - almost everything was perfect  I will try the other times I go.
I love this place! The place is huge and cozy. They all have vegan friendly dishes (carrots, garlic challah, kafu), and friendly staff that love the vegan offerings. I'll definitely be coming back! My favorite thing about this place is that it is small (I personally had 2 table's to be able to sit on) and it looks really nice, all in all, a great place for a small party.
Wow! We live in a small neighborhood where you have an underground restaurant. How could any of you not be impressed?  It is cozy and simple, and delicious.  The only thing that fails is that my wife and I feel awkward waiting for it to open. It is worth knowing that I can easily give up on eating from here after the long wait. If you like steaks, be sure to try Sabio's
restaurant at Tea and Tea and US service.
As far as I can tell, their amazing food is consistently good.I went there once for a lunch when we moved to a bigger, nicer house and I felt like I had come for a meal. My server led me through the menu of selections and then asked me what each dish I would be putting on the menu. She was very attentive, and offered to help me at least with dinner choices. On the other hand, my waiter literally pulled out all of my salads, and since my salads came from a regular Italian restaurant, the only salad I could have picked out was a taco. This actually made a lot of sense as the food was slightly over cooked and overcooked, the wine wasn't particularly good, and my selection of venison was way over par with what I'd get on a regular menu.Our waiter gave us some recommendations which were the perfect combination of things and instructed us to check them to make sure they were
restaurant usually sells meat and fish for some amount of money. After comparing our review there was a slight disappointment about a date when the cashier that checked the bill indicated no tip and even more disappointment about the place afterwards.
My wife and I have tried multiple menus, but always had our favorite, burrito and burrito place. We got our story when we walked into the store and as we walked down one of the side booths there were about 100 bags of Canadians all over a table with one (very generous, everyone.My wife was in full fashion!! She ordered 10 different types of mac & cheese in one bowl. What a wonderful tasting dish!) But this time it wasn't so much the deliciousness as the fact that the chips were from the bunch you were seated by now. The cashew chips and salmon which were certainly gourmet are certainly delicious, but as with everything else we were (we got one Korean burger, no korean bacon but decent portions -
restaurant:
My boyfriend is food-obsessed and loves how incredibly creative they work.  My husband and I make great soups and desserts, and everything that we do is really amazing.  The server also kept in touch and gave us feedback.  My husband's favorite dish has been the ice cream, which he loves (loved).  We have always been hooked, and every time we go we always order the same appetizer.
Most food reviewers review traditional Italian food on first try, but it works, but I have to say that was the first experience we had. The lamb sausage and flank steak were the best (we also got my girlfriend, so she also had the amazing steak). The sauce was a combination of vegetables and meat broth. We had the dry lentils, and the lamb breast was extremely tender, succulent and tender! The beef lard was so flavorful.
I've been a frequent customer. I've eaten more Italian food in my
restaurant. This food was great. Overall, I had the service, and their service was great! Their salad bar is great. You can tell that they are very food hungry as well, no matter what kind of food you order. Their mashed potatoes are good, and they have medium-cut vegan corn, lettuce, and sweet potato stuffed it's special. I like to find so many vegetarian options to my shopping in the past few days, not to mention a great size of table (which is why there are so many table seats)!  Unfortunately for our table, we went to a larger house and the kids, who are by far my most of all of my-time onle.  We were thrilled to know that this is a place to stay.  Food (and dishes) are always out of this world, and it is an excellent place to have coffee or ice cream for yourself.  Great food on the other hand!  I could talk my own sweetheart
restaurant. Its excellent friendly atmosphere and good service, but the desserts that are sold are utterly inconsistent. Deliciously stuffed.
Strawberry pancakes are delicious and excellent. It's not the cheapest pancakes I've had in Chicago. They can be ordered at a different location, which is nice for me and everyone else in the house.I've tried other places in Chicago, but I've always been hesitant to go for the same things. Otherwise, they might have the best pancakes you'll ever find in the city.
This is one of my favorite spots! The service is great! The servers are very friendly and helpful.The food comes in great order. Just make sure to keep them on the do not forget about the pepperoni. For dinner, place one of the two credit cards on the credit card table. They can charge you $90 for a meal of 1 piece of pizza. Come on, just stay home and eat. This is definitely a great addition to any dining
restaurant I prefer it called Black Tea by the Sea!!! The ambiance was really warm and welcoming and was always packed so I loved my visit.
Our waitress and I had the staff and staff this time and there was a female employee.  The waitress told us she couldn't serve you until we finished our cocktails.  We're a small group and i have to admit it's hard for us to get drinks at our place.  So if you want a great experience, go to Eicher de Paris, or to Absolut, for some great drinks.
Probably one of the best places in the city to go, and have a place nice and close to your home in an old city. It's a really cool place for anyone. I had the penne pasta sandwich and it was so good that I remember it eating...it was good...you have to say it was something I had not ordered from that restaurant but I don't have a fondue tooth/
restaurant and wine list. Having no other choice but to go to the downtown watering hole for that special opportunity, the chef hired up to six of us each for an intimate meal in the second and third floors. All in all, it was well worth the wait, and not only did it make the place more interesting than it needs to be, it also brought its own unique vibe that I may never have had in Grand Rapids. Everyone in the group enjoyed it as a romantic birthday present - their parties included large groups, as well as couples, with drinks of choice. We seated on the corner for a rare, intimate moment at the bar to wait patiently for a table to open up.
I love this place, there is no better non-stop concert for jazz!!(and any of the burgers would have done a whole page! Oh and the dairy lovers fried it??)Since your quite a bit smaller, the best part is this...you get the ambiance. 
restaurant shows the most lively crowd there! They are interesting and tasty!
The Food is simple, but nothing surprising for a restaurant of this size. The temperature was above freezing, the food was so good. The veggie soup was super flavorful and had huge flavors, and the server gave me a sense of who we were. I don't go to culinary school, but this was something to behold.  Even my favorite dish would be given away for free. The interior, patio chairs and restrooms were nice. Overall, a great little addition to any casual dining experience. If you're looking to go out and enjoy something fresh and unique, this place definitely has it.
Ok, so this is my first review of a place that had better food and higher standards of service. It looks like there is a lot of food behind the door, and they have crappy parking. It sounds like the food is overpriced and boring. The waitstaff is broken up, you're waiting for
restaurant, complimentary salad, marinated & maple oil- grilled eggplant at a special-kissed place for most people.
The place is packed, but fairly difficult to find. The food is good, the service decent. But we will be going back to the place where the food is most popular.
I love this place!  The place was a huge hit last year with over 4,000 people coming out for the last week on Monday - 45? WOW!!  Great ambiance and cute cute patio.  On the weekends we usually wait for 7 pm, but at last weekend when I went here (where the burger and wine bar hang around), they weren't waiting that long!!They have always been wonderful and are welcoming & friendly.  From the pictures I give you...i would not mind if you let me order the martinis - they can make the martinis fabulous.  If you want to try a different martini that may taste like M&
restaurant in Woodstock - Big help!
I love hearing from visiting friends about restaurants that can't beat Fried Egg. I have worked at countless restaurants - the Beale jambalaya seems to be the best at it - if you can find a friend/family member who likes Fried Egg, put your name on their list. Their only question is is - How many per plate is this restaurant? (but not the total amount) It is a great idea to have smaller plates than necessary. If you are to see some of the best restaurants on the city's east side, just up the street from this spot, use the menu and arrive 10 mins later than normal.If you would like to comment please feel free to do so at the BBQ area or the location below in the block. My husband did so much to get him signed up and he has been a Gatorboy ever since he was six. As a hangout for Middle Eastern/Pluto people, the chicken
restaurant/salad sandwiches.  Just a friendly little place.
I have the perfect combo of the fruity taste and smooth, crunchy atmosphere. They will put their best bite to the food. Last time I've tried the Daiquiri Toodler the customer service was outstanding. I ordered their Huevos Pita - they had a big dry pita with salsa that I like - which I think is terrific for dipping your dipping sauce in. I got the shapeless piece of beef wrapped in a ball, garnished with mushroom gravy, onions, and a slice of cucumber (only the 2 - not each person.) The fries were divine, the dipping sauce was raw and quick, and I will be back again.
I come here every other Monday nights to enjoy a healthy indulgence!The food is out of this world, I like pizza. I have never been disappointed. I must say I had the best trip on a memorable Monday night.I
restaurant, glass in hand. When I walked in, the waitress must have thought I was about to die. She asked me what I was looking for and I told her that it was all in the mind. I am an expensive person with unusual tastes and an interest in the food. The glasses seemed just fine. Then they started asking if I had questions and asked if they could send me another bottle of wine to see if I needed a second bottle. I thought I was going to die. Then, I got an email telling me my next visit could not be. Then I realized what was going on.
I was living in an apartment that had a nice layout. We enjoyed breakfast and lunch outside, and I thought I was set on falling asleep at the table. I was expecting to get a shower, which wasn't happening. I had no idea if anything had happened, as I had been gone several times already, and I felt like I was going to need a shower.
restaurant names include Chicago Reduced, Indian & Biscuits & Bruised Chops, Belgian Exquisite BBQ, Deep Dish Pizza, Chicago Carlsons & Cherry Stars, Curly Nut Fudge, BBQ Chicken & Spicy Cucumbers & Smoothies. We were generally impressed with the menus on top of the menu. My hubby and I ordered from Chef Charlie for his pita & sautées, smoked fish & enchiladas. The staff was a pretty nice touch and provided a variety of options.
Buckeye Cider Chicago is the Chicago favorite of the place.  They serve just about anything, whether it is crab cakes, ribbed ribs or great looking mac n cheese.  That said, the food has a tad over priced, but don't miss the Frito salad and fries.  The special dates are especially good, serving large portions for a variety of appetizers (white cheddar, boleti) and as well
restaurant. Their only regret is that the sushi menu has been a complete mess so far. Please do not head out of town.  The sea is cold, smell, and there are no bathrooms.  Too many poor decision making there.
For the price you can't go wrong, I'll definitely try something here. It has things like a full, all-day buffet and dinner menu that is more than worth the price. If you want a day full of good seafood, you will definitely want to try Steak House!
This is one of the best places to go that doesn't want to throw in extra seating for that style of ice cream/salad it includes.  The staff is not that attentive when it comes to the things I have to offer, but great service and friendly service.  Whenever I go to Texas from out of town, I always feel like I have a nice Cuban restaurant in town. I don't give a rat's ass to any Cuban
restaurant by the name of Alinea Crooked Cauliflower. The place was busy, but made by pho and small portions, plus the restaurant is pretty tiny (where is the whole bunch?) It's better then you think.My entree was a La Giglio Scallion and the drink was amazing. In addition, my server was great. From the organic-style chicken to the bland pastry desserts that accompany it (I like the decor and texture of their rice), this was a great, social environment to spend a few hours in. Check out the menu to get more of their seasonal drinks. The seafood was also really great - you can't go wrong with anything from the seafood to the seafood, and I don't recommend going anywhere near the Villes in my opinion (or the Hell, the charcuterie in ville malagne), but you can also eat in the Villemalagne in Melting Pot if you have fancy food and not our money.If
restaurant just really felt the wait really wasnt worth it!If you find yourself in a neighborhood, try this on Webster Street, which has a different art. If you're feeling busty for some reason the area is far too crowded. It's also very busy but it's still cheap!
Excellent food, and a nice setting. Their pizza is generally a bit messy, so you could also enjoy the torto with pecan relish.  The interior is very well done, and they've made pretty satisfactory pizzas for you.  Also, do not skip the gratuity bar.
I've just found out I live in Arizona, and so far I'm thrilled with their experience.  Located a short drive from Lake Doug where I live, it was an interesting spot to sit down.  All in all the atmosphere is classy and intimate.  Many of the locations that I have visited here have been good, and I've got some of their cakes with a basil
restaurant

Their breakfast menu is the best I have ever eaten! I'm not really a fan of their gourmet coffee and good quality food! Every bite counts. Our waiteress is BYOB AND we send the person getting us the check. Don't go to all the food and drinks you'd bring but grab a bone of steak, the desserts and desserts. Once you have had this dinner, thank you, for the rest of your experience.
I'm a member of obrantian and have ordered from several Chinese restaurants in the city.  The food was the best I've ever had.  The food was best I had ever had in my life and the staff were very attentive as well.  To tell the truth, it wasn't a great experience at all.  They have a fixed wait time of 15 minutes.  I can tell you that no one actually delivered my meal.  The food was amazing, not just for price, but the service was
restaurant, I've been there 5 or 6 times this month and it's one of those days you're not going to wait.  This eatery is stellar and with friends, as well as having great seats, you should be packed and pleased. It is a little pricey for the price, but having the avocado egg salad, ravioli, salad and fish bowl is worth it, both of which are fine.  The food itself is incredible! I have never been disappointed with anything in my life (such as this) and they always find room to bring in extra items or plates to satisfy your appetite.  You've never been disappointed with an absolute bummer!
I came here a few weeks ago to celebrate my 3rd anniversary, and for the first time in a long time I was getting something awesome (well-made, but not unhealthy) as I really, really want a Korean fried chicken because what a Southern feast.  I wanted to try this place to celebrate
restaurant chain - Butcher Shop.   That's right.  It's the closest thing I've got to traditional Korean BBQ in Chicago, serving a truly unique menu.
I love this place for its variety.  I am always a go with friends or go to a pizza connoisseur.  I have never had a bad experience.  They have great chocolate!
Walking to chef's salad bar....plus this place has the best chicken on the block!!  The music is beautiful, the food is appetizing.  The salad bar is extremely small so you have to check outside.The service is unbelievable!!The burger is hot, and grilled, and I love it!!It's an interesting combination of truffle and apple tart.The inside is pretty dry but the decor is really fun and inventive.There is one piece of a kind of metal block by the windows, and this is one of my favorites.There is something for everyone to try.
w
restaurant has been outside. Just like every other restaurant in Italy, yum, yum! The drinks are fantastic but I would go here again if I could get a seat.
The quality of their food was extraordinary. This restaurant has been an embarrassment to food. I've gone there 5 times already. Both times I couldn't agree about how good it was... but the first time, my waitress was surprised by the quality of food; it was for sure better than my first time there. Both times they had food that I had absolutely cannot afford. I never would've been able to get a reservation or even open a bottle. Both times the service was flippant and mannerless. It took about 20 minutes for my waitress to actually speak with me. I asked them what the prices were for beer and wines. They shrugged it off and then pretended to forget about me. They should apologize for that, after I was done with them and their next to last beer. And
restaurant 24/7. The food is overrated at best, but there are so many different types of meats. Only bloody leaves if we order bread and pasta that can be whipped up in seconds. Prices were pretty high for this place and expected much more.  Its a shame they don't add more nice places like this to their menu - i never once paid cash or anything, I just kind of wanted to try them.
Okay man...The hostess is really cool. They're parking lot guy so you can actually park there. She can actually grab a lot of parking lots. In fact this place has been known as the Red Carpet so many times it would make more sense to open on a Saturday night. But on Friday they really opened the door for brunch.  I usually come here on a Monday or Tuesday for a friday brunch. The food was amazing. This place does seem to cater to people new to the restaurant.It's BYOB but I'm
restaurant, very attentive. I was lucky enough to get it asap, served by both my mother and boyfriend.Our dessert menu came with 22 Entrees.  For about $15 less than you would get at a sushi place (maybe your aunt or grandpa's place), they are really nice if you don't like fancy courses. This sushi was also very pretty and I think they'll have more sushi on the menu.  In terms of cost, they were good.  For $15 you are going to really want a good bottle of beer.  If you can get some really strong beer on the menu, it's going to be awesome.  The prices are incredible, but you can grab some but it would really be a matter of money and going somewhere.Our personal fav....Fiery Carrot Salad with Honey Steak.Perfect- all-star addition to any diet!
I am a big fan of Dragon soup. The textures are amazing. The meat is
restaurant, two great restaurants and my only regret in life.  I eat breakfast with my entrees and have never heard anyone talk about the interiors and interior.  The worst thing is that, although the restaurant is more convenient and sanitary, the service is a total joke, not enough to make me want to eat.
Pissed. Sunday brunch was a visit from friends and family on a different world. However, they were so impressed by my hospitality that they informed me that their manager chose my table and chose to bar the last table so that my family and I wouldn't have to wait. The real catch? When you order, every waitress arrives and the products are loaded. We were still in the process of decorating our table and presentation, but it was finally being moved to our seats. Other than that, not a huge problem. Disappointed with the bill. No problem at all.
A great place to pick a birthday party for an awesome price.
restaurant) the food was super-beasy, absolutely incredible, and a special treat. At $39 per person, the food was unpretentious and yet it somehow makes sense to go down to the fare of the main courses (and maybe an A&E) so if you like pasta, high quality (appetizers), and always bad service, not all that bad. The Meat/Biscuit Salad, as was typical of Mexican restaurant, seemed unique and utterly elegant. Given that they only have one ceviche special option (I asked the chef why he had garlic wine included) the others have their own taste. The Salmon breast tenderloin, The Fast Food Double Trouble (they have a joint, so I don't have to wait long) and the Extra Cheese Ribeye were all ingredients that always made one feel like an avocado eater.I tried so many of the dishes I would have gladly eaten a dozen people by myself. My favorites were the Spicy
restaurant and personal chef, and owner (and possibly one of its employees) Charlie Timmins. He has a history of being really-social, as you would expect (even if you were not aware he was working as a sushi chef). He has a long speaking beard and clearly reminds me of the faces of the original East Coast pastry chefs, such as Buti LaBen, Frank Guadon & Willamette Spada, and Kris Fisher. He is the one that most draws me back to this place. We left feeling pretty alone. And obviously other diners were uncomfortable with us. Once we found a table, they helped a waitress get our food; this was immediately replaced by towels and towels. Finally, the manager walked us out of the restaurant on the way back from Chicago. Any combination of the above should have been enough. I appreciate the staff!
My husband and I go to this place every Saturday, Sunday, and usually every weekend for dinner. It
restaurant.....sees he was as middle aged as a busboy in school..Great place for chicago 'n' byy girls to get you before you go. you won't see any gringo comment on my birthday at the BYOB for 7 months.....but will keep you out of restaurants after.
Great restaurant here, but the prices are great! We love it and we will try more of their sandwiches. Don't forget to order from downstairs if you do not want a mid table, there is nothing better!
My friends and I went to this place today and it was awesome.  They are a wonderful family-friendly establishment which is wonderful for a different kind of man.  We had the Peruvian sausage dog and the avocado in the croquettes with the cocktail cocktail, we also got the fish and shrimp sandwich and we were super impressed.  Service was top notch.  But my husband, from the place it looks like was first time working
restaurant and cozy and minimal, in addition to not having to make an effort to pace yourself to arrive a bit early.
WOW! Really, what a mess! My food came out the front door which was okay. I got my crumpleati and topped it off with the almost finished meal. I was a little grossed out that the middle crust and deep fried chicken were all (paras) fried (Oro with no real food on the side, really ha) and really ugly, for my tastes! It's that bad! That was the last taste of my sandwich we had and was a total waste of money! I definitely recommend this place as it will be the next option for great food on Sushi!
Well, I guess I'm a discerning person of checks and miller-tacks, but I don't think I ever really missed the genius of Cesar de Mayo. Simply delicious, cute, and incredibly knowledgeable. We will be back
restaurant). Try the smokeless buffalo brisket in braised tomato sauce. It was one of my favorite meals on a summer evening in Chicago.Overall, it was well worth the price but was not as yummy as some of the other clubs I frequented.
Well, this wasn't an atmosphere that I would describe as a cliche.  Not to say I don't love it, but it was cramped and I am the owner.   But, the space was always overcrowded because everyone I talked to at my table was exhausted.  You can't use a restroom in the neighborhood of around a million people.  But I like our drinks, our food.  Our staff was attentive and gave a lot of advice.  The quality was decent.  Nothing had a dry, almost cottony feel.   What was disappointing was that the pastorate didn't enjoy the vibe of the neighborhood anymore.
Rookie hospitality/brad.  We just felt
restaurant at the peak...
Now, for a server suggestion: take your guests out to dinner and the woman you want served you a table (that will taste right). Bring your food to a table and watch the menu to see what they're offering and how soon you can get your drinks. You'll know what they are because when the server gets off of the line she'll open it up and give you drinks. It's an elegant, very romantic spot, but I've never felt like I was in the mood to be forgo a stop to hang out there. You'll spend an evening chatting or hanging out with your friends as they walk in. As a rule, the food and service is simply amazing. But if you're in a hurry, don't forget to stop by and get the 3 minute tip to sit down. It doesn't make the meal much more enjoyable or interesting, but it helps people come away with fresh appetizers, suggestions and we've even dined
restaurant by breakfast bar and private dining for $5.15 per person; entrée is $6.30 per person and includes desserts; appetizer is $5.60; dessert dessert is $6.80 per person; and menu is $10.95 per person. Most items are very good.
Best sushi menu in town.  You must try to come at least a minute early on a Tuesday to grab your fish.   There's a stop on the way to work and you must bring your own food.  Their takeout of sampler dinners were perfect, but if you'd like to try a more traditional takeout of sampler dinners, you can try my few other sampler recipes in the salad bar and each sampler can be ordered.  Nothing compares to Great South Bay (the traditional seafood bar).  I'd go back for dinner and simply try the sushi.
Our waitress had the freshest ingredients possible. The last time we went to
restaurant + home bar + YUM!
and yesterday I went to my Italian stop. the waiters seemed to be being really nice, mostly reading me. I figured, maybe I don't like to wait at all, and they don't care if I'm not feeling comfortable in there and they don't need me. I'm a singer, so, why should I wait a little longer to hear my music? I don't know...
I love Pig and the decor and the inside is awesome, new and fun to look at. This place is where I get my coffee. The food is good. I think the food has both good and mediocre sauces. It doesn't fit in with my over all hometown concoction that is soul food.
First of all I think "Threat Level" is what the two labels mean. If you are not part multicultural purist, you would think "Oh crap, that was an original. We got there at over a half a

My family and I came here for the first time last weekend after sitting at St. Paul's House which has outgrown Chicago's traditional brick building.  So when I saw the retro music to Reduce and Carve It, I immediately had it down.  Honestly, I didn't even know they'd be so hard at it and look like they'd tried to push it back.  The food is inventive, the decor stylish, and yet still somewhat accessible.  The service was lively, but their server thought they would only drive their buck.  He was just as attentive as you would expect.  They definitely understood what I was thinking, and asked about a specific occasion which didn't come up.  When our server and I could not be reached, we promptly left, knowing that we
restaurant for breakfast.  Since our chicago friends are especially fond of this restaurant and I go for a simple table-up or party with friends, I thought I'd try this out.  My friend was so impressed she rushed the table after a table was opened, expecting the server to come and just stare at her without a very bright smile. When he came, his smile was just that.
This was a great meal. The breakfast and lunch specials are outstanding. This place has a very diverse menu. I am frequently at the zoo, but i highly suggest ordering more food and ask less for them to remain open. It has much to offer the waitress, but she keeps trying to do things right. I recommend the avocado buns and spinach bowls and don't forget to add a dollar for each!
5.5 out of 5 stars, you're probably pretty well acquainted with Chicago ales.  Short of beers, check here or just ask for a coffee. And
restaurant with equally hard working beers and quaint booths (the Hopleafes and Art Deco) as well as excellent vegetarian food (yum). I sat down with Francesco and after the diner mentioned the fish stew there, we ordered the lobster dish, which was perfect. We had to start at $25 because it was so good. A great deal for a typical night, but we can also understand why the most expensive seafood entree (i.e., steak fried shrimp) in the city is overpriced. Our money was on the savory chicken, which was grilled beautifully, but we came away with the pork shoulder stew with the lobster. Our waiter even brought a little bass shrimp shank. Which worked well, as we ordered the pork shoulder stew without any shrimp at all. The food was so good I felt like my husband was attending a birthday party, with the addition of the duck breast, and I was so happy we were back. The tables were loud so
restaurant 'What a waste of time and energy!' Of course, most restaurants in the west are still shabby and inadequate. And what a waste of time we had on our last visit to San Diego.
This was my first in the Bay Area and I am always talking about it. I don't know about Chicago, but just because we live in a neighborhood that has a really pretty cool cuisine shouldn't be a surprise.  It's wonderful to find a restaurant and get to know its patrons. They are a great asset if you want to live an adventurous life. The food is good (I like the food and it definitely took a little more effort to cook than I'd prefer) but the staff doesn't seem to have much respect for actual chefs.  Our waiter was awful, and she forgot to send us a drink.  The fries and a vegetarian meal were hard to find (which is typical for many regions).  I ordered the entree, and a watermelon
restaurant and pizza you always feel that you can finally compete with this amazing crowd. I'll be back!!
First time I have been to this restaurant. It's great for veal stuffed pasta, veal aricchi, turkey sausage, etc. The staff is very friendly and you will definitely get that taste to go.   The waiter makes it easy to explain the menu, you will definitely be treated nice and follow suit.I was able to order some non soups and for dessert, mango buttercream I will definitely be going back.
Great food!!!  I am a fan of this place so I am always looking for a new place to visit.  I have never really had trouble getting that great korean
Wonderful place. Simple, nice atmosphere but the food is wonderful, fabulous!
This place had a Brazilian wave funeral of 2. Always an emmy of the posh and fancy in Chicago (except for that silly Italian legend which makes my mouth
restaurant, coffee, and dining area at the Tapas Bar and Grill. Our food is super fresh and fresh and my staff is prompt and knowledgeable. We have been to many other places over the years and believe their food is amazing.
My wife and I stayed at a pop-up restaurant for about 4 months. It was small and fast, very intimate and well-dressed. The food was tasty. We would go there whenever we enjoyed a good meal. We are Italian and have no experience or knowledge of Italian food. My wife and I are Italian, you can try any non-Italian food, and whenever we would like to try Italian food we will get a free bottle of lard! We are also a community service manager. We all know it is really good. I recommend it to all of my Chicago based customers, friends and lovers alike.
Excellent service, great atmosphere and service. I personally came for the wings because the dish was outstanding! (If you
restaurant. Enjoy both; you will definately never again be seated in the diner area.
Ive been to our restaurant for 4 years and many of my reviews have been positive. A two star rating would put us 3 stars. I think the best thing is that it was on an all time low, just good quality dinner, fantastic service and the waitress from past is a very nice lady. She knows her place and constantly saves time, and she gets on our table whenever we have the money to go on to. I will definitely be coming back.
The server in this restaurant is known for treating customers well, giving them an attitude and a wonderful atmosphere. A word of advice - if you are there at a friend's birthday party, remember to order a great pizza.
I wish this place had an Italian twist on ramen.  I prefer to dine in more of a place with creamy noodles and rather spicy meat dishes.  I also like to drink Belgian Lou
restaurant, and worth every penny of the cash we had for the three times it cost me. I recommend checking out the many great options in the neighborhood - there's nothing better!
My sister had a birthday party at the Lincoln Park outside this morning.  We wanted to get some juice for ourselves and a couple dishes for dessert for the evening.  To top it off, everything about this place was unbelievable.  The decor and the restaurant themselves are good.
My review of Redmont After Hours is a little disappointing, but hey, that kinda goes without saying.  From what I've eaten here, the only reason that I rate this place over other tourist spots on any list (6 stars considering they're famous, huge one) is the food.  They're pretty good, sure.  The lunch experience, which lasts about an hour (my wife had to wait in line), is definitely worth it.  The burger joint is long and sometimes is full.
My
restaurant, can't talk. I ask if the chicken matsu baba has really been cooked yet, and they say nothing until a few minutes later. But when I finally look around I find 2 people standing with a sign that says "contact us next month to try!" There are even some signs on the walls at the front of the building with such other sign ( which will be okay by now ). The kirby wayfarer alone looked very... at times... mousy looking. I wanted to thank him for noticing that I was late to the restaurant. His understanding and happiness surprised me. My girlfriend thought his knowledge and love of fried chicken was great, but there were other pros I wanted to point out. Then he went to the backroom menu and said that they are opening next month. My first visit was with my boyfriend, he just never brought us a menu. We had to leave immediately, it was almost time to go for a drink. The wait is
restaurant - interesting to see.
I liked this place a lot. Very family friendly ambiance and great foods! Good people. (Good for summer when there are trees and the crowd won't stop for us!) Just a wacky looking group and very casual.
I am very happy that I became a fan of this place in Chicago. The seafood burgers and crostini is really good! I was craving these items. Really enjoyed them and will be returning again for dinner. The staff was patient and helpful, although I would never suggest going to the buffet and entering this restaurant unless you are looking for seafood and easy bites!
Great Chicago food! We're on a Sunday and I go here on one of my own trips each week.I went there early and did not realize there was a wall of crumbles and the fresh food smelled like cheap spiciness. We ordered the tofu beef noodle in crab legs and both were delicious and affordable. These were GREAT!!! Highly
restaurant and not to mention extremely good ambiance.  I've written about it, but have yet to see it.  Despite a better atmosphere, I was the first woman that went to Fluxurismo.  It has their wings galore, tacos, garlic taco, the food is great, and I had the duck poja dip and everything was great.  the presentation was also very special.  The hype surrounding the service was good; it is a very well executed restaurant, the booths are beautiful, so the food is consistently good, and if you're looking for a relaxing weekend meal of Mexican steak, you are looking for a great place.  From what I found on the website, Fluxurismo is more then happy to host a dinner of four for the average listener.
I was disappointed with this place!  You can tell, on the website, that they usually pay my bills, but we still got turned away for a few days of waiting.
restaurant is a great place to eat, drink and relax after having dined at the Sushi Shops. I go there every Thursday and every Saturday night, the atmosphere is to die for!
Perfect! Service was good. Food was amazing. Excellent decor and great customer service. My favorite side dish for a great lunch!  Everything is the perfect amount of fun for a table but the servers are super nice and helpful. If you aren't in the mood for the big plates, you can have the roll. But if you want a space where you can enjoy one-on-one interaction, start with a yelp meal.
My girlfriend and I decided to check out our favorite shrimp restaurant.  It had a very authentic Italian feel that seemed very different from anything else we had been to - because there was a rockin' menu with zucchini, but no herbals.  Definitely not the place you would go to in a hurry to get anything else
restaurant as a street food eater and delivery.We got there in a moment and there were 45 people waiting in the walkway and we all started talking and talking loudly. Maybe everyone else had time and was very worried. Our server assured us that our meeting was the perfect time to take the lasagna and have some conversation. Every time we had a good time we asked for a special sauce and my hostess told us that the sauce was so spicy I wanted to take it out of the kitchen and that her husband could not handle the sauce because it was like that.She told us that was not what she meant. Needless to say I had to wait and was very disappointed. She took it out of the fridge a few minutes later and replaced it with another sauce which I guess is totally normal for our table. The food was poor on all the levels except for the lasagna. The food itself was good and we all enjoyed the service. I think we will continue to order the tort
restaurant/bar located on Sabre Street between Grabond and K-Town.
Staying warm, wearing the T-shirts with the orange and black sofas all the time. Very good beer selection.
I have been going there for the past 3 months and I LOVE it! They have packed most of their variety from their own truffle sausage, to cornbread.  It's definitely good sandwiches with dark meat.  My girlfriend eats it out of the oven and the bread itself is a perfect artichoke.
YUMMY.  Perfect place for vegans! I've been to El Fuerte every single time I've gone.  Perfect place for pizza or w/et shit! Go there for lunch! This is THE best salad bar in Chicago.
The Mediterranean vibe is just plain good.  Unfortunately the dishes are not so good, maybe my ass knows I love their hummus.  They use my bathroom, so that makes it
restaurant was in a similar style to the Lounges. The staff was really attentive and knowledgeable. The nice service is superb and the coffee and course descriptions are pretty helpful to the visitor (and the guests who are not in my party!).The sturgeon was delicious!  I've tried everything that ever one of the folks mentioned.  My wife who was having a few of my regular visits and only managed to call, let me speak to her.  She looked really nice and we made a point of waiting in line (except we both went to the Loveland for the flyover).  The staff was the best!!
I would like to try a fairly large theme and head there for dinner.  The place itself was fantastic and the food was perfect (just right, including one of the dishes that we ordered).  There are a lot of restaurants out there and for good reason, although I can't go wrong, they are fairly extensive.  From a long list
restaurant here, I was glad I did. The food was not stellar. I would rather wait at least 10 minutes to order a table when they open up again, though I am by no means a perfectionist and was well on the wane with the wait. The ambiance is also good, the wait staff is a bit jealous. I cannot imagine if such a casual atmosphere would be prevalent at their event.
This is my favorite sushi joint in Chicago.  Every time I come here I'm told that it's BYOB and no excuse.  The atmosphere is warm, comfortable, and very catered to my everyday tastes.  Most of the area is open during the night and allows for a bit of a service provided.  Being in Naperville (still a fun neighborhood), it's nice to not have to wait too long to be seated!  Some have complained that the food has been bland but the food here does meet my expectations.  Not worth my money if
restaurant, thanks to the gentility, great, friendly people, and the place to go, hooray! I will definitely come back here again with friends.
I've been eating at Butcher's for 8 years now.  My wife recently went back for dinner.  The food was amazing, special, friendly.  My waitress was good, great, knowledgeable, but not as skillful in communication as we thought we'd be.  My husband also has gone and we've had the best first try.  I'm planning on going again soon, but will bring up their desserts at least a few times.  The place is awesome, I'll be back.
Go to Desensitie in hopes of finding something great in the area.
It is definitely a great gem! The free tea hours, awesome customer service, and exceptional wines bring you back and it is always great. We had the turkey with a side of my dumplings that we were excited
restaurant and service was outstanding. While I didn't know that I had a hot dog I was somewhat satisfied. The pie-balsamic portions were also very authentic. Not only did they offer lunch, but they were also hard to find anywhere else at all, especially since this is in such a good location. I don't think this is a bad establishment that needs to close out the deal if it's gonna be so crowded that you'll need to head to the bathroom. I really liked the food, I would recommend the neon candle stuffed steak sandwiches, it's a little overwhelming the first time, but still definitely worth the food.
Best pork steaks ever!!!! Great decor, small staff but very friendly!
Quality meats, great food. But never the worst or worst food anywhere in the world.
Oh dear history!   This city, Chicago, is just looking around for incredible "The Middle East" restaurant to hit a street corner!    Found a
restaurant. These are the best eggs in Chicago!
YUMMYI COOKERS!!!! I love the sushi. It's packed! Have they beef belly or tuna?I've had steaks, foie gras and sushi.  So many amazing products!!!
Raspberry Magnificent, you gotta love this place. Service is good. I enjoy to order beer (and maybe wine) and I try to write with over 22 different chefs.  I almost have a hole in my stomach to line up a place to drink some back-to-school beer!  The food isn't overbearing, they work with family/friends to make sure you order what you want.  Got the miso salad that came with our pies...good going.  Maybe they could bring us their lunch plate too.
This place was the best in town, there was huge filling and the only time I've ever been a sizzler was at the House of Burger! 
restaurant(%d..btw) is amazing and wonderfully sophisticated, I enjoyed my $4 poncho lunch...could not be happier! If you're a vegan (hence you may eat a lot more veggies and beans) and look to some of the awesome courses at floursain (done by importers like us) we strongly recommend going to them!
Had to eat an awful lot of this restaurant as its held up poorly and I know a lot of my neighborhood is afraid of all the freaky overly cultured aspects. This is not the type of place that will appeal to a cute teen girl because she knows this is a dumb restaurant and doesn't have an ambiance (otherwise great), so it's an exceptionally comfortable room, not going out. Would not recommend being out of town.
I am really the ONLY white girl that loves steaks so I have to say that I LOVE it!! The food was excellent, the service was good and they do everything
restaurant free. We went with an overpriced steak appetizer. The food was so good they actually offered and they were super nice! After a couple of their orders of fried chicken which was DELICIOUS and a real BAD tip!! And they didn't mention that the skunk which smelled like a cow. After dinner it was cold! And what were those great punny tables ahead of them?A-W-OOM. The waitstaff did a great job working in your favor when we were waiting and if we were seated in your restaurant we would have been able to talk your life down to us! If you come to this place try to watch people make a reservation to come. We were booked well and have been planning on heading out. Our main reservation request in line is before we get seated. If we wait longer, we will be fine, unless we rush our table. It might not be a good experience but every time we go it is worth the wait.
restaurant.  Their best Ethiopian restaurant in Chicago and it certainly did not disappoint. The atmosphere was spacious and the service was prompt.  Although this was closed down a little for our tour, it is still extremely friendly and accommodating.  There was definitely a hint of espresso every time we went there, plus it was the first time I went outside.  It was pretty quiet, I was never underwhelmed, and the service was great.  In addition, we ordered another brunch brunch to share.  Both of those options were great and perfectly prepared.
To preface all this, I had the blackened chicken with an Italian seasoning: pork lard, duck fat, and all the wild stuff that I would like to know about it for.  And it worked out.  From the homemade sandwiches the menu offered, to the entrees I will be eating at my next table, I was loving it.  I don't know what happened to my friends that week;
restaurant buffet:  Delicious. The food was homemade and fresh (delish!) and the server was kind and helpful. Service was great! We both loved the green guacamole. The bowl of rice was fun, an amazing taste! Once seated, we were expecting the place to be loud and sloppy, but we didn't have to wait too long for the service to improve and our experience to be good. :) Great lunch spot for a family of four.
Something about my b/w that surprised me was the interior. The out of this world look on the inside was not simply beautiful - it was terribly unbalanced. You could tell they wanted to be in style, nothing like that. The minute they came out with a thoughtful menu, their customer service, and assured me that they would not be more down-to-earth than what I witnessed the entire time I spent here. Would not come back!
Not to mention their drink list is up there with K
restaurant. I have never tried her menu, and the products are so addictive I want to go back. I also love her waterfront. Save money on chicken? Yes, you can! Try the bone marrow steak. I will not eat it again. On a cold and rainy night with weak people, it'll have dinner at The Stone of Shaka. All the food is delicious. I can't wait to return!
That's a classic Boston food chain and for the price!                                                                                                    
restaurant-than-you would get on the weekends.  My favorite being Bob's Green; they do a lot of steaks that are definitely the best (at least the ones you'll find on the street).  My favorite of all is Mogo Zaki which I am not quite sure why I ordered.  By the way, I don't eat the caramelized popcorn the first time I eat there and not in a mary fiend fashion at all.  Check out my other food spot!!!
Another fantastic restaurant that's a bit noisy.  They're very good and attentive!  There are a lot of chefs and the food is very tasty, but they just bring out all the best.  If you're looking for deep fried and extra fatty food or a connoisseur's of my own, try they at Bravo Pizza!
Love eating steak in some much slower time and I've been to the Wallipoli often.  Although I really wanted something
restaurant). We were excited by it, but we had a rather difficult time paying attention to the menu, and were somewhat disappointed by the plan to call this restaurant a specialty restaurant. It's too early to judge this restaurant's popularity but it certainly shows how limited the lower end is. We were seated, on a regular basis, though we had reservations by phone, and brought with us 20 tables.  My girl was seated, so we had to have an extra 20 in the sauna (after lunch).  Our waitress sat next to us, so we had to ask for more as we waited.  Our table was completely empty with no towels and drink glasses.  We were expected to pay about $50 a person, and the service was terrible and we didn't even take care of our glasses.  I'm glad we came here so I could have this restaurant as a dinner option, but that's not what happened here.  Just awful. The food was great and could
restaurant and hot beverage and possibly work. so u have to try it... but i would have loved to try it.. but i will not leave.
Cheap and Unique..  How did they get that far from Portland?? with lots of great food, unbeatable prices, professional service and outstanding quality?  Would it be the same anyplace else?  Great place for lunch or dinner..
Is it a lost cause? Is this a tourist trap? Do you know anyone who does not walk out of CityPlace in Chicago???!!You can actually smell in your mouth..from the tea leaves.. like it's on top of a new beer or wine..AND its a good day for the food.. oh what the heck, i thought this was great, but it's not!  Just awful.  I would still go back...people are upset...but clearly the food isn't great to die for.. let me put it this way.. its just a lost cause
restaurant at Chicago's lily park, Lou Mello, an affable, awkward younger fellow with an intimate yet unpretentious place and the eyes of a young, good old-fashioned old man. But the late night hype and lack of anything better was unapologetic. The owner turned out a fabulous combination of cocktail and smoke, which went wonderfully with the salad and a little skewer, and handed me a big bottle of ink, and before I could ask for anything more, the manager started ringing up my phone at 8:30 that night. What a sloppy crew! The manager was making his way around the room after only a few seconds, and the restaurant had a couple servers. Why would I want to shop for a restaurant I had never eaten here? He could have told me that he and his management have had a lot of success in Chicago, and he wouldn't have bothered. You know, all of the success in our local market. Now if you were my
restaurant restaurant(s).  Stop by early each night for breakfast for dinners.  Try that old-timey cheesecake off a bottle of Wild White Rye (w/remix) in the cafe!  I highly suggest dropping them a few bucks, too.  Is the rabbit tartare on the menu?  I don't think so.
I come here regularly, and the food, service, and atmosphere are absolutely fabulous. It's too cramped to be a cozy restaurant, but the food, service, and atmosphere are absolutely perfect. The food is fabulous!  From the whole eggplant soups, to the tomato-based dressing with homemade bread, every single item on this menu is impeccable.
Tastes like a prix fixe - like the waiter was welcoming you and your entire family
I've been to this place several times, but the most memorable was my wedding. We shared the same meal. It took over an hour because we were
restaurant: I didn't even know what to expect...
High Quality Beef Short Ribs with Fried Egg and Quinoa This is the best In East Bay! Fried Egg is heavenly, freshly seasoned, tender and thoroughly delicious. Loved my Nick Boon requests and top plate!  Only downside was the price. But for the money, I thought they could be better and I will definetly give them the thumbs down!
This is a rock solid neighborhood restaurant with unbeatable food.  Definitely worth your visit to visit for the authentic feel and different atmosphere. They have a great selection of pasta sauces and we've had the chance to try a new one on the weekends.
I couldn't be happier! I've been going here several times before - and for me a typical Vietnamese Restaurant just isn't up to the pace that on a regular Thai restaurant. It's so busy that the place isn't crowded at all, and the waiter, someone who's friendly and attentive,
restaurant here, and it was good enough that I still get to eat here after going elsewhere. (sorry man)
Hot Ale is great, affordable and had an awesome location and great service.  Great tasting drinks, but not worth the money for the top spot in the line.
I couldn't be more satisfied with my visit.  The place is comfortable, reasonably priced, and (with limited delivery service) serves some of the best pizza you've ever had.  They also have a wonderful menu of comfort foods, like Spaghetti & Olive Pasta.  This is by far the best breakfast spot I've had outside of New York City.
I went to Rock The Dance Saturday Night and we loved it. The food is incredible and the staff has a soft personality. We will go back.
The food was pretty good too, but I still wouldn't go back to like I ate here any other way. The potatos taste terrible. I understand that some people
restaurant"

Stuff we missed    was a great lunch.  Everything we tried was great, with salads. The place was always well staffed and was quick to open for meals.  We loved the La Gran home fries and the Sam's Fried chicken they made that was so delicious.  We would try the special side of BBQ bbq.. Also, the dinner reservation doesn't have to be fast.. 5 pm for breakfast, 7 pm for lunch.
Great/Best Hot dog in Chicago
The food is just amazing!!! Huge portions with huge portions to work with! The first course I was offered was eggs w/a full 5 lb nuggets!!  The best toppings were rice, chicken and w/o extra cheese - the king of the greek veggies are the wannabe mashed potatoes and w/ smoked onions. They're the only ones in town where people should visit  and not go hungry! I've also had lettuce,
restaurant, and place high in the list!  I find them to be my new favorite place to take my child.  Also, yum yum.  Ordering here.
I'm a HUGE fan of this place.  I love that they have so many wonderful things to choose from from, their burgers are full and authentic, and their appetizers are bursting with flavor.  Even when it comes to their fries and calamari I still love it. I also have the... kamajawada
I go here frequently and love their fried rice. I just went there last week and was in awe!  The food is terrific and I love that they come here during the holiday season, so there's a good chance that you'll be a fan of their homemade fries at first.I personally ordered two different types of fries: the sourdough type, and the seasoned $6.95, which came with a variety of toppings (greek truffle
restaurant, great staff, nice smell and unique dining experience. The restaurant is free with their sauce and fresh food.
Nice place to have a nice meal.   Nana kitchen definitely fits the bill.  They serve appetizers that have a different looking flavor than some other restaurants around, we got a big glass of tomato soup from them, we have the whole American potato pie from the soup counter, delicious hot chocolate, no salad or bar.   Thank God for the breakfast sausage, seared to perfection and its perfect.
Food is great and we will never go back to Whole Foods again but I do really love the weekend specials at Whole Foods. If you like coconut, you may enjoy Chipotle spicy...one-pot shrimp, and buffalo chicken. I have tried most of them at the other two Whole Foods stores and the next is the quality in price. Last year I went there for my husband's birthday and it was a very nice surprise.  No reservations
restaurant was perfect. The spinach was really good! A great combination of grit and lemon juice. The ingredients were great, all taste just as good. The second time I had the ribeye they were excellent.
OK, my first time drinking lukewarm water here I knew, I wouldn't miss this place! The salad bar is crazy crowded! On a trip around a seaside neighborhood. Maybe after the oysters are over here it'll be nice to catch up. Bestest oysters I have.
I am always planning on going in on a weekday night to relax. This is one of my favorite places! I would come here because of the fresh flavor and because it makes one feel like you are really here for a long time! Our server knew her name right away and spoke to me right away and did what I needed to, while the staff worked. Our server in his mid-30's almost always greeted us as he was running our orders. That was,
restaurant, sexterritorial, and French brunch. (Still the best.) Large portions of meats such as sausage and ricotta cheese served at crispy, tacky, deep, delicious, and juicy portions! Service is great and we recommend doing the preparation of your meals. Great appetizers are always the centerpiece of your dinners.
Oath should be a bit more than just p/b's.  When I go for Indian pajamas, things tend to get really confusing.  My friend tries cooking with chicken on the side and it looks like it's absolutely hot in there.  They love their chicken on the side of burgers, but at least their pajamas have some actual meat so it's easy to take off a burger without it in the oven.  The dishwasher can help too and after we were told they were often done, we ordered some fried pickled cabbage.  And it was delicious!The staff is friendly, but at times you just end
restaurant, waitress and young hostess. I liked the food - flavorful, well prepared and clean. We were served by three gourmet chefs and one of the wannabe hairdressers. Enjoy!
My favorite burger place in Chicago! Perfect food, drinks, atmosphere and tasty wines.
This is a fine location. Yuck! The servers never say don't go to this place. Our waitress brings on customers to the table and has an excellent job of bringing out the drinks you might have missed! The prices are steep but don't be fooled, they're really great. We have had a few other burgers here, all the toppings are by O's style. The only question is if they're big enough to carry the extra toppings.
I really don't feel that I'm getting as many reviews as the other reviewers.  These are DELISH Mexican flavors.  Great for lunch or dinner.
I've been going to Macaroni and Cheese
restaurant/Chicago dining destination. I also love De-guest, which is cute!The water is great but it's not spicy or anything like that. Maybe I might try the pot pie.
The Pastry Burritos aren't all that special...they are a bit dated but they're not as good as the "haircut" "cracker coffee." Don't bother ordering...give them a try!
Enjoy this place on the first night when you get a large group. It's really deep and you get to the place with friends for a hip drink without getting blown up and dragged out of the bar!
I love this place! The last time I had a postcard with a new entree with sourdough bread at Chicago's Country Lounge, I was there with my dog...she got pooping on one of our stuffed loaves and another was just as big as the one that was supposed to be placed there. I just got the roast beef
restaurant service. But something is better there--served by someone with more respect. The atmosphere is sophisticated and bustling, especially if you bring a small group of people. And the selections are deep-fried and flavored with their own unique flavor combinations. (Many of the items are also dishable!)Food (both vegetarian and vegan) was so amazing. The meat was really excellent, especially with many portions being flat-chested. Maybe, like myself, you just like beef, too--and I should say at this price there is such a thing.If you aren't a vegetarian, you can go really cheap, which might be good (but since there are so many options, I recommend eating more often, especially if the meat is not cold-dried).  There are a lot of kinds of meat--sofas, such as the andcheese, which make for a good carnivore experience.  The same goes for soups, there are some pretty good options
restaurant and cozy host. I mean, the place has a large selection of everything from fruit and soul meat, to pasta dishes, everything in between.The waitstaff is great - it's by the end of the evening so you can relax while you wait.  On the other hand, there's sometimes a slight wait on the way to the patio that sometimes gives you the feel of the difference between pouring water and soup.  This place is especially good for beer, which is definitely what I have experienced.  I'd definitely come back again.
Really happy with the full on Hallelujah!  This is the second time I have been here and I was pleasantly surprised.The service is great.  They are as attentive as can be, nothing weird about them!
After some experiences in Chicago I love a good steakhouse!  There are so many wonderful dining options to choose from.  The restaurant tends to fill up quickly because of the massive diners that rush
restaurant at 3625 Parkville St. in Chicago's much-anticipated original jazz restaurant. The food was fantastic and it had so many styles and sounds. The service was flawless, both during a conversation with me and my husband and having a conversation with a Chicago jazz pianist. I love to write love letters and was brought over by a couple of my friends as the host for the Chicago, Chicago, Chicago and Chicago-to-Vietnam jazz night! I have also been fortunate enough to meet amazing people throughout the city who share their cuisine and culture while sharing a pleasant surprise.I love that Chef Gary Ribeiro has been so popular and provides a service that is just incredible! Please come hang with me, find me comfortable with you, know where you can get started, and be sure to check out "I'm Doug Ribeiro, please help my Chef get over the ridiculous wait."
I ate here twice on my own and neither of us could go back to
restaurant lives up to the reputation. It was awesome!
Very comfortable service. Very friendly.
My wife and I and a few friends started visiting Chicago over the past few months. Since opening up her place I have been spending a lot of time exploring the different restaurant options at Madison Square Garden, usually with great things. For our small appetizers, I had the spicy  Bordeaux Pecos, topped with a half the samuelle of crab legs for dessert. For appetizers, we ordered what I guess was a slow marinated chicken with canned garlic.  We ordered some mojitos and some rice.  The mojitos were great and somewhat salty, which actually made the mojitos taste so fresh, but wasn't quite as delicious as the rice.  They're not too salty. I would definitely go back for a more modest dinner experience.  Our appetizers and entrees were great as well.  Our waitress was very helpful, taking
restaurant, I personally love the variety of food and the service.
My other boyfriend wanted to try apple pie and everyone in the line was nice but not very inviting. I even called back later, but all was fine. Maybe he was just not eating there...but we'll have to wait another 10 minutes to get back...
I love to eat here.  It is close to my house and if you are trying to go inside get here quickly.  It is the perfect space for hanging out at all the big bars or at a night out with friends.  If you have a reservation, you can call ahead and buy some drinks.  The staff are friendly and welcoming, as is the restaurant itself.  The food is stellar!  Everything is packed and flavorful, but if you order a lot of pasta/soy they don't have a very good dish or dish.  The only thing the food gets you is a salad, so if you want something else,
restaurant. The first thing I wanted to do was to see if they were up to the standard of one of their many restaurants.The restaurant itself was very nice and looked very clean.  The service was quite attentive, but not so generous that it was consistently over the top.  I mean, it was absolutely insane to see all these people in front of you, just waiting to be seated, waiting for the person to arrive... but the staff and table were both clean and polite.  This was somewhat annoying, as the place wasn't originally going to have it's own patio but was going to be a large, multi-sided, expanded patio.  After getting a reservation, however, they started to move the first table and started to drive it inside and forth, taking it back out.  All these people started to walk through it, stopping, and trying to make sure they could get out.  They were ok, but also if they were like, two people in
restaurant, experience is smooth, and I was pleased to have something to recommend at the corner bar. I especially enjoyed the cafeteria joint.  If the servers don't care and are just about a sad little bartender, then it may not be worth the extra wait to get a table, especially for a unique time of the year.
I have been coming here since i was 5. It is so very comfortable.  That being said, this place gets it.  The food is amazing, the service is a plus and the music is always the right mix of energy and attitude.  It has a great atmosphere and can still be relaxing.  There is a drinkage fee with the party who comes here every now and then.  It is a great option in the Summer and Winter and can always be enjoyed by a group of friends.
Went to Napoli on my birthday and it's delicious! There are 5 appetizers they put in a a special "pita with
restaurant in Oakland doesn't have a joke. At least, they don't go about it and make you feel welcome by exaggerating the horrible treatment of my burger. There are no other restaurants that are as obnoxious. And when I ask for my food, the waiter seems reluctant to offer to pay.
Me and my dad are from Texas, so we came to Monsey in early 2008 for lunch. First of all we were not impressed by the ridiculous food. We already have tried a number of places along the route as a child, but every time we went to San Diego I would have been disappointed by the time we finished. I say "fine" because for some reason the food is tasty, but the service itself is ina bit slow and of a boring. However it was good as a rock, not something you would get in a bar. The food itself is not bad, but the staff was not attentive. For those new to the menu and family that doesn't
restaurant, and this place is packed!
Ongoing discussion, it is high time that the heat, by being very high, had seriously rocked a little of my eyes.  I usually head upstairs, and with plans to go upstairs the noise level in our house is ridiculously high! And our waiter, Joe made it clear that we were at a great time, and was making up his mind to bring us a drink that wasn't immeasurable in volume or quality.  I was greeted with the (very obviously"mish" of) flag request we were receiving.  I'm a grannyfrogger and most of the girls of our two table ordered a large bottle of sherry, and we were to turn around and give the beer to Joe who unfortunately decided to not order it.  He just ordered two glasses, which were short of the national top, and then he sat with his host to place orders on the table and pay for them. 
restaurant, almost all of it! Parking outside was awesome - at least it was for me.At the end of the night my girlfriend and I stopped by the stall where we were a little cold, found a table inside, and were asked to sit in the bathroom for around 10 minutes. Both of us agreed. The chicago chickens are quite plentiful there, no complaints. I haven't looked to another reservation store for meals, but, I'm sure there are plenty of them on the menu. Can't say enough good things about Yoo Choo at FAKE! I will go back with anything!
Perfect  sandwiches. Atmosphere was perfect (the long menu list) service was not impeccable and the food was not all that well seasoned. This is BYOB, probably due to the hot-spot attitude of the restaurant. There was a lack of great french toast on the patio when I entered which really ruins the quality of the fries.
Absolutely loved the fact that
restaurant for a big group of 30, they still didn't impress me. But I had to pass this place because they make sure to keep every other restaurant open on weekends. Food: The toppings were fairly average, but it was all good and I won't be returning to this place ever. Really good selection and decent prices. The only problem is that I will probably be out of the Chicago economy for about 10-15 years. The number and amount of veggies you get as well as the consistent mix of very good staff will be a huge plus for us and would be extremely attractive to other places in the area.Service: I enjoyed the service from my first meal (around 2:30pm) before moving on to dessert which I have not been able to get. Upon entering the restaurant, I'm asked to sign my receipt to all of the tables and make sure I can carry out a quick order for something that I need. This was the only time that I felt satisfied
restaurant... =.. FOOD!! YES, NO.  When I was at Chipotle, I went on a 4.5 and it's just not awful (unless they took me to $6 (I don't know why).  So I went here, looked at this guy with the kind shifty looks, and they didn't have much beef so I decided to just try and get a bite. I really appreciated the look on his face.  From what I've seen, they have a really nice veggie on the menu that comes in 5 bowls.  I definitely love the steak.  On the $9 side, they have a nice draft of lobster.  It was nice to have a side, but we were worried.  Overall, we felt it would be a little bit more expensive than the upscale and with lower price points.  I really appreciate it if they stay open a little longer.  If the air is tight, the waitresses
restaurant, eat-in-and-go for breakfast and lunch. And, I really enjoy the outdoor seating as well. I have been to a lot of parties and am a big drinker so I want to go out of my way to try their steakhouse.The food was phenomenal. My girl who's older sister got some pretty good tacos, a chicken chilera and a calamari with some sea salt. Really, the only issues were the place's not very appetizing as many of the girls I've tried haven't had any meat at all. The review they sent me was much better though. The waitress was very kind, somewhat nice and helpful in the end and had a great time making it all happen.Overall, I will definitely be coming back for a drink, maybe wait at a sommelier's table that I have never seen in my life. I'm big on sommelier's tables, having been there for 3 yrs in my dale
restaurant area is awesome... so much so that when it comes to visiting you'll have to shell out $25.00 for an entire meal. They make they sampler boxes of unlimited items that you have to bring with you to eat. This is great for making your own chili pepper wedge chicken that you have to serve. I've never tried all of the pepper on the chicken. But I do think you'll be able to make some tasty and delicious soup that comes out hot with a nice wedge of spicy.
We went there on a cold day and were enticed to try it, so we made the trek there. The Food is really good so it was super convenient. We can't wait to go back here again!
The food is always good and the servers are nice. For months now I've been a fan of the Crabhead in Bakersfield and would be tempted to take the perfect flight to Brazil if I had to. However, I've experienced similar food
restaurant for the family. It's a relaxed and pleasant place to hang out and eat and drink in if you like a good late afternoon meal. If you have a non-Asian and be in your situation, eat here right away.
I won't say this as a fan of the Burmese or black beans-style burrito but this is a pretty good entree!  I would take myself if I was a Mexican and my meal was cheap so I will be taking home that one.  They are true sommeliers and take good care to add a fresh twist to the ambiance.  If you have ever served one of these, you will love this place.
I've been to new places for brunch recently, but don't know where I am.  They offer 5 options: Truffle breakfast, lunch, dinner and breakfast tacos.  My friend says it's just the most delicious thing in town...To arrive the next time you see us, head
restaurant and perfectly complimented the hotel, food and decor. The authentic yet stylish feel and service of the restaurant really helped give it a nice, contemporary feel to it. You can go to Restaurant on weekends and weekends, or you can stay here until the brunch hour. It is definitely a much busier atmosphere with a relatively intimate feeling to it. No matter what it is about you will be back at least once again in the coming weeks.
my speciality is their Neapolitan spaghetti sausage.
Great late summer evening French food.     Service is very reasonable, but extremely busy.   I wanted to give the guinea pig a shot and enjoy the meal.   The food did start off perfect and fresh, but as soon as you get a steak it is in there and you can see the droppings on the steak.  I highly recommend  (apparently) they just changed the tomato sauce for us.  We were not disappointed but
restaurant is amazing, family owned and operated and we love that you can taste what each dish is made of (the chips, the salsa, the spicy sauce). Try either the pork chop or a deejillo on the dish, and try some to your heart's content. If you are new to dining, we recommend getting a reservation to look for a table.
For a romantic setting it was a huge hit. I came here with no reservations and had to go back to the bathrooms to get my food. When the doors open on Thursday 11/6, the red frickin lounge will be open to you. Loved it.
I love every word the restaurant says about this place and am constantly bombarded by people who are making all sorts of suggestions and suggestions that don't make sense. The exception being the tasty grilled salmon that is served with basil on it. I would say it's been excellent.
I couldn't give a better meal of my life,

Chicago Oatmeal came with breakfast in a similar style, this was a special combination of old school and new.  They cooked it hot.  We served a basic oatmeal breakfast, I was loving it.  Maybe I'm right.  The mac and cheese sandwich was phenomenal.  And the only thing missing from the lunch and dinner menu, besides the potatoes, was the rice napa variety, they were still eating, finding ways to start rich rice over the same temp as the breakfast salad.  So my husband ordered our orange croissant and order the cornbread.  His first order we ordered was in Spanish.  He asked me to hold him down as he left, he was sooo rude.  So I did.  And then when he came out he looked like he could have been killed.  If he ever shows up it would look like that again.  And then that's when it hits you: large rice napa & rice
restaurant restaurant that served the best Italian and Chinese food and the ingredients are always here to stay!
Horrible food. I am an American and I don't like pork, but I think it's worth the money. It's a busy restaurant that is basically a dark diner. The service is average, but the food is tasty.
Great food but unfortunately, some say that they steal into their little offshoot from the reputation of the LA area. The food is overpriced and subpar. They charge tip for special menu items such as the "blender chicken" (which is supposed to be a special course of chicken), "Foxy Chicken" (which is supposedly a special, dipping dish of pork dish), and rarer and higher quality dishes. They use a store (and a storefront) that doesn't seem to advertise, because if you're a first time diner you will be confused by how their food is priced. For example, we made dinner last night. This
restaurant is de rigueur and we love it.  At First Impressions we order our cheese creme brulee and then order our "spicy meats" to top it off!  We order out of our packet of salad which is the most incredible thing to ever happen.  We had the same order of ingredients but after ordering everything we were told it was simply not as good as what we expected.  I went to our mother's birthday party and it was a fantastic experience!!  The soft onions and fresh squeezed lemon juice were very nice.  I'm no dish designer but I've had nearly every dish I have had in America-that's how good these entrees are.  We always make sure to order a healthy salad, entree or dessert by request, just in case.
I live in the area so when I live in Rockville I get asked about so many things I want to say. How can they possibly NOT say the coffee?

I'd like to get in right away.  I went to Crossroads in May 2010.  I also went to Fred and started using the 'turkey house' because of the dish.  I got the coffee and the fries.  I thought everything was terrific.I mean, I've eaten there twice now, but everything was impeccable.  It's kind of a pretentious establishment and the food is sometimes terrible (and undercooked, by the way), but I like it.  I've also gone to Sprout this past year and it's very easy.
I love it in Ota! Sights/Auxes. Like alot of restaurants in Ota, I know this place has a name. Ciao Chinese Americana isn't as good as it seems, but its that good. The salad bar is amazing. From lunch to dinner you don't get the hot weather nor the sun but you get it. The wings are very
restaurant: Carob, will let you choose from: Ribbons and entrees (which includes the top item) - pretentious, unnecessary, and not particularly appetizing (this place is getting pricey and is quite crowded - I guess that's all there is to it).   Good guys are always there for...
The art and decor of the dining room are definitely top notch.  Food is always fresh, clean and has a little of everything.  The whole food menu features some of the greatest dishes of all time, from chicken, beef, fish, pork, butter and churros.  Everything is great and full of the usual options. The service is a little sloppy, though that's probably not something you would notice.  But to judge by the decor you will soon find yourself in!
5 out of 5 Great Mexican Reuben, no complaints at all. This place only serves two or three mojito guacamole. Made out of cow
restaurant, though, was a touch-to-feely. What I do, however, would be to write a review of a three-course meal with my family at home, with no pretension to get things done. To sit through, we were presented with a jar of pistachio and walnut chips in a bowl. As soon as we finally ate, the chips came out with a delicious amber tartank. We immediately ordered the tamarind or marshmallow pasta (bread, panini, tomato) and had two medium sized items stuffed in the old fashioned cheese. What a contrast. It was a great combination of savory goodness and refreshingly salty experience. Everything else was marvelous and almost completely unpolluted. As soon as we tried the cheesecake, the only thing we asked for was that it should be completely canned in the middle of it and not leave in the hot room. On this trip to South Korea, I am very fond of homemade cheesecake
restaurant in the neighborhood. The food was great, the service was great and the prices were good.
Everyone was getting nicely dressed. Our waiter did not just decide how our guests should order and then he was definitely attentive to our requests.
Great food, great service and great prices for a very good business meal.  And we ended up going back for another with a mediocre rating.
Maybe I don't understand so much as the employees who treat customers very well. But I like the sort of service that I get here, which is excellent. I also like the fact that the pizza is absolutely dang tasty, just don't expect it to taste like the normal pizza.I also like the fact that the closest one that I have in town is at Reeds. Same house with smaller windows and back wall so you don't have to look down at you to see it. It makes the food look more authentic, which I thought was the point. The full-service restaurant
restaurant, A&B - Pigsty, kebab - karaoke and sushi. There are plenty more -- people sit outside enjoying the food while they drink, we've had pizza and beef tacos all over the place.  They do have an outdoor patio, but they don't really make you feel like you're going to sit in the same bed and get to eat somewhere else.  Try Stem Caesar.  I mean, there are better pizza options in the city (and yes, there is dinner).  You might miss our all-star dinner, but you'll see us again and again, and again.
Wow! I don't have to tell you, and I am not an expert on Italian food, that this place is amazing.  I just ordered Margherita Salad, Charonita Salad, Baroque Salad, and Special to be honest I never had any chance to write down all of the prices and time I wasted because when you order
restaurant with a small table and a large serving of fish, chips and french toast.We had some sour crab and it was surprisingly delicious.You will not find enough delicious options in any Sushi restaurant in the states, but the food was amazing! My brother ordered SushiJuan for the first time in 6 months because he didn't have so much sushi in his 3 year birthday but he was spoiled and returned right to what we ordered. I will be back again!
We came to SushiFest and we loved it!!  We did everything in a hurry, trying to get the food (some of it "too many") for our group from the buffet - but we were able to complete the meal BYOB which we were expecting.  Just like the restaurant, I also ordered my favorite drinks, like Fogo Napo Panu Lajita & edamame (terrible cold) - we had a lot of them, some were allways damn good. 
restaurant: Bonanza. It's best if you're a coffee-only eater.
This place is always an excellent place to take in a group or an evening. It can even be a corner of the city for a party of a few people. The chicken always comes out sweetly warm, fresh, and the beef always adds the saltiest flavor to the meat. It's like we're visiting Mexico for a weekend dinner, and we love the chicken meat.The food is amazing and does NOT take us anywhere near to happiness.  The food is amazing and is tasty.  Everything was cooked well.  The prices were reasonable, but the fact remains that the deal was very good. The wine list is exceptional.  I have taken to the restaurant every evening and will return.
Been to sushi around, but nothing special.  Lots of places that are very small, and none exactly "diverse" about what you do.  The elegant barst
restaurant and a delicious meal.  I don't know of a meal that is over $10 at this point.  It just so happens that they serve a lot of different specialties and that made the atmosphere so cozy for me.  On top of everything else, it was enjoyable.  The food was perfect.  The service was great and the food was very fresh.  On the other hand, the overall score is 3 stars.  This place is ridiculously overpriced.  They have a lot of staff, and I really don't care if they have the perfect glasses to brighten things up or not.
Such a wonderful place to go. I like this place for lunch. The food is wonderful too.The waiter is very friendly and has come up with some interesting and delicious pastries.The service was stellar. I saw him at the event and was very happy. I love the job he does at the pastry shop so I hope this restaurant keeps going in the

Ok, so here I am eating like on Pepe on a Saturday night. Im not from Texas - love this place, unless you are moved in or on a diet.  I am from Michigan, with the style of burrito i mentioned and my meal gets a rush going out of Michigan.  I will be back again for more!
There was a nice brunch in my house that went great with horseradish-spicy beef. The service was pleasant, friendly, and attentive. The place is on the north side of the building that my friend took my younger sister out to. She came in just fine, and was telling her family she's going to this place for lunch. She's not being very welcoming, but she's not hiding from it.   The atmosphere was a little cramped at times. 
restaurant on side.  We could have been anywhere on the block!  The price of a plate can easily be, yummy!  For my favorite dish, I ordered the chicken rind and the potato entree was yummy as well.  Best potato entree I have ever had.  So good, in fact, that I bought a glass and tried it myself.  In a word, one of the best!
$6 for 4 girls and a gourmet food menu. The response to my request was an overly upbeat one. 5+ people moved into the restaurant while I took my 3pm move-out date. The manager was in charge. I had written reservations which we had received for each area. However, this restaurant took about 15 minutes for us to get reservation. Despite all of the complaining, we will return. Please accept my apology to the staff here for over doubling our bill.
My boyfriend and I went for dinner for just the other night
restaurant is called; that's how it should be.Their cashmere mussels are Greek-style and high quality (some of them even taste like real mussels, unless you have drunk them yourself).Their bagels are an incredible mashup of goat cheese, pilsner and watermelon and the only thing missing from the veggie berry selection is the Aroma Bowl. Being super low protein they've also added some marinated potatoes. At my price point I wouldn't mind spending $20-30 which would actually be an awesome bargain.


Highly recommended!!!
it was beautiful when I tried it out and im glad i didnt spend the extra $$ for it. If you haven't tried your crab curry thingi make sure you order this one. it was way above average price too. If you can't wait to go to the truffle shop on Truff street your going to have to try it again. they are a good place for taking family too however
restaurant & salads & day around and is our biggest favorite diner in Chicago. I have been there many times over the years and they take special care of my food needs. It's definitely a great place. I also think they have great bartender's staff. It really pays off.
The bathroom is totally spot on with the decor, decor and service.  Get the great wine list and it is on the cheap.   I used to be a fan of the La Salle.  I will now check out McDonald's again!  I love the wine list and buy my a glasses of wine.
This is definitely the best side of pork.
Had the vegan split which was one of the best meals i have had at this restaurant and I have never had better.   They have a huge selection and food at a reasonable price and the portions are huge.  In conclusion I definitely recommend going back for dinner.   You will have more pancakes and a side of
restaurant, helpful service, pleasant atmosphere, and tasty eats. Great when you go on a first date or while you're away on your own, even if you don't know what it is.
We were terribly disappointed when we tried the dinner entrees - most of the ingredients were sooo good we couldn't even make them taste at all.  Did you know the only option to put this place to shame was to give them 5 stars!  Nanna sang what she told us the meal - she was super charming and warm.  But some people had reservations for twice as long and all they ate was.  Also we got my beers, which are terrible, because they are expensive and will leave you hungry as always.  However, if you're going for something very special the line can usually be found here!
I've been here for about 6 months.  With the best people in the business (no disrespect the name), it's not for the faint of heart
restaurant and outdoor seating (I love the outdoor seating, sometimes it's hard to find a place that fits your budget). My favorite part of the experience was getting to visit the pet buffets. They were awesome and they were looking to display their private taste. The three year old one (my only quarantined, I had to come and visit after I couldn't stop eating), was definitely our favorite pet. We had a group of three. The one that was our best friend, really helped us get us. Once we left, they still looked totally cute and they were having fun with us. I would say they were the best part about the experience. Everything we shared and we shared their stories. You could tell they loved us. You can't get much better. A bit of super care and a relaxed vibe, the service is friendly and very attentive. I've been so impressed with the service of the owner, Eric. He's always there, making sure we have the
restaurant for guys, drinks, and food. My husband, we walked by and he had breakfast (he had a tomato kobe) and added maple syrup to my hot chicken soup. His apartment was full of lovely guys with great looks. It was the best that Chicago has to offer, and the only place I feel is that we aren't ready for a late night hangout.
The hostess, waitress, and staff are top notch. My favorite is Yuca yuca. She just seemed to work so damn fast that I enjoyed every single dish before I ate, and great service to help us cook great food. We ordered whitefish soup, mussels, crispy green tomatos, boiled garlic sausage (not entree) and a churros masala, and the fried eggplant and the next course was grilled riros, so they were meaty, too. Overall, great place, reasonable prices and the service is superb.
We found sushi here on
restaurant and a phenomenal selection of wine and delicious sandwiches. I recommend this location for those trying to get a better experience out of their apartment. On the street, it's just a parking lot and there is a lot of parking and bussing at the foot of the busy Loop.  Otherwise, please avoid the restaurant. I've been here a few times now, and the food is pretty good, though not as good as its spicy brethren.
$25 a person. I'm the guest at this place, they went pretty fast I'm sorry to say.  If you have the time, order you drinks with your dates, it's normal.  We only ordered one drink for each of our guests, so it was probably just random behavior that was making it difficult to find drinks.  With my dates it was a $50 bite!  The wine selection was only mediocre, and though I'll be back, I'm a pork-bean fan if you can't get
restaurant & red meats. The reviews are still on a a level playing field and many restaurants do not like the quality of their food (and I believe they have become addicted to the product) and the only reason I've found this bar is to make bad choices. The food is absolutely addicting and the casual ambiance makes for a great place to go after working at home or for family meals. Can't wait to give your brat a try. It's been there 3 times now and will stay the same.
The patio is more than just a nice relaxing place for parties and casual nights out. Our server/fiancée, You! (the love is with) has totally perfected the art of good Italian food. (or can we say, the art of bad Italian food.)Everything from pasta to spaghetti is amazing. Not only is the staff there perky and bright - well-hung but they even provide that tiny table w/ tables and banquets.
restaurant, but I wouldn't say that it matters in this city -- especially when it comes to eating meats on an extravagant and cheap set.
We shared a rooftop terrace bar to breathe new life into Chicago's dining scene. This is our first attempt at a burrito place - if this wasn't the first time, we would totally know. The result was amazing, impeccable service, and a truly exceptional burrito. When we decided to take a moment to imagine my new perfect burrito I knew it would be.It wasn't our first time coming here - we took reservations for a prior week after our last stop - so we were impressed, but not thrilled. Then we had to try a different place, which was pleasantly different. The decor was best-known for this place's elaborate 20-point decor, but the ambiance is relaxed, a great spot for informal dinner or a full-time evening. Even the biggest cabbages get a special treat!Our
restaurant, spices, spices, fun, drinks, BBQ, food, and I am excited to experience the experience.  I will make sure we do our due diligence.  I will never give away one of these places in the city again.
My boyfriend and I love pizza - we had the Sausage King in NYC and Margarita Place just prior to our first visit. However, now I am not so sure that it's my biggest restaurant! Our server described it as a "Burger King". Also, he did not like it when we ordered the Puff Daddy Pie in - it's a mixture of Thai and Alaskan meats...We ordered the Chicken Brutal Pie (Thai), which the butcher ordered. We still paid for the pizza. We called the butcher to check and he wasn't answering.  They promptly tried to do that.
I went for the flight based on the phenomenal server and the food and they were outstanding.  For all
restaurant: Whitefish(half - 90% wine pairing, full service or full booth) ; 2 sets of bartender ; bartender ; assisted; pool table is a long list. The cocktail menu is made up of either duck or beef. Most deals give 5 dollars worth of anything, but you will usually get far less than your original price, or at least at reasonable prices. These are basic, uninspiring entrees, and if you don't like it, you will have to wait a few years to get used to it. I have to say, the second thing that got me running with this place was a comment by one of the reviewers on my previous bill I had last year that it was $300 cheaper than the best beers of the year. Gooding the Yelp reputation was no small feat.
I've always liked the French hot dog.. It's like the two works of art. Our waiter was great but still spited at a lot of detail..You get 3

My husband and I went to Andersonville last week for this amazing tasting restaurant. At first, we ordered breakfast, bread and entree. The bread came out fairly quick, but it was quick. Not even close to breakfast if you go in a party that most people are usually by themselves. The breads were good, but not great. The service was excellent. Overall, my experience with this establishment was like entering the kitchen. It would have been very nice if we could have gotten home early, but honestly, the staff was amazing! Service was okay, but not very friendly. I'll definitely come back.
I received a complimentary complimentary tasting menu for a friend tonight. I was so excited to hear what it meant to be a vegetarian for the first time.  We were told that we were all vegetarian, and the idea of serving as other people eat nothing but meat is very appealing.  Our waitress at the bar served us one appetizer, and we

Although I don't know what this place was, my overall experience at 10/2 would have been disappointing if it weren't for the many positive reviews I got. I would have been much happier at Outback on 3/6.  An absolute gem, even for the service, and an incredible place to visit.  I will certainly be returning and returning again this season.
I have been going to pike servers for about 30 years. The servers were terrible and cold weather kept us up at night. The waitress next to me had to take out $15 bottles to my guests in advance because they would eat $10 of their food. My dish was always broken or messed up. They had poor service and expected us to enjoy our meal. The reason for this is that the servers threw out all of the dishes that would have
restaurant, medium, and good meats. Definitely worth taking a look in!
I love my pizza - and I love my burgers and breakfast. Topping it off, delicious pieces of ground beef perfectly seasoned. We also had to leave out the last 8 pounds of fresh chicken and a single elbow of cauliflower. Needless to say, the last two sandwiches were just as satisfying and hearty.
The service was excellent as well as excellent. I'm a casual eater and the    lunch menu is the only menu I'm allowed to see. The food was mediocre in most ways. The   food is what makes a steak call for perfection in the week and also just well done in your thai club. Overall, I'll definitely go back again in the future.
This place is definitely worth going to! I have owned at least 10 different restaurants and experience have lived a total lifetime of success. I've been traveling many times, recently and I would highly recommend the
restaurant is excellent. The meat and drinks are hot!  It's great that this restaurant can be so important, and still have the best sushi in the city.
Love it. Great cocktails, and more than you could ever ask for in the Bay Area.  I'd definitely go back again if I were out of town, but it's a great place to go, something it seems to be missing since most of us leave whenever we are in Chicago. :)
The Gorman Memorial is a spectacular place to visit when you are on its way to dying down, and its a comfortable wait (yes, plenty of wait!) for a game of Pinocchio. Well, it didn't seem like anything was going to happen on Sunday night. Maybe it was - it was literally a deep dish connoisseur who decided he wanted to go there, and wanted to get some better Gorman stuff. Or maybe he just wants to do this experience for charity and allows the pun
restaurant food, along with wonderful wine. The music was amazing and excellent.
I am definitely go-to hot spots and I'm not addicted. The parking lot is a nice size and the food was better than expected!  They are very light but the service is friendly, friendly, upbeat, friendly.  As a hostess, don't get my word on the fact they will be on a slow going day and offer nice meals to suit all sorts of needs. For anyone looking for nice tables and a great atmosphere.
Love Chicago Sun-Times No One Really Deserves To Go to Chicago Sun-Times, but they deserve a star (which is hard to get from it's star).  The place is busy, but not as busy as other places like it has become over the past five years.  The food is fresh, and delicious.  The bartenders (who will gladly bring their own sauce to check for yourself) did a terrific job.  The brunch
restaurant prices and great music, come along at night!
Love this place, really good food and cocktails (especially my older brother) and a lovely patio.  If you are close in time and want to make the trip, check out Demerara!
Well, I think it's a good place to go if you're outside of Chicago! I think it is a decent size, however we all know it's a real downer. The salads you can order (are yummy!), the light breakfast items (health cream sauce, churros) on the side of the pancakes are my favorites. This place has great music and doesn't feel cramped. The service is average, but they have a great amount of empty space at certain times. I've been going there twice now and the first time, I always get to get paid. Then, a few days ago, I saw they had a bomb thrown when you try to get inside. Just thought that we'd try
restaurant, joe-is-home, and Wicker Park Park. The group took in groups of 10 or so and got a great deal on a spot for just 1 person for a fee per person or $10 if you got to go 3 times the cost. Simply phenomenal.
Wasn't an overall bad experience.  We got served up by a couple for a meeting about 3 or 4 minutes before my appetizer arrived.  It went well, so a little overpriced.  We are sad that a city like Seattle or Chicago really needs a pizza place like this.
Is there such a thing as a "outstanding new restaurant?" Well, I'm not sure I would have anything to complain about if I knew about the dedication, effort and non-professionalism of this organization. But I knew it wasn't going to be like every other establishment in the city...it was very disappointing.  Especially given that Chicago is a city where its patron has a gl
restaurant. I've always loved the atmosphere of this place. It is really cool.
From this: "let us look up some food"
One of my favorite restaurant in town (be it chef, waiter or food enthusiast) in the area. Gotta love the atmosphere, although it also reminds me of an old place like Carnivale, which I always lived in which is a pretty good wine list. My name is Terrence and I'm pretty anal about it (I was a waitress here at one of my cousins' wedding parties) but I've always had my favorites: pasta-starring encased in red wine, veal-driven hot dog, and the oatmeal-steamed oatmeal pudding, they've all been made with ingredients that are amazing (such as fresh carrots, I'm sure). The menu for the day starts with an endless entree that seems to recur until your meaty chicken are stuffed by the long list of ingredients that includes
restaurant, cheap and tasteful.I love it so much I had to try it.It is beautiful - it is traditional and delicious.I highly recommend the rest of the evening to anyone looking to come try this place!
Amazing sushi sandwiches, with so much variety, then 2 beautiful sauces and cool risotto in the flour bowl. Can't wait to try!
The BEST Pizza. Worth the money!
We went there for lunch and were given a taste of hotpot food and good Italian food at a great price. I had the poneillo soup and this is the best piece of meat I have ever had and can't wait to try the sauces. I love getting their bean tacos which the pancakes are great! The standard strawberry dessert is just a mind blowing melt in the mouth and a perfect combination for sure. Then I had the mashed potatoes and the searing steamed spinach with brown rice dipping sauce. I love both flavors and will definitely go back.
I
restaurant continues to grow in popularity and is always being top notch. But, even if I didn't, I would definitely try their coffeeshop.  The place's very short and the decor is nice (except for the cute dinky decorations).  Although I think it is a decent Mexican restaurant, the prices could be a little steep.
Good and upscale, fresh and cool. The patio seating was marvelous. My sister and I shared a table there as well.  It was one of those booths that took a little time to actually open up.  All in all, they were well worth it.
Nothing memorable about the lunch menu,  but without the premium prices, there was something refreshing about the large variety of options, something odd or creative.  My boyfriend and I took food to Chicago, and we had a great lunch.  We ordered hot peppers and olives, and it was a perfect combination!  The eggplant was yummy and the juicy spinach
restaurant. Our waitress always says "So awesome!" and sometimes the portions are ridiculously big. Great pairing with Pizza and other good eats.
I often go to Alinea for brunch. If it's a romantic place where you can tell your friends and family that you're really going for romantic dinners, then Nuevo Leon is it. I've been there once only once in my life and I am always pleased with their food.  They are also open late and only available at night, so it's always worth the wait.  If your looking for a bar menu with some traditional dishes and a bit of some wine, then look no further!
I used to find Bambino's here on FD.  At one time I had never visited it but my wife and I were taking our guests here (white ganitas etc) for lunch.  Their food is fantastic and I'd love to try different varieties of them.  We went with our two best friends because
restaurant and others. Honestly though, I was disappointed, I will never go back.  However, the place was very small, the service was bad, and the atmosphere of the place was pretty nice.
I love this place!! Everything is fresh and great. Everyone here is great! Service was really good and cute little topper! I always order lunch. Will definitely be back!
The amount of meat they serve here at that rate does make it one of my favs! Although this place has several locations over and over, that is what matters, these two places make my next trip to Chicago worth the wait.
While I enjoy the hot dogs...this place can be an efficient counterpoint for any day of the week. Don't get me wrong, this place is good but its worth the wait.
Best Vietnamese food I have ever had!!! OMG I'm so glad I had my first Vietnamese restaurant.  I want to go back!  I have never had
restaurant. We also ordered the Pican?me and we were shocked at what our waitress did in terms of customer service. In his arrogant and pompous style, I could only understand why he put these ingredients on the menu. She said that, without waiting, she would have spent the money on a different dessert. Then, she added some fresh ingredients, some change, and frankly one of those dishes where you don't eat, knowing full well that it's food that is "perfection" to satisfy even the tastiest appetizer. We served that order and what he said then went on to say in response was incredible. So nice, and just going to pay the bills.
First off, this place is so awesome. We've just been coming here for awhile.  If you are new, you will be curious, they have a vegetarian menu with plenty of meats for vegetarians and vegans to try.  The wait staff is awesome, and the food is delicious
restaurant is very good as well. The food is good, so that is what I do for serious sushi.  Sushi is outstanding for $30 a piece. The service is very slow but I am very good with my reservations. The sushi is really good and worth it.  The dishes are in line with the menu and the staff is willing to take care of you all the way.  My sushi night is by no means overrated, but the amount of money for sushi is not even close to what it is.  Next time I see a group of sushi geeks in nearby right blocks of Luxor going around downtown, I'm excited!
Awe a delicious and little gem.  First, they serve several of the best homemade scallops and what a wonderful summer evening.  We arrived about two hours late after our party and as a result, we were thrown in at 5:00 AM.  In other words, there was plenty of time for our
restaurant to where you can enjoy your cake and braised lamb.  The service is even better, their servers are super friendly and nice about moving you right back and forth between the courses.  I had the Tare, Ales & Bele wait to go for dinner (but got there without the service plates which are usually served on the counter or on the wall).  My partner ordered the minelette with mozzarella and leche cheese in marinara, so she ordered a sauteed cheeseburger and at least half a dozen cheeseburgers at a half price.  I was not disappointed, and I certainly will not be returning.  I'm not saying I should expect better service, just that I appreciate it.  But in my eyes, their food was more than enough.  Best people I know will never make an argument with me over a food menu like this.
It was busy at breakfast. I think the restaurant is in somewhat of
restaurant and also their pizza. They give you a fresh twist on your favorite filling. The best part about life in Chicago is the ultimate Texas Chicken Restaurant, with their great wings, wings, and even brisket. Each steak will be quite tasty. The service is very attentive, if you're in the mood for a smooth pancake. There's been a lot of hype about the Texas chicken salad. Now for the juicy special entrees: we went to see who had a Wisconsin Wildfire with crab legs.  The burger was phenomenal, but my favorite was their lettuce.  With that in mind, I ordered 2 items.  One was a combination of crispy thighs, prosciutto, tomatillo chips and an onion ring.  The other was an interesting seafood dipping sauce: it was solid, and really seemed to compliment your salad.
Awesome food that can be enjoyed at the restaurant.  Good deep dish specials that are affordable.
Stopped in for a brunch
restaurant is the BEST i've ever had. I know i miss a lot of service but i want to respect that bit more. I used to pay close attention to my orders and remember there were 4 options for making an order when I really needed 2/3 off. I know you'll not find a ton of ways to cut corners when it comes to service but today is the day I finally had a different option.
My wife and I like NYC steakhouse. This steakhouse is the perfect place to start for a long and enjoyable evening. We usually order whole chickens first (ok after just a few meals) and then, after a quick bite, the meat goes over my tongue and starts chucking out every bite we get. The atmosphere is comfortable but casual enough, the pizza is to die for, and the bacon and sausage are very good. Prices range from $3-$6 per person, or $15.00 per person. They make a nice point that they're
restaurant has held at least two of its restaurants since the restaurant opened in 1992. It's a place where you can relax by taking food from other restaurants and buy other things that won't make you stand out in crowds.
Quite frankly, I love how we can get our karaoke drinks at Chipotle on Sunday nights because that's where they open up this Saturday. I also enjoy it with friends if they are more into that type of eating and are not too focused on the others table, which I do. Besides that, it's a great table option for a casual meal that can take a short walk or three. The homemade tacos are excellent.
Like the hot, smoky soup place in Chicago's Chinatown. When the hot needs to run out, I prefer eggs. They deliver in strollers with the children's box of chocolate.  People can bring it with them and there are a lot of them out there. The kids can come up here to chew gum and
restaurant for brunch, macaroons and seafood, and my favorite tacos and bbq, however I prefer a better atmosphere and perhaps even a budget. This place is here every night.
Last night we went with the homebound couple and we were greeted enthusiastically by fellow fans. The bar was quite loud and super loud as they passed our table. The owners of this business put this place on a list but we ignored the sign and were escorted out. The receptionist/bartender at the bar seemed to have become like a an imposter who was giving away the place until all of us agreed to leave. Needless to say, this type of mentality would not go down well in some time and that customer service would be a top priority. Would it be nice to have a bigger place in hipster cooltown when it was truly a bar?Well definitely. There were a lot of seats and a staff that was all friendly, welcoming, and attentive to our needs. They also

After hitting water out of the nose I decided to go ahead and visit the infamous opening and basting room of the Nino's. After going over the menu, I noticed that many portions weren't enough. The food was way too salty and bland to be of any value whatsoever. I tried all the steak sauces and their bread, which would've been amazing. I took my wife to our table and was greeted by her belly where we enjoyed the all the extra service and skill of the chef, as well as the 4 burritos he used to make. We loved the steak and we're going back for steak no matter what my recommendation is. We have a special guest, too. I have waited to go back over the menu for over two decades, and unfortunately, my previous visits were off. I will be back, but in case you didn't spot the bad service, I recommend visiting Nino's.
I have lived in Chicago for a year,
restaurant and try their roll with lobster, bacon and seafood on site. I highly recommend the Beurafa & Ahlu'l which was amazing and always delicious.We had the hot bell pepper on deejes guillot, steak tartare, pita mix, peronaisse and goat cheese. It was soooo good. the onion rings were really crispy. I will always go back to LaBarbara when I am out there.
yummy! (8/10) Is sooo good. I do not have it on my list but I do have a fondue too. Nice appetizer for dipping and it is good!! Service was simple. Next time I will try the cold crepes and appetizers.
One of the best burgers in town!! So s---, i never thought I would be able to eat here but  The hostess was attentive and her boyfriend was very pleased with the food! The man (no father!) who took
restaurant" has fallen in love with the place and it's got a nice price tag. In my opinion the good thing about this place is they can't get enough of the people who come to make up for their lack of prior experience.  No warning - they have work available to do and it is BYOB, which is a problem for staff members with heavy needs.  Keep an eye out for chicago visitors so you don't miss a second chance to take advantage of their atmosphere and friendly service. Also, keep an eye out for reviews, especially those of the return employees!
This is what i love about Zizza!!! Fresh and delicious!! Great service, friendly service, service, they pay real quick price!!!!
Best Mexican food!!!
Granite margaritas are great too. If you go early for a meal the service is there and the atmosphere is good. I am always late for work or the food is ok. They have a birthday dinner
restaurant, it is very clean and cozy. I like playing the bar area, so this is not one of them. You can order the beer and it is quite good. It's pretty simple to get from Gogo store at the bar, but there are many of those places across the street. Also, this place is absolutely packed at night, so you'll want to make sure to hit up anyone who needs your drinks.
Disappointed by the reviews. I wish it was easier to tell people by the age they were over 35 so I could have shared the place with them. Unfortunately I'm a guy who likes to go there for a date.  If we make friends and we feel like we have fun, it's great!My husband and I have been there five times and one time had a couple of drinks.  Their opening menu makes for a great list as well.  Achilles' Day is a great date date because that's how much it took to
restaurant with several dishes at that table. The shop is actually very small but I found it to be very noisy and frankly, was uncomfortable. But here we are. 10 items to eat in my 9 hours of work, and I can handle it. :)
I had the patties a few days ago and it was really good. I really wanted a place like this in Chicago, so I figured I'd try it. Great place for casual dining and great food. Have you tried this place before?? Great food!
The kids always get what you pay for, regardless of how much. But the thing that really hurts me is that you have to wait 10 minutes for a suss...the jimp o coo it.....which is nothing to sneeze at. My mother literally went to the bus station and ate the food  we got. Everything was better. I still prefer this place to Lacey's but that's okay.
Amazing brunch, really good service
restaurant needs to grow up and learn more about the past.  The girls at the time were extremely loyally and the others were too young for that sort of task.  The current hipsters are accustomed to sitting up and taking notes on the dining room table.  This was always dismissed as a wasted opportunity for lazy girls or cringy young guys.  This attitude was clearly reflected on the dining room table.  Very often when dining at the Sabre, girls take part in a party and have people's glasses of wine before sitting on the top floor.  One of the regular girls on the Sabre told me of having been taken in by a man with a gun, because he thought she was extremely attractive.  When I tried to get the conversation off track, the man suddenly tried to explain that a bunch of boys on the Sabre are supposed to be guards for the boys.  Nothing has changed.  The cool dad is now the new boss, who
restaurant, brunch, or any other kismet/activity you want to take home.  The table really is very welcoming.  The atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming.  A very good place to eat!
To my left is a sitting room decorated with one of our own stuffed martini bottles on a table. We all have to use our English as a second language. This is the standard practice for adult Chinese kids. We ordered the Mahican 8 Cuz You Come Now, and I'm fond of this. They didn't bother to add this mustard from this place. Next to the chinese decor is another large drink bottle, about 5 liters. This place is as good as it gets with Alinea (priced $14.95), amaranth (range) or
I only had coffee because it was hot and not very fancy.  Also, I ordered the street potatoes and lime juice.  The great thing about this place is the family flavors. 
restaurant-workshop may be tough to find, but this Chicago-based restaurant/restaurant is still up there with favorites like Miller Garden and  the Krazy Burger. If you're looking for the BIG BLT of chicago goodness that it is and what is packed with authentic foods, you'll love this place. Please remember to let them know when you order that you will be seated at their table!
I love that your friendly servers can make us feel welcome and with fun,   they give us suggestions from my menu as to what appetizers you can choose from. I have used a hot dog, a lobster with sauce for mustard jelly-kebabs and the paring chops.  Awesome restaurant!  It's better than it looked at first glance. The oven is great and it's a great way to have a different dish during the cold (including spicy meats like wild salmon) but can be soggy after a dinner. Great flavor with delicate textures
restaurant, but very very cold to warm, nice.
For our first time ever I knew the word sushi was not acceptable for my boss when I first started to eat here (mostly to get along with the crowd, no matter what her name was, and to cuddle up with friends).  Unfortunately I found my last ever sushi place in Chicago, out of the way so I went back.
I went to, and definitely not to, Diner around 5:30 pm, which was awesome.  The hostess came by for lunch.  From there we were seated promptly, served a joint, and basically everything went according to plan.  There was never any toast entree on toast, my husband, and I went on for a meal.  Fried fish was fantastic, butter was creamy and sweet, the risotto (like ravioli, oh, Italian) was sweet, the bread was very good (can't wait to find another, ever, the old
restaurant, after dinner, although the owner insisted upon a list of things to do, which was not reflected in the schedule. I visited my table, however, and found the offer disappointing. My friend had asked if there was anything she could do to work a 30-day vacation. Upon initial hearing, she was perfectly fine and only said yes once we made reservations for the night. I went to dinner, but the evening before came out at around 10pm that afternoon. I told her that I'd get back within 30 minutes and we'd need to walk out of the house.  I assured her that she would walk me out of the house, we had to get back and get a place to settle.  I think most people realize that no matter what the price is, this place is practically an establishment, with bathrooms, refills, etc. I asked to sit at the counter for 3-5 minutes because I had to wait too long to eat dinner. The waiter had
restaurant, and bakery.

I had to stop in to the dining area this past Tuesday and the food was fantastic. I had a second in a quarter, everything was perfectly placed and tasty. Service was prompt, and the menu was delivered promptly. While reading the menu for breakfast and dessert came down quickly to my liking, I was still able to confirm that the restaurant's menu was not in a bad shape and my credit card balance had been updated. I also found it really informative to know that I would be able to make a reservation online for free! The beef ravioli was amazing, tasty and kind of cheesy. The house veggie risotto and the tequillette were both excellent. Both of these options add to the deliciousness of the meal, and I was impressed!
I am coming to the area only to see the greatest Greek restaurants in Chicago.  My impression:  Meh...and without even asking.  I have been to Xeople
restaurant & dessert area & ladies area = pork chop
In the prefect cellar! Try the cauliflower tenderloin, banana bread cake, crispy pizza... my favorite and really only authentic. I'm so glad I came here with my wife - they weren't very attentive when I brought the container.  Our waiter turned to me after our table. "Cauliflower tenderloin", we said..so he thought that it was great. I told him that was really good and asked him if he wanted some maki o leh! he ordered the burnt tortilla the first time I saw it on the Market, but that was because it was grilled! I told him the tortilla was cooked because it was very charred! He said that it was a tiny wooden dish. He just didn't want to wait! And I wanted to tell him that it was a new dish, but he just said, well we told him that we loved it! we thought he was kidding
restaurant?!?!... I cant believe it! Yummy. Am I missing something?? Try your butcher, but the gyros are just ok. :P Alfalfa. Until next time.
I love this place. I am a huge fan of Halapoula, sure it's a real Mexican place but since its a nice location with plenty of parking I go there many times to get around and cook food I like everything that it offers. Always check when I am in town.  The food is good and the place I went on a mission for. They have good rice cakes and crab cakes and they have a lot of pretty lotta at most gyros on the night (http://t.co/ClyR9oW9hjWY).
If you love Carne Asada: here you go! Got this review for my first trip to Chicago and it was true. I love this place as a place to eat, spend a
restaurant, we shared a lot of appetizers and appetizers. We had a huge selection, all included in the special menu. We were served those savory shrimp patties, a bowl of seafood with their mozzarella and a citrus scallop. The tasting menu was a bit long and we loved the innovative, upbeat atmosphere. After we got our drink glasses and bought some snapper eggs from the counter it was only half the price. The menu has a nostalgic flavor and color. The entire thing is very fast-paced and easy to make. It is also fairly loud so in fact there's always an opening around a corner if you want to hear the folks over the music, that do serve a la carte. With 20 friends from around the world coming and going, it's an intimate day out. For me, it was worth the wait and going if not for the hostess and excellent service.Overall, it was a fun night. We were disappointed in
restaurant (I also used Nikkei) has been lacking, with brunch menus disappointing for just over $200. You must have a reservation. Also, that is NO INDIA ASIA BEST AWESOME BLACK ALUMINUM EVER (which I don't understand. Im a white person), if you feel like being the only nonblack person in Boston, this restaurant is for you. Their coffees, pastries and other foods are underwhelming. Still check this place out. Try a margarita at 4:30 or as far as I'm concerned, because the lighting is muted.  Avoid the crowded crowd, as it's not something you want anywhere near as free in the city. If you're a mealgoer, it is up to you. The entire restaurant is so spot on it's worth that all of it is totally uncountable. Please give this restaurant an "A" or B, or if you are just looking for a glass of wine
restaurant, but not a pizzeria. The only reason I want a place like this is to know how much I miss my neighborhood, and on occasion to eat here for a show. These kind of places are just so nice. And you can feel like we enjoy these things in a way because the place is cozy and makes all the items you'd like easy to walk in from your kids' desks when they're still and awesome!
I love the Cheez Dumplings. They don't get paid. They get way more than the average food that gets paid for in a restaurant. The food itself is very good - not the best, but not the worst.
If you're feeling dirty/devious for thinking that eating brownies is a bad thing, I can't recommend this restaurant enough. The food is delicious and they have excellent selections.    The service is stellar.  The prices are nothing to write home about.  I mean, this is a
restaurant has huge wings and it's often busy. If there is no waitress there, go to Oldtime's Cafe. You should check out their falafel.
I am a brazilian-tender sandwich eater and I can't wait to go back!! Very attentive, served on a large table! I've been to Bud Fries in Little Rock several times and their bun is so delicious you just want to grab a couple of them. Their sausage buns are excellent and if you're searching for Vietnamese-style tenderloin chops, take the blanc-stained cut of beef and roll it out the fat. They offer a killer variety of sauces, and they have fabulous beer selections. The service is great, friendly and amiable!
When yum and yum go out for lunch and enjoy the food as much as yum and yum go out for dinner they don't charge you a damn penny. They start it at around 10AM on Sundays the
restaurant is all about the quality. Be prepared to wait and get ahead of yourself. Maybe you want to try to catch up on stuff that goes back to your days when it was Italian. If that's the case, then go with the restaurant. Don't go fast and you're not going to see how good it is until you know what's in it, but you're going to be fine. I highly recommend the ceviche - good or at least prepared and packed.
The leftovers are like savory mediterranean salad. The slices and pieces are very fresh. Everything is fresh and so delicious! It is one of the best Italian places I've ever had. Get the lamb chops and fresh love them!!
this place is charming. very friendly. especially when they are big. but great for when you can't find something from long ago. they have the spicy apple soups for more meat
The only reason I ever went to this place again was my little
restaurant made me cry. It wasn't food but I was getting it. They packed dinner every hour or so to ensure everyone ate a decent meal. Still, the food was beautiful. They had no problem giving us drinks. As soon as we opened the door the waitress told me that all service came from the food and the place itself was exceptional. As for customer service, the manager tried to avoid it but it was only a portion of what I needed. He did allow a few places to take reservations but when we asked if they would be able to take an item and sit us up on the counter, he was, I think, a little taken aback at what we were asking for. As far as food, the owner got it in a classic Russian style style dish with margaritas and melted chocolate. On top of that the place's now the dining room which was done quite well. The only criticism I can say is that the last time we visited, we ordered less than
restaurant, therefore I took issue with the policy...
Wow, this place has it's flaws. I did have one awful experience, and that was the freaking gnarly dinner I had there. The service was horrible as well. Despite everything, their food was so great I had no problem eating there. I would not go again.
Not too bad with its Italian food but I'm really disappointed, considering the quality, and quality of the food. Everything is superb, and though the food is not fantastic I've had good quality meats and organic wines which even though it's a little off from my liking for things I actually like and who don't eat well. I wish the meat were pureeier though.
You cannot get a better Italian restaurant than La Giornale, but they don't seem to care.  And the 5 stars I was given are no joke.  This could easily be done to keep the first 100 or so places a step closer to that
restaurant.
They had a good selection of wines which was a pleasant surprise. We would go back to Illinois when we can and hope they would open again.
Absolutely EXCELLENT.The beers tasted like real schlock with something strange. Very mediocre. It was great I guess but you have to ask.
I came here on a whim for the weekend for my son and a friend of ours who live a block away.  They were inviting us back once our table was filled and we enjoyed their food.  The prices were reasonable and friendly.  I don't like to order a deal like that anymore since we can't afford to go to this place, but this place is amazing.  It's great to be able to take your family or friends and get to a place that seems like they'll be getting your attention but isn't.  We'll be back as soon as possible.
My son and I will be back in June and will write about everything
restaurant, my only complaint was a great part dish was that there was also a couple of cuban cups for dessert.  At our table a pitcher of scallop was also used.  It was a delight!  We'll definitely be back, the food is good, and the wait staff was friendly and informative. I am always concerned about community, and so would not be disappointed.
This place was fantastic.  The staff was friendly, and the atmosphere was truly charming.  It was amazing if you want a classic American experience with the vegan friendly.   We are a swingers and love walking past Burger King and Whole Foods for fun, new place, and unique experiences.  You will want to check this place out.  I highly recommend their Tortuga Frontera and Thai Specials for different price points.
Went in the Sunda.  Eat at La Sabato?  Very good.  They have wine list (excellent) on
restaurant service, two or three appetizers at a time, and the whole establishment is pretty much a diner. Food was pretty good, the owner seemed to enjoy chatting to the staff.  Service was exceptional as well, the place itself was only served one night a week.   I wish I could say enough about this place - a very romantic restaurant.
My wife and I don't drive anymore.  I only go with a single person.  We have one girlfriend and have a co-worker, and we never come back.  We don't go to and complain about parking.  Nothing about this place is good, but it is what it is.  They have closed my place while I am still working and I am still glad I stayed.
Ok i just got my husband who enjoys another day with his wife for dinner and i was lucky to get there with him on a Sunday night for the chicago vegan food desert trip.   I ordered from the
restaurant is superb.  I recommend the crusted pizza joint ($4 for the falafel section. The fries I've had while in Italy, is incredible and that falafel fries are among my favorite kinds. If you like steak and you need a long day of eating here, then try the $1.50 burger.  The big tip to owner's in this neighborhood is that he treats his customers like kids for the drinks he offers. This restaurant also has a very private patio with incredible views and amazing views of I-75.
My husband and I went here two weeks ago and love it. I would recommend to anyone, especially a family, that is looking for affordable. The service was very helpful as well, and we ordered a free birthday cake when the service was slow.  That's a 3-course cake served on regular pancakes with toppings to garnish or homemade buttercream frosting! We were really glad we went.   Although it is
restaurant -- MMMMMM mmmmm, that's some pretty good pasta, you'll be very satisfied. :) The work of subbing out the dish, which I know was necessary since it wasn't perfect, might have been another problem. Food were bad, however, and the server asked about the number of people there. My server said no. At least, we were four chairs out of five. (Sorry for the racism, but also saying it's ok for a customer to walk up to us and ask if we like shrimp or shrimp sauce and provide the same services as everyone else...go! Everyone knows a shrimp salad is great! Who wouldn't?) Regardless of the situation, I can assure you that by this point, the restaurant was pretty busy with plenty of food. It would have been better if they actually had more work in other areas of their business, but as I said before, they have to cater to a different group of customers.And like we said,
restaurant and something I actually want to recommend. I love fried meat and homemade cocktails and almost always end up sitting at a table, reading the lunch menu, or watching high school cheerleaders pass out sandwiches on the table. But I love pizza, which is great with the price and the ease of the service.  It's usually a pleasant surprise when I am confronted with a gluten free pizza or rolls.
This place is good. The wine selection is very good and they go far down the pub chain. On Saturday there were a couple of boozers with bad credentials and walked away. Definitely one of my favorite places to go, especially if you are looking for affordable, or an enjoyable chat.
Great!
I am a black female of old and a so called superfane of ginger custarde. Food was great...I loved trying it at the store. Did not suffer any  random  finger-to-midget mishaps, but to top it off
restaurant of some note; service was impeccable; food is top notch. Puscata is a very nice place to take a date and if you are from Napa, you will definitely be the happy patron.
This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the city.  Everything is great.  The grill (again, our favorite), the seini, the noodles, the marinated giano, the jalapenos, the light roast pork, hot/cold, everything, is cooked great!  The presentation is spot on, fresh and simple.  This place is an absolute must for any appetizer lover.
Go to the Wicker Park (which is amazing right next door) in the middle of rush hour with friends because they call by Chicago and make you sit at the counter at the end of the night because there is some noise! We stopped in at Gino's, and my husband and I needed something here.  The menu is always the same -
restaurant

11/20/13 - we moved to an old space that was definitely gone.  We must say this place is totally worth every penny!  The food here is insane!  The menu changes daily with the seasonal specials.  It is delicious, from food.  There is always something to be cooked at the Endeavour, our main dish here!  Great place to get some Chinese or Asian food!
Chop N' Calamari is great. And don't forget the pizza. Nothing beats the road with the heavenly clams.The place is so beautiful and warm, you feel like you're in heaven! The food here is fantastic, and the weather is wonderful.
I went this weekend for my big week in church.  The food was really good but... the falafel we had was just okay.  I guess it was the beef or venison.... but overall it was quite good. I won't be coming back unless
restaurant by CHICAGO!!!!
I've been there twice now and the staff is friendly and attentive.The main thing I'd like to say about the Food was that it was great! The Pork Steak was excellent! That being said the menu has been completely filled and the server was friendly and helpful. The staff consisted of a full service bar-keep and really just let you know what it would be like to try new dishes! What is more, the place is quick, cool and funky - just ok at times. I'd say if you're looking for a great time, go there!
Probably best tasting experience in the area I've had in Chicago and love the food...they have the most expensive menu ever, affordable...and very service friendly. The restaurant does a great job at delectable things, most notably the hangover cures...
Great burger bar. I hate to mention this place is definitely one of my favorite in Chicago...beens to eat
restaurant pizza (not sure if I'm onto that one), the brioche bread that I'd gotten (and really liked, so much it reminded me of faggot pizza) and the Brazilian beef braised bacon stuff.  This is a must try for Italian pasta lovers and you can't go wrong.  Another positive was the amount of chocolate chips that I got.  Also, the sandwich was great (a little salty).
I felt like I needed to head back to say goodbye when I saw this place. Awesome food, great service, and ambiance. I wouldn't be comfortable living here anymore. Don't go back!
Couldn't have been easier to like here. I've been coming to this place for over a year now and it has gotten very popular. We have the Porcini. Not a bad little bowl of fruit but they have little likelier to drop in a drink than I would like. The wine selection is a really good if slightly
restaurant: Nana's.
The iHOP opened this weekend for the Great American BBQ.  The steak and seafood was juicy and we were all definitely looking forward to that experience.  It's really fun to step away from traditional dinner fare to be invited back by those around you.  My only gripe is that the bar atmosphere is more than a little loud.  And we had heard good things about the ambiance at the outdoor dance club.  I'd definitely come back if the bartender is charming enough.
Hands down one of the best dinners you will find.  The fish and chips are a little runny and not particularly flavorful and the homemade fondue is just awesome.  I highly suggest sharing them with your friends.
good portions and ambiance here and they have nice dishes. thanks for everything here. but I am sorry the steak house is so.... red quail razors,little crust,money,sushi, chicken dish,
restaurant," most of the room will feel a bit like two bedrooms, and a little bit like a typical hotel lounge. On the other hand, the ambiance and manner of each service can definitely be seen as some sort of nice check-and-gop. For a spot-by-step walkaround experience, this looks like the space they have under contract with should be recommended.


I only went to the Pecan Grill this Friday because of the cramped bathroom. After stopping for dinner at the china lounge, the sandwich and pizza are of great quality and great tasting. The pizzas were both so quick and just so good, the crust was delicious and delicious. We had the pork belly and jackass appetizer. The risotto was very pretty but very strong and cooked well and only needing about a minute of thiital process. You don't need to start looking for a choice right away, but they seem to be doing their darn job. We recommend
restaurant and value it at reasonable prices, too. The server was pretty chill and asked me about the restaurant:  It was a little cold so I let her know to pack it up in case you forgot it.The rolls were delicious: 2 of them were barely cooked because the jalapenos just took way too long to go.  The potatoes were good (1lb.).  The mushrooms had deliciousness.  The beans were pretty good too, too.
I have been to Chinatown a lot and was disappointed in the service. The food here is bland. I hope we just go there for lunch before going back.
I've been going here several times and never experienced any great, if not better reviews.  The third place I thought I had everything I wanted.  They've never kept pace with the actual, successful offerings, but everything looked gorgeous.  I was extremely disappointed with a Bump Chop (Seriously! It was amazing) and if you haven't
restaurant and bar. Only other reason I'm going there now is to get some more real food and entertainment.  The only decent thing I can say about the other 5 stars is the attitude!
The owner was extremely funny.  She had a very nice personality and brought out a wonderful cup of coffee for us.  We didn't have a chance to ask for a reservation, but we waited an hour in line before we could get seated. We were expecting more from him than we did from me!  He seemed like a cool guy at his level.
I love the place.  This restaurant has a great atmosphere, great service, an excellent food, and a great decor.  The staff is knowledgeable and attentive. I went here after the Cheesecake Factory paid the visit.  We tried the Caesar Salad and the Mushrooms and it was incredible.   My friend and I also wanted to order from Caesar Salad but were disappointed with the pricing at the local restaurant
restaurant! I love the taste and is very prepared for the atmosphere. It's ok to eat here and your dessert seems to be as good as advertised.
Went here to celebrate Christmas. And it is.We were there 1 week ago and were very impressed. It was amazing! I was the last person to be there when the manager came in and told us all about the location. I had the same experience you would do if you wanted to have a slice of meat to eat in the library. They all had fun working with our favorite dish and asked if I would like to have a dessert service.I had a massive martini with something I had been talking about. Yes, it was awesome. Tried the orange risotto, huge devit, their goat cheese cake, and an ice cream sunda. Everyone was making them so good and so delicious. I thought it was the coolest thing to ever happen to me.Overall, I am totally gonna go back.
restaurant (c'mon guys guys, ok? I might get you another?). We never brought ourselves too much to come back and we felt that if we were here it was because it was my favorite place. Their breading is exceptional and the Balsamic-Lafeux plate is perfect for any one needs a very special dessert! I'm still not completely sure if it's enough to make up for this and make it come again. If you go there you'll just have to wait a few days!
The Pizza is amazing! It's so freaking awesome.  Our waiter was super nice, and he offered to send us one of his meals that we ordered.  We thought that was a bonus -  but it would take longer than that because it wasn't pizza.  We have it in Italy now, and it is sooo yummy.  These kind of people just don't seem to care about the quality of their menu.  And it was delicious
restaurant, take my wife to the speakeasy for brunch to know exactly what we were ordering, and have someone take our food to the server! Overall, I'm incredibly satisfied with this restaurant and will definitely be returning again!
I really hope that you all have a great day,  Best Soup Ever.   This place is simply ROCKIN.  The food is remarkable, and yet the service is amazing.  The food we have is made all-star service, and they have such a great crust.   It's from heaven!  Perfect date night since you must ask for a refill if you want to make a reservation!  They have so much excellent local soup.  That includes a unique homemade salad bar.  If you're going to be outside of Chicago, this is for you.
I've been to @ MiamiJunkie twice, both times with my husband on the weekends.  We had the Malibu Bayou a little bit too
restaurant and the bread hits the spot. I was told that the spaghetti dressing tastes like you've just never eaten it, and I'll be there at least once a week.
Great ambiance, excellent food, and an entertaining evening atmosphere - best sushi in town.
The food was excellent, mixed rice along with a side of steak and chicken rasparinis was amazing and a delight. The only thing I will say about this place is that its so small that it will probably cost a little more then it should. Otherwise, good job!!!!
I would not recommend this place to anyone but people who enjoy Cuban food and for which I am a fan.  Once upon a time in Chicago I would have been indifferent to Chicago music, beer, and culture.  Our waitress was great and took great care of us, but I did notice several things that were atypical.  The salsa dancing was kinda slow, it was...not great.  The only small advantage
restaurant. The food and service was outstanding and that you don't expect anything of a Mexican restaurant or restaurant background at a'small' pizza place.  The service wasn't too bad, but wasn't great. I recommend going to you neighborhood pizzerias to have a lot of options.  The service in Andersonville is not great, but it is not bad. They serve the same stuff as the other pizzerias with our fav pizzas... they are ALL kinds of good and high quality.  Overall, if you have a craving for pizza in Andersonville you must go to La Cajon North.
The decor is right up there with the first Hot Dog bar in it's original glory.  Huge bowl of steaks, espresso, empanadas, and dessert - or just appetizers (although that can come with a cornbread with a whole lot of cheese, or simply a good layer of napalm in there of course).  The owner also came
restaurant to ensure the food stays toasty. My first bite was savory with dairy, and the second was creamy with raw almonds. The salad bar is full, though I ordered a chicken ragulette that was super soft and crusty. The dessert itself was delicious. Don't order the salad bar, I ordered my dessert before going because I was sure the food was tasteless! Overall, I'm glad I don't come here anymore because it's such an awesome experience. I especially liked how the androgynous little star was so perfectly cooked. Plus, I didn't want to go in the middle of nowhere and have every meal skipped because I wanted to spend an hour and 30 minutes just a few steps down. YUM. ( Oh and don't forget to bring your own wine)
I had the Blue Lights pasta salad when it first came out for Christmas, and the dish was DELICIOUS.  My husband had the other half which is some of
restaurant can start at $10 for the soup and barrique appetizers, they've got a decent menu too. I've been there a few times, usually on Friday evenings. Their cheese toast is awesome and not to mention the 5-course pasta and lunches:good. I actually made friends with a dude who was there about a week ago who was a chef and most of the food was. The sampler kimchi was amazing! They have on hand this great wieners which includes a selection of every soup.The food was a little on the bland side but amazing. I highly recommend ordering a bottle of Italian hot dogs over the kimchi because the staff were very attentive when they saw us over there and knew what to expect.Enjoy and feel free to follow the ramen experience on this trip around here. If you're just starting out, try to be a bit more adventurous than before. Try to go to a place as friendly as their own that doesn
restaurant (although they've recently been open at 3PM.)
I've been staying at this place for the past couple of months and haven't had to pay so much for the service.   It's BYOB for large group and it's great that the tables are outfitted with too much space.  I went with my manager & fiance & they both seemed to like it.  The prices are reasonable.
Place to be for any date night with food and drinks!  Yay la viele!
We are located at the North Shore and decided to come to this place last weekend for a 4 week stay.  We had an excellent dinner there and will be back.
Everyone's favorite pizza, bread & shell.  We lived in N and the decor is very nice.  There's plenty of good food, but the service is quite slow so the prices are really high.  We tried their enchiladas, pita bar and cev
restaurant on private business, in 1-2 months.  Located on 3540 N N Goodyear Avenue between Nuevo Leon Ave and I-15 in Claremont.
Excellent atmosphere, generous service with great service, and great artesian.  The downside is that the food was sometimes a little bland, but it was worth the wait.  I could have kept thinking.
I love this place.  They throw them at a party where it's cheaper than the club spot. They're packed, so they can even be stashed in the ground if it's Saturday and Sunday.  The only negative is that the food is the freebies.  I've given them several only once.  I'm sorry if you're thinking, "Why aren't you giving them those?"
One of the best places in Miami!!!  The owner (Bobby Kuzmar) offers extensive wine selections at an affordable price! He shows us what's available and what's not
restaurant: dry burrito. Appetizers: pizza and chips.  Atmosphere: relaxed atmosphere.We want to support our favorite "chicago setting" but of course we want to support their past mistakes as well.  It is not all that old.  They definitely set itself the bar better than the rest.  They have a good base here and if you visit them all you will appreciate their food and experience, everything here.  Recommend their tacos!There are several other groups here, but there are more.  It is not that hard of a pace to start off.  It is like having your whole house together.
I am very pleased with what I received from Schwa.  The selection of food I received was very similar to what I received from their Salads.  The sauces were really well executed.  They also cooked the mushrooms well.  I think the food really reminded me of the old vietnamese version of the noodle soup.
restaurant. If you want to buy greek food I don't know why they don't roll out vegan food staples like fried rice and french toast. I think the croutons are where you'd send someone to.
Yum! Next time I go I'd go all the way.  Even if it's true it's some awesome Ethiopian food.  I prefer watching their margaritas.  The staff is nice, the decor is classy and edgy but I feel like they've taken out a big fat wall of boring wankers with whom they have a long and affable line.  The food is amazing.  It is the best homemade fruit and cheese I've had anywhere.  If you're a Cuban or Cuban American you should get there immediately.
I went for brunch last night.  We dined at Bandiera and other locations.  It was a happy date but not memorable.  The place is unpretentious.  The singer gets
restaurant specials like the Highline or the Waikiki.  Our food was our standard size, freshness and very comfortable.  There's a window in the front window.  If you're a vegetarian, I suggest getting your meat wrapped in vinoes or hot pizza or baked noodles.  I felt like I was in a carnival of sliced beef with mousse, mint slices and crisp cucumber meat sandwiches.  The avocado stuff was super dipping.  We even had the tofu scrambled egg rolls.  My wife was in love with this kind of food.  After giving birth to our second son (who was also a vegetarian), I was really surprised by how well she did.  But it was very much  good.  She really appreciates her specialties and experiences.  We plan on sharing this place with a couple of friends and when it's open it will be free.  We have friends and co-workers who live in Boston so if
restaurant, was good. Otherwise my friend & I used to sit at the table for these people to deal with so they would act as extra reserve places for us. Yes....there is nothing fancy about this place. But my pal felt like he was being better served.  Waitstaff's speed & slow service are the problem. Would be great if I could see the signs for the bus, etc....
Love the doughnuts! Warm and fluffy the food made us feel honored and felt like they were being paid.  Everyone with a generous tip were so generous!  I have reservations to the park before starting this restaurant, but it is open.
Visited like the guys back in the day, always finding a good taco.  Great super sweet.Loved the space! You should stop by first...You MUST order. Yes... check Yelp...a 3.6 star review. Wow....don't be fooled.We had the chocolate mandarin with roasted guacam
restaurant and most importantly if you have an expensive bite that you need to order. It's very good which makes me glad I went here. I couldn't believe it when they sent me a super fancy red entree (my biggest beef I have eaten since I was kid). They also ordered TWO gazpacho margaritas for $8. It's amazing what a free fajitas can do. Finally I made it home and gave them the deal of the day. Good money you guys!
THE GATOR SPICY is an exclusive  diner/restaurant on Broadway. Every time I go I like to see it that is.  Hogging in the summer they have great nice/healthy seafood and decent olives (sometimes green). In the spring, the patio is where people can really chill and enjoy the fabulous menu. When I am coming to go, they have a fun outdoor seating area on the grand steps.  The diner does great work for us
restaurant)..where are the dishes? Then after I try one of the actual dishes..I like to read that she's very skillful.  So they've got a good feel to her tastes and a couple of times I say... it's just lucky we had to get more than that.
This place has good vibes.I have been to two of their on weekends, but at 2pm they take care of me and I have to wait in line for 90 minutes for a table to open. I am constantly afraid I would be escorted out of the restaurant.The food and service really don't add up to great service either. If anyone could stand up to the giant rude waiter who runs in front of the food..guess I would go somewhere else.
I finally came back to Peyote's.   My fiance ordered a birthday cake and it was delicious, honestly.   It was my 2nd full time job and we had not eaten
restaurant, We're in the mood for something fresh, not bitter but classy, a Texas steakhouse with an inspired crust, our only problem was we couldn't find something on tap for a price that reflected the day at the store. It was loaded right here! SO SUCH A CAKE!  Whatever we ordered we were okay. My crab salad was excellent, too. It was fresh, creamy, and delicious, but it was not too hot. I do not get hot food like on my hot dogs in my neighborhood. This place is on a Chicago train so if you walk in you're already out of your comfort zone. And for the $8 per person it's cheap, you can usually get a special table at no extra charge. Service was great though and the staff was polite and friendly. Hands down the best pizza place in Chicago.
I'm a young Mediterranean carnivore fan and for over 20 years I have eaten in numerous Italy restaurants. Great ambiance,
restaurant, and appetizer. Really nice, and I'm happy with what I had here and will continue to be!
DONT EVER forget about Burritos! I tried the menu in Chicago, Mexico and once again, all were terrible. The food was terrible. Check it out.
not a good lunch spot for a trendy brunch, but 4 stars because i dont believe anything about Philly!!!   The menu is ridiculous. not as good as the ceviche restaurant they put together for burritos!   Pk Americana....should not be in Chicago.
I love the flavor!  They have black beans and grape sausage at a great price!We also had a huge selection of Belgian cheese.  I have never tasted anything close to them in my life!
Food was amazing, service was super friendly and warm. Everyone gave me great opinions and they all were super friendly. SERVICE was great. Service was great and you will be back.

restaurant - My husband and I both went there for their second weekend and was pleased.  The beef dishes were incredibly well done, very pasty and made a great bistro or burrito.  It was a slightly more modest setting at the time, so we will definitely come back again and again.
I went here recently because I wanted to discover some special veggie gyro, meaty house/househouse feel to it. The items were great, not what I'd be dining at my restaurant. The kitchen was quiet, kitchen itself pretty small in style, smaller items (a sausage and the polenta box), but definitely the best restaurants in the neighborhood that have vegan options. There's really nothing like Thai gyro here.  I love the chicken omelets, with marinated onions and seasoned chicken, great fried rice, and other not really vegan options. It's just one of those good restaurants that bring you some unique food/lunch options while still
restaurant of a lifetime, it is worth celebrating the incredible experiences of visiting restaurants by talking to the chef in charge. They are truly unique and you will have a memorable evening. Our waitress is always amazing to help us out with any issues or ask about the items we need in order to fix our servers' mistakes. There is also nothing like finding another way to enjoy yourself in a larger restaurant! Highly recommend.
Not one that I am afraid to try these dishes on the cheap, their little "chicken soups" are seriously impressive.  It was very nice looking, and the chef knew a lot about their fried foods, such as the combination of spices to give the dish a solid meaty flavor. The veggies were very fresh and delicious.  Very tasty!  My only complaint is that when I visited this restaurant, I felt like I had the worst night of my life. I would definitely go back.
THE MATHEMATIC ICE CREAM.THIS TIME
restaurant. (and having a host on the street.) Nice waitstaff. Are all dogs enjoyed? No. Only wonderful room setting as much as reasonable size apartment apartment home can accommodate. Hoppy atmosphere, somewhat solid menu, and the food is an honor (and neither am I inclined to pick the toast of the day!). Best coffee in town, and one of my favorites in Chicago... Yum!
Thanks, The Factory.  Their coffee is better, their cakes are just great.  It is hard to say that a good/visually-viewable coffee place in the city is lacking in its style and taste.  This is actually rather a known fact because I was a frequent customer in the East Village, and their quality of coffee is breathtaking.  It would not be correct to say that their most desired coffee is Colorado Maroon.  If the baristas in Chicago have a real choice as to the course of service, then sure - they will go somewhere other
restaurant food and fresh ingredients to create our unique take-out menu. Hosting is great, the food is great and happy to go to any of our events. The Hops has a great selection of chips, olives, tequila and even a chocolate sundae. I would recommend entering a party, so to speak, for the in-group seating.
For live music, check. My father does come to Woodbine (you have to eat here and you will not know if you are looking to have a good meal on the reservation unless you walk out a few blocks before that). As a result he doesn't go after Cuban and Cuban entrees (who knows?) and the food is typically well-made. The price doesn't seem excessive, but since he only order chips, he needs a medium dish, no frills, no spice.    I think that if the desserts are left to rest while he takes care of the bills then they will be
restaurant, and by far my favorite restaurant. This place is to die for. We love this place as much as we love everything else we have to try. I would definitely go back.
I just realized this place has a good side, and it's certainly the most free for me. I guess I was forgetting something at one point so I can't really comment on it.  It's a wonderful little place that is always filling up all the time.  I love its potatoes!  Fantastic salad that is the perfect crunch at the right time.  The meats are amazing.  It's a delicious way to go...and you get to bring your own cash to get it.  They have dessert place options and lots of free cupcakes.  Finally, they have a fountain pen! A great means to enjoy yourself outside the food chain.  It's cool though that the place is always full, since, well, there's always a wait in a BYOB store
restaurant, Michelle Polatoy told us to ask for, "How can I get a pizza pizza?"Well she replied "So what?" Well the look on her face changed. She pulled out her boyfriend's expensive Valentino's I had only had yesterday and the front of his four calendar had an oversized slab of crepe cubed pizza crust which broke my tab. She pointed out the chaos of the pizza. I was so confused she asked, "What?" Well we never paid our bill and were on our way back. Finally she said, "You give me your boyfriend's card to pay a small fine. Thank you." And that's it. So this girl never paid and is now breaking people's bank.I tell everyone I'm a pro but when you tell someone you're not going to honor what they say you're not going to do it.  That's the attitude most people have on us.They go beyond doing our due diligence and say, "Well
restaurant (laying out bowls of soup, but the dinner menu includes a wide selection of grilled seafood, duck, beef, and other items of gourmet indulgence): I felt it was making me very uncomfortable to stand there with my hair pulled up my neck and walking around looking at their sandwich menu, while eating them. What's that? I know they served a breakfast sausage, you can still decide whether or not to eat that one. I went to the restaurant to catch up.It's not really recommended.I tried the French Toast de Pan mousse, the color of honey and the tangerine flavour matched well with the airy, sweet interior and fabulous food. The biscuits were somewhat salty, some of them were like extremely bland in color, and more of a mouthfeel... I was glad the menu of honey pie for your bbq varied with its diner name. The girl in the second row of seats really needed to be added to the menu.If you
restaurant in the Park would be appreciated.  I'm not sure if the fried rice that's sitting there is as fresh as it was on the menu.  The salsa is super fresh and refreshing!
Best Italian Grill experience I have ever had. The atmosphere was nice and cozy so i felt comfortable when i was in there. The service is efficient but staff is happy with their recommendations. It is a little hard to find a good place to go because some are willing to do anything to get something.I love the patio and will definitely visit there as many times as I can.
Our waiter, Kino, was super good. I hope she calls me every other night since we have to take the bus.  He said some really good things about people and the place was very quiet so you can hear the clinking of pomegranates in the background.  Everything was great, and the waiter seemed very apologetic and warm.
What can I say. Everyone else
restaurant. Located at the corner of Third and Pequod's Lane. Very happy and very intimate...had a little party at Villa Vista and came back.  One of my friends recommended Rock N Roll Bakery which was pretty decent...you could eat pretty much anything you want--a croissant, creme brulee, chicken sassafras, pepperoni & chorizo..(again...A new favorite!) Plus they had a cooking class and music class.  They were very welcoming...be prepared to make a reservation at the counter if you are into that sort of thing.  Nice atmosphere, so much good food.  Waitresses are nice and friendly.Great place to hang out with your best friend and family as well.
I am a bit enamored of the Nescafe for a variety of reasons including the extensive menu.  However, I live a little out of town and find them to be inexpensive.  It has been
restaurant and cuisine.
1. I went to a bar recently on a Sunday afternoon and the server told me that it would be fun at that time. I was just shocked and at first I thought, wow, I just stumbled in, I gotta have a drink here. She went on to explain, such an attention span, give me a date and I couldn't wait any longer. The food was delicious, from there I was addicted to it! We had our foie gras, cheese stir fry soup, shrimp ricotta, and goat cheese with so many different dishes that we decided that we wanted to go back for better value. The only problem was that we had just had our appetizers and I was still sitting next to that table watching, but I was fully engaged! Upon finishing the dish, I thought to myself, hey, that's delicious! And, of course we had a swiss chard sausages. I will probably never go back. 2.
restaurant - which is okay because of my previous experience, but the word deserves more than some calories - and a kingfish - which is also. Nuevo Leon, CA!!!!
Hoping to stop by for a little business. Service is simple and fast - i know you don't love service, but waitresses are rude. Great atmosphere, friendly staff. Parking is normally a little pricey.  I would think Chicago is much quieter than it is for such a great restaurant.
Definitely for experienced, familiar, and reasonably priced restaurant. This place is NOT priced for your budget, it's money well spent, and nothing pretentious can make you more excited for dining out, especially if you are a G1 star. Our waiter is extremely nice. They really have a fine line for new and new diners - and we LOVE it!
I haven't been to X+2 since 2:30 PM. I got here for my mom's birthday and it was my
restaurant: Entrees: (except sauces)

Great location and great food.  Everything they serve is great. I am extremely re-purposed, even on the weekends when I'm busy but the food keeps making me think about them too much.
This was the BEST sushi restaurant in Chicago....each i had was amazing, yummy and perfectly prepared.  The service was outstanding and to top it off we had the great Christmas surprise.  The wait staff was super friendly and knowledgeable about all things sushi.  I had the Kicto Negroni kai rice which was so good it surprised me which is awesome... it came out the way the instant it was cooked.... with love.   Also the service was prompt and helpful... I had many occasions to talk to the chef about the dishes and he was very friendly... even when I am staying, he would always be right back at my table...
I love the Wine cellar. I will be back
restaurant manager and owner by the name of Fracetostom has opened an upscale restaurant. He also has opened an even better store, that he's so excited about. One of the dishes they have used this week is the Italian Carnitas with a big, unique twist. We were pleasantly surprised. We also shared my waiter's personal experience of an experience I never would have had if they actually had black sauce at their service. I can't think of anything better than that for restaurants.Our meal was very appetizing, but didn't give you any room to sieve all of the pros and cons. They even host a pre-service meetings of their VIPs if they want to expand that special guests club. Some of our entrees were of yesteryear but everyone suggested the price and time at which they decide what to eat, well that aside from a 12 dollar quilt bag. The food was also horrible and came with a side of salsa and mayo and other
restaurant. Too good.  If you're short on time, come over here!
Food is DELICIOUS!!!  No one else in Chicago can compete.  They must be slow.  Of course we were greeted promptly and the service was pretty well performed.  The grill was lovely as well.  Not any meat being smoked, it's simply delicious!  The trip took about 5 hours and the service was well done!  Not to mention, they have a delicious restaurant on 27th Street that seats a small number of family who prefer to go in the winter.  If you're looking for fun and affordable lunch, this is the place for you!
I decided to make a quick return trip to Mexico City...a little late due to sun & rainy day in general, but oh, just the other night I had a guest introduce me to a group of people who are very much hispanic. I must say that at first I couldn't resist a bit
restaurant is quite lovely. They have a wonderful scallop that is also delicious. Good food - a nice spot for guests with allergies. The coffee in the cup was an amazing experience. You're at a private server in a coffee shop - the middle between a private office and a cafe. I highly recommend my FOREVER PORTUCK! My server never falters in their task! The pizza is excellent - very mild, buttery, deep. Hands down, my favorite thing in Corona.
Amazing restaurant. Not a side menu but this is usually what I recommend.  Are you an adventurous eatery??  Check this place out!!!
Pizza is superb. I've been here a few times and I've always had a great time.  The meatballs are so fresh and delicious.  The cheese is amazing too.  Everything is my favorite, and the place is very nice to host.  All that said, I don't often give any particular
restaurant Toni, Cheerios, and/or foods for dessert for the cost of the full experience and feeling good for the others!The place is very cozy and perfect for a meal with friends, or to give them some rest after work!The service and service was great and they were always fast and affordable. I highly recommend taking a nap here!If you're looking for a place that may be perfect for a special occasion and want to go back, or maybe just for a relaxing afternoon, try this very spot! On Fridays they have breakfast on tables with free food while coffee and appetizers are on the menu. I love this place and recommend it to everyone, even if they don't live in the suburbs.There's so much flavor at Spruce and as a matter of fact one of the best things I've ever eaten there. Love it and love the variety and variety of products you can get.
Everything was fine, so bad that the store went full all
restaurant. The is right behind the Sprouts on 50th Street and 3rd Avenue. I live next to him and want to take a look at his menu but it's always open.  We wish it had better service and more affordable prices. The greasy rice was great, the cornbread was great, the prices were reasonable, the bathrooms were nice but small. If they had gone all the way back for the salad bar we'd have died to eat there. We recommend trying the gumbo, its a bargain price for the first bite, I remember one time taking a bite. $15 for shrimp with spring rolls is also far from fair.
An exceptional service place with excellent food and atmosphere. The place is fairly small and nothing can beat the variety. We spent a lot of money on the drink selection, we loved the blueberry cookies, and will continue to go back as long as it's more delicious and fresh. We came here one day during the spring break
restaurant also in another city. I could taste the wine and it was good. With all of the service we got, the deal was just too great not to reccomend. It's not sure if it was the food itself or the decor/sign(like, booth desk) or even more sure than any other diner. I'd make a yearglass-long celebration there and definitely be back. Also being an experienced takeout/place would be awesome.
This place is so awesome!!!We had the Vianella but it was an excellent choice - about the size of any fair use can be...and now I am back for the close quarter meal I was a little disappointed.  I ordered 2 versions - the huge crepe-scallop bite - and the miniature mushroom poppet dish...The crepe-scallop was just okay.  I was totally disgusted at the direction the veggie broth had gone so poorly and had to put it in
restaurant in the city. She will definitely be back, my food is worth every penny and definitely worth the wait!I would definitely be back for more pan-Asian take-out entrees.
We are a few of the best dog lovers in town!!They are open 24 hours a day! It is the finest dog place you can go to. Take some of the dog that is on the menu and treat your friends at home, see what they eat and enjoy this amazing destination!  Love my Chicken Wings and the Crab Special! Yum!
Chef loves all their food
Their cheese sandwiches have the same tasting and flavor as the Chicken sandwich, but the more you eat they enjoy everything better. Everything is sooooo fresh! Don't hesitate to try the shrimps and the rolls! Delicious. First off, please remember to bring an advance reservation so I can bring in if there is one nearby which is closing so you can get a seat.
I was staying
restaurant within a three-hour wait. The beer selection is even more eclectic and steeped in different styles than any other restaurant. For someone who has never tasted vegetarian, this is something you will be going back to in your lifetime. Besides the smell and the service, our waiter is attentive, accommodating and friendly. We recommend going for the lunch at 5pm or the wild version at 8am and if you are looking for a fast & tasty breakfast, this is a good place to start.
I had a great dinner and I won't be back as much as I did the previous time. I didn't enjoy the restaurant either because it was slow to go on Sundays and my friend had to wait on one street and with service so awkward. The decor is very interesting and is really hip, but so are the music.
Wonderful food!  Little wait staff, great service, or they tried to bamboozle the food!  Some of my server friends were not
restaurant restaurant - I especially enjoyed their pancake intermission and their cinnamon risotto, which was excellent! A little pricey.
If you want to try it out of the park then go here.  Good food but the food's very basic.  This is a huuuge chain of restaurants that is not about appetizers, drinks, niches, and really hard working people who actually care about what you eat and want to make sure you get what you want.  It might look like a chain of cheeseburgers, but it's usually run by a bunch of experienced parents, and since they're fairly well-educated and familiar with this setting they don't look over your shoulder and say, "This is a great place to take food from around the house".  However, the food can be quite pricey at around $35, and it's good, as well.  I have read and heard that brazilian, mushrooms with calendula are good too
restaurant is worth every penny. Enjoy!
I love the sushi and they're delicious!
This is our fave Ethiopian fave place for sure, the food has always been what makes us want to give this place five stars. The fast food is what makes this restaurant worth every penny. I wouldn't be giving 5 stars to a Mexican place unless I was entranced by its name. But, this place is DELICIOUS. I've tried chicken bhi thai, buffalo salad, chicken entree, all and are finally getting the hang of it. You have to wait more than 30 minutes for what you've got, and delivery is generally much faster than what it's offered on tap. And they're not going to commit to 2 star service but to finish a lengthy dinner at less than $25/seat and start again with an extra 2.25 miles on a table. Their servers are extremely attentive to their patrons and to bring as many dishes as they
restaurant is always better. Pizza is always the best and they always have the best beer on tap with specials on the side. They also make an exception for Friday dinners. Sunday and Monday night are BYOB and guaranteed a fabulous dinner meal if you wanna happen upon a restaurant!
The food was  good. The service was awesome. Service was helpful. The crowd is big and I have never felt so great. If you order a dessert, people pay for it. Otherwise I will continue to recommend and recommend people take out their cash.
Loved The White Crispy Chicken Broccoli. I love this restaurant and I recommend it to anyone looking to take their entree home.  One of my all time favs   and can't go wrong with these.  The staff and food were awesome!!
The restaurant is pretty cool but unfortunately they cant compare to other popular yuppie restaurants like McDonald's, McDonald's Texas or Barchetta. I am a big fan
restaurant Ugo Grassy.
B+ The appetizer is excellent and the food is okay.  There's nothing wrong with eating before dinner though and the place is small so sometimes that means that you can't tell which portions you're in!  We had the Salmon Crab with Little Fogo sauce and it came out to be outstanding.  The bbq chocolate ball was my favorite.
The food here is perfect with the end results.  The fried sirloin risotto is the most wonderful dish you will find.  The roasted shrimp was amazing.The halibut this place was hard to miss.  Two very good wines.
We ordered a beer and it was great! The food was nice but the service was sluggish.  Our server and I shared a table. Both of us commented on our experience so I thought it was great.  For some reason the last beer that I ordered was not a the one I ordered last night and I don't
restaurant.The service is outstanding and very attentive to your requests.We had the sandwich from 1:15.5 to 3:15 so it was about good service, and the atmosphere was always fresh and loud, which I think is the main thing they need and want. Some people complained about the spaghetti at the end of the sandwich, but for most I can't think of another good Italian sausage sandwich.The other thing they had was a saucepan on their dish that was a better quality than my suggestion and didn't seem to make any lingering taste. The interior and living room were neat and clean (very so), the wine bar is like a hangout for wine lovers and music nerds, and the club is beautiful. We had the chicken ceviche with their sultanas, baguettes, tomatitas, and was able to take home about 35 minutes of service.We did try the enchiladas on the side. Our server never took the salad off his
restaurant areas all had similar and very inventive menu choices. A winner of the dining room only -- perfectly congruent with our thought process -- dining to which the serving was an entirely different and quite entertaining experience.
I'll be back to this place for sure.  For the money, I won't say much about this place due to the sheer wealth of Asian food in there (you'll probably have your food eaten just like your next goodie at the bar).  On top of everything, I couldn't make reservations for this place.  Our waiter, Stephen Foster's plate went bad!  After ordering an appetizer and appetizer combo, we didn't feel comfortable knowing what to order (we had another big meal order in at the wrong time).  Some complaining people said we didn't be able to give them our signature,  because they couldn't figure it out yet and were unhappy with our behavior.  After we were told that we would probably have to make dinner
restaurant with this spectacular pizza, which you can experience every time you want to eat it. (frozen bread is the perfect pizza taste) We found the pizza to be absolutely DELICIOUS! If you're not hungry, have the patience to wait at the desk. Definitely go somewhere else (there are other great places like restaurant in town).
My husband and I are fanatics in that we go to restaurant every other week for dinner.  I must admit that when we arrived we decided to go as fast as we could because if we had been there the next night it would have been worth it.  It was a reasonable price but we were NOT at the table and were hungry.  So we waited one hour and 45 minutes.  Now we have to complain about dining at Greek Oasis and other Greek places in our city where the wait doesn't seem like the number one thing a good Greek restaurant does and make them get it right.  We went to Bar Ar
restaurant is great; it's filling up quickly, and they have a nice section for everyone, and a huge amount of people there who need it. The service isn't stellar either, but their mac n cheese appetizer is a MUST-DOG. It has enough ingredients to make a lot of dessert. The gluten free braised pork rind is fantastic, a perfect blend of quality.The food was delicious. Like most recommendations, they also carry the bacon roll and fancy goat cheese shawarma! The question I can't answer is does the owner, Jennifer, actually care? The bagel, butter, oil- and green bean jam/bread is incredibly delicious (only one thing I can think of is non-cereal that's super great!I'm not bad, it's just that, the dew is so buttery...but feel free to watch a nice minke!The beer list was killer. The Coors Light is just right as well. I
restaurant that lives up to the reputation. The decor is just incredible and just so accommodating. This restaurant is deep dish. The owners, the great food, and the great service aren't great. The type of food that is being served is simply unbelievable. The food is decent (wine and beer), but food is slow and the drinks are slow and expensive. The sandwich that I had in my bite was on average less than $3.00. Many of the issues I had in my experience were very easily fixed by the waitress (you never know what she is going to do when a party is pouring coffee or something in the window).Overall I think what you get in Jardine is better. You only have to make a special trip to Chicago to be able to taste something good. However, if you aren't willing to pay the good money, please give this place a chance. They aren't worth the extra money but if you are going to start picking up a plate for
restaurant made it with a soft espresso and wine list. Our server was nonchalant about having lunch. Yes, it was hot, but he made a point of leaving him because of his personal allergy to meats. Also, I remember not having a real reason to complain about how it felt as if it was a cake made by someone else's.
One of my most favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago.  My favorite cheese is Giotto, their salad bar is the best.  The bartenders were great, and the staff was responsive.  You'll find a place to go when you are craving a good Italian experience.
I thought this was for the lovers of Coast to Coast. I was so excited to try the following night on the other side:There was one. That one time my parents ordered mine off of the menu, and it was like it was coming out of a truck; the owner would be screaming to us with laughter and we could never hear him! Then
restaurant is fantastic. The chefs get a large selection of dishes and enjoy to dining with your friends.  Their food is outstanding, I recommend trying it on Saturdays and Sunday.  The portions are big and the sauces are flavorful.
Love Food and great atmosphere.  Staff was extremely helpful, had fun and good conversation. What a great place!
Good service!  They bring out your table at the end of the evening to have you experience their famous brisket...but not wait.
From the first time I came to Mill Creek North Grill and I was so excited to try it and try it before the lot open.    (1 of 6) of the 3 servers were attentive and friendly.  The atmosphere was amazing!  I would highly recommend them if you are going to come to Mill Creek North Grill for BBQ.
Went to this restaurant recently for a great lunch and we would go back.  We were confused and decided to go, after all
restaurant at a valet parking lot that has been cleaned up by some colleagues and then ordered at a restaurant where the beer were first brewed. And frankly, it was the second to last time we used the side of it, the toppings and the mac and cheese. Oh, and I get it the first time, there were only two batches to go, so it was wonderful to have to wait outside and get to it afterwards.The only problem with the entrees was that at one point they were so aloof, but now they have wonderful cocktails and great menu. The only thing the menu was NOT able to match in terms of quality is the avocado. I felt the liquid was pretty bland so I felt very sorry that this item went away.
At first I thought this was hype - perfect for superintelligent grub. After reading a few other reviews, I thought that it was just cheap hype but it really was the true chicken dish, getting the traditional chicken with chicken

The de Givre is a bit small. The servings are limited.  They look like half of a pizza with a slice and 2 medium ravioli.  I ordered a conchiez sandwich, you will not believe what you taste.  The chips were pretty good, but it took about 2 hours to get them, and I liked it, I'm planning on making my own soon. It is great the food is out of this world so next time I go, it may help.
Very nice atmosphere! We ate here in a Saturday night party, there was a little stick within and the beer selection was huge.  Hated it!!
Fantastic!Fresh, juicy, and amazing. The steak is amazing as well and the salmon and trout is perfectly paired.  We also had the sandwich, all ridiculously rich.
It was never the same. Everyone I've been to around here has always been impressed with our food and service.
restaurant, server, TV host, artist, and the owner. We made the trip with them and they were really pleasant to find and we can't wait to try them.  The friends were super awesome and the cook was really interested, both while we were there and in private moments with them.
I love this restaurant and is finally moving in!! The chicken is amazing, the specials are great, and it's always great to have a small wine combo, so you'll be spoilt for choice when you're in for the family run, or the weekend night. The churros are DELICIOUS (I LOVE THIS CHURROS!!-) and the server, from across the street, is perfect. The service, though, was pretty average and the Korean food was a little better. He just sent me a coffee and I am glad to have taken him over, and I enjoyed it as much as any other Chinese restaurant in Chicago. For my money, this
restaurant enchiladas (almost) as good as you can get for quite a few bucks. It was packed, and crowded. I didn't have any complaints, but I do think a bit of food served over the top of the Chinese food is just par for the course. They also were full of energy. Had this special special appetizer but I like really spicy portions.  Cheesy rice- and sausage- the vegetable is stuffed to the corkand to remind you that it is meant to be and a little salty is ok, but fried rice isn't.  A bite to go, but you don't want to come back for more.At least for a change, my dining experience was on par with other places I've gone, and the portion size was the single biggest change.Not that I'm mad at the food, just that I love it and hate waiting anywhere else for more.
love this place so much!!! thats what i came here for!!!
restaurant) and experience a fantastic food and service with our friendly owner. Don't mind the prices but the neighborhood is great - had a great time there.
I love Chicago! Although there were some good events in the Loop (there is a headrest with lobster of course), the food was definitely top notch.  Over the course of the evening it seemed to be bringing the perfect sumptuousness to my once-per-week reservations.  I will definitely be coming back, but I would suggest this place to anyone looking for a classy brunch. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The place has a cozy vibe and they do have reservations with short wait times but I think there is still room for growth here.
I'm glad to report that this place is getting 5 stars because it is awesome!! I had dinner with my friends in Chicago and we dined with great atmosphere. They had high-quality options. Everything tasted fantastic, every food was delicious and fresh and
restaurant area). That, plus the fact that this area can only be found in a very dimly lit basement.
Must have!!!  Lunch and dinner are excellent and the food looks like it was prepared right in front of the camera.  Tenders are always impressive, but that couldn't keep up with the rarity of live music (especially as it's so off-the-wall in the music hallway).    I'd recommend eating at Salsa (though they are close to Lemongrasseria Cafe and Parmesan Chiramek), Bregula, a burger, and tortilla plate.    Best of all, Ropa is a tasty and juicy and delicious breakfast dish, and should have been absolutely overshadowed by a late night bite at Lemongrasseria (not here).   The margaritas are cheap, including the grapefruit-based tamarind-like salsa, and the Thai dressing is the right arrangement for two people
restaurant.   He was the best I've ever had, especially the salsa-flavored pasta.   The scallops are amazing, tender and savory.   The meat is tender and flavorful.   I love the cheese sauce as well, and I don't believe I have ever ate a steak.  It's amazing!   It goes great with a fresh fruit roll.   I've had french toast for just about every meal.   It's yummy and an excellent use of my cell phone.    It's definitely worth a try and remember to order the cheese sauces!
I've been coming here almost every year since I moved here in the early 90's and has been talking to several different staff about where I can get my business. The food is the best, the service is amazing, and the mix of the old and new styles means that if you are looking for a great Chicago style restaurant that is still not

Griffons here they are delicious!!! Nice loud music, amazing sushi, wonderful wine selection, lobster roll, coconut tuna salad..Hands down the best sushi place in southern Michigan!!We have been wanting this place for 2 months, two reservations already and I only think you can decide on one because the menu is so much better!! Very aggressive waitress, highly attentive with a deep laugh and impeccable food...The staff is very attentive, friendly and fun, very welcoming and the wait staff is so nicely drawn in and ready for you to sit on a comfortable chair in a quiet place with a nice view of downtown with great views of Lincoln Park!I especially love the concept of having impeccable presentation..I find it very fun to walk down that street, feel like I was seen inside before entering or just wait in line for your table.I also wish that you had friends,
restaurant and helped fill a lost appetite.
Amazing!!  Mmm I love the tacos and the cheese tempura.  You will miss the rest of the place but then it has all the classic Mexican food pieces.  It's definitely worth going there as the seating is just ridiculous.
Too bad this place doesn't have a restaurant for the money.  I'm a big soda drink guy and my dad is just addicted to sweets.  Please try Gosta's bar for a bite and some drinks.I'll be back
First of all, I will say that I love the menu.  I would like to suggest a dinner menu that changes the tastes of the restaurant, which doesn't really need a restaurant.  The beef cocktail served on a mango was my favorite and I love the panini dish it adds.  The sauces that come on the side of that were delicious.  The blue cheese on the side was a bit pricey.  As a bonus I also

Well over all. It's a true pub of yesteryear. I started in 2004 to enjoy life but have changed the tastes a bit. We've decided it's time to return! My husband is a 29 year-old former college student and our two sons is a 7 year old star in any college setting, as well as a bit of a head of brown. The food has been excellent, with lots of flavorful smoked salmon and the
restaurant should be a central option in a successful bar.
Ahh I agree that it took 2 min for us to get there. Great atmosphere! The service was always friendly and attentive, that the bartenders were friendly and even pushed us to the register.There is a bit of atmosphere outside (with 2 beers right next to me, I have no idea how many of those are available) but this place is now quite empty for a big selection of beers! I only wish they would try it again for their next joint!
Oh, I have never gotten in here!This place is awesome. Service is great, food is alright, and the prices are reasonable. Otherwise, the food was awesome and tasty.Tried 4 burgers and 3 cheese rolls. Wow! I think the burger roll was my favorite!Seriously, read the note that comes with this. We did NOT get to try the cheese roll... they recommended the fried rice instead. Absolutely disgusting. I have never eaten
restaurant?".. one side of this thing is you get a burger with fries.What do you get?! Duck. I don't care how big the fries are, this is not your typical fries but hey.
We tried this place and it was amazing.  The location has been great to find amazing, hearty eats.  The fish was fishy but really delicious.  The ribs were too fat for my liking and a bit too good.  The breakfast menu was appealing, the soup, and the lamb which I am a big fan of and would recommend it to anyone.  There is something that will have you drooling.  We would definitely go back again and I will be back.
Wonderful experience
This is a very comfortable dinning space.  It's hard to get to work and the dining environment is unique.  We are dressed in our T-shirt, headphones and hairstyle, they do one of their shows with friends when they go
restaurant serves fast and warm beverage! Check out their chocolate sandal kop'nork.
We had lunch here and were told the table was completely empty, had a good buffet, and we had a nice dinner. Good buffet and were able to come out pretty quickly. Highly recommend to anyone who loves fries.  But, they have alot of the fries in the salad bar, and their shrimp bologna was very good too.
love this place.....it's different!!!!  We got our food at work and were soooo pleased with it.The only complaint I have is that this place lacks a catchy name. I don't know, maybe they'll rename it. Because i would like to think that every restaurant must have a catchy name, so its important that they call it that.
We went to El Grand on a whim when we were last there - wonderful customer service and superb food.  If you're new to Chicago, you're in for a treat
restaurant, beer & wine selection on the main, on the bar menu, and even in the movie theater!We were not disappointed. For food and wine, it was a hit!  We went back for dinner, two days later!The kitchen looked amazing.  Our waiter handled everything the chefs were planning to make, though he was not a fan of the kind of food we were allowed to use.  We were glad we had some steaks, because the steak I got was pretty good.  Overall, we liked what they were cooking as far as food.  The waitress wasn't overly helpful, though, as she seemed to think we were a little too adventurous.  The pasta was amazing, though, as was the salad.  I think the dining room has a good bit of room for dessert, but overall it is pretty nice and fun to sit outside the patio door looking at lots of outdoor spots.We ordered the appetizers and cheese.  As mentioned,

Excellent atmosphere. Very small menu and a space for waitresses to come in and out. Beaches are tasty. Bongos are good and hot. Great price for food and reasonably priced. We went here about 20 minutes ago. It was great.
Love these specials! The chicken fries are unbelievable, so very good. When you go in there you will get the shrimp tempura. The fries are awesome and the bbq is even better, thanks to the steaks! Highly recommended!
great service! quick, friendly staff and with endless game. the best place for a late night devotee on the eastern coast!
The Cafe had great food, amazing atmosphere. This place was really fresh. Service was exceptional as well. The one I went to to on the way out was a long wait but the staff was amazing. First time I arrived I was greeted in the waiter's chair and was told that I had a special order that came out just
restaurant, wine bar and bar, coffee bar and dessert, the entrance is set to be front, far from the kitchen, it is quite a way from the hustle and bustle of the barista.There was a store being cleared by the same police department and the counter was being a little low lighted that there was some sort of some sort of attempted theft of art that took place.My guess is this guy's word-of-mouth wanted to go to check something that was basically a real thing and was never really returned (as a bartender i can't even taste the whiskey).My advice is this friend should take a last minute bath before going back to his car so he can sit back and relax and enjoy himself!<|endoftext|>
restaurant with a hashbrown.. classic but wasn't finished.  Don't care.  Gourmet!!!!The only use for the fries on any day is to get a bottle of wine before going to work. A friend and I went for lunch and the waitress immediately stopped serving us.  She told us that she could not even figure out how to get them, so the plan was to stop serving us until we was 100% satisfied.  Waitresses like at my sister's and "cowboy" goat hide all together.  After all that, she was working late at night on a management job to give us reservations.  Had a taste of what she was doing but didn't care because I could barely keep up.  My sister-in-law had recommended something so simple - Coca-Cola! I can't imagine that people are so dumbed down to drink up this thing.I have heard from my friend that they would also make your extra potatoes a bigger salad.
restaurant 7/5/2013 8:00:00 AM Food: Neat, served at numerous locations. We're still trying to figure out how to go with this food. 10 People should spend their money on it; the server always talks super nice. 8 people should spend the money on it; the food is great but we don't have the time to let it die. The biggest downside is that there's not a great pay down of our portion of the meal (as if we'd paid for the food) and the price is unacceptable.
Garden Pot Tacos is like any other Italian restaurant. Our waiter works impeccable, is attentive, and if you want one pizza I'd recommend everyone to try it.
One of my favorite places. Great food and one of my favorite places to go to for lunch.
Awesome food is delicious!  Very cold and warm.  Don't have to wait in line for food.  Este: I ordered about
restaurant, dessert and beer menu, or contact us for more information. If you find yourself craving one item in the menu that is extra special, get there early - the restaurants allow the minimum hours to run when at times you can and leave with someone else after having had a meal.
The cooking is great. I found the steakau meat tenderloin to be the most authentic and fresh I've ever tasted. I love the pickled egg crumbs and it's cheap too!
I won't say much, but this place was the star of the night for it's size. Brought my daughter from out of town and she was screaming and screaming and screaming, I was screaming. The food tasted great - the cheese was good but not fresh either. It's usually a breakfast special where you get a whole bird's ass of pork sausage. My daughter got the gummy bear the day before which is fabulous for breakfast.
I love Chicago and I do love seeing up
restaurant, our waiter always greeted us and told us how hungry we were with our orders. But when we finally got their last orders at around 5:00 pm, the waiter did not speak to us. After all we still ordered our food, and were able to finish the food. But, we are surprised that this was not accompanied by a complaint or apologize for our mistakes. This was merely a personal attack on our servers and management, not the restaurant's mission.In case you are curious, there is more:

This was definitely one of the best Italian restaurants in my face.  Love how the wine list can be really helpful.  The menu changes during the night so, whenever they want, they will now give you a new sauce and wine list.  Once again, thank you (kind) vendors!

Another favorite.Enjoy! 3.6 stars because the staff are friendly. Another quality on the group was the wait staff. Once they started to work, they kept asking for a seat to come in. Will be back soon, but not for the wait.
Great selection and great food.
Stopped by on a Saturday evening and had a great time. They have a movie going, and we had the Red Rover!Great to go but nothing to compare it to. Also had the Savers and Cornhusseur.So impressive!!
The food was good and the servers were very helpful and professional when it came to what we ordered. I would definitely return.
The chair is just missing, absolutely no stars!!

Some things I like: Good coffee & the outdoor patio.
I'm impressed with this one!  They do offer a gluten free pie so I won't be disappointed with either one.  We love the extra cinnamon and spice they offer to enjoy the moment and the freshly baked bread.  We won't be returning!
One of the best places for great price and service in downtown Chicago.  Good music.  Loved the dessert menu on the walls and their burger and pork burger which also features a good crust.  Also good music.  You can't go wrong there.
The food was excellent. I always get the meatballs for dessert and if it was the bowl I'd throw them in there just to eat and think about eating again.  The servings were tiny and they were smaller than I thought they'd be so I didn't have a large sample
restaurant, which was so beautiful and with so much flavor - like the place! The wait was maybe 30 minutes. But it was awesome. Many helpful strangers were there for a stay and saved a lot of time.You really don't get a great restaurant, but Love Mary's that's on the Yelp are a solid 5 stars.
Went to Northwest for one of my much anticipated, 5 star trips to play music. It's completely worth it, just trust me. What a wonderful restaurant!
I really wish the Gizzi would have bought my restaurant as I live in Chicago, but that doesn't happen every year, no matter how hard the economic downturn was.  So let me just say that every experience I have there is great and the food from Gizzi has something for everyone to try.  It is worth every penny.The staff is a bit on the casual side, so if you like spicy food and need to ditch bbq, or serve
restaurant for multiple meals.  Service was not great and the wait was hard to get to the bar.  However, because I was pretty scared and nervous at the time, my server cleaned up after us.  I had to ask when it was that time we would be getting dressed.  Our waiter was very helpful and it was good to have a waiter that came by and help us out.  I gave a friend a ride home after waiting and there was a hostess at our table next door who was obviously a little annoyed and had to laugh at us a little.  She promptly apologized and thanked us and said there was nothing we could do, the food was a perfect gift.  The food wasn't great and I would have been happier if we could have split the meal between two meals.  Overall, I would definitely return to Spadina.
I cannot wait to go back in for dinner. Great food, nice parking and I love the fact that you can
restaurant is more open 24/7... but is all that matters....)
CHICKEN COME BACK TO THE NIGHT. DO THIS. THIS IS THE BEST FANTASTIC FOOD COMEDY IN THE CITY.  It's deep and flavorful and one of my favorite Chicago dishes.  The Cuban bread, served with hors d'oeuvres and fresh bread cubes that are always moist and covered in greasy smoke, is an absolute must eat.  A little something for my friends too.  If they can take some courses and eat here while not being the heavy handed D.L., that makes life easier and more fun.I highly recommend the Salsa margaritas too.  The high priced prices and generous portions make it worth the trip!
This is a great meal (although they keep the price down a bit).  If you haven't tried the croquettes, there's a lot to like.  It's very interesting, but not without depth
restaurant." In fact, I'm just grateful. I'm surprised there's so much great food there on Bontrager...well I'm surprised there's so much bad shit there.
One of the fastest strollers I have ever had! The kids were seated with four of us each, one by one! That was my favorite, especially since we were all really busy making our mark.  Our food was good, sweet, fresh and casual.   Each item we bought was always a fresh, refreshingly sugary treat, perfect for a hot, fun and sophisticated evening.  Our menu includes beans, potatoes, apple cider, duck fat, crispy peppers, and horseradish.  It is great to watch the chefs, staff and management help you plan your evening.
Best burritos I have ever had in Chicago. I also have never had to eat eggs that similar to this one. We split the staff for some reason and it was BYOB.
restaurant Yushi Yum. Finally, check for FREE HOT SHOP....we received such a high rate at once - the tea leaves burned off.I've never had a waiter walk around us (he was too busy talking to his waiter). Instead, we were treated to 10 minutes of silence while we waited for a table. If you would like to wait for a table, YOU should book a reservation at Joe's.   Even after talking to the server about the trip, his initial smile filled me with respect.  Our table was HUGE...great place for couples to celebrate with a group of friends...OMG...WOW. Not to mention, the wait time was extremely well worth it.  I don't think the waiter would have stopped complaining about service to the customer in the center of the room. 
I am sick of eating here! Great prices, great service, excellent food, plus great food and service. And in addition to that, I've never
restaurant.  I have ordered a lot of salsas from each location but have never had one of them close to me.  The restaurant is fairly diverse and very comfortable and offers excellent wine selections.  There are some stores throughout town that offer bars and wine or ales and their patrons can also purchase bottles or be matched.  The atmosphere and food are top notch.  It is nice to be able to have a sit down experience at the bar at a reasonable price.  The best part of this restaurant is that all of the servers are pleasant to go around and they don't drive you crazy.  The atmosphere is nice and cozy but great for long term planning.  Keep up the great work...
This place is amazing.  The tacos are so rich, spicy, and made with everything.  When I go they go with the bacon margaritas that I love and the egg yolk taco - if you're a fan of egg yolk then this is
restaurant to the tune of $2,300, a budget pizza joint has become something other than something special. By far my favorite part is the art of chips. Good bread, good cakes, fabulous desserts. The prices are reasonable, but the wings are like a bar run at Martin Luther King's in Chicago! The scene seems to be living up to the hype.  I am in the front row, not the back, but must admit my boss and I were amazed with the service.  Besides the tastebuds, everything I was eating was cooked to perfection with a little effort.  I had the seafood twice with gluten free gravy, a little bit of sauce and a pinch of salt in the crust. The sauces were superior, the potato salad was absolutely better.  I would eat only half of the meat if they could, but I cannot give up on the salad and potato salad.  Save your money and order up all the other meats and chips.
Excellent casual
restaurant is your second step, grab your cell phone and get the old house.
very tasty food with more than 1 course pizza and their proximity to NYC. this is definitely the first pizza I've eaten here as well, probably will ever serve anymore. has some great selections including finger-out soup and pizza deli for under $10 with tapas. vegan burger is the best meal ever!
Hank's is the best! They keep delivering the best fresh produce & awesome specials every year! My friends and I dine there all the time & LOVE it! I will definitely be coming back.
I was extremely impressed with the solid service and service from the star staff at the Met Glenn's where I frequent and absolutely love all my ciders! From the off, though, it was hard to eat there. But overall it was a great environment. Also, the wait staff seems to appreciate a much needed benefit, such as low prices. Many and many of them,
restaurant sandwich at Best Western. Yes, please.
Just as the Italians were going after their homemade croquettes, West Coast Italian food is doing it again. Yeah, I just might be all too pleased that Napoli has now jumped into this no-nonsense-waitstaff category that was successful from the "30 last 5 years," to the "60+ wait," to the plethora of restaurant dining options at reasonable prices. For a group of 5-8 people who take almost every meal for under $25, this is the closest you'll come to a master restaurant. Never wait too long. And don't even get yourself into the sticky sandwich sauce-and buttery bread-to-mouth situation: skip it all and enjoy the savory burger-and only bring in any tinctures you like. After sitting in a crowded restaurant for the three hours on a Friday night until 3:30 p.m., I wanted something different, something that was not just plain
restaurant's, dressing room, dining room, dorm and bathrooms and so much more. Perhaps they can re-open it, for a cheaper price. But again, you can't compare! My name is Vincenzolo, I get into balla. And they are missing more than anything. Oh and for these reasons, tell me: and I love you and your food!
The waitresses, staff, and hosts from E in here are the most interesting of non-hippies.Their approach for the last few days was to make it very frustrating for us with their cakes and greasepointed sushi in a lighthearted manner and to offer complimentary alcohol free when asked to eat that special cakes and greasepointed sushi.  We had dinner on a tight schedule, but when you place them in the cafe instead of at my table there will still be wonderful food and customers will be given unlimited drinks and advice as well as being offered champagne and some minor
restaurant!
The decor is amazing, and everything was delivered to us right away and we did not find another condiment that didn't taste right (everything from lemongrass sauce to steamed beef). We also have a small kickbox that we use as a place to share pizza. Everyone should check out Pie Eatery and Giorno.
I live about a block away from this restaurant, and it was a bit crowded...so decided to come for lunch the same day we were leaving the rest of the place to go back to work. I believe this is a great location for a cute afternoon wait-off-sue. The service, decor, and food are all outstanding, while the atmosphere is incredible. The food was delicious and fresh, which to me makes the place more for a casual evening, rather than a dinner-going restaurant. We used lots of wine. The food was as good as they come. Consistent service - just try to eat like an
restaurant, mediocre. The line is moving too fast, however, and we're back to eating fine on Sundays - no points for the chef.
We've been here twice now, and each time, it was a new experience for us. This neighborhood seems to have had a few original twists and turns, but I felt that this place is a clear improvement over a few earlier offerings of what we may call the "masterpiece" of the neighborhood. I would give the trio its due and return.
Great food. The sides are pretty good, but the ambiance couldnt be better, so no one would find it unprofessional. Service was speedy and attentive, they're always happy to help make you feel good.The portion sizes are great. As for the prices, I think they've charged extra for a five by 10 meal. Desserts are overpriced, just fine.
I have been to French Riviera many times and this is my new favorite. The
restaurant : Absinthe Blondes!, he kindly used to know my address but has since changed his name. cant wait to try them!
Glazed Tortoise Grill's do not come at a less than stellar price. My wife and I used to eat here, but had a variety of options. All of them were tasty, but we had our favorites from heaven.  We ordered one salad, which was literally filled with amazing horseradish and onions with marinated mushrooms. Our server seemed to be overwhelmed by the selection of meats we were eating, and all of them were disappointing. The food was not far off, but the presentation didn't stand out.  The pasta was big, but my wife ordered the special croquettes at 25 minutes after each of them came in, and the bread was just ok.I had a number of orders for the tomato, meatballs, etc., but the meatballs were incredibly bland.  Our waitress (once again being
restaurant for a very reasonable price. The customer service was great, and their food was totally authentic.  I must say, I would never go back.  I will definitely return!
There are over 100 memorable dishes on American style brie. After The Shawarma (starting in 1970) was invented, traditional Italian salad, soul food with fresh and frites (including roasted potato chips and like a bone of saurian) was popular.  After various other things followed their success, became about as popular as La Prada.  For their success as La Pasta, as for their neighborhood spot in La Seville, the Alinea Biscoz is an excellent place to start.  When it was again adopted to Cabrillo in 2005, Alinea became a cult favorite at the time.  The other great restaurant chain as well as Chicago street food culture, Decca, later became the Decca Steakhouse.  Cafe de la Prada became a culinary
restaurant, everything was so cool. I've eaten here in my life since I was 9 years old. Enjoy.
Everything is unique and wonderful...and it's one of the best. My parents, and I got an after dinner reservation and had the perfect amount of food, drinks, and energy. I will try to go back here again for a long time, but a great place.
pizza was perfectly cooked and the taste of the food was amazing. love their lamb meats and enjoy it for dessert.
I love the atmosphere and all the restaurants here....its a big-town setting. like it or not you get to pick your ingredients and hang out. every room in the restaurant comes with the perfect amount of seating and music all night long. I wish I could choose and date a guest from across the street...it would make for a great date night out.Overall, at least one couple of lovers to the point that I had the idea for this restaurant.
restaurant made breakfast here, I had to say it was good, just on the cheap side.  The staff at Gialy's Food is always extremely friendly and accommodating.  Their ingredients are unique and simple to understand, especially their rolls of coffee and roasters.
This was a good night! Really had the best tasting falafel ever, served with just the right amount of cumin and garlic. The service was the most enjoyable, friendly and efficient. The flight attendant with the salacious charge at the front of the table is special. The falafel wings were in a perfect big setting! For over $20 I would say this was one of my most flavorful meals on the whole and my go to! Try this joint for another date!
Fiery! Golden! It's fantastic food is great service is so cute even to a date! Finally I'll try this place.
All things mentioned in this review include various nice events including a tea party, stuffed
restaurant, and tasty desserts!
My boyfriend is from last week and now we are returning again...free food!!!! Great family, great atmosphere, if you're somewhere like Wharveing!
My group was seated at the bar and I was quite excited by the counter-service. The place was reasonably clean and interesting, but sadly not attractive to the average tourist.
OMG!!! The last visit to hopleaf was amazing.  The lunch buffet was so delicious and a bit more service than I had hoped for.  Service was reasonable and delicious.  The waitress seemed to be very professional and pleased with the overall experience.     I gave away a pack of 3 of the pizzas.  I would definitely eat there again.
I don't want to go back but I could read this review without actually liking this place.  Maybe that has to do with how busy they are in serving vegetables.  Of the 6 tables in the same room we
restaurant Brunch is at least 30 minutes past dinner time. Try the side of three, I'd recommend two of the best. It starts off right with the Chipotle giardiniera with spicy egg and the baked potatoes. It's not overly spicy but serves up plenty of flavor in short portions and has a really nice balance of spice and meat. On the first bite it's very fresh and delicious and looks like there's something for everyone. If you like meats with a great smoke, this is one that will give you a wonderful time. I know a few people who ate over 30 minutes on their own. This is where steak sits and eats right away because there are so many things for people to enjoy. A steak wraps out well because it's cooked without the bite adding to the flavors. It's very soft in the mouth and very tender. There is just enough of a steak on the table that you can get out of there quickly. And if you're going to take
restaurant. I will be back when I get back.
I get to enjoy a place that more or less sounds like that of home in the middle of nowhere.  I live in the southern corner of San Diego.  I have to say, the food is reasonably priced.  It's sort of like everything I'd do anywhere else--the pork tenderloin and the chops covered in mozzarella.  Great place for noodle-stuffed meat snacking.  It's cozy and out of the box, but full of fresh ingredients.
Pettuccini is a summertime hot spot! A must try!
Best dinner I have had on Sino's.  The portions are big for an eating experience, so the waiters are always on time and efficiently!
Omg, have you heard the rumor that Dark Ink Red is the result of Luther's Restaurant's unique journey into southern delights? The first time I visited the restaurant was at around
restaurant chair and doesn't need to be dirty. And when my friend brought her for breakfast, it was cozy and tasty. Not sure if it was a great choice for vegans and vegetarians, but we actually just eat at least one "Oxtail oatmeal cake" a day.
Great place! I went there last summer and loved it. The food was outstanding and very fresh. Service and the overall experience was wonderful. The food was stellar! I will be back!
  amazing service and service is excellent!
Food is excellent  ;. Some of the local restaurants I go to have their specialty restaurants.  The deli owner comes by and raves about it all, he isn't the type to complain about the food if you like it.  Food is great. I have found that they use the grated cheese one time, and this is most of the time they don't use fresh cheese for cheeseing and stuff, however i really like the
restaurant is so hyped up, I wonder if the wait will slow down the service at the restaurant when you come to see them and order! With the seat area being the only known thing about the atmosphere, I'm not so sure that's the case. That being said, the ambiance is spectacular. The food isn't exceptional; it's simply bland and generic at best. The people at my table always catch the attention of the server in the coffee shop; and the table staff always ask why.When I'm paying my own way, I often find myself holding my attention when the waitress comes by and holds up my credit card to see if I've actually been ordered. It's a bit of an instinctive thing for us. It's honestly disappointing to think that our server even had the decency to come up to me and write me an email about trying to cut my bill because I'm so stupid. Let me tell you, if I ever return to Chicago, it's
restaurant-health-friendliness.  We had the beef bq beef bq, which were really good, but the management messes up the meat's taste.  Not to mention the total mess of sourdough breads.  I don't think I've ever been disappointed with another in my life.  I am not saying that I don't like the beef bq beefbq, but what I am saying is that I won't order anything else for my four year old.  I will say I took advantage of just one of our tables, but it will be a long time before it's worth it.  I guess I just want some feedback on our food and the service, and I will certainly be back.  It will be interesting to see what happens in Chicago, so check this place out!
This is the best upscale Italian joint I've eaten in the past 6 months!  The salad bar and spinach salad is great and the soft drink
restaurant/crabs) - very nice  I will definitely go back!!!
Best carrot stick salsa ever..would've reccomended your pizza!!
Smooth service, amazing artwork, great interior decor, great atmosphere and  more.
Hands down, the best taco joint in Chicago.  You can get from Malzano to Pico, anything you want.  The atmosphere is great, though. They make sure you order lots of tacos every day so you can eat a lot of food.
An inexpensive Ethiopian Diner in Downtown Chicago just a few blocks away from famous Sarma. We waited 30 minutes and waited 90 minutes for our food.We chose the Deep Dish Sava food - very expensive but tasty.  Very good as well.  We ordered the Steak-Wim Prison Salad, as well as the Honey Belly Pasta.  It was delicious - soft and flavorful with a bright and fruity cheese flavor.  We also
restaurant, which for $20 per person is a great deal! Then for $7-$10 per person there are three different types of private lessons.  They all consist of wonderful miscellaneous lessons which are available for those who are looking for a nice lesson and to introduce yourself.  The CHAPELLA is our dinner menu which is available in 4 different ways.  Food is enjoyed by just a few, well experienced guests and we all want to go for a dessert.  There are lots of great games (including a score of tuckered corkpits, howling!) to please everyone.The DUCK RACE AGAINThe place was packed at one point, and we felt rushed when we headed to Whitechapel. I still remember being hit by a crow during a ruckus during the first year. I ended up paying $9 for my ticket, which it costs the staff to fill out for you.  Their response was no apology. 
restaurant soup.The chicken and shrimp sandwich is great as well.Also, the ambiance here is fantastic and looks fantastic. Prices are great for a slightly different fare and a little more in the style of your typical restaurant. Fun times! I'm not sure what to expect from Gimp's in San Diego.  This isn't going to be an all-out celebration of what is happening in the city; I can wait til I can catch a flight back.  Sometimes the style of cuisine seems as old as the gimp and it has become a side activity.  In the city, the fusion of gimp's style of food and good wine is one of the great ones of the last century.  I can't wait to eat there.
I like this restaurant very much, but I'd like to keep the prices the same.  Don't go here if you just want different prices, and do whatever they say.
All-stars.The service was excellent
restaurant, manager and staff, owner, special guests, etc. BYOB.  All complimentary drinks and tab.
This place is nothing like the old Nebraska Fried Chicken; anywhere from $5 for the meal of the day to $12 for dinner on weekends!We also had our $35 grilled chicken dish, which was simply something you get for one meal, either on a Sunday, or Monday. It was incredibly tasty, the person knowledgeable also gave us their thoughts on our cuisine, after we left. We really liked the flavors.Just because it was in a small restaurant, the quality of the food doesn't mean it's not delicious. We got the salmon pie and chicken fillet.This is truly a great place for adventurous brunch or early dinner, although there are some problems with the meats and veggies.We'll definitely return. They have nice, deep fried pizza but we'll be back very soon.
My good friend and I have been on this wonderful seafood gast
restaurant. The pizzas were incredible. Its an authentic take on a traditional Italian restaurant. He even invented a simple chopstick. The service has always been more patient than you will ever believe. I had the ahi tuna deviled egg by Garcia-Manfredo which was great! My friends had the steak ruelette and bread pudding. The Eggs Benedict was a total must! I also didn't mind the pineapple and smoked mozzarella spread on top. They can't have a better pizza than that. The server is a wonderful person, always helpful and kind. Rick and I would suggest this place to any wedding dresser. This is a gem! Always really good.
Tootouste will not go back -just gotta try the old shows again
Gross dishes are amazing!  I actually had a time when they offered wings as a birthday present so i decided to try it out and tried it out.  The extra eggs were delicious and the wood is
restaurant costs $6-7 per person. Don't expect this to be the place where you can get a new giftcard in the mail.
Food here is terrible.   We spent $50 a bite to get dessert from there.  It was pricey.   The floor plan was on the steep side, and the tables weren't yet set in the nice middle-between rows of tables.  After the first bite, I feel compelled to add, what more can we ask for?  Dinner really has to be made at home--well only if you are not going to have a boss that loves your food!  And for an amazing dessert, try a dark chocolate pie.  When dining on salad and agnosticism, I would definitely go back to this place.
Service: time was great and we even had a special table under the counter.  Our date had dinner with another chef and we shared the table for lunch on our next trip. 
restaurant. My food was so good (and very good) and the service was always warm and friendly.   I wish they had done it more often, because my dad will now bring us treats for our birthday or gift this month!
For food I was craving something that didn't taste so fine. This is a thing.
The place was a pain to walk in.  When you walk in they hold your order out until you are done.  They made you wait for a lot of seconds so that you couldn't order it (me either).  I tried placing my order on the counter and they kept kicking it around until I got it down the right way (I wish it was more masy on the counter).  SoI called ahead of time to let them know if I wanted a side dish, and they told me it wasn't.  I also needed to check the floor so they could get it down.  It was so too hard to keep it
restaurant Burger Guy. I saw this restaurant every weekend with my family and myself at the Bin Dokan Golden Globe Festival.  Everyone in the restaurant seemed like they were fully aware of this neighborhood and this romantic atmosphere!Everyone in the cafe was really cute!  There was no area without the perfect lighting for them.  The service was great, the staff were always friendly and attentive.  We took the bus home around 10pm for a family dinner.I also tried to enjoy the food from the Brazilian cuisine but it was not as good as some of the menu items.  All in all, we recommend this place to everyone!  By all means, try this place.
I actually recommend the Italian steakhouse!  Best Italian in Chicago to come to the neighborhood for dinner and live (that's not it) the hour before it opens.  The waiter reminds me of the smoky meatloafs (plain beefballs) they cooked up at de la Salle
restaurant. Atmosphere and presentation is top notch, atmosphere is great.
Great stuff... the food is different than the size the american chains have got.... you do what you want and get what you want...it's great and diverse. i'm going to go back
Best food in town
What a great place for your summer vacation!  We had our king beef tartare - go in for dessert and great oatmeal bar (not real hot).  The atmosphere here is sweet and relaxing.  The staff are friendly and the owners are my favorite.  Service has great value and I will have never been in another city since opening.
Pizzeria Burgers is such a wonderful place to eat pizza.  We went for dinner with five people.  We were seated pretty quickly.  We were seated next to all the other tables so it didn't take long to get to the table.  I was expecting to be long late, but I didn't miss
restaurant and neighborhood party atmosphere with a "totally enjoyable and unique atmosphere." The macaroni salad served with pig's foot sauce was always fabulous and I'm proud to say that this is one of the only places where everything that isn't homemade comes from.
Can't say enough good things about the other Best Mexican restaurants on the block.
Yum! and it was the best Italian Restaurant in the Goliad. The food is AMAZING. The staff was nice & relaxed. The burgers are all worth a visit. Other things to take note of are the tasty cheese & marinated chicken. They have a parking lot area so check there first if you want to know what to do there. They also have delicious margaritas.
A fabulous place!  Having tried so many great pizzas here...it seems some of them are just okay.  We recently took a group of 20 and ordered pizza, which was excellent.  Everything was fresh and fresh.
restaurant names, things that won't make my own table looks like they came from your sister's kitchen. And the server is very friendly. Do expect to wait almost 90 minutes, or most likely $50 for dinner.If you want $50 off a 5+ hour wait, do so, but then think you're paying for a fancy coffee. Once you place your order, you're about to be treated like it's the best thing ever.  A GREATEST DEAL IN THE BUSINESS!  The organic cheese pizza was pretty darn good, BUT the real deal was just the service. I felt I had to scream the rest of the line because I think it was for drunk people to call and get sick and eat a dose of the food they ordered.  It was similar to the actual Pizza Delivery Service I experienced at Conso.  The food was excellent and while it is a little pricey you have a much better delivery experience (better delivery service than Cafe Santa Maria)
restaurant (w/ private entry) 1/2 charge 2 friends (whilst in the kitchen) (with my girlfriends), three of whom asked me how I was eating 2 weeks prior to their arrival and I simply told them they were going to do two people at lunch so they could have my large pair of breaded squash, but i couldnt complain. (they went in to look for people eating fish) This included a bunch of reservations we had made and got before the service arrived to cover our extra charge of their food bill, which was based on the fact that i was in a house/caterer room. When we told them my bill, they said they don't normally charge people up. The woman was just too embarrassed by us to have any interaction with her own party, which makes her seem like she really didn't care. That could tell everyone else of our costs at the expense of the service. The waitress and the third member were poorly behaved. I didn
restaurant 2 special tip (25%)
I would be too, and if you do take it a step further you would also better guess the minimum number of ingredients you will be eating in your meal, in addition to your comfort food (which is a good thing if your vegetarian or vegan friends are there). The first time we took delivery that we chose we went to a pretty small restaurant in Canandaigua in Spain and spent about a half hour reviewing everything. The kitchen was rather dim, and lacked the features that we expected in a restaurant like this. We spent more than 10 hours going through everything and asking every detail. The chicken, pork, lamb and lamb ribs were all perfect, but I was too impatient to cook them. The dessert was that bland. The meat was absolutely bland in texture, which was certainly unfair considering that meat in general is a great selection. I was forced to walk out of the restaurant without any change to the meat the next day, and the experiences
restaurant at Burger King. It's packed for your table and the food is best. I highly recommend the Bon Avril steak bisque with fresh meat and perfectly cooked black beans. The ambiance is wonderful! I was so over the top with my bowl of La Mame over at Lou's on any given night. For not having Korean entrees here, it was tough because the Korean beer had to sit over my table, which sucked. After all these years there are so many Asian restaurants out there, but their booth is nothing special and they keep running away with money!
I read all the reviews and was so impressed with Tried Everything by Melissa (who, by the way, is actually a chef). She will not disappoint anyone. If you're a loyal customer, she'll make a tasteful and delicious meal out of everything you have ever eaten for the money. We can't say enough. And for making choices, when not off hours or even weekends (we've

Yeah!Also I took my daughter to the table and she shared with her friends a variety of tasty items. The food is phenomenal. The chicken noodle soup with foie gras and is the highlight of our trip. My daughter is also very happy with the service. They're going to be back! :)See you soon, and if you happen to be in Naperville next time there, do yourself a favor and pass it on.
If you have any location in Chicago to get away from, this is the place to be.  Will be back again.
a big hit with emusians.  The star of the night...awesome bacon sandwich.  could have a different ending...sheckles..
The food was good but poor service on occasion.
I have been going here alot lately.  I still have a sweet tooth but it gets
restaurant of choice (small portions at Woonsocket!), an owner-owned location where you can rest at the foot of a rose chandelier, and there's a selection of delicious artisan brews. There's a spot of 10 people, this is definitely an affordable place to take in a weekend or anniversary celebration. I recommend going with a bottle of extra soft drink, this is my 3rd cocktail bar, it's very similar to 2 of my previous spots, and since all 3 beers are very similar (4 and 6 drinks each), I think it's an excellent place to enjoy some of the other sweet treats from the real you.
This place is beautiful. It gets very crowded around and seems especially safe as a restaurant, when you wait at the table where you are served the most delicious food.  They even have an absolutely amazing bar (made especially for us, mind you) that I have to say is located right on downtown, which, to be honest, was
restaurant served for our 5 or 6 people or 2 adults. It was a little pricey, but most people would have said $20 or $25 and sure there was plenty of seating for people who wanted to eat lunch. We were there for dinner one and they wanted some brusque food. We were seated about an hour before we left for their late lunch hour. Having a great time, a great place to sit and an attentive staff gave our appetizers a taste of a good deal. For a really cheap pizza, you can put on a tiny pizza for less than $1.50, and then place the pizza onto the pretzel crust or whatever you'd like. And that includes a $2 glass of wine. The sushi was great, and both our son's and daughter's had the newest version of mojito and oyster with vegetables, fresh fruit and cheese. The fries and crab cakes were very tasty, especially the shrimp rolls. Overall, I highly recommend this
restaurant recommended. This place is BYOB and is perfect for a more relaxed atmosphere. However you need to note that there are many little signs to indicate that you are seated in an affordable setting or that your reservation is under way. I've had several recent Thai friends who had a surprise dinner at this restaurant where they were walking around after dinner and they all came up to us. We told them we'd give them $40 and go home. They responded with a no go and said no. Our waitress has never had trouble being an authentic Thai patron, even if she's rude. After she said no, we went to our regular dining room. I highly recommend getting a good authentic look at this place.
I have never been disappointed with this restaurant.  It's very authentic and has a great food tasting menu.  Even though it's not that great, I want to get an authentic Chinese take on Chinese food and stay the course.  Great place to see friends and family
restaurant to each individual party. Our food, not so much, was crisp and flavorful, very rich, and our bartenders were friendly. I couldn't tell you how much the food was. Every person we met had given us nice advice about their order and presentation. All of the people we did manage to serve were very accommodating and attentive. My next experience at Best Caprice was at a club filled with genuine hipsters. When they needed a presentation, I showed up and left. I even went to a lunch place with few people to thank for having a nice service. This isn't just someone who can serve up simple sweet food and drinks, it's because this bar should be full and welcoming. An hour later we took our drinks home and made sure to enjoy our drinks. I plan to take this bar to the next level next time I'm in the city and want to expand my career in catering.
Ummm.. yeah, have any complaints?  This is a
restaurant have been really good. You will be glad you did. They have excellent service.
Terrible food -  It is nothing special.    If you are trying to change anything, this is the place for you.
At:  Service:  Not exceptional!
Had dinner with one of the other owners who is really nice - so much so that my wife and I went and not a word of anything. We sat and talked. Once seated, as we ordered our burgers, it was clear that this was a perfect restaurant. It was packed, which was more than fitting considering the solid staff we have.  Food was excellent. We ordered the leeks - which we ate just fine.  We would never order anything else - those juicy, creamy green, and mango-hued apples are on par.  Our cup of joe was all Supernova.  I recommend this place to anyone who loves soft drinks.
i dont go to Jamb
restaurant = soup (see something else. My second order was Pork Chop) and it was the best they've ever had! By far their better option is Crepes. And the Guacamole Crust. In the people who have this taste (probably) I find it the second most important menu item on my top of the list. The choices are endless and delicious.   Try some Churros there or bring your own with your special guests.
I have always wanted to go to South By Southwest and The Amazing Chef Rizzle is always the best. Their vegetarian menu is fantastic and you can try a wide variety of dishes like churros, pork chops and steak. The service is always fast and service is always great. Whenever I go there, I always have reservations that I am constantly greeted. One of my favorite places in the city to watch the food run is when their second chair turns white and you go in while the visitor faces the wayward chair.
restaurant here that is free of charge. And there are staff... WHO WILL I TAKE A CROOK TO TALK TO?I try to be skeptical that many people would use this restaurant for a job that I really do not want.  I have worked at Jack's store for many years now and never once have I treated my clients to rude rudeness.  I don't really care whether it's because it is a location or it isn't, but I feel that it's a minimum that you should expect a large and well-funded American restaurant with full equipment to have such good service and place all the doors.  If the management does all that is reasonably possible, then they are following the law.  The place is in an excellent neighborhood, and the staff is definitely highly skilled. I don't think this will go over well with some of the most successful restaurants in the country. But if they want good service, and please fulfill my request, that's what I
restaurant option, and based on price tag, the other options should be an upgrade from Mexican food at a rock bottom of a morass.You can send the meal from Mexico (20/25) to you own hotel or a room at the swap out kitchen. The other option is the manor down the street from Chinatown, and it costs $12 more than the cooking class.The wait in the front bathroom will take longer than the restaurant itself, but your Italian grandma who is seated in the back will be staring at you for six hours. Don't spend money on it!Next stop is Cafe De Suiza, the best the mixers in the city can offer. With seating on a big table, you'll be a huge fan. The service is pretty good and the prices are reasonable, so don't expect a buffet! Plus, since the ice cream sandwich on their menu has this table setup in order to accommodate the counter with cream. The desserts I chose, Reuben
restaurant.
This place is a sign of my new neighborhood.
I have been going there a couple times and this is my new favorite place. They have a totally unique atmosphere to welcome in friends who are hoping to try something new.  The service is quite mediocre and they have an actual issue.  Other than that they are always accommodating of my many requests and I tend to come back.  Then come on in the evening to eat.
This place is not about vegan cuisine.  They are the best in town and are well prepared.  The people know their ingredients.  They are very attentive and friendly.  I went with our family, most of us.  We called our waiter and the name was changed to Melinda.  It was so rude and insulting.  Needless to say, we knew we were in for an upset.  We need to call the catering staff.  Of course, Melinda and I had visited another vegan restaurant but had not
restaurant for coffee! I suggest purchasing a blend of red. Not too salty. It's soft and keeps it very nice looking. I like that they have the coffee down before baking. I wonder if the rice was made to order for a beer.They just let them make their own.Also, I've never had the dogs nor will they ever do it again! Who needs dog food when you have 6???
Best Local Asian Restaurant in my life. The chef is always absolutely awesome, and the service is great. When I go here a while ago, I always think, 'This is my friend's first time and I'm used to seeing something 'new' here. But I'm never in a rush. The food is amazing! I just love the sauce they use! It's best when you can find a bottle at the bar, as well as their wine selection, so you can indulge in some cocktails in there! You don't have to wait long for something amazing
restaurant is good (apartment is probably 2 hours away) and very well-done. Food is tender, however, the service is generally fast. For about an hour of straight time they almost certainly won't serve you anything because your whole party cannot deal with the salty crepes and crisp white pasta. If you're into expensive Italian but good it'll definitely be a good deal. If you're watching your money, skip the Parmesan and get a diced egg. I like to buy Italian which has been for a while, but this place just doesn't work as well. If it's not on the menu you can get a diced potato (I know what I'm saying but if you're in this area you may prefer a springer or buttery potato instead of real margaritas!) and or the sides with all the meats to start with. And it's on the reservations list for the hour it's open and not that expensive.
(The review process is always incredibly
restaurant at Kogo's!  The corn torta is a nightmare.  Just another table from the fake but delicious meat joint.  It's so hot you can barely breathe without it.The sushi is great but still very good.  If you are looking for some eye candy, you will not be disappointed!
I was going to say this - I live in good neighborhoods. I really do.  I mean that literally.  I will get to Burbank again for dinner sometime in the fall.  I think it should be in Malibu before that.
My husband, sister and I had a fabulous and terrific brunch.  For appetizers, I thought we would give them a try as soon as possible.  I love their chicken dishes, pickled basil shrimp, avocado, shrimp wraps and mole-plated ribeye.  No food is too similar to the bar at B2B that you will be seated there at 3:30.  Just just
restaurant, then me and a couple of the friends go in. The bill we pay was roughly $12.00. Total spend is $16.00!! After dinner I go over some of the menu and go to find out what I want to order.  It's cold out on the way out and has been super awesome the next night. The service and the food is really good. This place is perfect for groups of people, but is definitely worth a try if you've tried any of the other line-ups.  Every week we try to change our budget and tips the people there.
This is a high-end barber shop.  The ambience is pretty damn good.  For the price and great food, it really would not be a romantic place to go without.  The selection of drinks is limited (I love the maraschino gin), and you may not have a creative idea on how to make it all that better.  All in
restaurant choices are always perfect (from fish salad to pizza).  As far as the staff itself, they never disappoint. Service is incredible, their drinks are endless, and what feels like a service nap would be the worst in the city.  I have never had a rude experience before and if you order pasta dishes they aren't around, so really that shouldn't bother you at all.  I do not agree with the pricing, but there's nothing like going from $100 for pasta to $60 for soup.   It just has so much value to me and I have no interest in waiting outside to have everyone fill me in.  If they are telling you to pay $100 for pasta, then that's true.  How are they selling that?  You should have figured it out yourself.
I've lived in this neighborhood for four years and it has been fantastic! I've read about the Greek food and how great the organic food gets and will definitely be back
restaurant with a beautiful interior.
Best, worst, smallest seafood salad at http://bach_man.com/
I think I will finally eat here...and more importantly I will eat here again! This restaurant is top of the food chain. It's fair to say they're also unbeatable! I love the pizza too, everything is crispy and fluffy. Awesome design!  But check out the staff who work like vandals...I love the pizza but I don't like the pizza too much.  If your in a hurry you have to go back. Too much old school pizza.I definitely recommend this place!  I will go back here again!
Piano is awesome for just $12.50/month. I've been thinking about it for a while but since I've been here two more times I'm finally going to try it. The pizza is delicious!
One of my favorite Italian restaurants in Chicago.  My girlfriend and I are a huge fan
restaurant. When they came in they were not happy. Food was awful and service is really slow.  A friend even left a check for another party, which was totally tasteless. Finally they came back just as rude. Got the server and said they want you to email him and get a refund. He thought he was cute and placed the check on the table. I like this and we always get a refund.  This place is overpriced and not going to keep going.
Great website, great food, delicious beer, our only complaint is the last 30 minutes. For the price of what others think (free pizza, fries), this place should be a must for any seasoned pizza lover.
Like I said we're very familiar with this place. They have done it a couple times for me, and it only got better. The hype is still a big part of the experience. The best thing about the place is that it's supposed to be super simple to get there
restaurant
I used to think that is the cheapest Thai place to eat in the city.  Instead it's cash-only!  I've noticed a lot of the workers are somewhat drunk, so the food is pretty good, though. I liked the little offerings they offered.  Overall, they got a positive reputation for food and service.  Overall, the only disappointment is the restaurant itself.
This is one of those rare Thai places where not only is it extremely upscale, but all the customers are treated like family - almost like family. I love this place and highly recommend it to any fan of dining and dining with the family. All I want to add is that if you have a different taste for Thai, this is not a place that you should try. Keep up the good work!
The front of the store, which used to be crowded, now seems to be a secret.  Please be patient, the wait times are way down.  Everyone should check out
restaurant) but I'm not a fan. So I'm working on a new restaurant, and am less than pleased with my experience here. My only suggestion? Wait until you are in line to get an appetizer; I don't want to sit in line waiting in line, so the food is more expensive to start with.
I went for my birthday on Tuesday night and the food was very good. But after having had the fried oyster fries, I feel uncomfortable going back for my relatives. It is amazing when you enjoy your family-run restaurant and enjoy your meal. I just wish I could have made the reservation quicker because they have 2 doors and they are closed because of the busy service.
Had the BEST sandwich in Chicago. Main course with good creme brulee. Definitely can't be beat....since the ONLY reason to check the store is because it is closed on weekends. I mean we should get our chips or chipsaver....it was the only place I
restaurant, he would rather know how to impress women than bite his chest. The sure to be warm, comfortable and delicious. I had a fine meal on Tuesday evening and expect excellent service and authentic European cuisine.
I love Carnivale and I grew up here.  The quality of the sandwiches and soups really matter.  The atmosphere is very hip, casual, and all-around fun.  The service is top notch. I really enjoy going to Saturday night when my friend is there.I won't go back to Carnivale if I don't want to. I enjoyed the food.
My sister and I have been to Friday night restaurants from time to time. We went here last week and enjoyed the meatloaf but couldn't be more happy. We have been to L.L. Doug's in Salt Lake City a couple times and there we had just picked up our friend and fiance from college. We will definitely come back.
I live in a
restaurant experience by featuring fresh tasting ales, ground beef and pickled carrots.The menu features a gourmet menu consisting of ravioli, house red peppers, salsa, pineapples, and more!~ 6 members/inners were seated at 6:30, 1 more below is selected!~ Pho, Rollout, Tacos and Dinner~We had reservations on the last Sunday night so we decided to go sooner rather than later.The food was fantastic. The service was so good that we were able to rush a table, and there are plenty of amazing seats. My husband and I would recommend this restaurant to everyone.Try this place if you have no reservations!
How many great restaurants did you expect to see in Chicago last month? Not one! I have visited many great restaurants there and now to go back has surprised me.  One thing I love about Chicago is the seating arrangements, especially if there is a seating fee.  My favorite place is my
restaurant came to find a lot of unusual eateries serving strange dishes from around the area. Everything came with a twist. It's also to be expected if you want to feel like the cafeteria is full for a long time and that this is true. I mean this isn't a movie on the wall which means I may have been more confused about the service at the end because I thought this may be "bandaid dining" but if I recall correctly, the dishes served were amazing. Tres fruit salad with guacamole... jicama fillets, shawarma, black bean truffle, and mushroom slaw were totally authentic. The inclusion of avocado and mahi mahi pork on the menu made all these dishes very unique. Overall, check out the "disco" element.Food is amazing. However, if you're looking for something without the deep fried, fried balls, hit the "speciality" menu. The seafood sauce combo was amazing and the mus
restaurant, delicious service, and dine and relax. We recommend this place to anyone who is looking to find a place that takes a ton of vacation time away from everyone else. It has a great ambiance and is less noisy than the other establishments in the area. I had a wonderful friend order the toast because she found it on the menu from the gas station. Also good is that they provide the best tip italian dishes. The tomato curdini, kong thai appetizer and savory bran soup are both delicious! Other than that, this is a great place to get in and out of on a weekday.  I've also had a friend and her fiance and they both love it.
i have heard good things about this place. great steak night here and great food. work place to go. are the three tables the ones with the whiskey. would recommend.
This is one of the best restaurant in Chicago,a place for a date.This
restaurant is highly recommended and really accommodating.  So what?  Well....I found the toast and marinated goat cheese dumplings you can find in Eatem there great.  Their strawberry pig for breakfast.  Not my favorite of all-around, but there are a lot of sandwiches made with the ricotta!  Very large, well kept and easy to make!  Great bread and wine selection.  Don't forget to order your own dip!  5 Stars:  the host, Mr Bethuel said that his co-workers on the get go were probably horrible.  If only I could take the chance to let everyone know that they're horrible.  This is what I've always asked for: filthy dishes on a staff that spent so long berating these people.  Fierce, loud sultry, and physically abusive about everything, this was rude, arrogant, and self-promotional.  You must know this.  I've seen the name
restaurant, but some other comfort food items aren't advertised.I recommend Chicago very strongly.I don't really understand if we should consider the following items in their conclusion:
Especially since they look great, bring them to meal instead of dinner.
My favorite part of this restaurant is the Burger King Cafe. I love the variety and space they have here.The food is perfectly fried but the service is excellent. However, what really eludes me is that there are two separate rooms that are themselves separate from each other. I guess it's that this is a separate restaurant when they do the fried soups, roasts and tea.Overall the food here is very good, but the service is little more than a bit above average. They also have a little more selections in the 3 quarter aisle that will push the price down.
I never get a seat at the fast food restaurant on a Sunday night. Everything is so out of proportion that the prices start almost $60. My
restaurant in select restaurants in Lakeview, says she hopes for a better place at the Rook Mill location.
Oceanside (1003 N. Second Ave.)
The owner -- the roving, highly paid pastry chef behind Selene's Cafe -- is no chef: he is a wine aficionado. (In his native Italy, one study found that his specialty of sherry casks, which he always leaves to his guests, is more prevalent than in other styles.) On the day he leaves, the owner takes an interest in her all-important wines. When he is seated at table, he flaps his wine selection to my waiter and, with a flourish, offers his first taste of our new fruit. He asks if we'd like to pay for a pint or two. And as far as the broth goes, she told me, he simply asks, "Will your order be ready the next day?"
One of the restaurant's most anticipated summer desserts was
restaurant!
In the past 3 months or so, I've had 2,000+ different places like it. Of course it's impossible to count the total time it takes to open an Italian restaurant, so we've been bringing a host of people with us to hang out and try each and every pizza they have. So far, I've been able to split the tips of 10 pizza sets. I'll try to say what pizzas are good. For example, the steak and my friend's grill meat were the two good ones, and I never felt the need to break the mark by liking what I just ate.
If you're a Chicken Fettuccini lover like myself, it's your damn fault for not being up to standard by now! This place is amazing. Chicken is a must get at this place!   I always order the Non Olives (white bread) which are amazing but still, most of you will definitely not be disappointed.  I love
restaurant, a big deal; inside, we were pleasantly surprised and delighted, offering a selection of upscale casual salads, tomato-esque steak/bacon spread, and lamb sausage. Everyone was talking about meal and service, and I just could not help but stare at the cake under the king-size.This place was exceptional. We will be back.
I am getting nervous about this place. Although I cannot compare the prices to any other gourmet food I have eaten at. From what I can say I love the outdoor patio. They have great food that no one else in the area can even compare, but they are fast and have all kinds of incredible food. The food here is really nothing special. At this point, we are just looking for something a little more inviting, but I will stay out of this place.
We took our order out of my refrigerator because it was cold. YUMMY!We found out we had to cut out the two bottles of wine
restaurant friendly for all! On a Wednesday night, the fries were always full! This is definitely a large city restaurant, but once you open up you're into the food so deliciously prepared, and they've exceeded expectations. There are 2 sides to this entree, open menu. The one with the french fries was the biggest thing, and the one with the mashed potatoes was the only other thing that was great. Both are roasted cabbage and they have chips on the side. It was a very fun dish, and the food was unique. The fries were fried potatoes and the fries had chicken, cheese, fresh cut potatoes and vinegar. To top it off, the potatoes were melted through and the vegetables were raw and soft. We got the potatoes and bacon cheese sandwich with bacon, but that didn't even touch the potatoes and cheeses. We didn't know how to get the food on to the fries, which was at best a wasted matter. My only other complaint is that the
restaurant is a bit trickier on the side because your rice and lunch are likely to be better.  However, if you're not sure why your rice and lunch are not better, ask for the additional option, only wait until they show up.
My husband and I are constantly looking for Indian dining places in the neighborhood...these little spots are sooooo tiny and it just becomes overwhelming. I will be back every time!
Now that I know what tastes like in this restaurant, I will try to take some photos as I return to visit again. My goal here is to find restaurants that will bring out the best -and if the time is right, then fine! I hope you can plan ahead and choose what type of food you want.Thank you everyone for your service and support.
Simply the best steaks in Chicago -easy to get everything you need.  Ordered the red pepper sushi, an apple crab and three...which were amazing...nothing more than a
restaurant options at our restaurants, unless you like escargos and things about the interior of restaurants. Save up for a burger and fries by sharing a big plate of food, since you can always add to it with what's left over from previous days. I tried the weather map to get a sense for the location, but it was too dry. I was disappointed since the location appears in the background to reflect only the seasonal woodlands and fog that plague the Southern States. I'll give this place another try, though. I would also recommend parking in plain view during times of cold weather as a side-effect of cold winter weather.
Good food. Sooo much good stuff.Service is quick and attentive, tastes great, and really special. The service outside the pub is fantastic.
The wait staff is small, medium-sized, and a bit down on the tall side when you drive. Maybe the most ridiculous wait in Chicago. Margherita here is well done,
restaurant-style menu; space is cramped and heavy at night and it only takes the bus to get there (the rear doors open at 10 a.m.). If you want a tasting menu from a restaurant with good decor and interior, you're going to want Plano's; here is a great one if you happen to be in town and you'd like to try it yourself.
Wake Up American is always welcoming, and the location is fairly large (50 sf) but its the food that inspires us all to always try new things. I highly recommend you go here if you have never tried it, and definitely check it out.
the unmade shrimp taco is outstanding, they have SO much sausage to eat, great stews, and the owner does some incredible chef work. they have usually low prices and as most of the staff worked there has rarely been any negative service. well done chef are d never moved by anything and make extensive use of their space, but
restaurant on Thursday when he said he had been watching The Good Wife. Although the food was good and that he was well cared for, things were not great.  Our waitress introduced us to her husband about 3 days later, to the point where he said his table wasn't quite there yet.  She did have a light bar and would not make it difficult for us to go back for tea with her husband.  I also cannot say enough good things about her service, because we had an expensive meal.  She also turned out to be extremely rude to us and almost kept us waiting very long.  She asked us why we were there when we left and our voice was very confused.  Whenever someone gets upset and tries to change the menu, they take our names off the menu because we couldn't make it.  I hope they change the food.  I love the restaurant as it is a really nice place to go for a date.
La Madeleine was fabulous
restaurant note: for starters, don't eat your noodles. That is where the dishes are amazing, and I hope they survive their apparent curse of disappearing. An early reservation will allow you a quick cup of tea and beer, but have to try to wait a minimum of 10-15 minutes before enjoying that delicious casserole on a banana straw.  If you are not a sucker for syrup, there are a couple of options on the menu.
Long story short. Tasting experience is great, service and atmosphere are fun. But then you realize: the food in this diner has more complex ingredients in it. Have you seen the now famous gyros in any city that actually asks you for your name? I've never had anything that was ridiculously prepared, from scratch, and it made me get hungry. Very disappointing at best, terrible at worst.
Great decor, great food.  Hopefully our waiter will make the neighborhood become better for business.
When I was a kid
restaurant - highly recommendable. Just didn't know what to expect, but it was so perfect to drink this delicious tamari all around!
my girlfriend liked it better. ever since i was craving Thai margaritas, i used to go to any of the other restaurants in Saguarita! when i visited to give away the wine box, i was disappointed in the prices!!! my girlfriend really loves them!! there is a waitstaff you need to stop by to check before you get in - and you need to be ready before the wait!! my gf loves their salad bar - and my boyfriend loved their spicy blueberry kabob!! My mom loves them! the food was good and the service was amazing (makes my mouth water!). i am not going back here again, since i had better time there!!
Yum! Huge Margaritas! Not only did they use real cashew, but they also had homemade sausages! The ones i'm going
restaurant moxie du zaro, not being that different than wine from any other yelp food thing.Yummmmm... Next time I try this shop it will be very special.The plates that were special were spicier than my basilical and crispy on the inside.  The  charcoal chips and miso salmon that we had here were the best.I do recommend this place if you really love lasagna and love the presentation on the steak dish.Dessert is ok but not always so fresh and unexpected!
I'd like to write a review of Alinea's near weve closed for good.  I have been to the restaurant several times now and could definitely recommend it all.  The ambiance is an amalgamation of Italian and American with so many things being possible.  From the aromatics and the craft selections, to the delicious soup and entrees.  And with the pairing of hotdogs and veggie rice we could split our shopping trips
restaurant: Electric taz -- great if we have no other options. parking place: Crockett's -- definitely does need to do some creative garden work, but not among our appetizers.
Yummy!This was our first visit to Mooteca, so we had the chance to try some of its flavors before coming here, I love going to the Little Mississippi in the spring! I usually only go here once a month to see if they will be working a long-term remodeling or just expand on an existing business, which makes this one of my favorite places I've been! If you have a second visit this time around you will get to try and relish in the hot, unique flavors that happen to be from an area where you live.The food was very good and exceeded my expectations! I would be back for sure.
Great, fancy Japanese gemolo!  Obvious variety.  Service is great.  Very informative.  Overall the food was
restaurant is somewhat pricey. My girlfriends and I are usually pleased with their mediocre portions (with white rice), but this one's a different matter. My wife wants the potato fried rice and fries, but the potatoes (fried rice) only taste like white rice. I like the nigiri flavor and have never really enjoyed this fried rice. There is a table outside and the interior is full of pineapples. Sometimes it is small, sometimes it's huge. I think that's a good thing.
Will come back here once again for brunch with Italian entrees and desserts. Also note the tiny parking lot.
Horrible place, plain menu, dim sum portions all in all. What can I say?
They're happy to pay you, and I respect you. But their food is awful. They're so polite I'm just fond of being called that I feel like I'm a dork. Nice, cozy, white-roasted sushi place (with fish and chips
restaurant for the salad bar! I had the cheese appetizer (she is lucky that I'm from this area) and because of the special service I decided to try it too. I got rice benders (well bunched beef) and we ordered the big potatoes cake with lemongrass cheese. It was horrible and the bread really was better than I had ever had in my life. I really would go back for this restaurant and the fries will keep you coming back even after years of winter dining in Fogo Fogo.
A must for local dining! Doug's is no stranger to Italian cuisine; once in a while he will have your menu but most of the time you want something different. One morning at 3pm he and I were walking down to our job as we wait for our tables at some of the nearby restaurants, he asked me if I liked how dishes were prepared so I replied "no - i don't like it." The waiter came in and asked if
restaurant/executive chef? But one thing I can't say is, get ready to die for cold appetizers. Try something awesome and have the good old fogo dar: niki wraps and salads - their best. If you don't enjoy the customer service and don't care for your food and service - I highly recommend the duck/pork gyro in the spring section - if not done right, for our service - good deal. All in all, i'm a huge cheese lover.
Such a cute place, but if you live in the mood for this place for a great cold eats experience
I arrived here after dinner on Saturday and it was raining. Very nice... everything was super slow but by the time we walked in the large kitchen, the water was just pouring out of the inside and a cutout. I always like these little places like this (I know).  The ambiance is very nice though - an old jazz club with the cool culture
restaurant. The menu is not great. While I love duck seafood, I cannot  enjoy the red velvet shrimp fries, which are such a shame that you can't even get a bite without trying them. Only 8 total  to be completely honest. Overall, good burgers but not nearly as good as the one before it.
One of the best sushi I have ever had. They have excellent selection and prices too.
Go here!  When you get there you are probably going to find a bar where you can sit down and have some sushi with a bunch of other good people - with the most vegetarian sushi you will eat anywhere. I had a samurais samurais chicken for Christmas and thought it was what a standard sashimi menu would be.  It's kind of like today's classic.  The portions were big and their veggie wings were enormous.  My wife loved the roast meat and rice with the beef.  I can't wait to go back
restaurant: mojitos. The seafood was off the charts, but the quality of food was worth it.
Grand opera house restaurant La Muro Grada.  The atmosphere is good, but not as interesting as it once was.  Some people think it was supposed to be an alternative to one, but its not.  All the food is good, and in the dining room, and serves completely adequate.  I have been to this restaurant once, but never once had a cup of espresso.  I would say they were good, but never once have I had. 
My favorite Indian food. The chili is addictive. Chicken nuggets (lemon, oiled pork and shrimp), topped with salad, rice, eggs, mushrooms and beans, always makes my mouth water. Every once in a while the guy will bring out a scallop to just cook.
My friends and I are into Asian restaurants.  On Sunday nights I go for dinner, (
restaurant is great! I ordered a couple of oysters and did not order any, rather, of the three sauce dishes. Which are: (I am very partial)  Upper shrimp, Cooked pork, Whole fish, and salad..... we ordered our first dinner together.... we each placed their order with "tapas". It was phenomenal!! The first dish was great, without those plates we were left with beef based chicken that was wept blue that said it was sun dried out.... Next time we would try more of the lower shrimp.... They have much better meats in their menu..... Thanks Asahi Fushi!!! Next time we would try their second dish called, same combo...... but I would leave waiting longer.......  We tried 2 more dishes:  Old fashioned bean pot steak & goat cheese..... I was only confused when they said "Made with green beans". the one I had there was not green beans.... which has an amazing taste and it took our wine course to get to
restaurant option (guaranteed good service, great prices) and great pizza, and also healthy eats.  We don't know if this is to hit all SODC related problems, but if they let me try my few 10 star dishes, they are going to cook up some good reviews and would make me want to order more.
If you're an old ass tourist and live in the city, I want you to be prepared to eat a little dinner in your bedroom.  My daughters visited Chicago over the weekend for dinner and it was a great experience.  They've been there every night since I went last night.  I especially like the novelty of the place.  They're looking for beer and cocktails and if you're not into that or want something tastier, great off the beaten path, just order a bunch of different pieces (such as the molotov cocktail) and have a grand salad with apple shavings on top.  We didn't even
restaurant, he recognized the complexities of the situation and assured us we could be served their delicious dishes if we ordered at the right time and right time. We had several of the dinner parties (mostly serving from the bus shelter), which were perfectly prepared and perfectly prepared to attend a martini bar, but it wasn't the menu that brought out the best. So, we decided to go for a martini. The box was open for about 20 minutes (very cramped), we were still completely exhausted and we needed a break to go see the 'Outside' (where the crust was deliciously served and loved by the owner). The service was very prompt and we had very easy to find seated parties, and we definitely recommended it. Needless to say, this martini bar is a must.
the best martini bar in dennym
from the initial waitress it was amazing. i would not recommend anyone to go to Margaritas. the food here are amazing. i dont
restaurant is expensive (when she sold the dishes they could have refills), but it was worth it.
I was on a hot dog breakfast reservation, which meant we had to wait 1 hour and 20 minutes for a seat in the restaurant.    I don't know if there is time for the breakfast buffet or lunch or dinner buffet (I really like the philosophy of its fresh soup).  Unfortunately, there was no appetite.  I might go back!
I didn't plan to write all the reviews, but this place was amazing, and every foodie that I spoke to was given exactly what they ordered.  Food was terrific, but the service was flat and the prices were ridiculously low.
I've never been to This place, but I got very annoyed by the atmosphere and music.  A restaurant that has been around for too long is an overbearing tourist trap.   Unfortunately, the owners don't make a lot of money on the food and service
restaurant, the staff was extremely friendly and attentive and extremely helpful. On Tuesday night, we went to an elaborate party and our date asked us what we were going to eat. We ordered a large salad and it was absolutely fantastic! I didn't want to wait a full 20 minutes for my own food...but I said 'yes' because I thought it was overhyped.  The bacon sandwich which was good, was good but I couldn't finish it! The salad that I chose was not great as I thought it was overrated. The toppings that I ordered were exactly what I wanted: scrambled eggs, apple, lettuce and bacon cheese- simple, but extremely thin and crispy. I am a huge fan of the bacon sandwich.  They were great on the food.  They cost a good $20-$30 plus tax and I only have reservations now for 11/16. I would probably give 4 stars.  If I had a great time, maybe 2 and never
restaurant; Ravioli's, Popeyes, Curry Fries; Shrimp Fries, Eggplant Fries; and Potatoes and Mussels. The BBQ bbq is also high quality. All are great just beyond price and atmosphere. The maple charcoal chicken sandwich is very flavorful and even better if cooked over the charcoal briquettes. The chicken chowder, a classic in Chicago. I believe on top of that, the BBQ stuffed Rib Black Fish is a must-try for those wanting some great greasy fried meat! Overall a memorable experience with a nice crowd. The charcuterie is also top notch but its the prices and the food not worth it at the cost. Just check this place out.
Every time I go I just have to let go of the idea that the free McDonalds are something special and not everytime I get my salads down I get something that is a little less good. Although it is true that my meal stops when I take a
restaurant is great and offer great recommendations (don't see the full review) but there are some things to say about the duck.  It seems very upscale and private, however the duck just felt just right in the water.  The prices were significantly more reasonable.
My husband and I have been here for over 30 years.   Our budget is about $50 for dessert and portions for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  We have been told that the duck and steak is fantastic.  This place only serves 8 duck dishes and always asks for 8 small appetizers each.  The prices are lower, which is nice considering it's hard to find a decent place.
The menu is so extensive and unique, that you can't read any of it.  If you're looking for something great to do in the country, try something different than La Course de la Rose or Tien de Cana etc.  It's here that the customers come in to be ambushed and
restaurant? Both of us for sure!! We had the rosé soup and it was amazing! My boyfriend loved it and we will be coming back anytime!
I am still under the impression that brazilian jordans take precedence over tbe colonial style pizza. I thought they were ok with french fries because it looked like french fries but the fries were far better than what I got.  There are a lot of not boring things on the menu.  It is interesting that they had to add enough space, space needed and space available. They do a better job with turning people away than they did on other things.
For the check you get 2 servings of egg rolls: 1 served at room temperature, 1 served at 5'0.20 in. tb50 was over $20 and it took less than 5 minutes.  The only place I would review this was we had a non availency at 9:00 am (around 7pm if we were staying
restaurant $125 per person. 11 a.m., Monday through Thursday 1 p.m.; $150 for breakfast or dinner; and in the afternoon you get free popcorn and a cheesecake with your choice of 1 Tuna chips, nuts, avocado, rice, salsa, or whatever else you have in your huge basket, then you wait forever for your order to be confirmed, you'll have a busy dinner place to yourself for hours, making it fun and delicious, but would you do that? For the price of popcorn and really the rice? Yep. We also had the deviled eggplant and the chocolate chips so cheesy and delicious. Our order was absolutely incredible.We have had more than 60 different menus, and several times more have been from across the country. What's more, the kitchen is my favorite part of the restaurant!  Milled chocolate syrup is of course a staple on any pancakes to leave you drooling.  The nectarines have a delicious deep chocolate
restaurant has been opening since the original white house opened, and when they've finished decorating the lounge chairs it's moved in line with their re-opening earlier this year, along with the wife and son of their venerable owner, the chef and cook. All are real-life experience specials.
The brostini sauce I ordered was one of the best I have ever had, and I must admit it, was also the best I have ever had from an Italian restaurant. I had the cayenne pepper pork...seventh year college student Ruth decided that this was a move up from her normal fare- pizza to this elegant and addicting dish. It was almost as if Ruth had gone directly from cayenne pepper to tomato sauce; it took seconds for her to realize she was going to have to spend hours making it, but she didn't have to wait long to get her pizza done. It was delicious and warm (it had Italian colors) that was as much as
restaurant-packed-goods, including hip hop, organic, and local (and locally) artisan plates.  It's a nice cozy place and serves good tacos, like yum.
So while it was pleasant and trendy, this is actually one of the most misunderstood places on the East Coast. It doesn't happen in Chicago, it happens in every part of the country.  When some of us encounter the restaurant in Miami, we love it!  The sushi is one of the best ever in the area, the crust is just exquisite and the sauces are so scrumptious.  The sushi may be the best I've had in the area.
My friends and I drove home from Chicago just about 8:00 pm last night. I ordered the chicken omelet with gyros which is not recommended because the gyros are very thick and salty.  I think the gyros were the best in the area and that was that we were not offended.
restaurant and incredible flavors of house-made noodle. Some of the best cocktails we've ever had at Giordano's.... --Costume: the most expensive for a food experience (guess that's not cool because they're going with waitresses), but worth it for the atmosphere, quality, and artistic work, and for everything they do here.Food: the staple in the neighborhood is savory yakitori--kind of crazy, huh?The antipasto portions are very creative, so you need to add some meats, (the tenderloin and meatballs -- it's a bit red meat, but for my money the best flavor of most things in Boston, I've never tasted).The thing that really gets me excited about this place is the cream of the Astrafell dish, which is, well, cream of your choice. The cabbage is amazing. The egg rolls are hard as metal, perfectly crispy, and filling and delicious. In this rotation
restaurant $11-13
Our go-to cafe for Akyo. Try it during Chicago month. We have a great food and a great atmosphere.  This place is reasonable with only about a half hour wait (literally).
I love the hostel food in this location.  I know it's a Chicago steakhouse, but for the steakhouse to feel like this is totally Chicago makes me want to giggle.  The manager is honest and open with the customers (and their families).  Service is great, great food.  And they have a great vibe.I highly recommend visiting the parking lot.  It's convenient enough for us both!I've always been in Naperville, so I am a sucker for food here.  Not only do they have great burger spots with great food, it's well worth the price.
I have watched for many years how pretty more great restaurants are for people under 30. So many more years I have sat on
restaurant" since then.  My favorite dessert place for Ethiopian couples is Kistro....one of my favorite places to sit on the patio....it's always incredibly fresh, always fresh, always at the best prices.   Its amazing...there are so many choices, so you can always choose from the best or least popular (I do recommend Kidder's first place, since it's really good).
best chicken w/tomato soup I have had in Chicago this year!!!! Fresh.  of local meat.  Not spicy so I highly recommend the company itself.  Just here for the veggies and vegetarian thing.  Batter with venison is awesome and my favorite way to go.  some authentic pig blood and grits (whatever that means) was perfect.  Another top notch restaurant.
I have been here many times, and as friends of mine make short trips.  I enjoy the food, but the service is at a high point.  My dinner
restaurant Sam's Fish, Purple Duck burger, Green Veg's, Empanada-flavored wood chips, and the value of the lamb as a patron offering. The table was full before I walked away. And the entire experience reminded me of my girlfriend and I dining together. There were a few special and slightly overpriced recommendations like the Steak King, Salado Slaw, and Try It Nutella - for a total of $3.95 or 4 or 5 bucks, we ordered 5. The salmon soup was DELICIOUS. YUM! We didn't mind the service and no items that were negative...just the food!  For entrees like Entree, Avocado Love, or Dragon, we ordered the pumpkin pie which did not disappoint. The Service was HORRIBLE, the portions were not smaller and the appetizers were fresh too...MUST USE 3/4 total when ordering again. Even worse was the size of the shrimp that I ordered...
restaurant, sanitariums, etc.
This place was great, extremely friendly, and if you have had a bus ride or lunch, come here! I highly recommend this place for no small number of reasons.There is one other eatery you will find here: Kala Bistro.  Their dishes are some of the best you will ever find (if you order to-go, you'll definitely find yourself eating here), they even have some Belgian Braised beef which is always in the tasty to see! It's just about worth it!
This place is amazing - very special tasting food.  There is nothing better in the city.  It's the best.
My favorite place to be in town on a weekday! The only thing that makes it so special is the atmosphere.  Great dancing, great tacos, a little bit of Italian food.  You can tell by the wide walls with those huge hostesses.  The cantaloupe pizza
restaurant was very good as well as great service.  I have not had this, but it is the way I have had it, and more, so I will continue to say it (which is true):
I absolutely love my brother's salad bar! I am coming back for dinner on Sunday. I am about to leave, but I have gotten a reservation to enjoy our fabulous food. The service has been great, and all I have to say is, glad I finally got on the trip to eat there, it is awesome.
If you like spicy food you should try this restaurant.I love this place and have tried many different kinds. Its a great place for bringing the children and with a good chilli. I love that the guacamole with the pineapple is the best and it is also excellent!
love food  food is very good here and i always LOVE the chicago vibe, they look to be in a philly area so dont be afraid to
restaurant means it has to be accompanied by someone. For us, it means a huge number of people!  That means we are likely to have a large group of customers (2-5), not just a small group of people.  However, it was like we had a big party!  We have never experienced that!  I know we do not have customer service experience in general, but not at So Cal!  We have always heard a lot of negative reviews, and always assumed it was some version of "I don't have service" about so many of our previous server friends in Napa City, California.  However, with the popularity of So Cal, we thought it would be cool to try another server at So Cal, and it is.The waitress (Chu Nguyen) (which is clearly the most attentive, reliable and professional) was fantastic and patient with us.  She even explained that we were fans and that a date had to be planned for lunch
restaurant, all shared bread rolls and soft candies. Arrive early and order sushi, although have a better dining experience than most diners.
I recently went to my friend's friend's wedding, and everything I've found is great and brought new love. The food comes from nowhere, and it does not look like there is much we can taste. Once seated, they have the noodles, salad and the margaritas and all the expensive seafood bar is also out of the restaurant.The service is awesome! Food for me is cooked as well as drink quality. I personally feel the whole experience is as much a show as the menu. I'm not a fan of the coffee bar, which brings over me to the big coffee latte-style sandwiches. With just that I would go back for more.
I'm a cook and one of my friends has recently given up on pizza. The place is a once in a lifetime mistake. Sorry, not sure if it has
restaurant), but it's equally as great. Parking is plentiful and you will be able to park at any corner and get a table right next to the bar. The food is pretty good, a few samples of the more famous Italian tastes. There's a a lot to talk about here, but also plenty of basic folk music. and there's a really decent wine list, as well.
I think I've written this review because I don't know how to get a good shot in jazz. The service is super good. The food is usually totally well prepared and the service is always friendly, and everyone is happy and enthusiastic. Of course the unique decor of the lounge and the kitchen would not be recognized without some first timers yelling at each other on the counter while answering their phone. The prices for drinks and drinks are all quite reasonable but the music itself is totally innovative, classical and experimental. They even take a lunch break.  Also, even if you can't get a seat
restaurant

Absolutely the best in the area. Yes, it is close to a schoolhouse or a major airport, but the food is unique and just right. The food is tasty and sometimes flavorless, but, once you try it, you are right. If I would move in, I'd go here a year ago now to enjoy all the different flavors and styles of pizza I've tried. They were seriously, unbelievably friendly and attentive. I've been here a dozen times now, every time I went there, and usually they are great! They know what's coming. I have to say, I have eaten at you before and come here often.
My husbands will never miss this restaurant! My wife and I enjoy trying everything in the menu and consistently deserve a great "best of." Their extensive service, a long wait for food, and our food was very over-whelmed as our food was delivered to our table for delivery or at the next table until one was
restaurant with beautiful decor, great food and a very friendly hostess and we are very happy! If you go tonight for a brunch, go, it is way better than the club. If you are on a relaxed, upscale style to a relaxing evening you want to try the same thing. We are very far from the usual crowds of the bars and are much happier eating in a very "family-friendly" setting.
I love this place, but this place is NOT for everyone.
After chatting with a couple friends on the last night I decided I wanted to give this place another chance.       A short drive from my hometown was about to get to something I had never been to before.                                                     
restaurant - a night out for everyone!   Unfortunately I was nervous about stepping out there and ended up having to wait a lot longer for them to come in (I think this was around 3 - 4 hours from the restaurant)  For the first time, I had to wait for 30 minutes to get into the atmosphere.  Nothing was particularly fun or exciting, so I had to wait a while before I got here.  And if you aren't inclined to wait in line and eat a little before, they also charge you $25 for 2 seats in the back.
Went to the Superior Holiday for dinner today!  Was really impressed, the food was delicious, the service was very friendly and the prices are reasonable.  I'd go back to try other places that served the same steak daily (Jug or Yuca).  We went in right after the first stop - the kids were usually asleep, so no matter where we were, we always found our place quickly
restaurant on the ground floor, sandwiches in a day, and well, burgers, chocolate achillefries, whole grains, etc. Great coffee and amazing service!
Most of my friends in my area love this place! The staff is awesome, and the atmosphere is energetic and well-crafted. The C++ cuisine is so important and makes for a great dining experience! The pizza is very good and delicious. I eat on the weekend and will definitely come back.
Made to order delicious, fast food. Give the place something you don't normally have to pay for. Try alot of entrees, the best was the tapas!
Treme as it gets called - Franken or Chardonnay is the best example of a chicken house in Chicago.  You know they make fantastic soul food and meh, I know they can do better.  But, if you want to eat  inexpensive, serve them here - it would be Worth every penny.

restaurant. I love the pasta and it is ALWAYS tasty.  I have tried some of the Giordano's but I still love it.
I am a vegetarian and I LOVE TOSANA!  I give it 2 stars.  I received a letter from Mr Carnivale and I have been to his restaurants many times and it was way too many seats for me.  The owner of Chef Bayou has always been funny and gracious.  I am glad we didn't.  But you need to try this restaurant for sure, and the wait staff is friendly and attentive. Thank you Carnivale!
Food was great.  We ordered the Caramel Cow Shrimp and the Truffle Pepper Fries.  I had only the Vegalea and saw little to give in.  Overall, well worth the visit.
I recommend spicy food, but this place is for the adventurous and they make a mediocre short wait for you on the weekends.

restaurant menu and is just right on the $10 recommended menu. All in all, a very nice surprise. I always get the crowd favorites and the neighborhood specials. This is a great place for some of your party mates to plan an afternoon of culinary wine and.
Great food, food + service. If you're not for Vegas Style Salad or Appetizer, you can't go wrong with Allura :)
The small portions are inexpensive and the service is outstanding. I went with a group of four on a Sunday evening with our 2 sisters and it was pretty crowded. I had to wait 8 hours on a hot morning so most people waited for another hour so there was no trouble at all. My fiance and I were seated on a reservation and we were greeted at the bar. All together, it was a pleasant surprise, especially because it was a full bar, so we went to try everything together.   I would describe this place as the zenith of full bar
restaurant.   We ordered something a little sloppy.  The ribeye steak was awful and the table was a little dry.  We called to make sure it was kosher because we had to go in the private menu to make room for all the other dishes.  Our waiter was yelling that it was going to take an hour and we could not make reservations because we were so out of our chairs!  Apparently the wine table has a date with a friend and ordered a cocktail.  It took an hour and we sat there and waited for all of the wine to come out.  I guess it would have been okay if we could have taken our hands off the tables and rushed back to the bar.  When the waitress came out, we decided we didn't want to wait.  The service was terrible as well!  Don't leave without a fight.
I love this place. I've been to a lot of restaurants and this place has the best selection of organic beers
restaurant, salad bar, and garden salad bar - again all near Maple Ave. Only downside - you won't be able to go out of your way to meet up with friends. 
Went there and love every minute of it, glad I did and will be back.  The atmosphere is pretty sexy and the meat is really good.  How low can you go? (but really, those aren't deep red-meat red meats on the side anyway... :)  My husband called me a wannabe fat, but then he forgot to fill our bill.) There is another restaurant on the block on the block.  If there's one more place worth going to, I'd probably stop by... 2 bad reviews on Yelp said they do not only have the kind of experience that Yelp needs, but they have to get rid of everyone from the crowd to the service desk who bothers to stay a while longer. They've even bragged that they run a professional coffee operation.
restaurant is definitely not the best, but you definitely won't be back for long because this location is packed with incredible food.  The Greek pizza is about the best pizza I've ever had, and the risotto to quesadillas are delicious too.  And to top it off, my favorite old standby is that Pizza Crust Crisp.  It's a feast for my wife and my kids! I absolutely love the space it's in.
You will love it! They have nice booths that feel like they should be welcoming and accommodating to everyone with their size and size of dessert. My husband and I've been there nearly every other Monday night (12pm & 5am) and everyone else at the bar has had the same experience. We have been on 10 dates with maybe the only downside to this place is that they usually serve food on a week-to-week basis and some restaurants don't recommend giving out its limits as a reservation option. The fun and
restaurant and I recommend two of my friends to be on that thing again.  Not sure it's the best place for an all-ages party.
I don't mind eating there but its definitely best to bring a couple and also get for the place full of greasy people...even when you're trying to catch people moving around. If you eat there in person with your dog's eyes then you get the chicken chorizo, spinach sandwich, and our drinks for almost $10.99 plus tip. Best unpeeling sushi in Chicago. If you choose to be on a somewhat small table we suggest having dinner on a Saturday night.  Have your coffee too and never pay anywhere near $5.00 because what it says in the bottle is to pay for drinks for everyone who comes! Be prepared to try and find a one other than their will.
So far i've been back here a few times and with so many open seats and lots of seating. In every
restaurant and location, while adding in some really nice side dishes including a gorgeous fruit cake and vegetable side dish. I have eaten at both restaurants with my meal date, but we will be back.
Food is amazing and no complaints at all. I went for the piglet burrito and the tofu burrito was HUGE! The sauces and dressing are outstanding! The tables make a loud ovation for that. Frites are our top of the line and there are a ton of great options. Overall, a great BBQ spot if you're in town, especially if you live in a neighborhood.
This was such a good neighborhood. This place has a long, flavorful history, and the best outdoor seating has been part of it for over 20 years. All the sauces I've ever seen have been completely creamy and delicious, and the seafood selection isn't one of the worst I've had, but they have actually gone so far as to raise the value of the food they bring. We
restaurant is very nice and accommodating. The  lunch specials are excellent, especially for family or group night.
awesome chicken wing! was offered yummy pasta the noodles were phenomenal.  rosouche is the best! value was excellent (but also worth mentioning that they take long to eat.  be very careful when ordering.  for the price of one dala or fresh they are ridiculously pricey.)
I live and dine in one of the biggest fast food cities in Chicago and am really going to go back! The temperature is just ok, except when a southerner hits 5 degrees fahrenheit in the middle of the night!  the service is really good, but the food is chalky and undercooked!  how ridiculous is that?! What are you gonna put in your girlfriend's home? Good food.Best food I've had in Chicago.
This is the best vegetarian's I've had in Chicago. This is the best chicken you can have
restaurant. I liked the wait but the service was spot on. The staff was so friendly, the waiter is always there so you have to be ready with orders. The key ingredient here is - wow.  They literally have a neon sign around the windows to read. My order included some extra fruits like capers, bananas and fresh berries. I loved every second it took! Our waiter, Aloha, is clearly just a huge disappointment and I do not care for black women that know that they do not do exactly what they say - he got a for his lemonade and demanded a line. The menu is limited and tasteless. What a waste of customer money that he has spent trying to do the right thing, before he is ready to say "What? Be mad! Do this! Do something about it!" I only like the quality of the service and the person that just stepped up makes us feel good. Not what any other restaurant offers. 
While visiting with my
restaurant restaurant, traditional Cuban food, and a lot of things.

Definitely wouldn't recommend this place, not here unless you live in Roquefort. The food here is ok, there's nothing else to say.
Hot Hostel! I found out that the man behind the bar owns the bar - even though he is in a jazz room, not a bar - so I assumed it was a happy accident. Now that we know about the check, and the menu for the nights in which we eat there, I felt a bit bummed. The food here is average, what with the fact that it only has rancheros and mmmmm. The food at least once out of the freezer is close to perfection, but I've tried it at least once and while I won't eat it for the rest of my life, I have to say that if you ever want to be someone else's guest, this is by far the best restaurant in Chicago.

restaurant in the past, but now is a very successful restaurant!    Our server and I would be delighted to sit in the lounge and make our own savory churros.
I have never been a vegetarian in Chicago.  My boyfriend loves Chicago bacon fritters, tortas, etc.  My boyfriend loved the way you could feel good about dining in a restaurant that asks you to, whether you are an average eater or not.  I have also never been to a shipper's.  Oh, and by the way, this place gets cashierized at night.  Your ATM a night before they are open so you don't have to worry about them closing or missing.  Thanks Gauntle.
Go Go! Fantastic coffee and an awesome wine list, it really is one of the best places to drink in Chicago.  Being french-fries are the staple and the pizza special is fabulous!
Ahh, cheese with carrots...
restaurant pizza, has never been better. Many of the extras we had were somewhat over the top. The small booths were just what you'd expect in their heyday. I still would like to write, but I hope that other restaurants around Chicago are inspired to follow their example and take pride in their quality and performance.
Well, that didn't happen. The place has become  impassive. The waiters in the entrance table are doing their damnedest to watch this fancy bar become overwhelmed, and the bar itself has become a douchebag filled with cankers.  This is mostly a result of the fact that  when I left my old friend and his wife for Chicago my two grown children, we went there for lunch and brunch. So while you can't really blame the waiters, the entrance area and the small booths provided a much needed level of public service. I left feeling quite emotional and having serious questions about the neighborhood. This is not a restaurant that will
restaurant and staff. Excellent service at a reasonable price. Food is decent too.
I went there the other night. I loved the selection of pasta and pizza.  This place definitely needs to bring in more pizza!  I highly recommend checking it out and enjoying it the rest of your life!
Oops. After years of frequenting this location to revisit friendzy food and my group trip in celebration of 'First Island' brunch.  Please. Please!  By taking a 25 min drive from the Orlando airport, you are going to be wrong and out of luck.I know many people didn't, but I know there were several unhappy customers there, who were called in for rude comments.  Their owner's wife was unhappy with my failure to use the restroom, and asked if my "successful" gourmet dish would be returned.  Please, don't call in any other staff to see if they are complaining or just complaining, only apologize for your fine choice and
restaurant" and was off the deep end of the best hole-in-the-wall recommendations I've heard. But they were also refreshingly reasonable and reasonable for what they offered. The place wasn't bad but given that they are holding a special promotion for next week that will allow them to at least break even on some drinks, I felt a bit more waitstaffed than I did at Bar Daver's.I would consider giving the dive food and VIP table an A+ rating.  It's good but I think they'll try something else when they finally finally open up a place to celebrate The 46th Anniversary of Don Draper's Birthday.
I'm not exactly familiar with The Big Apple, but it's definitely an interesting place, and we absolutely loved it!  The butcher special was one of my favorite things to have!  I've had pretty good burgers and steaks at The Big Apple, and whenever they finally open up a regular place, I'm always happy
restaurant. I don't care if they are not large and maybe 75% of what is available is for groups, since they are waiting in the parking lot or by the front door.They were very attentive and I'm very pleased.The food was excellent and incredibly to die for. From an Asian vegetarian menu, to more contemporary vegetarian with the sake of a daily/epic menu I am already impressed. I also love the vintage steamed pork chop I used to get in the summer of 2010. I had a chicken with big broth, although the pita had the wrong veggies. The chicken was fat and everything tasted terrible. The rest of the dish was bland.I ordered the cilantro sampler with a side of sea salt and lemon blanc. Not a good choice for those in the mood for those thefish off top. Did I mention the rose garden, that's what you expect from a culinary establishment?I won't go back.
Great food. Would recommend

I had great meat.We started with some smoked salmon steak - while not the most flavorful - our friend shared another (dried pork), and it was so good! We will definitely be going back!
My brother and I have been there a few times.   The food was fantastic, the portions large enough to accommodate two people.  The decor was cozy, spacious, and impeccable.  We had dessert - a gummy appetizer that was wonderful.  She went through this before she left.  She was beyond willing to put in the work and waited for us to find out about it.  That night, she found the phone ringing - and forgot to open it.  If only she had had breakfast before 5 or 6.  I didn't believe that the restaurant in Shreveport would be so packed - but because it was!  So glad she would.
Went to the back of the house this evening with our date and
restaurant/is now at 750' / 325' he would not come here. (This may be the one place I forget)He tells me that you cannot pick up these items from the competition. "Not sure what the situation is. On the bread or potatoes you are really disappointed. If you want fresh meat for an extra $6/lb I can't live without the that inauspicious fruit item".Gross.  Not that he is someone who will give you healthy and delicious food at less than the prices you can get in the 2nd city.How many people can go to trouble eating out at 750' milwaukee?  if this is some sort of junk food chain/bordering grocery store I would never be where I am now.  So of course, all in all, there is just no excuse to let it all happen.  I have been coming here regularly for months and I have never been disappointed.  In fact, the server was extremely
restaurant. In the evening we had nothing but hearty sandwiches. After lunch they had an entree of carrots. We ordered a salty salad with spinach. Not tortilla chips, we gave the yogurt mousse dessert a try! Unfortunately, they turned out to be so crappy that we were missing anything from the salad menu! We paid a total of $30.00 to be given out and the restaurant ran out of patience, after which our group arrived at the cash register. The owner for a party of 7 was smoking his ass off and was looking around, who later realized he had been given in for a pricy charge of $50.00. We were then told that we could not eat for 1 hour because the front counter was off. I called to ask if the food was good but they said it was not. I was told by the owner, that if he could not help me we would be in this camp for a week. When I asked about the money he said
restaurant, more and more like fellow mecha joints. I didn't think I'd be back in such a big group once the reviews got online, but we all should enjoy this warm little place that offers you as much good as food. It has amazing customer service as well as great service!
I was new here last year, the atmosphere was great and I love everything about Trescotta! It has a great full bar, a great wine selection, cheap prices, a great atmosphere, and a busy atmosphere every day. What a great place to go out.  I love to sit with my dogs and are sure to be enjoying every bite!
I have been here 11 times but my overall experience has never been this good.  It is overcrowded with my friends.  The food is horrible.  Tasty & more expensive than the top pasta i have had.  What's different? I would highly recommend going to Yuca!
A great place to celebrate
restaurant).For a fun afternoon, please take a bus to favorite few places in the city. If you like grilled calamari, expect to eat a lot of calamari!
When it first opened at the Blue-Lamp in 1981, the restaurant was one of the most cherished Italian-American establishments in Chicago. When the restaurant closed in 2011, it was a bleak mix of the rustic dining experience of the 90's, and the soups and salads it carried left most Italians shocked. They just wouldn't eat them anymore, even after great chefs took over.  Their latest choice of raw fish was an extraordinary treat, the famous huevos sautéed with cucumber, salsa, and olive oil.  The olive oil alone was made with 300 milliliters of red wine, and while the canned veggies, such as cucumber, crab, garlic, yellow onion and aloe vera were among the most preferred meats for American diners, the whole meat
restaurant and for the cost of $25 each she was terrible.
The parking lots in this neighborhood are HUGE for a fine restaurant in a downtown neighborhood. Plus, it doesn't hurt to have one of those stop in 711 that is open to the public. I love it here. There is a line going in and out of the service area. Staff is always friendly.It was a little pricey for me but not worth it.
Too much of a wait - not only was this restaurant great but we had a nice night-in special! Had a diner night at Pocomcahy and Chef Salmon and then a Sunday dinner at Tabris and waited 45 minutes for my place and service. Great place to go if you live on Main Ave and want a great two-course lunch menu that is very cheap!
We came here for lunch.  We wanted to go for a unique taste.   Food came out well, with a hint of maple syrup in the
restaurant, we chose Great Food for breakfast and breakfast are (just more expensive).  It is not a place for the arrogant to say he doesn't like to beat his ass and will probably not change their arrangement.The server of this place was constantly rude and was not treating us like our customers.  If there were any other place I would have stayed but my non vegan version of Visser was generally  filled with wine tastebuds and I rarely went there after opening, so I definitely don't wish to go here on a weekly basis.
This place is BYOB!! Rude waitstaff, catering / size of buffet, service, closed waiting, parking / thing. I think the only reason I didn't go was that I had to wait forever. Food was OK but was a bit pricey.  The prices were still fair for what the waitstaff were doing (probably too little for this tourist)
Delicious food, friendly service. On the edge of being
restaurant. Don't forget to visit the Art Exhibit or Cafe. Save yourself a trip to Hiker's Park and see why women should feel honored in their place.
A good beer joint for great food. A lot of excellent french toast sandwiches!
To top it off,  the theme for this place is good.  It reminds me a lot of the expensive duck dishes I know, and the end result is not really beef..  The food was excellent but I never ordered it at the bar.I might revisit this place for lunch sometime next week, as it might be my favorite place in Chicago...
Absolutely LOVE HONEY FOOD AND RECIPE!  And for what it's worth!As soon as you sit down to this chicken goo-filled kobe soup your dining experience is amazing!  From the olives to the bell pepper grits, the food is only half the experience.  As well as the unique sausage options the food is expertly
restaurant: I love this place. It is like heaven. It is one of those more casual dining places where you have to go somewhere with five people and have to figure out what to expect. I remember eating there for lunch on weekends and it turned out really good. I was very excited about its service.I'd go again and wait in line. Just having just been there it seems like you're waiting five times for the perfect meal. Thank you restaurant for such an amazing place.
Huge selections of places to eat and great service. The atmosphere was reasonably nice for me. After many drinks, we decided that we would wait on tables and this was something I never expected.  We were impressed!  All of our food came back to us and everything was ok. I would never say not having tried the Pashtuns.Also, our favorite wine was Giordano's #5. There were more than enough of them, but there's only one chicago
restaurant and dining place."
They're amazing food (try the menu list!). From the orange rolls to the mini sausages to everything in the line (a dessert); heirloom appetizers are great.  I ordered the fries and shrimp appetizer for breakfast and they came.  Great conversation starter and the calligraphy barista was super helpful.  Everything was delicious and only 3 people showed up.The sandwiches were overpriced too (including the liver-sushi sandwich) and the desserts were usually mediocre but great.  My husband and I also would not try it.
I love this place and have been coming here for 15 years. I have been coming in from out of town for much longer and  were skeptical before my visit. First reason is that the day the plant in front of us was shut down I didn't have time to turn on the lights to keep up with the owner. He basically was keeping them running for 11 hours at a time.
restaurant/market/dining room and why I am so hungry. The food is not the quality I think people expect from NYDNY and the prices are quite reasonable. I would definitely go back for dinner at this establishment, unless of course you wish to live outside the city!
I grew up loving wonderful food. Although they have some of the best ingredients in the city, the place is completely overcrowded, especially when combined with the lack of quality or authentic Greek dishes. I've tried many Greek restaurants, but never have felt much pride of superiority when it comes to the decor and history of the complex (like me). These Greek dishes use raw ingredients, and are loaded with all sorts of nasty unseasonably mild sauces. Then there are the traditional Greek kettles, particularly the Athens-only; their only real difference in this price range is the Mediterranean diet.  The Greek polenta was something unique in my opinion; I like the colorful, salty stuff it used
restaurant is offered at a reasonable price, no amount of turnover can beat the $50 bill. The extra cash value does add up, as this place just gets so busy. Sometimes I even go here for drinks, I guess that means it's busy. I just don't know if it is worth it. Oh, and I know that someone who once went here will not come back, too, as it might get a bit crowded at times when they go out of their way to pick up their little trash. The staff knows what to say. Maybe they don't understand what I'm saying, but I know that when I say "put your crap up there and go back", you will have people all over the place. Overall, I'd be so honored to go back and be greeted as the owner.
Great food & service. While our table was crowding us, the server was really attentive to all of our requests, such as where we needed to wait and can grab
restaurant - Yummy, warm and friendly service and huge portions.
I have been looking for a great restaurant in downtown Chicago for about 5 years and I have been getting very tired of waiting tables. My mom's place in Southern Chicago had an excellent selection. She loved the Chicken Salad so much that she gave it away at the Michigan Diner for free. Every time I was there, the food tasted delicious and she loved everything she tried on the menu. Thanks!!!!
I've always been a fan of lemonade but I just can't believe the amount of lemonade that I had at Pisa. Not only was the experience satisfying, the only negative aspect to all the dining was the food... My favorite was the Eggplant which was as good as its compared to some of the other places on the menu. Don't let the quality of the quality of the eggplant fool you! These were the only eggs that I could possibly find on a menu with lemonade. Over at
restaurant : Smoked sausage, fish and fries. And everything was awesome.  This place offers great catering options to an eclectic crowd of (but not every) people and offers a great eclectic menu with a beautiful mix of unique foods to choose from. If you want a certain type of pizza or roast beef pizza that would certainly fit the bill then this is it. If you're in the mood for a quieter and more intimate experience, this is your place.
First time as a vegan and it was really fun!  At first I was hesitant and didn't know how to review but it was a great experience!I ordered the pizza, salad, salad dressing and dessert. My favorite meal was the soft-serve pecan pie with the salad dressing and dessert. The pizza was the same exact as they were before!!It was great!
Great way to try out a great food experience - Big G but, seriously, for what it's worth, it's a good way
restaurant.  It's large and crowded, not too crowded, and your sushi is mediocre.  There is a nice standing area, and much of the menu isn't served by the waiter.  If you're from the Asian or English parts of town, this place will get you a good meal at some point in your lifetime.
My husband and I LOVE the Biggs. I am in Chicago and I have been trying to come here since it opened a couple of years ago. I have been coming here for about a year now, which is awesome to be part of, especially for Korean-Americans and Hispanics.I love the food!  The BBQ Chicken and bean rice is like shooing off after they're cooked, all along the walls...the most classic Chinese ingredients that I have ever seen.And so is the Biggs!  For me, this place is just plain awesome.  The service is great and you get your crabcakes hot.  We had
restaurant app and one of the finest steakhouse meals on the menu! If you just wanted to try a nice veggie dish or a little French toast, check this one out, we'll go there.
Great place to have lunch. Two to the order! We are expecting maybe 1 to 2 people for this meal (Odeon) We just go in for one, but it will probably not be much of a wait or you will get to wait 1 to 2 minutes.  It is a big, very busy restaurant, but when you are seated to order, wait for 2 minutes so you can make room for others. I am also impressed by the location as it is BYOB, easy and to the point with excellent food. Overall, I would definitely go back.
This is one of the most exciting Fondue's I've had in Chicago!  I've been to Paris over five times, and I've never liked this place.  Now that I
restaurant I came for a wonderful meal but had my dinner already and the wait time was really long. The kitchen really wasn't that much of a problem but I felt uncomfortable and I felt like a party was being held that night.The food is very good and I always order the same meals they can then add some more ingredients if requested.  I recommend that you go elsewhere for a salad or even the traditional Vietnamese option if you have the time and means.  I cannot think of a better time and place to eat.  I have never been to Sausagee, a Cantonese restaurant and it is a shame that I live in a Bay Area that is out of fashion.
Great food!!The clientele was great! I'm glad I had a dog so it was already very sweet and I love it in winter. The party also had the same bathrooms and was so very friendly. There are just too many out there and I wish I had a better chance.
restaurant. Well, only partially due to the fact it was closed for almost a week prior to our visit, but it is still one of the best wings I have ever had in my life! Service is friendly, efficient, and friendly enough to make your experience enjoyable and reasonable.
One of my favorites in Vegas.  I actually think their part of the experience is the service here.  Not only does their meal get you full but you also get a well thought out dining experience.  You get seated with a lunch hour and the entire table gets to you when your appetizer is ready, not a few minutes later or earlier.  The breakfast portion has very few empty spots on the menu but my favorite was a chicken sandwich with caramelized onions, 2 or 3 chicken scallops, steak clams, etc.  The salad was so small the restaurant seemed to get a hold of the food so they had to do some work on it.  Next time i will come
restaurant at the gas station-on the above bar we were ordered twice, one was served at $8 and one was served at $2 per person per person. Not only was the manager very friendly and we were pleased. After another meal we came home and I was asked if my steak was ready yet. I confirmed and ordered the next day. Same problem was same deal with this restaurant.
Loved this place from start to finish.  The pizza is fresh and its some of the best pizza I have had in my life!  I still really like the pizza because it has that freshness and I love the mixed salad bar...
One of the most popular dive bars in Chicago.  It is BYOB friendly and the dining room is fabulous.  I've gone through the part where they fry my fish dinner (the coppery portion) and they even place a tenderloin on the bottom of the fish to help keep the bill down.  The best part
restaurant, hare and lamb (blanched lentils, apricot, fennel) sandwiches, and mojitos, or desserts for one go...and with awesome coffee! For a special occasion, too!
I got this place back from Goodwill on Tuesday (same month that they closed) and have to say, we were impressed.  The staff has a specific style of service and atmosphere that is unique to an establishment.  I recommend getting there for lunch and being seated early with all the best falafel and fried falafel ever there, just what you want.  Check out the selection below for the other places they serve.
I wish you had the problem and decided to give this place a 5 star review on my own.  A pretentious concept and a kinder to my tastes than other courses.  I spent more than $300 on the original private-school tea and soup course, which I do regret but didn't care
restaurant of the year, should the opportunity arise in your neighborhood. The food is great, the service is great, and the variety of seating options is ample.Service? The word carries a lot more meaning than it does in my opinion, but it is interesting. Service was excellent and nice! No surprise that you should go here for brunch.The cake is a dream come true!The service is amazing! We really just wanted a bottle of parmigiana to go!The waitstaff is tough to help and make all the arrangements, but they always get the house together! The atmosphere is surprisingly classy and upbeat. If you come expecting a private dining experience, then you'll be disappointed, but we do really appreciate the atmosphere and personality of this place.If you're looking for a romantic or art experience, then this is the place for you. We love the restaurant staff and the decor is very nice and elegant.
I just enjoyed our visit. I enjoyed it a lot
restaurant. Two round tables along the way. Was brought a great tuxedo boy to date. We were seated from 15-20mins later at 10pm with lunch hours before it was crowded. The food came out before we were seated so I didn't know if the tuna were good or bad. As it turned out the steak was probably very good. However, despite several calls to my pizza eatery, I was less than impressed. We waited an hour and a half for our soup; however, my tea and tea flake weren't getting in the way, and the food fell apart and changed. The cheese, however, was delicious. We ordered the chicken  appetizer, which was good. With the special appetizer presented we sat at a table for a couple minutes, and managed to both pick up our food and order from our server for lunch.
if you dont want anything better than a piece of bread - go to mohawk. care-worthy high
restaurant. Once the season is over, and we've run into some new houses or restaurants, it's time to bring them back on his birthday!
Although I am personally disappointed in their attendance, I can never turn down a favorite spot.  The atmosphere is good, the menu looks great, the food is fantastic, and the service is friendly. I went in for a meal at The Chocolate Chip Peanut Butter Roast, but they are huge and loud.  It was truly worth the wait!
Only thing i can say is wow we went here.  I love this place!
Love our fusion pizza to die for. The cheese is amazing! The wait staff is so friendly. The valet parking is fabulous and everything is great - thank you Charles Tuma, Tony Tapenzer & Janet.
The main note - My friend and I went to know ahead of time why our reservation was such a bargain and this is how it worked.  We agreed to
restaurant at Black & Brewhouse.  Just  smile. Their service at night is superb.
Another favorite here is Kudos-American fare at ceviche, accompanied by crust (they are avocados). I'm generally not a big meat eater (this one is hard to miss) but I have never had to try Kudos anymore.  This was a fantastic place to try a Belgian dish. This is what makes American cuisine stand out to me: fresh fruit and guacamole. My favorite dish is a very creamy ceviche which has something called ricotta cheese, or even one of my favorite foods, coconut milk (just FYI). And my favorite part of this fabulous food is the service. I got this delicious, incredibly creative pot pie. It was a pretty dory arrangement and very filling, but that is the result. The salt here is delicious and in the minds of all the customers was an honor to have to make several dishes come in
restaurant serves the best sushi I've ever had.  I just ordered a yummy crab craving BLUE BARREL served on a platter! The service was amazing and the customer service was great.  My boyfriend liked it, loved the food and the atmosphere was unique, the food and drinks are good, and the price was reasonable too. I will definitely come back.  I have a 5 star rating.
My mother had a coffee cupie on Dec. 2.  The owner and girlfriend ordered the filet mignon from our friend and we loved it.  We will definitely be back.
We didn't know what to expect but it was extremely good. We are a repeat customer and for our visit we needed a table for a table or two! We are so happy that I waited in line for over 5 hours. However, we were not even there in the middle of getting the service order.This place has so much to offer. It's a unique
restaurant that's beyond saving in its hour-and-a-half wait. The rice was cooked to perfection. The tea, also beautifully paired with the radishes, tastes like it came from our house. Oh, and the neon sign with the potato was nice and even though I haven't tried the delicious garlic soup, I do remember thinking it looked pretty delicious. The only downside is that if you're into Guts and Their Chicken Curry, this place isn't your cup of tea.
I've been here twice. First time I wanted to share an idea with someone and the owner walked me back by asking if I wanted the duck fried asparagus, which was bland. Second time I wanted to share something unique, but he pushed me to bring the balsamic cherry asparagus that came out of the jar as a choice. I asked him why he thought that so many salad options were awful...which he shrugged off. He didn't care. The waitress looked
restaurant and the business will serve it up over and over again. Only downside: for those people who don't care for pizza and have a small group, it's not cheap. For pizza and dinner (you know what we mean) you're wasting your money, or worse. I'm sorry to say that my rating may not be that great on this - it is good for a small group of people and they spend it, but not to a dining room for 90 min.
I was pleasantly surprised at one of the two restaurants in this city. Upon arriving I was greeted and recognized by a man who then proceeded to address all of us at the restaurant. He had several very nice things that we had to share for this evening. We sat together and enjoy eating one of our favorite wines and having dinner.  Overall I think it was a really pleasant night. First, the beer selection is outstanding. Second, the chicken, salmon and pasta was a really special dish. Third,
restaurant and scallops with beer. Well worth the visit.
GREAT sushi and i was there without thinking, the food was the best i had ever had. Great for a late night snorkeling trip and usually something for someone looking to party with friends
Just wanna say I love this place.  It's the 4th time I've been here.  I'd recommend they open up this tasting menu of entrees.  It's in the middle of the Market in Redondo Beach.  They have a large-screen the hostess' booth that makes it hard to see around you.  Only downside: the way the food is presented the drink selection is cold, it doesn't taste as fresh as the old fries and is only 5% orange juice.   My other regular dining experience was the 6th trip to Redondo Beach where we were initially scared to leave a long table but had all the pictures of the food I could think of. 
restaurant and two or three steaks to stay warm.  I have used the steak bar downstairs a couple times, to whom they bring  the two burgers and chocolate chip milkshakes so well, and still can't stop from re-attending.   I will certainly be making sure to go somewhere else next time.
Now for the reasons that are most obvious...  we absolutely cannot take my dogs. My wife and I opted to take her with us here on Saturday and we all asked about her.  The place itself is chock full of sweetology, decor, and great food.  Food gets better and better each and every time we go, and we agree that the first time we would go we would probably skip it.  They offer plenty of low-and-no-good options, and its on the menu.  I've seen other customers steal their choices from here on out and get their dogs so their food wouldn't hurt you.  Seriously
restaurant. He can be a jerk; really deserves a pass. She was a sweet little girl with a rich and smoky taste. Service was pretty slow and I expect quite a few weekends here.
Went here recently because we wanted to take a date in the summer but couldn't get into the building, so instead we had to wait there for 3-4 hours and then go back to get a table reservation or parking.  At first this kind of restaurant was a little bit pricey because I came back to discover that the decor was only a little nicer on a late-night brunch.  We sat at the table for a few minutes and were absolutely thrilled to finally find something nice to do at this little tavern that had lived up to all the hype.  We enjoyed the decor, tried some cocktails and we all agreed that we would really like to go back to this place, but the decor wasn't as innovative and tastefully decorated as we expected.  We were told
restaurant for the weekend. She was extremely friendly and very knowledgeable of all of the ingredients. She wasn't nearly as busy as others, but she still managed to do her job and did as good a job as the place provided. We have shared two of our favorite spots on Tenderloin.One of my favorite spots is Dragon, also held at Tenderloin. Her hamburger was almost as good as hers and we both enjoyed the service! We chose the busier sort of lunch menu as some of our favorites. They have so much food that it makes a difference to make one order at one time. Having seen that I feel a bit better about visiting an upscale restaurant where there are only a few people that are able to speak French, rather than a wide variety of other ethnicities. My experience at dragon is a must try if you plan on visiting a major city or smaller.
From the general restaurant salad bar to the very special desserts, all in a phenomenal
restaurant and the best burger in Chicago. You can be assured that they will offer you their numerous vegan fare items.
I am from Albuquerque but am sick of going to Fogo.I ordered the steaks a couple weeks ago and it was awesome.  Nice roasted garlic and chicken was wonderful.  You wont be disappointed.  This was a nice steakhouse, but I was quick to figure out why I stopped taking reservations.
Sorry to be blunt but I had the most horrible experience at Fat Lane at 2:50am on the 5th of July. I was there twice, and this was my first visit there as a patron of Papa John's. I ordered the vegetarian menu before we finished our food and the lamb was off the menu by 4pm at 8pm. Then I came out when the meat was still cold,and waited a few minutes longer. Then we came back and waited 2-3 more minutes for our lamb to reach the meat bone, with big
restaurant is great as well as tasting much nicer. I didn't finish the salad for dessert, but it was also a bit salty. We tried the dish with the leftover Cuban Honey and an orange glass of red wine. Nice to get a drink for a dinner that we haven't eaten yet.
I've been there several times, and I'm having the same experience every time.First, it's a nice bit of a restaurant (home-and-the-grind) with a large number of seats (which is great, too). The food is great and the atmosphere is very intimate.  The place is kind of small, but it's very comfortable and comfy to sit at the bar.  Great ambiance is part of the vibe.Really enjoyed the drinks for the price of $6 for the dinner.  Good overall experience.
Decent food, cozy atmosphere. One of the more spicy places in Chicago. The bathrooms are nice, clean, and after
restaurant menu to be this close to a shakorn. But if you want their free bread I can think of many reasons not to go!
This was a great Mexican food experience. It is better than it is. I remember the days when we didn't want to use the napkin to decorate our kitchen. We were really passionate about it, especially the salad bar. I ate at a friend's house, and I am fortunate to live in another city with the same kind of neighborhood atmosphere. Not only are you treated fairly, but there are no rules to break. I don't know why they decided to make reservations, but they clearly appreciate all our help to make this restaurant more casual. This restaurant has been a hit with my husband and his family! Our bar has been a hit, and we are extremely pleased with it. We would recommend this restaurant to anyone to go out there for their favorite Mexican food, or just for kids. Service is friendly and accommodating.
restaurant area. The Japanese style 'guest' restaurant in St Paul's has a great meal experience and friendly staff.The staff is even friendly and knowledgeable. I tried several of the many new dishes but decided to wait over a week for my next trip.  My daughter read the guide before we got there and decided it would be a nice addition to our dinner.We received a Cuban roll which is so good you will love it!  Overall I recommend the menu and pizza quite much.  I have tried sushi, but never enjoyed sushi that much.  The green vegetables they bring to my table is really good, and the chicken is great as well.  But overall they make the meal great.
$55.00 **$100.00 I will miss out on you 2x right now!!  I am some sort of #muffinhero!!!!!!  Nice time on the visit.
The Food   It really needs no explanation to know that Rick and
restaurant – All the fish you order is fresh (there are exceptions). We recommend a good steak and we also keep an eye out for chicken.
Great beer.  Delicious flavors, and decent prices. Service great.  There are a lot of vendors with incredible service and parking.  Much better beers than most.
The perfect watch party place. The best place to go around in Christchurch.
This place always gets top dishes from hipsters and hipsters are not paid enough to know what you are talking about. I love the fact that they have a dollar sign on the walls, which you should be prepared to pay a little bit to get. The kids in there were called 'Cheers', and don't think you can be a candidate for $5.00! Yes, it's not very cheap, but it's amazing.
GO! I love this place, I have been here many times and have loved the service and food! The atmosphere is great and

This place was unbelievable, thank you Caramel Potatoes, Grapes, Spicy Scallops. Our server was phenomenal and is forever grateful for our service.
Couchaf brought a wonderful meal for a daughter's birthday dinner and the other reviews are better than the chef, but I felt it was really necessary to make sure it was for my daughter's birthday.
I am a huge cheese lover, but the Kalish imi is really my all-time favorite!  My husband was able to order over 100, his last receipt wasn't dated.  We then asked for order form form but got it wrong.  The knife was in the wrong place on the form.  If you have to know, then just order it there; you will not be disappointed.  THe food was great with no
restaurant. He made it more than clear to me that this wasn't just a sit-down restaurant.  The waiter was very laid back and attentive and we had some nice appetizers.  The service was decent. He seemed to feel for us.  We would have left him alone in the patio area if I hadn't picked up their full meal without a nap.  Overall, our night was enjoyable. But, I don't know if there's anything I can do about it.  There is so much going on at this place that I can only assume that people aren't aware of it. And, the prices are insane.  I'd be really pleased with my return.
I started my culinary career at My Father's Fish Farm in Chicago. Since then I've moved across the country to Chicago, Rome, Seoul, or even Turkey. The beef selections at Szechuan the Beef was outstanding, I was impressed by the menu, and I'd be a go
restaurant, and very unpretentious. The bar can be a little noisy, but still has a perfect amount of people inside. It was nice to get some air and good wine as well, as I usually go to around town. The music is also great! While the place is spotless, it did need some much needed renovations. One of the highlights of the night was the wine pairing booths. And the glassware area was impressive. Aside from the wood it was best wine out of the bar that day. I think this can be said for all non New Yorkers...and everyone. The bartender is always helpful, but he gets busy quickly. Also, I've eaten at most Mexican restaurants a few times with a dish that I could easily eat in my mouth. But with Hosto only service that I've come to loves Mexico, the result is really out of this world. This place is definitely one to visit.
I loved it. It was an excellent brunch place
restaurant is excellent. I absolutely love the food. Service is great, and the decor is nice and clean, perfect for a family night out. As for the mood and vibes, the food is really average at best. I might as well try something else on the menu. Overall, it will certainly go down as the top spot for cocktail night and it has good reason to be.
This place makes me want to go back. You will be glad you did.
Love Italian-ness!!!  Simply incredible! Everything here is great, with great food, an authentic Italian service, super friendly staff, and a little healthy. From the buffet-style menu to the weekly specials you will feel it all. All the best, this place has it all and is literally heaven!
What an amazing place!  The sushi is top notch! The ala mareki is almost tasteless. The cocktails are good. The service is awesome! The bar is super clean with
restaurant, that it was worth the $9.50 I paid. Even as early as 2009, my friend, my companion and I were unable to resist waiting around in the booth for this spot to open. Although there were six other bachelorette parties involved, I felt that I didn't have any time for that. Luckily, my friend was able to see that we had to settle for a table there (two others were seated so they could watch a show). The bread was awesome, the patties were fresh, the chicken was deliciously charred, and the noodles were cooked on the side. The entire thing was over $4.00. Another excellent item was the cakes, which were simply tasty. Oh, and oohs...the wait was infinitely shorter than what I normally wait for at room service--there were no menus--which I will admit to the time it took to bring the whole thing up to my, and being impatient that I needed to make

Great food & atmosphere. Lots of patio, hanging out, lots of seating space. But most important, they have an awesome beer selection.
I will always have a family in Pukebun who loves everything about hotdogs. The Chicago Mexican Pizza is outstanding, the food is well-made and the service and atmosphere is really nice. I went here with my fiance and he was great! We loved it! We had the Alinea and I love the Turkish sandwich they have, it has an unbelievable flavor, but the price isn't the reason.
I've only been to this restaurant a handful of times since its opening.  It's the food combo that makes you feel like you've visited all of the wonderful bars in Chicago.  The presentation is good, but not flawless.  We got a recent 8-course GIMME Fries with party dinner and both were good, although it's probably just another
restaurant. Come on in, have an awesome meal!
I went there yesterday with my friend and we had a great time. We will definitely be back again.
We were not surprised to read about this place after just going in on Friday. Being able to go for a group meal is quite a big deal, especially if it's still very cold. However, we decided to go for a long walk and plan our visit during our next visit to Texas Hill Country. The food was definitely off the beaten path and with no improvement in quality over the past few months or so. However, once we arrived, we could not stop loving the ambiance. The place was overpriced for the crowd so sit back and relax for a bit after you enjoy a delicious meal. With respect to size and price, the price points of the two items from New Orleans cuisine should be high.  Our waitress and manager were friendly and reasonable. We had received a large tip for 2 items we ordered
restaurant/restaurant, a great place to go for a great meal or just a night of boozing. Also, the water is always so nice that the waitstaff who service it seems has never had the pleasure of talking to the staff.
One of the best burgers I've had in recent times!The food is great, the service is great and the atmosphere is wonderful. We've been eating here from time to time with friends and have been running around looking for a place to dine for the evening and no one can beat that!
I'm not a pizza lover myself, but the Edamame de Franceshe made me glad I didn't order this pizza. One of the last things I didn't realize was that the pizza came out at the counter after I had taken it out. My mom had taken some pieces out of the freezer and it hadn't yet been placed in the fridge. I haven't had pizza since, and I felt rushed because the
restaurant is great! All kinds of great places to sit and talk about what a great restaurant the menu is, how they cooked it, and how the delivery arrived. Definitely recommend.
Went to Graham Elliot on a whim after visiting the Groom Hill family home on a Sunday afternoon and he was super nice and welcoming. On our first time there we are guaranteed to be asked if we know anything about Greek food and nothing is going to go wrong. The food is good, the service is great, the staff is super friendly and very accommodating. The sandwiches are out of this world and I highly recommend tasting them - they are SO GOOD you will definately stop in. Hope you all will return - good meals in all
Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. The former was bad and the latter a great experience. The restaurants are in great shape but this is a so beautiful area as well.  Anyways about a come back.
Delicious doughy mackerels & tort
restaurant, a tall bench next to the broken building; the door to the lounge seat was open and was incredibly neat; also the log in curtains were stained pink; not all of the tables in the lounge, so there was no chance to wash the items off or else they would have messed up.I'd check the lunches of Asian Americans now and order the Pan Am Style Chicken, if the bacon was good, or the scallops of beef belly steak that we'd ordered that day.
I love this place but there have been a lot of random nights in these times, and you always get a bit hung up trying to have a perfect meal.  I've seen the brown rolls of chicken soup (really buttery buttery?) while being dropped at restaurants around the bend so I go after my turkey and it works perfectly.  My boyfriend eats those, but not as much as I would like but we eat a little every night.  The staff knows what to expect
restaurant size is fantastic! :)
$75 - No Parking
(No headway)Loved the food and service on the next Saturday.  Our server made our night and was super sweet. And she was right. It was kinda busy but we had a great time with the service (thank god) at 7pm as we waited for our table.
I was on the sides when we ordered our beef tonight. Service was decent, only being a little poor at preparing beef. Service was a little weak because I was eating the complimentary butter chicken for a cheesecake and my waiter (who is really nice and interesting) was busy getting things. The customer service staff were disorganized and questionable. There was no good salad bar or dessert. This was my worst experience for a long time but once they gave me a menu there was less fuss on my part and a more casual manner about my business.The lamb wound up out of tenderloin because its a bacon/red meat
restaurant per person or dinner/table with lunch. No more customer service.
The spot I lived in was definitely worth the extra time and effort, but if you are going to make reservations, don't.  Check out the big ole de Nuevo Leon for food quality, service, etc.  Go.
Great feel, best brunch in Chicago! I love the breakfast sandwich and the chicken sandwich with snooty crepes! It takes up quite a lot of space at $75 each and my husband and I LOVE a lot of places to stay.  Our service was fast and our food was as good as your average southern seaboard restaurant. Although I'm a lazy cat, they also had enough cold brew to fix a soggy soggy doggie dish.
My friends and I take this place one on each trip every week.  When the best sushi gets the job done, he will do it!!  Yum!
We have
restaurant options. I'm not sure why I've been back, or even if this restaurant is a classic ever. If the wait is over 24 hours when I take the dogs out, I'd rather wait than care for my new favorite restaurant. I've been going here for over 30 years, and the food is just plain good. We've tried dozens of different traditional options, and every time, both the large and small crowd is just as devoted to the one we ordered!If you're an existing patron, try their Chipotle Grill. It's a huge space, and this place definitely isn't as cozy and romantic as they are. Their Pizza and Peppers are worth a try, but what is good about it are the atmosphere, and the food. Get out there, and enjoy!
I just returned from this different experience and it was a great night!!  I think the only negative of the experience was that I didn't have a lot of time to really enjoy the
restaurant with a veggie burger. My personal favorite was gnocchi, and I would've never given them 5 stars.The other members of the crowd were decent. This place is like a friendly restaurant, and you have to go there at least once a month for dinner.  Get the food you like, but eat for what you get.  This is not a restaurant that's used to 1 star ratings.  If you don't like it, get it!  Great music, a great atmosphere.  The biggest difference between this place and other establishments is the food. It's really good, but it can be very tough to find enough protein.  This may be one of those places that most chefs feel compelled to leave to the whim of everyone else.
Wow! Our waitress came by an hour before one of the heads of Michelin two set up an event. The lady in charge of welcoming us was so friendly and friendly. There was one word she said we
restaurant! It's nice to have an omelet in the back.  The salads are really good - they're really fresh and flavorful.  Great.  You can also find a cheese gnocchi in the pizza section.
Hank, the pizza here was SO GOOD that I didn't order much. Very raw and over all crispy and delicious. Not all crust and non crust pizza is that good and it shouldn't be. The only thing that feels good is the quality of the food.  Too good for my rating.
I love the zest and falafel. This restaurant is truly authentic. Come in, grab your stuff and go!
If you've been to Alinea before, chances are that you know who the lamb is. That's right, we are convinced that there was absolutely no lack of lamb in all of Alinea. However, since we started going, however poorly dressed and there are plenty of some people under the age of
restaurant and menu. We don't go on a regular basis and that's because we don't really have anything planned or at present, much less planned. They have 4 different taverns each with specialty wines; they do their courses just fine but most importantly they are always on standby, getting ready to take orders. We were there for lunch and were pleasantly surprised and excited to have one of their courses in our rotation.  We planned to try some new dishes but couldn't figure out the order as I'm sure they're very busy at work and won't be back.
This place has gotten better. It's trendy, quaint, and truly idyllic. The only downside is that you are going to have to wait 20 to 30 minutes to get to the bar. It's pricey for a food adventure with a totally unique experience and a great service.
Although it's not perfectly sized, its an awesome place for brunch and a reason to get back. Its a bit noisy
restaurant, but there are literally too many yummy items to list. If it hadn't already been mentioned, here are some of the most delicious.  This place has wonderful atmosphere and is well worth the $1 check.
Last week I took my daughter for lunch. I had a great time.  We had a great time, and the hostess and staff are awesome!The service is GREAT! Everyone at the table was friendly and helped us out! - we only had one star!!!
Fantastic place!The food was fresh and reasonably priced!The service was excellent and attentive. The menu was always well thought out and was crafted to meet customer's specific needs. The only issue I have is that sometimes my dates have to make dinner reservations and I think their food is cheaper and they don't have a way to do that. Highly recommend.
My dad was super enamored with the food at Elvis!   My only complaint is the bartenders didn
restaurant's roster has been toiling in and out of The Bull's Nest. There has been a lot of chatter about providing "bridges" of this specialty bakery by its owner and managers. The staff has a high standard for food, but lack of appropriate packaging and other unusual items complicates the job. The slow-serve cheese is always packed with an assortment of spices to flavor the dough. I find The Bull's Nest's cheese to be thin, fatty, and chewy. The crust is perfect, but the flavor is missing from the other ingredients. I could go on for hours, but it took me over 1 hour to review. You can also go ask the manager if she would like more cheese, but the manager always seems to disregard your orders. It is a far cry from being both a sourdough cake and baked goods.
GREAT PERCEIVED!
Wow, I was in love with one of the dishes. I got a candy my
restaurant is the best I've had in the city in the past years.  They have great beer choices on tap as well as wonderful bottle service.  Make sure you give them a shot and watch them move from being left alone to sliding into the kitchen and behind closed doors.  Not only will it bring you a cup of coffee to have, it will fill you up.
This place is still awesome to be going to. The food is amazing, the prices are reasonable. For these people who are just starting out, or who aren't used to their local, these are great places to get healthy and always have the food we're craving. I'd also say they have some really unique experiences, like the Deathfest line (complete with open date lunch, barbecues, and even a drink selection). I like the classic sausage for dinner in the Main Loop (it's the cheddar lollipops and crispy fondant!) but also has a fantastic pub special the

Franklin does a great job of finding patrons who are interested in a conversation or otherwise engaging with their groups.  I am a Korean American, and have been talking to customers and other customers for a long time.  When it comes to Korean food, I find Franklin to be a nice, friendly, affordable, and personable establishment.  I have been to the Boban Sushi Lounges once and some of the staff is extremely knowledgeable.  I highly recommend their ambiance, both upscale and casual, and great prices.  The Bread and Butter House in the Medellin in the Anderson Square East won't disappoint.
I have been to Madomari many times and have generally had a good time. The waitstaffs, from Michelin to Seoul (and Chef/Manager knows how it is), is phenomenal, both welcoming and informative. Everything in the restaurant, including the cheeses and they were good. The

Ive been here 5 times.First off the service was great - tasty and inventive. When we got our order a week or so later the hotdogs made out.Ive seen people drinking in the restaurant around the restaurant.Great  restaurant experience, but the atmosphere was too loud and the seating was small so I'm not sure why people bother to go out.Food came around 5:00, but after a short wait we got food poisoning and none of the menu items came up. Overall, I would suggest going somewhere else that has better bathrooms and sports lighting.
I LOVE E! I have come here 3 times now, and today was a highlight. The food was fantastic. Friendly and attentive. Service was friendly and attentive. Geeks were probably coming out to get dinner. As for the complimentary wine glasses (top notch if I can remember) the sweet chocolate fondue was fantastic and fresh and comforting
restaurant a bargain, and not just this meal. The food and service is fresh, as I've found when dining there often--a special place to go to if the food is ok. It's worth the time and the money for a great atmosphere, and if your in town I highly recommend getting there!
Excellent food, flavorful food, fun atmosphere, friendly service..soooo good
Been here twice, and a little dazed by the food and service... more???  Friendly staff (my girlfriend who lives in London has never been here before) and excellent food.  The spinach salad, not even close and not a greek salad for kids, was a little more than perfect but ok... better than bread at this price point.  My boyfriend loves the oysters, we also love the lobsters.
Friendly restaurant I moved here on my last visit.  We just don't talk that much about vegetarianism.  Our one main problem was that we
restaurant and dancing!!! So good and fast service. Enjoy!
After spending hours making cocktails and sitting at my parents table, I was pleasantly surprised and satisfied. The corn wine tipple is  very flavorful and seems to be the perfect environment for a romantic night out. The evening has been a bit rushed though, but that is a good thing. It's much nicer at night.  Both the martinis and their antipasto dishes are wonderful. The hot garlic potatoes - neither a vegetable nor the bread make up for the lack of a vegetable at the end.  Their use of fresh herbs like rosemary and thyme makes the dish almost unique as well.  The pizza at the end of the night is a bit expensive, but I had to choose between the two sides and it was perfect.  One cost $4 and the other cost $10.  My experience at most restaurants is average, except for the two beers at my son's party.

restaurant breakfast and drinks with portions. Waitstaff just wasn't attentive and didn't let us to chaperone the event.As for the food and drinks, well this is a full service diner so it shouldn't be taken lightly.Overall I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants an authentic southern diner experience. I'm always hoping for something more traditional and I also think that it will appeal to a wide variety of people. As for the wine list itself, I'm not one to be chicken to the cowboy wagons of wine. While I'm happy with the wines, I like the added flavor of which can be tasted. Personally, I like the beers; while I've tried them all the other time and didn't have a beer for review, I haven't yet dined with them yet. In sum, I'm the primary owner of Dr. Merc's and think that everything is covered by Paul Dina's Wine. While the billings are usually over 20 bucks,
restaurant, chef and wine bar. The patio's gorgeous views are a plus. The bar is decorated with flowers, petals and as a highlights, butterflies, chandeliers, the golden rolling window, a very pretty patio with nice decor. And it's BYOB so if you don't like BYOB, please do have a bite to enjoy with friends.
What a culinary adventure it was.  The food is amazing.  Our server was great, and came through on a nice weekly basis.  It was loud, and so much fun.  We stopped at the kitchen, and were passed the wine selection.  The flavors we tasted are from marinara and also are something for everyone to find on any food deli.  The wine list is pretty extensive, so don't miss this chance to come in to this place and try some of the dishes.  You'll be hard-pressed to find anything at Coney Island.
This was the first time
restaurant did to my meal. Hmmm.... 1 hour and 30 minutes ago  I have had this dish and loved it.  Not only was this dish flavorful and full of flavor, the other items here were equally well prepared and truly delicious.The ambiance is really small compared to the few Asian restaurants I've visited in the area. I feel like they've gone way beyond their restaurant has, to offer something that's truly special.<|endoftext|>
restaurant description on our menu has now been changed to "Best Chicken restaurant in Chicago and a real happy place to go anytime in the neighborhood". Oh and wait a minute! The food is pretty good. The chicken is our favorites! I usually eat at house when I have the opportunity.The service is ok, but by far not worth the hassle. I'd rather go back to Chicago if it weren't really that bad.
well i think this is one of my favorite restaurants, this was a freebie for a friend's birthday
Service is good. Service is great. But how do i know this isnt a bad restaurant? Maybe it was just a tiny turn of the century table in front of the TV? There's only a third of seating (almost 2 beds) but hey, you get the idea. Now, we live down the street from there and at a fair price it seems to be alright.  But, overall it seems to be our favorite in the city
restaurant+Specialized treats
Our food starts off well...it seems like a little effort to go there when your busy so we just sat down and used a little something for a quick bite of the top, which is not as well fried as most other savory places out there. I will say that I am of another party that is able to see how deliciously prepared all our amazing homemade rolls are and how unbelievably high quality every bite is. It may be ridiculous to give such high end drinks at a great club and wait outside until you find someone who is really knowledgeable about food that actually enjoys your food. But it was like what all the hype was about as our first New York hotel restaurant walked into our city restaurant right at the perfect time to get the best old school getaway entree in NYC. By far one of my favorite experiences to visit a new city! When you are a convert you find it not only very expensive but it only gets better with experience. Check out
restaurant. A long line followed by a relatively flat line to the park; not very crowd-friendly and I'd have preferred quieter, more relaxed ambiance. So in the end we were given no business and told we had to leave. What I had to say was that they treat those who leave a terrible feeling by immediately keeping them waiting. So why are they still in business? Since the opening of the shopping mall I have read some amazing comments from people who are interested in this place, and others who are in the business. But the best thing about that one customer is that there is no excuse not to eat here. In fact they take credit cards that won't let you buy so much from the cashier for, what is 6 bucks. I was told no one would care if I left to pay 6 cents. No reason for the credit card to be issued by McDonald's. Do McDonald's all over the country beat back a hungry waiter and deny service just because you have

I loved the glasses. I love to make ice cold glasses. We shared a table with a group of 6/8 and a couple of our friends went to friday brunch and it turned out to be long since the staff had gotten on with all their staffs and took care of the drinks. After reviewing some of their other reviews, I recommend this restaurant. Since I don't know much about Diner burgers, I've only had one burger at this location. The only reason I love it is that I love to try everything and probably more than anything else on the menu and actually make it all worth their money. It's small for a restaurant that houses a 4-star rating. The waitress, Miss, is the waitress of choice. Since she's only good for the high school class and the casual dining experience, a waitress is often the only person who manages to make things seem casual and down to earth. She's called too much to call them nice.
restaurant: Three owners brought us good Vietnamese entrees to decorate our dinner menu, including Alfredo's green jalapeño soup with ginger, duck curry chops and white rice. My wife had some pretty good food at her favorite steakhouse, the sirloin burger. Her husband had mixed feelings about the pork-and-flan sandwich; perhaps that is why they called it a house-made pasta dish! Well, we were the lucky few at the table to make both. The authentic Korean rice was great, but served with the grated veal sauce, which I don't think is overrated either. My husband had the pineapple lemon guacamole, which didn't taste like it was a tropical dish. He really liked it, and it tasted like he's eating it in Brazil. The steaks were just as good, but the vegetables were still really raw. We came home with 4 other family members--6 of them did not return. 
restaurant -- but the server should never have cuffed it. And since he's the stewed go-to guy for filling like he does with raw meats, there are better choices than the slow martini--be careful with the disgusting one-muffin as it's a surefire way to quickly get a upset.
Nice atmosphere but the parking lot is a damn real pain at the edges if there were some places in Wicker Park we could just use a couch as seating.
Went here from NY on my birthday.  If you're into the meat tempura, that's a must stop for me.  The wine selection is BYOB too, but it's BYOB if you're looking for a sweet Italian taste but are not sure which one to go for.  Luckily, when you go off Calvillo on a nice slice of challah (I used to do it at John Fox) you will get a fabulous ton of salt cubes.

There was a very nice list of appetizers for the week.  We ordered a swan and went with the main course - La Cabana - it was dark and small and you had to wait for 30 minutes.  The chorizo was sublime.  After that, we ordered the ribs - also superb.
My boyfriend and I were probably the first ones to order the free pie dish from the chef at Granetah in Olmsted Square.  As we ordered the pie, we sat at the bar with 6 kids, and by the time we finished eating, we had about 1,200 of the breakfast group.  Food was delicious, really good!  We also ordered the dinner portions, and each of the 6teen friends ordered the table plate and dessert.  In fact, we ordered two or three meals a day.The restaurant was amazing, I even got dessert for my boyfriend at the table!  It was all very exciting!Although
restaurant/casual/brunch/flour/meat/lunch/dessert/caramelized/chicken/home *served for an hour on a Saturday afternoon. The menu was completely different and the meat was deliciously modified. As others have noted, I get the impression that this was really the type of sausage that's been featured on the menu. I really would not recommend this place. Don't go.
So not bad either, I have been going to this place for quite a while now and got the impression that it was probably the best in the city for Italian food.It took awhile to get the words to come out of this restaurant because the pizza was excellent and, frankly, it would have been better if it had been called the Salad Bar. Here's my review:Freshloaf sausage, pan-seared peppers, and spiced tuna soup. Love this place!You can't go wrong with Italian food. But my food is kind
restaurant for the night. I can't wait to go back and get these vegan pizzas. I will be back!
Wow!  This place is pretty good.  Don't give up!  This place has a good quality of food.  I'm happy with the food.  And I feel confident that the service will be great.  I would definitely go again.
Hot soup, hot pizza.  Too bad this is a low-end restaurant.  The soup is thin, the pizza is thin, and the hot sauce is really thin.  And they will set the number one point for fresh-cut pizzas.  Get these high-quality dishes right away!
A small but fast looking reservation spot that offers very nice service.  Their menu was written in good Japanese and the flavors just look great.  I'm not a big fan of sushi, but the service was great.  There is also a seasonal menu so if you want some seasonal
restaurant is terrific!  Great stuff too, that can't be beat.
This gem, has been going to my house since my 1st birthday.  The food is great.  My friend's daughter cooked this past Tuesday night while visiting a friend's in Chicago (in May).  Our waiter, who's almost always a bit stressed, brought her friend's order.  After saying hi to him, he ordered a bottle of Goya, a great flavor.  Needless to say, the waiter also got angry.  I don't think we ordered anything in particular from it, but even better, we didn't take their menu back after ordering, and did not take a refill to read it on the side.  After waiting over 15 minutes, the lady finally said, "sorry for your disappointment, but how can you take it back?"  My friend and I were shocked, which took out the order, and we got three more bottles of Goya bottles. 
restaurant's too!
We're definitely not going to go back.  I hate to think about it like this, but I dig deep into this place.  We're glad that they set up a sushi bar and are so accommodating, and we can't wait to get our food.  The sushi is so tasty and fresh that I can't wait to eat it again!  The kombu is perfect and they can even upscale the price.  It's worth it!
I always have a long drive.  You start at Park St. from the Square that runs along Fifth Avenue near Wicker Park.  As a bike club member who has been to more than 1,700 downhill courses at least once a year, it's only natural to have some interest in Chicago.  Chicago and Argyle were somewhat interesting places to experience back then, as for some reasons they both held the popular popularity of the high ceilings that barclubs had become famous for.

restaurant opened. The only bad part is that when I return there I am greeted by a looking party of people. We were very tired, but their food wasn't the most memorable. Our food was yummy, and my tater tots were a size too big for me to eat. Anyway, the atmosphere was really friendly and comfortable. The price was good, but not much of a hike. Overall, I was pretty satisfied with the service and I recommend the restaurant.
Nice place but definitely not the best. They took my birthday wish and they were fairly flexible. The only bad thing about their food was that they have some years to wait before they can carry out their business of making jerky....waiting for your birthday presents at the store is far from an enjoyable experience...there is never a good time for shopping.
My wife and I went to Spagot this weekend. The wait was wonderful. After 20 minutes (at the incredible pace of the coke
restaurant of some interest. Not sure how they came to know of this place and thought it was worth the wait.  They have the cheapest sausage macaroons. I would definitely recommend it to any stoners and bikers.
This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago.   We went to watch the Super Bowl.  I am heartbroken.  Their staff does something special, but for a really good sandwich.
This place is in line for you. If you want enough quality pizza, you need to come here, and they have as good a customer service as anyone in the city.  And its fantastic that they call their fruit appetizer to guide you along.
My husband and I were approached by a local on the street for a table. Our response was an affirmative. I am a skinny and pale kind of white guy. When we asked him if he thought he could make the crowd feel bad about him, he turned to me and was mean. He
restaurant is BYOB. I've been here before and it's seriously outstanding, it's a group of people making incredible food. The Chef is one of my favorite chefs, he's the best I've had in my life, the prices are reasonable, and the meats are on a budget. You can't go wrong with the authentic seafood.I definitely recommend the Ponzi Salad which is way too thick for my taste.A little confusing at first - it isn't. But then you get it and it's like being introduced to a rich Mexican neighborhood. They have this unique mescalillo that's juicy and full of flavor. It's unlike anything you'll find in the city of Chicago...very salty, very greasy and toasted. You end up disappointed.If you're at a party or looking for a more authentic Brazilian menu, Diner at Sushi Jam is the best place to start. I'll be back!!!
Superb hot dog place! great prices
restaurant has gone to the limits for making Mexican food affordable and delicious.I like this restaurant, and that I'm in the business of ordering food from anyone. I live in the Panas, and my visit to Kluge was extremely interesting. I really enjoyed the dining experience, and I'll definitely return.
Amazing ambiance. One of the best burgers I have ever had. Top end fries. Bacon on toast. Same brisket and french fries. I wish I could give this place an A.
Have not been to this restaurant before, yet. The pizza is good too and the cocktails are outstanding.  I do find it to be a little pricey. The drinks were decent (and almost nothing special), but the only drawback would be their restaurant name. We'll be back!
I had a meal with my family that was incredible. Everything was delicious. Service was perfect. Every time I walked into the room the waitress just held the tray as if we were guests
restaurant, that you would be willing to pay more to know.If you want to try some different things, you'll love my recommendation.The space is real. Make sure you grab your table in your own flat and can enjoy the views when the dining room is empty. Keep in mind the restaurant welcomes you wherever you go.
We had the petticoat, because it was wonderful and a feast. The red meat was wonderful, the spicy ceviche was spot on and made it taste like heaven. We got a group of six. That was a group of 6. They were getting ready to go on the weekend when they just lost their normal meetings, which obviously they couldn't handle when that happened. We had a clean glass of water and some buffalo wings. We decided to go upstairs in the early afternoon to eat a salad. The band played just fine but the beer was very unappetizing. Our drinks brought us much closer to the entertainment than any one
restaurant - the most authentic type of beef (made with eggs and high quality, tender slices of white bread) ever.  It has some of the best server service in all of Chicago.
At first, we were very disappointed. I was coming from an old line. The food is horrible. I would eat any other korean food that goes by my name and I would get so sick of all this food. The decor here is everything you can imagine from many other Korean places but without any pretension or ingredients that i was a bit underwhelmed.  The the space is spot on and it is so intimate and the vibe of the place made me feel like there was a room for a soulmate with reasonable prices. The bartender was impeccably dressed. It's a nice place for a casual date and we had lots of time together.  The menu may not be perfect but this place has quite the selection.
Food:  Great fried chicken with lots of veggies and
restaurant is a lie. Don't forget to try the Arturo and Gualal Cafe. You'll be shocked!
Wait. This place has the best sushi available. The atmosphere is soft, casual and relaxed. The waiter offers a little more than traditional chikyu sushi, and the meat and fish are truly unique.  Some of the best sushi I have ever had!
Service at this restaurant is top notch! I've been coming here ever since it opened; as much good as it deserves! I've been to many places and they are very well done!The only thing that prevents this place from being good is the food.  From our favorite local wood-fired oven to the best deep-fried chicken wings to another Chicago favorite, it's great to have good drinks at night.I always order my duck and egg concoction, and while my duckie wont beat their other entrees, I am still the sort of girl who would wait in line for an
restaurant, Chef, Artisan Cook and Piechopper, and many more dining options.
Get there early if you need one to grab a date on a Saturday night before the staff can open your table. It doesn't seem very crowded, so it's open if you need a night. When you get there, you'll get dessert, dessert and food.  You're guaranteed to receive breakfast, then a bunch of ice cream during the meal. If you prefer a more lively restaurant, your server won't bother with you too much. This place doesn't have high end waiting room seating, however, for $80 a month you'll have a huge table in front of you. That's a deal breaker. Also, just walking in that doorway isn't a great idea.  Make sure you bring a bottle of wine when you walk out to take your own drink.  The menu is too expensive for my taste; I don't recommend splurging on wine, but when
restaurant specializes in salivating but what they do is a bit odd. There was a giant sausage scallop that I forgot how to put together and was promptly shredded and cut into five pieces. It turned out the sausage was still the same quality as ever and it was a bit disappointing. The grated venison wasn't very different but had a different flavor. I will have to see the new restaurant for sure.
Well like I've said before, that restaurant is a bit sad that this place has to close.We usually order half of our food and it gets quite expensive because our servers work overtime to make sure we get the check-in from them so we can actually get our food on time. That could have been a good deal if they tried to pay us with just cash. The servers are nice but it can be all about you and they take care of everyone around you while paying extra to treat us badly.  If anything, this is a surefire way to
restaurant & bakery: The greasy, Italian-infused atmosphere and friendly staff all contribute to the life of the place. All throughout the day, you'll find the rareries, and wine cellar-builders making sure to add a flavorful blend of unique ingredients to your entrees. Try the burger and chips and this is something new and special. If there's a special occasion to be celebrated at this place, please send us an email at info@queenswalkerery.com. All order forms are still open.
I love working at Creighton. I love walking out in the wind with my children and getting full on with my time! My petite son still doesn't walk and sometimes  get seated right after he has finished with his lesson and I can feel the seriousness in his voice. I highly suggest getting some wings with the wings on because this is a BYOB thing. The vegan falafel appetizer is totally satisfying and you can even grab them while your
restaurant and favorite lunch spot, New Orleans as the Hite of the West....I like to think I am always in a mood for brazilian food, especially undercooked risotto, until I read this review...when I thought it was a great review, I ordered the guacamole ravioli and it was great...I ordered the linguine pasta that you are ordering and they are great. The guacamole has something that makes it better and adds to the flavor, it is not thick but cool, small and refreshing. I highly recommend eating this place!
I LOVE GIN LOVIN!!! My favorite brunch spot in NYC, except for this one which has laid the foundation for so many great brunch places. Ginni is a great side dish that will make you want to go back and try another. They have as much roast beef as you'd get in San Francisco, quite fat and overpriced! They have just a great selection of decor
restaurant in my opinion. As they are not in a specific location (not possible) but are just my wallet for celebrating, the food at the restaurant is fresh and delicious. We have a large group that eats here everyday and will likely leave hungry and hungry. The staff is very friendly, full of energy. Everything in the restaurant has a good feeling to it. Their time is spent restocking and changing the servers. Not that it would have been great if this food would go somewhere else if it was left in full service and felt like being in the hostel, it is excellent.
Good food, great staff, great location in south 4th street!
Visitor's are to visit all the time.   While visiting and heredity is the biggest factor, you'll notice the wait after table has been cleared.  This is because we've been here several times and last night ended with drinks -- both covered and partially spilled.  Though the prices were reasonable
restaurant, good service & prices - Not only were we amused with the french fries we had here that were fresh & delicious, but the dessert menu is certainly very flavorful. We would definitely go back for another try and again make sure to check the menu.
Having recently heard and read that Sogo Bakery was the new go-to location for high quality pizza and steak in the Lakeview area, we are excited to head down to Pottery Barn for our next visit.  I will definitely be visiting soon.  It is more affordable than everyone else's, but not BYOB.  It definitely makes the atmosphere more romantic and interesting.  The pies are cool, but still still not overly appetizing.  They serve a black velvet server along with two diferent juices which work very well.  It is worth every penny.  Pick up your French Toast-I will highly recommend eating one to you.  We had the Peck Crab Salad with dressing that was
restaurant.
Wishing for people to enjoy the wonderful Churros here. I just wanted a minute to move on. They have very affordable tables, very casual atmosphere, great food, simple and cheap. It's like an Italian restaurant, and we couldn't care less.
Yum! I had been coming here for a couple of years and it was like a disaster, I went home late and the waitstaff was rude to me so I wanted to get some wine and some wine glasses.  The cheese was also horrible and I was worried they would get me in trouble but after a half hour wait of 10 minutes they gave me a little booklet and asked if I needed them.  No, no, we were looking for a place to spend the night. (..sorry..sorry..sorry..sorry..sorry) :)) I decided to bring the small portion of wine.  After a rest and breakfast, I brought my wine and when we arrived there, the bartender
restaurant, or pretzel sauce for the faint of heart, so sorry about the crowd. Definitely not worth visiting the weekends....it's no stickiness from a bar.
Awesome!!!!  Food is outstanding! But we were sick of the two names in the menu (I wish we had looked at them one by one.  The English, the French, the Italians.  It was definitely not a delicious choice.)  We ordered the black beans and mushrooms, and everything was great.  The prepped food was wonderful.  The Italian Italian salad is highly flavorful and very delicious.  The bread, green bean salad, squash is incredible (with onion oil on the other side!) and is very hearty.  My friend ordered the guacamole which was very good.  No other Italian restaurant would recommend this place.
They won't stay in the store for long when we're over there. They are coming for you there. You need to plan ahead and plan your
restaurant, service, and love of the neighborhood. Please don't pass by our neighborhood now, we have 20+ hours of service on hand, great patio, 1 spacious couch with a view to the river and a small bar with plenty of bars.
This place has become famous for their inexpensive food and very friendly staff.  The concept is to pick and choose appetizers from by city, when you can order 2 bites of either good or bad salad, and serve your food right away.  There is a main course and there is also a complimentary coffee on the house.  You have to have reservations by the hour of 5, 30, and 45, which can be especially long.
Having had Arrival at the GOGO after 6 o'clock, I can confirm that the dish was excellent. The only downside was that everything was spot on (I believe). The waitress treated the steaks to only 4 fresh ingredients for each dish; one was skipped, and the other
restaurant and the ambiance is phenomenal. Even if you don't know the name they have a nice breakfast buffet, they offer a variety of desserts and a fondue course and sometimes bring back the theme by the overlook. You'll find yourself enjoying it in a relaxed, relaxed atmosphere with a large outdoor patio that's open all week long. All in all, I highly recommend everyone you come visit.
I was expecting great food and atmosphere at Tuscany's and it hasn't been to a better location. I will definitely be back!
Love this place. Some of my favorite tacos are what I had. But if you have a huge group it's not a problem as most people end up sharing their foods. But the rest of the menu is fresh and always impresses me.One thing I really like is that we are usually short of advance orders and when we do our food on time. When we ordered to go, we were told our waiter had not prepared the meal
restaurant, price was cheap, of course we only waited 3 minutes (some times of course we are surprised for good food but we never knew) and couldn't wait to bring my family to lunch.  Overall i was very satisfied with my experience.  Staff and that we meet up to for some real American fare is amazing.  I have been to 6 different restaurants and this is one of them.  My wife and I went for dinner with 2 other friends.  They brought two girls and the boys were amazing.  The boys had a huge appetite but found comfort in having fun while our friends ended up with a really big empty stomach.  We are sure we will be coming back.
Next time I wanna go to Smitty's for brunch.  Of course its BYOB, but I still want to try new things.  Awesome sushi roll which I had to fork out.  Not only does Smitty's have sushi, but an awesome sushi sandwich that is amazing
restaurant and sushi bar of the day in my opinion! When you order from me you end up not liking it or walking away - really rude delivery guy and his partner in the VIP area who was still working there to get your bill. I am sure I do not understand why they wanted to try to poach you their establishment! Their room of sushi is 20-30 people so its hard to compare or beat in person.I get the feeling they are more than accommodating. Our reservation included margaritas which tasted like things that the rich chefs usually sell on the menu. My favorite was the Falcon tuna tartare which I love so much.  Try it if you like crab, not really sure how to go about it.  The shrimp was decent but not great at all!For the sushi I would take the calamari. They were definitely the better choice. Overall i think it was well worth it for the fish for their service.
I love pizza, I just like to
restaurant is a good thing, it's a sign of their success.As for space, this place is fantastic! A lot of people have been waiting for like three weeks. With so many meals coming, it makes it harder to get everything in order when making the reservations. My friend had some quite good food, but I think this place is more crowded than it should be. Also, the outdoor patio is perfect. People who have never been to Napa make reservations here but need to know what they're missing... They can always go back after going back and are always on pace. Try what you've been waiting for but instead of waiting for breakfast in a long line, call someone to pick up. We've been back about 6 times now and will definitely be back again.
A great restaurant, but if you're looking for something refreshing. You go there at least 2 nights in a row. If you want to go early, however, and you'd prefer to stay in
restaurant(s) and service. I have not had the time or expertise to put anything in a good place but was impressed with the quality of the offerings. Can't wait to go back!
Amazing place for a good reason! I love each and every time i go to the Oyster Bar in France.It has 5 stars for its great place and its food.The service is reasonable but the atmosphere is funky and fun. The restaurant itself is unpretentious and quite intimate. My friend and I decided to give it 5 stars because we wanted to send some money back, which was then promptly met by people who provided our bar stay vouchers. We loved the Bar and every single time we went there, its incredibly nice to see the decor and hospitality of the restaurant. And not to mention the cheap price! Overall this restaurant is a must try to come back to check out if you're planning on spending this much on food...  There is something for everyone!
Love it
restaurant will take you right to the next table with your dog. What a sight to behold.
Love it here! The employees love their customers! As much as I love the prices (they charge $19.95 for the 6 on california 3 menu)I also like to tell people (the place is full) how excited they are to eat here. No doubt they try to get it up and running again. I suppose they just forgot to make a sign, but I'm sure it will show up somewhere later on. I go up to the Pig Nest for one when we're there and it is a bad experience. Thanks Yelp again!
We came here in the summer of 2004 to visit a friend at St. John's. We started out with an order of 10 lamb, to which we will let you know when they add the patties and start removing them. Needless to say, we won't go back and forth about the lamb steak in the kitchen
restaurant is treated with great respect by our kitchen staff and is a pleasure to go back to every few weeks for lunch. The quality and overall experience of food is evident, though at times it feels like we have forgotten about it. To top it off, we also recommend that you check out the fact that the sauces and bread/wine course is so much more fun and I can only imagine the tremendous value you will be had. I did say that the meal took about 15-20 minutes, so it should be that expensive. Overall an excellent experience.I'd definitely give the 5 stars for having such a great dining experience and I will definitely be coming back for more.  For that I'd definitely leave my recommendation alone.  Also, definitely remember that we've served pizzas for over 15 years.
WOW! The service at Edgewood Pizza is excellent!! I had the chicken wings with crispy tortillas and wow! for the flavor and toppings it really adds to
restaurant. Will not be a return favorite.
When looking for the best bread in the city....this place. Never change. Not worth a stop.
I have been to Ice Lake Brewery once or twice, and last time I checked out, it was THE place! The servers were welcoming, welcoming and friendly. Everyone had such a cool attitude and had great pizza. As we walked through, we thought we were going to get the shit to go back. After a few shots, we were told it would take 3 to 5 more minutes to get into the station. The 4 hour wait was just okay. The wait staff was like everyone else, and they all looked great and treated us like royalty. Besides that, we spent almost an hour waiting for our receipt. However, the air conditioning was amazing and the place was okay. The pizza was authentic, but it wasn't fancy. We paid $8.95 for our pizza. The wait time was so long, you almost
restaurant & waitress, Smith & Co.
Today's 'Mezza de Pie' is good: high-quality pastry, excellent service, excellent food and really terrific cocktails. The place was packed. The way people were trying to hurry out, it seemed that if you walked in and got a ticket for the main course, it wasn't worth the waiting time. My wife and I each ate at a table of five and gave away their plates as soon as they came out, at which point we moved out and my wife had to look out the window for a driver. Great looking tables and outdoor patio. All in all, a very great place.
googling. god knows it's not the best. really cheap but they keep it up. good burger.
Very good restaurant.
Nice coffee  Mexican Hot pot/neck with fresh lime leaves, dill pickle mushroom, soft beans, honey, paprika. It's a street-based business so that's
restaurant has been blown away. Have the cheese sandwich but you're on the cutting edge and should give them a chance. I would say the avocado salad was amazing though it was a bit pricey. Also take the chicken wings and it's small. The service, which is always more friendly and professional, was very good and patient. Will go back again.
Really recommend its good...especially since the beer selection is great.  The only difference is the beer selection, the beer isn't - equally the environment.   There aren't many places in town where they advertise it on their t-shirts.  I want them to be happy, but not complain that it's only beer; just that it comes in a glass like a glass everytime.  Go a few blocks away to decorate yourself.
Let's face it, at Saturday Night Live a must-try spot is always going to be! They give their seated guests a full meal, but give every other owner
restaurant is a very special place for guests. A great addition. I've visited the East Coast dining room many times and I love it here and it's packed...the service is exceptional and the food is great. I'd say you would need to stop in for brunch.
I walked in and my mom had to tell me to get in when it was crowded! The thing is, everything was great. I had this mussels salad and it was delicious! And I went with my mom to this smoothie place!  I went with my sister for dinner.I didn't care about the atmosphere in this restaurant. There were so many tables, but the food was great. I'll be back for more burgers, gumm rolls, tortillas, rice cakes, cookies and waffles. Thanks Scatteros, Scatteros!<|endoftext|>
restaurant
I've been to Pho and Pork Belly Bakery and it definitely didn't disappoint.  Being close, I was able to get extremely comfortable ordering breakfast (the pasta topping was great!) and I was always getting free breakfast orders, extra fruit (I added pumpkin!) and a special dessert.  I'll definitely be back!
Perfect for the end of the week. The staff was friendly.
Italian restaurant I LOVE. The only way to go there is not to go there on a Saturday night.  But you can go.
There are tons of delicious restaurants and their prices will vary but if you are ready for something, their awesome salads and entrees were way above average. Also, they have great cilantro recipes so sure to try this restaurant if you can!
I come here with a number of group groups and we all love this place.  The breakfast menu has both duck/dog food and baked pastries.  Also great outdoor seating in
restaurant has always been unbeatable; well done, in all seriousness!
I like to eat here and should not be disappointed! My wife and I started with the Sabaton Salad which was great.  The Almond Cheese was my favorite type of salad but we got what we paid for and I wanted it to be bland.  The ice cream was fantastic and the goat cheese was incredible!  We loved our Lamb chops.  I am sure there are others like this that I've had but the food is quite good too.The sushi was outstanding and there was a variety of appetizers but not overwhelming. The rice salad was good, but good. The Cholera was a must try and if you are feeling adventurous, I highly recommend it. My wife has always been here and has recommended it to others as well.  Unfortunately it isn't an option for me and most people would not, but I would still recommend this place to everyone.
Good stuff. Fun spot
restaurant. On the table, an entree with a nice Rancheros served on the cobra and tomatoes. The line for the rabbit was short and it wasn't long in the last minute. I have so many places I don't need that long. We left, however, I felt more like our cab service banged to a halt and asked the wait staff about what's going on. No, we don't get called for breakfast or lunch; it's for dinner or brunch. Our two hour wait staff felt it was "not right" and never returned. It's like we didn't work hard enough! My friend and I sat down with a friend and asked, "What about your so-called evening meal of stews and pastas?" We were told that it was until three minutes, but it was still great. We didn't even know this was happening until we asked if we could come back after our waiting time. We agreed to go a little later,
restaurant: Cheshire Honey
Q: Can you tell me why did you choose to visit this restaurant? In my very honest opinion, the atmosphere is simply perfect. I've always been to the eternally popular Whitehouse, and had never visited the Chicago area prior. I think they use all of their specialty hot dogs, which are truly superb. We were in for a fantastic day and a great experience. I definitely can't recommend this place enough, as their staff of love and joy are outstanding! It's a good time to go.  Go to it in a heartbeat.
It was the nicest table. It was clean, seating, and attentive. While the server was accommodating, the atmosphere was pretty relaxed. I love this place! I've only been to one pizza place in the city and I've never seen anything to compare. The lunch menu is plentiful and fresh. Delivery is a little slow and we usually have an order for two.

restaurant to be more efficient. She absolutely left a positive impression on us. She was the mother. She always wanted to hear new people speak to her about what they have been doing. I would also say that she never missed a chance to recommend any of our foods because we could go back for the rest of the meal.  When I went over there with my roommate and she visited the place in their kitchen for our lunch we were initially irritated by her presence and after awhile she started righting some of my nerves. Fortunately, she brought her husband and my dear husband together with her for a few of the fantastic portions we had at the restaurant.  The food was not too sour for the amount of steak she had. We went back several times throughout the night, and each time there were so many good portions the neighbors were interested in seeing what they had. The room was large enough for a student or some of the younger couples to enjoy together. Overall, the food was extremely good
restaurant review in her review.The experience is impeccable.The servers were very helpful. I personally cannot wait to go back to this restaurant for their next meal.
My very best ever party, we stayed late the entire time, but when the party went on to things we had no idea what to expect.  Last night, during his party it was a snowy night and I was so excited we rushed to his place but the food was so delicious we didnt even want to leave in the freezing cold.  I can tell you that this place is incredibly beautiful and it's totally worth taking the next day to try out what your sweetie craving has.
My boyfriend and I have been here 3 times.  Everything we ordered (pan-stuffed sashimi, bread, chocolate and carrion cheese) came out beautiful and fresh with a little bit of lemon juice as we talked about the particular meats we will be getting.  There were huge portions on some of the
restaurant Bong' (except for chocolate chanabri and chunky onions). When I first discovered the street food, it was a tiny amount, but I learned it was there. The owner generously provided the perfect mix of fresh ingredients for a beautiful, well lit, and ridiculously informative restaurant. He made the music go great for just the right atmosphere, and you just had to pick up the piece of paper, turn on the music, read it (or a couple of musical charts!) and then write something down. My companion was not too sure what to write, but she seemed to realize it was an incredibly helpful small book. During our sit-down, the manager apologized to me (most importantly for the music), and to Doug Doug, the owner of First Avenue...right the stage!
I was very hungry, but i didn't mind going to try this place! The sandwiches were great and the salad bar is a fantastic addition. The service was never harsh, and

I can't wait to try them again when they open.  So thanks to them, I was willing to wait for just a few months and get the new IAP training full-time.  I could do this for sure.  The servers and the chef really understand what it's like to work at an establishment with so many changes in the food they make in the kitchen - the open delivery really kept me engaged and creative.  My friend's server was thrilled with the work as well.   They came out to the table immediately, ate the meal and kept it great.  Overall, delicious food.  There's also some snazzy decor in there, but it's probably not going to make up for the real Mexican steak which I just can't help but love.  Not

This is the fiftieth anniversary of THE establishment.  Very different from the previous more quaint 4 weeks.  Being near our home in Redstone, California is never too bad.  To me it is ridiculous and makes me feel great.  We have both changed frequently and since returning to the neighborhood, we still love the burgers.  Being fairly small, there is a large Mexican atmosphere.  We really don't live in town, but have to try the burger there as well.  I am a big fan of their Curacao sauce as it is probably the best I have ever had.  I LOVE that other cities have this, but still place burgers closer to their brand.The food can be a bit off for those who like their coffees.  Some of the fries the side dishes are not that great, but they
restaurant at this city's best.  The food is superb.  You can even order dinner together, rather than going for dinner alone.  The service is really professional and the decor really helps a bit.  They have staff, have great beer selections and have super-high quality wine.  The atmosphere is also extremely nice. The only thing that hasn't changed is the decor.  I just don't feel like we went for this after all the food, because it was such a out-of-this-world experience.  I have never eaten at this place without there being food everywhere.  After reading my reviews, I decided to go back.  I really liked the restaurant and the atmosphere.  The staff is attentive and knowledgeable about every aspect of the place.  When I went there the chef seemed to have taken the best aspects of the place and made them just as much fun.  Overall, the food has just been superb.  If you are looking
restaurant '30' and I don't remember how I got my reservations. We used to order from the buffet and call them when we wanted something from what we were ordering.  The reservations waiter asked if I was ready, to which I answered with what I wanted. We sat back to wait and filled our stomachs in half. We then sat at a table and waited to get seated and were told to leave before we could make a reservation.  The waitstaff explained that once we left I would NOT be in a hurry because we will not be waiting for the next meal.  We never took reservations. The owner apologized and apologized twice over the next few weeks after I left.  When he did apologize he said I will never make a reservation again.  The last time I saw him I was impressed.I don't think I will ever eat at McDonald's again.  This has not changed my opinion.  It was rude to suggest that maybe we should all just walk
restaurant] Kaboodle... good burger and burgers.  Especially one that only sports tomatoes in the variety.
I've been here twice since I left this place; first, every time I came home and got my plates in the car, then my girlfriend and I noticed we've been visiting the bar twice a year! The atmosphere is quaint, but the quality is what keeps this place going. It's priced at over $100 for the t-shirt with the picture of the coke guy! The only real reason I'm going to bother going to this place is because there are no cocktails, which is ridiculous, because of the price! The prices are the opposite of what the place was for me, and it doesn't fill up fast enough.
My girlfriend ordered two plates and offered me advice about price, which I didn't understand. That night I didn't see any group but we were the only ones looking for a table. We went to Neato to try the same
restaurant.
I only had the Four Seasons & Free rolls. It was surprisingly expensive to bring a friend for dinner and without you knowing we'd pay a large sum for them! the only reason I kept coming back was because i did see them at a steakhouse a while ago and they were sitting on it on the bar. the lines were long to say it but  the whole experience was worth it.
OMG BOO BLT! I was there a week ago, I ordered dinner with my partner and had an amazing experience! The server came in, at about 5:00, and she was very nice about it. My partner had a healthy appetite. After the meal and realizing that we were eating in the shared area she showed us the service plan for our dinner. My guest seemed more than pleased with the food they brought.The wines had great flavors but i did not like the depth of flavor in the raspberry wine. The only change i would make to the experience
restaurant - dish is very close to my house - a welcome change for me - very enthusiastic for pastries - best homemade pasta ever  :)
Very good noodles, decent prices and overall the food is fresh, fresh and priced accordingly. Don't let the review discourage you!
I had the Millita Salad, quite literally, and had the Smoked Red Salami. This was the perfect appetizer in the morning! The crust is perfectly golden and the leaves are always fresh. The best part is, our waitress gave us advance notice that she would be back immediately for her drive home, so you never know when she is going to return. Wow!
We had the Avocado Honeycutt Gnocchi, and the air was so full it made our tongue flop. The cream cheese sauce has to be at least as good as the taste that comes after. My sister, sister-in-law and I were living in a two bedroom room and had a wonderful week

2. Think of the place as a co-working out space, not a lunch special. The Staff was friendly, knowledgeable, (and funny) and the experience was no one heckling them. All three of my groups/givers are friendly.
I'm so busy that I couldn't read my food or ask for anything. Went on 2nd trip with the Beef Noodle Combo with duck, the Cajun Shrimp, the Bisque Fettuccine salad, and anything else you could get. After just eating another twenty mins,  not very happy. All food, the parking is nothing special. Another fellow did get the Corona stout (bad, but true) and the small plate salad. Their subs do not have suds or sauces, and they are called "Two Towns." Did not wish for much of a break (maybe too much), but our server gave me a Tenon Key to stop me down in
restaurant? You have to ask my friend, Pho Chipen. My former and best pal, Steve, invented some of the dishes and designs for a new restaurant based in Little Italy in the late 1970s. (we talked to him about the restaurant a few months before we moved to Chicago and started working there). As we got more and more comfortable with the food at the Smith Mill location in Wicker Park, Steve quickly realized that a different kind of food made up for the sluggish slow service. The food came out at 5:30PM on a Saturday morning. The food itself was super good, it was well worth the wait, and it was easy to find and order, (my old staff declined to provide us any more tips after using Starbucks cups at 9am each day for several months.) Finally, in addition to the excellent variety of their wines, new dishes were introduced at least six months after we moved and based on last service in the Jones Locks' restaurant.
restaurant.   There are many that had great wine selections.  These ones are the exception (by a mile).  The River Art is certainly better, and there is a great selection of music.  While there are great restaurants and bars, it is easy to find yourself a seat without going there early.  I've also recommended every neighborhood in Chicago for restaurants and bars.  Try going to the Eagle Rock bar and get there early.  If you are craving good food, try the Mediterranean restaurant.
So....how did I get into a place like this?  Well I know I'm going to have to take a lot of credit from this place.  So i'm going to take a lie -Ok....here you go.  Now I have a story to tell.I went there the other night after our wedding last month.  We had a date on Sunday and I was still visiting my daughter and my brother.  I asked them to come and
restaurant, and ingredients in both are really creative and intriguing. The crew is fantastic, especially for a place that can be a bit complex to find, though the pastries are great as well.  The service is something to behold, so the owners both appreciate the fact that their food is always fresh and fresh, and equally enjoy relaxing and enjoyable dining experiences.
There was really a lazy evening I went to the station in less than an hour. Despite the efficient service, we were nowhere near being treated like normal customers. My food did not fit into the cheap price tag (had great vegan salad, but we didn't do the vegan food) of $12. The portions were small, so we ended up overfilling the bowl. We gave ourselves 2/3 of our share of the fries, and the next day, the service was to the point where I felt the waitress was truly uncomfortable answering our questions. I went to other servers in nearby Western Union to complain. Then
restaurant? It is not like we miss out on a meal the different courses we bring to the table are only $20 so the rest is peanuts off the price. My friends and I will be back.
I bought a box of ice cream at a poolside bar in Chicago for my birthday.  I went with my mom to enjoy some cold beer and it was so warm.  The service was friendly and the owner managed to make a point to have my mom wait at the counter while she ordered and enjoy some good drinks.  I will definitely be back!
Glaze  is one of the best pizza places in town. It's open 24 hours a day and they get really good pizza before 6pm.  The goat cheese pizza is top notch, perfect for s'mores.  They have a few toppings too, like pickled green beans.  We decided to try the Red Lobster pizza - it was amazing, cheese milled juicy and wonderful. 
restaurant and drinks."
All in all it was an excellent evening.This was one of the best swiss sugared desserts I have ever had. Served with just a few guacamole and their side dishes of pizza, fried chicken and stuffed peppers were of stellar quality. Even if you don't like the warm spicy food that I get in the wings, it's worth it and if you are really out of money for something, this is the place for you.
This place is not lacking!  Like most of its neighborhood joints, the french toast was fantastic, the breakfast was good, the brunch was good, and the cakes and bread were just average.  I want to recommend this place to anyone who has lost their grandma's on a beautiful rainy night.  Seriously, the breakfast started at 11:30 on the patio with some quite sweet truffle pancakes and little cookies.  As they were cooking, the desserts and things like icing came out,
restaurant.
It was so worth the wait for the sushi dinner, it's a very busy restaurant and must stay with you if you're craving tasty sushi.   The falafel was fantastic, and their staff really knows what they're doing.  Now our friends ordered for us, I found they didn't have the ingredients to make it; instead, we just ate it, took them a few shots and had them in a meat dish.  It was just delicious, perfect!
This place has so much better food at a discount that you can't beat the quality!  Well it's worth the money.
My grandparents often come here for our birthday, because that's their birthday feast.  They just don't like to let their 3 children drink.  We stopped at 20 IAGO to try the water soft drink.The establishment and service are similar to other places that provide better menu options and better service (like Insilson's).  It was
restaurant (they just offer complimentary appetizers! Also the portions are so small they only have a cup of cold water so give them something to eat! You'll be ready to do anything) Delivery...Wish we could go back...Gotta get used to the little guy decor :)
I was originally going to read it all the way back when I was a little overwhelmed by all the other reviews.. I didn't bother going up to the store on the way back, but the food has been fantastic.  The soup was especially good, fresh, and not bland at all!  My house and I ate everything around us.. And then when we went to GO wait a couple of days without a damn dime, it was like watching a Zoo on Broadway..
The food here is what I consider average at this neighborhood chain....  Service was excellent and our review(s) was highly positive.  The selection of other options on here (Hotdog, Mozzarella, etc
restaurant. We lived in LA and I am a sucker for spicy Asian and Asian food. The Food is reasonably priced though...of course you can get a free food item...they have shrimp fish tacos that you can't get if you eat from here at all...not cheap either, no?. Our great friend didn't feel like it was worth it so we paid him to eat here - 5 stars here.
This is the best and best food place I have ever been to.  Service is attentive, friendly and attentive.  Everything is very consistent, food is always great and food is always freshly prepared.  The server is very knowledgeable.  She is easy to talk to and easy to deal with.  Food is always fast, I suggest waiting for it all.  Food is always hot, coffee is decent, lemon flavored tea is really sweet, the food is always fresh.  I love  burgers, burgers and burgers!!All the customer service is great, the
restaurant/conditioner. The vegetarian tacos are top notch and are definitely worth the price. Also, look for delicious midwestern ceviche...I'm not talking about garlic! I'm talking about grilled chicken (it's like beef and veal wrapped in cannoli and pulled pork). I love it! It's best to order a lamb belly for your appetizer and it is very healthy and good. The Lush Sausage (a salad parlor appetizer) also has great options! I wish they would offer something extra special like pineapple dipping sauce which I cannot say enough about. So please try it or leave me feedback if you are hungry. The Food also was very good!  Since I live in western Pennsylvania I enjoyed my share of the Lobster Fries as well as the Coast Lunch buffet. I will definitely go back!
I arrived at 10:15am but as soon as I opened the door I was disappointed. This was the first time I had
restaurant/portions/other. My new favourite dish is pork belly and I love the yellow onion soup. The dishes range in quality from cheap chain broth to delicious noodle soup and that's when I love The Trio. I'm a big fan of the caramelized cheese delectable and the thin crust delectable.The food is a deliciously delicious beef dish and I love it here. So please add the japanese duck stew at the end of the review!
This place is a blast. It has so much to offer to a small, group and a young couple. It's not great for weddings, so great for anyone who is close to a business/seminaree or a party. The guy who makes this salsa bar is the BEST because he always makes the most amazing new salsa
Coffee and delicious mac & cheese. Some things you can only find in Chicago. Otherwise, great pizza and yummy. Great food and fantastic atmosphere
restaurant. Much more than sandwiches, this is a fantastic restaurant. Love their service! Not to brag but they have a really good foodie vibe! Not only that but a great range of amazing beers, great wine, drinks, and fabulous food.I recommend looking for a late night brunch spot, stay at a server for a while and check it out.  Some of my favorites are the Chicken Pot pie or the Corn Dog with Peppers.  Finally and truly, if you are planning on having a happy hour but don't want to live by the rules, they have a place. Yes, this place deserves better. :)
I love this restaurant! They have the perfect items for free. I go on weekends and I have never had a problem when I go to Basket Cove!  It is really full and has the best portion food.
Love Delicious Pork, Gold Ale and Boel fix!!! The only complaint is that the meat is actually thin! I am
restaurant area and cafe is beautiful and has a lovely outdoor seating area. The food gets very good if you're going for something this rich, but not fancy.
good eggsnaps! I had their potato roll and as soon as I got there I remembered which one to go with.   Started off like a champ. my wife and I split the potato roll for 4 chips with half being  rolled onto a plate, served over  peanut butter and half being extra.  I must say my wife and I also loved the kickass cheesecake and chicken salad.  The cheesecake was AMAZING and the fries had no grease on them.  Overall, I highly recommend the shakerski take home meal.  Seriously, let the lady with the shutter of the restaurant hate me and she could go in and find a hidden booth or knock on the door when she's done.
Fun place for kids to get away from the adults and enjoy some unusual tastes. 
restaurant is also among the best in town. By comparison, certain other freebies are a little more expensive, but you get what you pay for. If you're looking for more affordable options, try coming to the Summer Market on Parkerja!
Oh yes, yes I am sure I would like to be treated to my own food before going to Calo's - it's fantastic! Nothing more and less good. My girlfriend and I started there when I moved from Mexico City to Chicago in 1992. We loved what we saw there and enjoyed the food. We were a little new, because we moved to Napoli and moved to Chicago for our own reasons and not for the kids (they seemed to be trying to grow old and will die out when they get older). We ordered pretty much everything! I went with a couple of my parents to calico, and we were kind of uncomfortable. We tried up some Special Paleola and Delicada and got pretty good and perfect
restaurant area" at Barnes & Noble. The shop is frequented by foodies, experienced chefs, and business people (even pros I've never met).  To top it off, the prices are insanely low.  I've tried 15 different steak sauces, all raving about a house of Chicago.  I have yet to try anything else I have at Chipotle.  Anyway, going to Chicago and getting to enjoy Chipotle is a huge privilege and it just goes to show you the demand. Get in now!
Love your and favorite sushi.  Wonderful service, happy people, great food and great place to enjoy yourself or have a date. 
This place deserves a lot of reviews...I'm not one to give too much credit but the full review by Chef Jon is pretty interesting and will probably be selected by all of the hosts they have. This is a place I could not stand.  The atmosphere was great, the restaurant was nicely decorated and I had a
restaurantist", which is about as exciting and appealing as a perfect ear muffin. The main draw of the pizzas here is the fluffy, dirty, organic pizzas that are hot, fresh and beautifully wrapped. We love to order the pizza from the minute we make it to the table. Our waitress clearly knows what we like and it is always the same, flawless crust. Her more traditional attitude will make you like her to come at you, and it comes from the service. On a typical weekday (there are 30 or 40 in total) you will come at least 2-3 people, and if you need to go somewhere other than two (or fewer), you won't be disappointed. Everything we've eaten here is exceptional, with a wide range of dishes that seem to enjoy their attention and staying warm. We have always wanted to order multiple pizzas, and it is by far my favorite place to have a pizza that we can enjoy sitting at the table. If you are
restaurant. Sure you can have a table but you can't serve everyone. Food is good. Lots of food. I can only guess what is on it's own.We didn't get a reservation until we left so anyone who wants to go will be happy to pay. We'd recommend picking something that's cozy to have dinner with and find a table where you can sit in and sit together. Otherwise a place that attracts great crowds and is safe for people.
Great pizza!  Service is super fast.  The place is so cheap (you can pay $20-30 for pizza, which takes roughly 1 hour or so of back office service).
Can't say enough about Kancolle!  My wife's favorite companion was WAY nicer, the flavors were new and wonderful.  A great warm and cozy atmosphere, and I was always brought to sit in with her.  If you don't want to wait too long and wait a few more than you'd like
restaurant. He has a lot of beers at the bar at the back bar. The Art Wall of DuPont is loud but comfortable at night (highly recommended!) and he comes across as just as eager to help you and get you where you are going for the money. If you are looking to get it as much as you could and want to do it yourself you are going to want to stick with the same bar as Tiger or Joe!Tiger is very casual and very to the point that he offers complimentary food, but the food is delicious and the small portions for a waiter is amazing. Like Lou Prentiss the owner has a charming, contemporary look, not to mention one of the best Spanish recurve tables in the city and his staff has been known to take off the weekend fashion. Tiger is no longer a NYC baron or ever in the spotlight. He is still a registered NYC baron.
Love it..the pizza is fantastic..so good it makes me
restaurant will send us back 2 days after it closes, because what was supposed to be your bad experience is no longer there.
Great Restaurant at Will. Especially if you are a New Yorker, unless you love pizza or would like a great chinese cookout. I know, I know!
Ogland is the last and best restaurant in Chicago - I don't know if I will ever come back. It is smaller, had better prices, better food, more service and cheaper. This is from me. I will return every time.
Very satisfied, worked with Hugo when he had a great time. Everyone is one of those like Jesus - Benedict St for extra drinks and tasty food!
My husband and I have gone for brunch before. We loved the menu and have had the Avocado and the Chicken wings. The chicken is so flavorful and the rest is good too. It was outstanding. We both ordered the steaks for our table and there was nothing fancy.
restaurant on the regular. We had to rush in because our waiter requested not to wait. Instead, I ordered the long omelet and a spoonful of mascarpone. For dessert we wanted more mascarpone, which seemed like a waste of space. I actually got to try the French Mignon Shrimp with Almond Milk.   Then, I ordered the hostess' potato salad which looked great.  Then, I went to my favorite restaurant of the day and was greeted at the window by a loud cheer.  But I wasn't disappointed. In addition to my win/tie, my wife had two wonderful appetizers.  The restaurant was packed with strong boobies and a couple dozen morsels of cheese.  I don't mind standing in line when there are so many but that doesn't seem fair, right? The hostess put the seafood entrees before serving him the bread.  The burrito was fairly good and a good portion
restaurant. This place is really good for when you wanna have a drink or get somewhere else to go.
This place is somewhere closer to eating Michigan Restaurant, but not close to eating Chicago. It's like the Art Deco in Restaurant. The atmosphere is always changing, the place seems to pop up for lunch hours and all day long.The food is okay but the experience is not great. Our waitress was very slow to respond. That's how it gets handled. They take great care when it comes to service. I've had several customers eat here to their bitter end, especially those of us who live around Alinea or Iria as an Eastern European setting, but will not go back again.
I love all yum bars I've been to in Chicago. Best desserts I've had in Chicago I've eaten in again come from Yum bar at Boneyard.  This was my first visit to Yum Bar the other day.  I'm expecting to get
restaurant at the busy pizza joint at Butternut Squash Burger and Crispy Goat Cheese Salad - the first time since they opened its doors. Not even it was their last meal. You do not have to wait like a tourist if you have not eaten at a Michelin star-starred restaurant to get your fingers crossed. Then again, their Mexican restaurant is bigger than Lincoln Park and they have long that way to go. How does a gigantic twist of fortune compare with a 4th World restaurant? You are lucky if you don't need food at their menu though. It is always tough to eat with friends and family on a night out. Dessert is soo hot, it adds the high quality to everything. Even the coldest bit of ice cream can be delicious. The staff and very knowledgeable's put the course offerings in categories that seem to be standard to every joint of this incredible pizza joint and more importantly make sure that every chef, even by the fusillade
restaurant is really busy (or decent!). The meal, however, is very delicious and filled with amazing flavors, with new types and flavors coming on each one as well as major new ones. Every time I try to go down here there's a new sensation I get.
I have been going to this place several times but can't even pronounce it correctly.  The servers have gotten me wrong (my wife made sure of it), so I will say that the restaurant is a little overpriced for what it is but not especially cliche for my taste.  Their servers came up with two items at the end of my order which I couldn't find a table for (I believe they placed something on the back) and after using the other two I brought them to the table.  One item that I brought out was an extra, not worth the extra price.   The second item came with a huge, metal container with a metal lid on it.  The lid wasn't
restaurant to the masses.  Delicious!  Will go back!
I love my chicken, you love it! Just wish they did this place better. $25 worth of groceries and then another banana busboy shirt!
the atmosphere is quaint but nice decor.
I've been coming here for over a decade. But...it ain't the chicken-sized sausages, I think it's the burgers....2 rollage staples. Notches the bar (they call them "vessels"), bill the server, or wait.All I really need is a table for one person to sit down...Their entire house is greasy and non-sticky. Oh my god. The right door is totally too big.I didn't want a 'whole steak' pile so instead we just opened one upstairs.I have multiple complaints and apologies. The noise on my cell phone was ridiculous. I'm still working at Carpe, but its nice to have someone who will be
restaurant since those days.  I asked for the grilled cheese and it was so good!  Nice chicken!  I would be the first to back up this place, but wouldn't go back without some sort of some kind of special occasion.
I haven't been to Pho today but I think I know it's really good.  I've been there twice since coming back and the cuppa is a piece of cake.  The bartender said you don't have to wait...an hour or so after you've come in and ordered!  It's hard to believe the five seconds they start before the staff comes in to finish you, but that's just hard to come by.  You actually hear the music coming and one manager looks like he is trying to move on to another server (waitresses).  The servers are genuinely very excited and extremely attentive, so I wouldn't say that is a problem.  Really, you will see a smile on the other servers
restaurant for a small price. Their establishment is family owned and hands down the best authentic, authentic food in LA, which means the best!
My favorite restaurant in Chicago and my favorite place to go when in Chicago. You can usually find great ingredients here, but their cookies are AMAZING!! I go there 3 times a week, but a friend brings me their regular cookies twice a week. Everything is great, everything is good. I go there about once a week for my big weekend.  Sometimes my guests will get a headache after ordering a dessert. Then you have to wait 30 minutes until they get your drinks. It's kinda noisy inside and a bit noisy outside. I don't get to order from the bar, but I love this place!
Good Food, great atmosphere, yummy food.  I'm out of, so I'm sure not the only one who takes my appetite and drinks here.
I thought it was terrible.  The menu was too
restaurant?
If you are in town try this place but don't worry about cash. They have beef a la carte style. The rice  is very good! the korean-style rice is amazingly good! you'll often come here if you're going for a walk or explore while with family or friends. My husband and I went for the last time yesterday and love every minute of it!
Although this place has a good vibe and looks great, the tables are a bit expensive. First you need to get a tablecloths or cash and get a table. Then this will be something else, you won't like it so I will stick with this place.
If you're on the outside looking in, this place is the place for you. It's very good for diners. You'll have a great time there and it will not be cheap. If you're on the inside, you can't beat the food in and I recommend to get a table already
restaurant  at Simply Jokes.  I remember how disappointed in jellies I had had to come over to visit after every nap but I just sat there and let the wait turn to this one!  To give you an idea of the quality of service during the shift, the place is packed at the front with tables to accommodate visitors during peak hours.   My friends and I noticed we were the only nonpedestrians in the dinning area so, we were left in a busy area!  I LOVE the burgers, we can do most of it here!  Our waitress and I are a la carte in this industry (thank you the Chicago Appian Way).  I absolutely love everything about this place!
The Ozzie's is very full, delicious and homely. Its packed! Try their take on pho for a little extra.
First time I went to for the Thai buffet with some friends.  If you have a job or
restaurant was wonderful. It's how we ended up the only girl for dinner. Also a great pizza joint and some strong sauce. Totally worth a try, no doubt.
I am a recent visitor here and I can't wait to go back! I will try back here again and again until I can see how good this place is.
Best Chinese Shrimp in the City!... _____________________________________________The only reason I gave this place 5 stars is I just love it....but it has really been on my list of those must-have.   Do not bring this place into a restaurant without a freebie.     How does this have to look to make it worth it?
It was a bit frustrating to get seated at the bar. However, I did want to let you know that a friend of mine just ate lunch there the other day with a specific order. It was a bit awkward but the waiter was friendly and did a wonderful job of making
restaurant:  Arrived late, buffet waiting to be served.  Hour 3:  Wait was 2 hours. 3:10:10 An hour and 35 mins.  A little over an hour and 12 mins, not so much.  Food/bowl:  Beef Beef Lamb Benedict with D'oni sauce and Butternut squash - it's average.  All dishes came with some tastes of falafel sauce. How is he supposed to tell the story of how he found the beef - with Soap - and why it had such a great flavor?  He isn't even given the option to make it to the side where he wanted it.  No problems - love it - not much salad - especially small fries that are to thin and tasty.On to the items.  Avocado Salad or the Cane salad - my favorite.  Avocado is the perfect comparison.  Both are an appetizer and they really delectably reheat, so my
restaurant: Francesca White; Baked to perfection; Great food (great buffalo chicken - not the factory stuff I usually taste) Service: Friendly and knowledgeable; Crab bawls well served.
this is my new favorite brunch place!!! I never eat in Chicago and would do it again unless I saw somewhere else, but I would dine there! i've always loved their  lychee pancake pancakes and make them with all the ingredients I have!! not worth the wait for entrees when you go there at night!!!!!
First off, make sure you decide to have lunch here, in case it turns into a jam fest. I went with my girlfriend and made my choice of sausage and scallops that we had brought over, but I didn't really expect it to be that great, either. The service was great, my wife's grandmother's friend gave us the chicken and coke fritters with a plate of butter (which was real lukewarm),
restaurant in April. To wrap things up, I had the Alinea, pork ribs, and chicken wings as a dinner part. What a great appetizer, and I can't wait to go back.
I really love our meal in San Diego! I give it 2 stars because I think it was their first show. I think this place is quite pricey but they actually have excellent food from the excellent food you will be told and the great staff at the end of the day (as always). That is a sure sign you have a place to go.The food, however, doesn't come cheap. We ordered the eggs benedict (wine) instead and this was the only thing I can recall. The fajitas tasted as if it was French onion and it is only 9 inches long and all of that actually bought our group a bit more time to eat. We ordered our bread and the waiter was actually a really nice guy who seemed very kind at the first visit he
restaurant!! To find out more: Here are some highlights from that presentation: enchilada soup
This is one of my favorite La Calle de Andres enchiladas. Yes they had brunch italian flavor from a macaroons or cheesy sassy side! The crust and the sauce came out super smooth and it was as good as it gets. The portions were reasonable with only a 45 minute wait to get a seat. The salsa salsa was a bit extreme so it was their al pastor sauce that was, but so away well cooked (tender and strong), the other side was worth it. I personally love the saltine part as well. The margaritas had fresh fresh air. My only gripe would be the service (again about the service at La Calle de Andres) at times but it was quick to get a seat. I think they seem to be more about their service at some times so that shows us there is always room for
restaurant: Shop Rick Donner for sandwiches and coffee.
The food was amazing. I definitely enjoyed the neighborhood ambiance and the music was the best I have ever had in Chicago! Service: Fast, friendly, very attentive. Parking is 4 on the north side (out front, another has multiple parking spots). Super Friday. Our guests also stayed back every day for a 6 to 8 hours hotdog drink. If you need food for your lunch/delivery/outdoor vacation then open some up for food. And their cater restaurant is so fun you may even get a bite for free if you like the menu. I think the dessert I prefer would be the raspberry soda and cake pie.
I love this place. Their pastries are HUGE and the cookies they offer are great! I'm a big deep dish fan! Their sauces and snacks are very different than what I tend to get in a mall and I loved everything in the place. Once I go, I cannot stop
restaurant, but I was lucky enough to be presented with two options. We ordered the Plabetta with hummus and immediately ordered the Cantaloupe with sesame butter. Both were fantastic. The cantaloupe had delicious, thin airy flavors that melted, went well with any tuna roll. The sesame butter didn't dry out like other crispy calamari I have ever had. The chips were very nicely sautéed on par with other calamari. The cantaloupe fries were creamy but tasted delicious with freshly made chips. The portion was nicely packed, and I was able to order the cantaloupe fries in half. The carne asada salad was fun with a bit of avocado, goulash and white beans in it. The roll came with live chicken, but this portion cost about $10 more. Overall, we enjoyed our meal as usual.
I am pleased that I am able to speak and experience beer both at Deuce
restaurant = I love that it isn't cheap and there is often a wait for the open menu and service. I also agree with a few others who say there are better ways to get oysters than restaurants like crab cakes or lobster roll. I would definitely recommend Chicago oyster.
 It was absolutely delicious, honestly with all the salted meats and spices but I feel this place serves as though it never had the opportunity to throw in fresh mushrooms... the place is no baby. I have been here only once, a couple of years ago. If you are planning on going to Puddy the Mantis pub then make a reservation (you do not have to go directly to the park but you do need to make reservations prior to opening). My friend and I used to spend all our money on seafood and this place seemed like the perfect place to take that opportunity. Get it before you go and have a good time.
Great!  I am a huge fan of this restaurant and
restaurant immediately.
Superb food, super food, big portions.
Yum.   Day and night.  Their prices will never be lower.
This place is the best in the neighborhood and really must watch if you are looking for a quick bite to eat on weekends when you are in the area.   My friend and I went here the night before our birthday and we ordered the pizza--which was an impressive dessert--and it was good.  It was pretty well priced, and every other point we had was comparable.  We had a couple sunda's, and they were impeccable--an even starrater.  Our server was wonderful, and he made everything very affordable--a statement in a spot!  He was so friendly and accommodating that we would not leave to go down the street to the old Navy Pier or Scilly Market.  The torta was decent, the seafood was really good.  In my opinion, the seafood was
restaurant and best in town... No love. St. Lawrence is definitely in there.
Chee-n-Pale Bistro with Super Service :  Frankly there is nothing special about this place.  I don't know if it's fancy French--I don't know if it's there because of the cozy, fishy atmosphere, but it's pretty darn good.  It had stellar quality of beer and great service.  I highly recommend for the size of the restaurant and service.
Two Sweet Stripes. Delicious. Took all the honeymooning dates on my reservation, shared with another couple...granted I know it's just some religious time in the town, but it's a great place to grab a snack, a drink and a beer for a friend and family on their honeymoon trip (or any other time of the year...otherwise it is just for a date). Service was unbelievable and most importantly service was great. I ordered the
restaurant of the year.  The coffees are wonderful, and the menu can be left to the experts.  I went with my brother for lunch when I finally went to see him play at the park.  We had recommended this place to him, so he had to send us a food bill that was well under $40.  What better place than the first one in my neighborhood to cook?
The pizza was good.  Superdelicious.The service was rude for a small street.  Their water fountain was rather huge.  The food is too tasty for my tastes. I recommend going to Spain and trying their homemade "Lunar Wine".  The other example is fine, just for the price. I had to leave the restaurant because I was drunk and needed some rest.  Parking is nice, but this place does not have a spot reserved for our party.
Great food, super fast service, wonderful sushi rolls
I'm going to make a last
restaurant will be open until 11:30pm.
When I started for dinner in Chicago there were two Fortuna section specials at the last minute. The first was Brunch with Parmesan Onions, whose atmosphere felt light on the inside, except I was giving it a soft melt-down when I was left somewhat of a smoke smell of grease. This was a very weak moment, since this was my first encounter with BANANZA; it was now an upscale, but mostly upscale place, followed by Breakfast with Guacamole with Orange Jam Pecan Jack. My friend said the great thing about it was the price, but that's about it. Regardless of the specials or the atmosphere of the restaurant, it's $10 for two 3 gal. two free appetizers, two chips and a beer, and free dessert. One of the other two specials was a $5.99 dinner ticket, so the price, but very affordable.Overall, a great
restaurant place. You can get some warm and natural soda but I don't have time to drive out. Really? Love it!
Excellent food, a decent wine list and very informative wine list. See about my next dinner!
How delicious. Again. This place is BYOB. There isn't a bad spot, just like I'm assured they will. The bowl of good food isn't huge. When I walk in, they pull over their own car while I drive by. This is where they charge me $50 per person for one person and less than a $300 person for two people.
Ah yes, Chicago's Sweet Chutzpah! The vibe and service definitely make Chicago their home, especially at New Year's.  What an amazing way to enjoy summer vacation and always have a good time!
Fantastic place, great pizza and Italian dishes! Great food, pleasant atmosphere, and atmosphere friendly.
Don't go near the Brewhouse! 
restaurant and included a table of appetizers and desserts. I went to the Geist karaoke room for dinner and I had a special order for Cheezy (I didn't see this one but it was homemade and tastes like it was good fried meat). I took the special order and enjoyed my special order because I thought it was the best I had ever had.
I love the sushi course for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I order the Nana sashimi's and have tried a few different cuts and it is quick and easy. My family members have loved their guacamole sundae for their birthday, and my fiance and I love the extensive menu that has everything that is related to that.The dining room has always been fun for us as we waited in line and tried everything from seafood and fresh seaweed to savory seafood and sausages. The seating is spacious, and has great large windows on the north side to make a giant sound on
restaurant by Chef Chris, Adam, Aril, Doug, Chris Campbell, Brianne and Doug Hayden. Only wish you could take the time to contact each other and this is another huge success.Chef Chris, Adam, Aril, Doug, Chris Campbell, Brianne and Doug Hayden.

This place is one of the few to have the best pizza. The only two servers are the Italian and the artisan who just chided me that they didn't have pizza for me. The pizza is amazing and the atmosphere is friendly and friendly to anyone we need it to be. Definitely very popular.
What I want to say is that I highly recommend the El Melo Donut. I cannot believe how delicious they are! I just love how they have steaks!!! This place is super disappointing, they actually kept every seat empty at the end of the day because it doesn't look appetizing
restaurant's experience was fantastic. You can feel free to order a beer. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. You can order coffee for just the right price. And after an hour they really understand how you want to feel and are always helpful.  We even went with 5 of our friends who paid very well when we went there and the food was wonderful and totally worth the wait.
Wow, now it's been over 2 years.  It was $8.95 per person so it was perfect for making a reservation.  The wait was much longer and we're not used to drinking until I get on a bus which I do when I want to stay longer.  You can only have 4 friends at a time.  It is sad and disappointing that most of our friends, and therefore all our families, have reservations.  That is why I left.  It is frustrating to know, I only leave when I like it too.  Sorry or not, $8.
restaurant is less than 1:30 and slow.  This staff is rude.  They take your order and when you are asked if you have your order yet again, they tell you to wait for 45 minutes.  The wait is about 30 minutes.
One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.  Food is excellent.  The food is very fresh and is usually perfect.  Service and attitude is friendly and attentive.
NOVEMBER EXPERIENCE!  Best location, best food.
I love the Big Nap and also love that the quail plant is a small variety. My mom keeps the sampler right up to date with the crust you get at the plate.  I love the variety and good prices!
I made a small reservation this past week for my husband's birthday dinner. The service was not as good as expected. We had a lengthy table after a solid meal, which was unacceptable. It was literally 'breaking the deal' to have a birthday
restaurant is rarely anything special; they serve everything from chocolate and chocolate fudge to ice cream without breaking a sweat. It's still a true celebration. (Big tip -- because they have some classic signature cocktails in the back.)
I love this place so much that I spent a great deal of money on the food itself, including their cheese fries, milkshakes and salad bars.  If you live in Chicago, you'll definitely love this place!   Even if you don't have a reservation.   My only regret was that the prices are so high.  The only thing to do is to make reservations.  Although, it's not at the service level that's more satisfying.  When they order food they order just enough, and when they ask for, they usually do their perfect, speedy delivery.  Unfortunately, all that, plus more tourists, means you're gonna be spending 20 bucks for one, two or three portions.  And, of course,
restaurant, starlets and fries. The only thing that makes this restaurant great is that if you love chocolate, the chef always knew how to pull it off. Even though this is the last time I've been to China, I'll be back again in a heartbeat. The specialties are the best (they take flavors different than yours) and the food is always on point. Don't forget that my girlfriend loves Orange Banana, and she always misses dining in Europe!
Delicious!  The decorations are beautiful and the place is warm and cozy.  It was great when I made a reservation and it was quickly confirmed by someone who received my order.  The dogs that I had there were very friendly, did a great job of feeding the food.  It was a bit pricey, but the food was all they could offer.  It was a great place for a walkout, family afternoon or evening.  I have been coming here for a couple years and it makes it

The staff at Schotenland's does it great! A very nice place to go and gawk at steaks/fish in great views! Excellent wine selection, too!
This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago!   Worship like god and roast food is brought to you by the amazing owner Niki!
The best sushi place in the city....
restaurant.  In the space, it was unlike any restaurant I had ever gone to.  The buffet was awesome, but some of the details were pretty unimpressive.  I would have just picked up a fish buffet when I went there.  I would have never gone back if this was near my apartment.
Been going there for the last 7 years, and since when has my dog, Fray, been waiting for me there? Love him!
Food from one of our favorite places on the block. Expect to pay more than their best.  Been here 2 years and still have never had the taste buds of a reservation.  Expect top notch wine selections and amazing service from local wines. Will definitely return to this place again.
If you're thinking about going here, go to Cappadocia Wine & Bistro.  One of the most inventive and twisty restaurants in all of Chicago!  Definitely check it out if you're looking
restaurant wasn't able to act as I thought it would. The complimentary hot dogs and dessert were hard to get because I didn't have the falafel on the menu. The girlfriend and I were the only ones at the table. The waiter was very polite and helpful in our experience. He was very picky and personal, but attentive and professional. And this is when I discovered we had been there for over a month with no question to ask about the place. This place is nothing like anything I've ever seen. The food is top notch and I definitely recommend it. I also got to try one of the remaining, nachos. Very warm as the salad bar with crepes was not tamales and it was very disappointing as far as not having any wine in it. Service was high in the rainground restaurants, small temperature saucers and those are what average pizza gets. Yes, a large pizza means this is a very fresh, new pizza and you can get
restaurant with big breakfast and big lunch to finish the evening, we were given a smaller menu than usual. My wife and I sampled the brunch menu and ordered two dishes and enjoyed their salad truffle and specialty 'ham cracker cake'. There was nothing spectacular about my experience, but the best part was the really good menu of prices, selection, and product.
good food, parking!i've been here a few times, but my friend complained about the service and was always stuck in there waiting tables for their next meal!
Went here on a Saturday night last Friday night for my birthday.   My husband and I sat at our table with the lovely management and told them that we wanted to take our shower and we wanted to go to the grocery store for 4 hours.      The manager was so nervous that the one not inside knew what to do.                    
restaurant never let me down, you never heard about it...
I was sitting there in a large room, thinking that this would be my next date...and by the time my bartender started talking to us, she had already told us her plan.  We were excited, but we told her we would be late to come and wanted to cancel our reservation.  When she suggested that she still get our date's attention, she laughed and apologized to us.  Even though we really did regret it and were happy that she was nicer, I would still take a date with another girl I love.  She was terrible at keeping us away from her girlfriend but I think she had some good intentions.
I had heard from several people that Dave's Style Haus is one of the best Italian restaurants in Chicago.  They don't follow the rules and constantly changed food selections for us at 6-9pm.   However, they always have good options and good food.  On
restaurant is a huge o. on the roll of top notch chef, especially the Cheese Jam!!  All that said, all in all it was THE BEST BEER EVER!!!
First I needed to give my server a big fat cheeze. And in my mind, that's not good! I just loved the service and the food. You will probably go back to Ebert if you want to re-try the Crock Pot Mac & Cheese Sandwich.
Just went to Gid and was greeted very well.  When I inquired if there is anything special, she responded that they don't know what it is yet.  I then asked if there is anything else for me to talk about.  When asked if she's got anything for me to talk about, she answered...I'll wait for her check.  Really, I thought the waiter gave her 10 stars because they can never bring in really good money, but she was right.  In fact, the place
restaurant will give your location location a 5 star rating. The fabulous atmosphere will surely please you. Go immediately if you are on a night out and be sure to check it out.
Nice location that does not take long to get to, nice service.  Waitstaff never seem to really appreciate that.  My favorite place in the city for Cuban food.
Best place for coming from Chicago with a group or an intimate dinner that includes some adventurous meats.  Food is perfect.  It is a fun experience for all. I have heard about several other bussers out there, but never had anything that was more enjoyable.  The food is not as great as your average 'big city lunch place' would make you think.  The prices are cheap for high end fare, but not onerous or expensive.  Overall a great place to go if you just want an exotic chef, and if you want the only real advantage to this place is you have that amazing unique environment
restaurant" like I did, but it was really what it seemed, brought to you by amazon. I was recommended by karysoft yesterday for her tour of the house on Long Island.  She found it and was really nice about it.  My niece likes to eat at them so much she has only visited at full cost.  For all the potatoes and salads I think it's really great they use meatier squash instead of beef, and they give you cheap salads with a vegetable side!  The prices are decent and yummy.  And to top things off I was very impressed with their fries.  They have so many great ones that I'll be back.  Good deal on mussels though.
THE BEST AGAIN COLD DIE STORE I've ever had.  Not only do you get something like breakfast and a ton of instant coffee  every day (we don't make the trek down the SFO from Yuma), but you have three
restaurant and appetizer served up ahead of time. We still thought we had had a good time, but when we got there, it was very crowded. I'd suggest going earlier if you're under 20. The food was ok, but not anything special.
Don't let the fact that you cant have a better sushi place on the block (anything more than worth it) fool you. A bowl of Nana's tamari sushi was perfect and the chicharrones were the nicest. The band with rainbow florals, which can be easily enjoyed by any two people, was also fantastic.  My own favorite staff member is amazing! We ordered the Avocado Pad and it was delicious! What a killer chicken for such an otherwise excellent lunch joint. It also tasted like we had been shittled under a chainsaw. The mussels for the  Turkish Sausage was also amazing!
Friend/family here always is so knowledgeable of a variety of things
restaurant - chef butler had one that was ok but added extra toppings and desserts. Delicious!
The reviewers I talked to were pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it and that they are trying very hard to get anything they could get. The food is already out of our mind.
Most Asian restaurants are about good foods.  But unfortunately for the corn tortilla, the Hot Tuna was great.  I have never had a better.  I will never return for another.
I will not go back.  They have made my meal of falafel and ham.  My boyfriend just won the Best Dinners ever and we will never go back.  I hope they open a new location.  The chefs are ok.  I can only hope they try someplace else like Marsa.
The food here is nice and friendly, the staff is always very nice and friendly and it's easier to go to a restaurant with the same level of people and
restaurant. The food here is excellent (my friends ordered the signature lime, broccoli quail, marinara sauce, & balsamic dill add-ins in the other items they ordered). I will definitely be back!
This is the best burger EVER!!! From the special one with the burritos to the caviar. This place is soooo fresh. Great drinks and good service.
Finally yelpers noticed that I tried their new guacamole dessert. I definitely recommend visiting and going to the swank places.
Best twist on free college pizza in Chicago!  Also no delays!
Disgraceful place!  Long line, not worth wasting your time.  Horrible food, too many dead guy dicks.  The customer service is ugh!  Everyone in the kitchen has slight dirty looks that you can barely spot from the top of their teeth.  Try serving them to their friends and family when they take off their d
restaurant is clearly limited and simply brags that they serve an unlimited number of options. Some places also lie about the location. The service is more substandard. I wish they had expanded it or gotten rid of it entirely. Don't get me wrong, the food is excellent, but prices are ridiculous. The employees were so incompetent that I actually went into a sandwich shop to get some. In fact, the only way I can make it up to them is if they take my money and hire less crappy employees. I realize this would be a better business plan if they would hire some "emporium jewel" to treat my complaints and complaints, which I really wish they didn't do. If they thought there were some type of danger in the restaurant it would create a special meaning and a whole new pricepoint to deal with when writing your restaurant review.We would suggest people go over to Tripp Voodoo-- their place would be totally empty.I'm glad that their owner was
restaurant item was delicious. A bit pricey, but that's ok, the prices are lower than you would think. The food is my favorite. It is decent - if somewhat speakeasy - I guess some of my favorites are:
I love bacon fratelli. Great bread with a little smoked ham.  They also have buffalo chicken on their menu.  It's one of my favorite dish and it just made me crave more of it.  Their flavor is right out of the can.  You must try this place.I do not know who the owner is but I definitely like there amazing burgers and the vegetable portions are huge.   Ours is probably not the place to do this for yourself but feel free to write me or send me a check  where you can just tell me about where you live.
Had the culinary version of the pizza. Worth the wait because the food was very good and absolutely delicious. The carne asada was the best.
restaurantie here.  Also, the kids at The Zoo on Askins Hollow have phenomenal food and music.
We have always enjoyed the Peanut-i-Pumpkin pancakes, they were great, and finally my husband and I were able to relax in the quiet corner and take in the unique food that the menu offers.  We would definitely make an evening trip again and again.
First stop was the Fried Charcuterie. The meat on the bone was fantastic, and the eggs were cooked from the tendernent meat in the crock pot. In addition, the French Margherita was a must.  I only had 2 courses (Golp Zasset and L'Aix - great portions, but it is what it is).  Overall, happy to return again for another occasion.
Poke night is a mainstay of the dining room.  When i eat here my advice is to try the Giordano's pizzas and pizz
restaurant tastes like an Italian noodle joint without being rushed.
Absolutely wonderful food and ambiance. We had a party of about 20 at the start of January and a great time making reservations. We will come back and check it out soon. Thanks guys.
A piece of shit place that made for an enjoyable experience. I have only been to Chicago before but was absolutely disgusted by the service and price.I love this place because of the food and atmosphere.
I really wish the food would be better. The lamb steak. In the same reason that Steaktown has awesome beer lists at its door, this place is worth a visit. The beers are awesome (both in terms of flavor and some other) - can't compare to any of the beers in Chicago. The beer selection is mind-boggling and worth coming back for.
After I finished going to an establishment in the corner of Leppola and Second Ave, I had the opportunity to meet me on
restaurant, I had to ask if I could order the dessert. If I haven't been before, do you guys know what dessert is? So we each ordered a pie with 2 slices of parmesan cheese and melted ice to eat. I sent a couple packages with appetizer and dessert and I received the mango mango quiche, a special grilled chocolate side, different mung bean cake and a mix of fine chocolate syrup and coffee. I LOVE you honeycomb honeycomb!!! So cool! I am sure that nobody would have come here to eat anything but when it came to fine dessert - THE ORDER!Yummmmmmm just the right amount to have for you!
This place is insanely good! The food is amazing!  There is also a seperate juice bar to pick from!  The staff is amazing.  I think that was nice to know and definitely fill a space up!
This place is stuffed in memory...I dont know what I felt like I was
restaurant/art project. I was intrigued by his inventive food and much the same. I went with the 4/5, and the staff was generous and the atmosphere was fun. The noise was great, but overall very unique. We were in for a wonderful day. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!
Had this place at the extreme end of the first edition of Frontera Grill, and loved the girl with the steak. My daughter and I started we TUMBLR. The food is phenomenal. The parking area is full, but they now have a lot of space. It was a true great experience! We only had the tamarind burger but my daughter also loved the ambiance. No baklava here... it was really decadent. The service was great, but the food never delivered. I recommend this place to everyone who has been to Frontera Grill, and they need to take care of its owner.
I really enjoyed the
restaurant for all!I had a dish to celebrate with my son and took it home and there was nothing in the house, just the top of the head by my table! And as soon as I left the restaurant I was ecstatic. It was not until the third act of dinner that I realize it was the only dish that went down in the manager's speech. (Whenever he has a change of heart, he usually likes something up his sleeve!) What a shame about this. We all went with the family, and no doubt we ended up having fun.As we arrived for our next bite, we made our way over to Do- it! The waiter had one in his host's room but said nothing about whether it was properly ready or not, and our waiter had to ask his reservations. We had to leave and head over to the Andover place to pick up our food! Once we were home the night before my birthday, it was our turn to eat it! Do-
restaurant, though we were told it was in a busy area.
This place is out of this world. When I arrived the wait was total! After all the big food rolls and dishes and hearty salads I have never ordered more at this place. The waitress was nice, but not friendly. I wish she did. I cannot recall the last time we have had dinner with such a fine server. It was incredibly complicated, but fun to sit down and have your dinner with a friend. We ordered more than food, and my friend got the extra salad special, which really is insane. The waitress did make the mistake of making an unnecessary mistake by getting my own appetizer in, and then leaving the quantity alone for whatever reason. She could have dealt with it very easily, but left it in the salad for another reason. She assured me that she would probably get rid of the offending item, and made no such mistake. What about the fries? When we ordered that they were from
restaurant - Food was alright but I was sick with stomach pains and I came here hoping it would be someplace to meditate. There was nothing like a braised beef restaurant to get your stomach hurt. I love this place, but my friends should do the same.
I had a nice meal tonight.  I've been there twice now and I got a turkey.  It was phenomenal and I thought it would have been ok, but it wasn't for the price.The reason I was disappointed was that I had the nicest meal I've had.  Service was good.I don't really know why they have the $75ish tab on their menu.  Also, even though the book was nice, I wasn't excited to see the gorgeous dresser that was an absolute insult to what I'm here to eat.  I wanted the dresser dresser and I was disappointed.
I have been to a lot of cocktail bars and the mimosas are great
restaurant.
I'll recommend the Husky Popper Sandwich, the signature neighborhood of gluten-free eggs and gravy, not the bustling, hip, relaxed diner. Or even the place. Try it yourself and get a free soda at the bar.
This place is a huge hit with the community - the steakhouse runs on the gravy.  I went there at 2 pm and received a packed meal before moving on, but once I was seated the flavors of the onion rings were awesome.  Enjoy!
I was a regular at yummy Big Duck Lettuce with my husband and their horchata dish, but they had a very spicy side and couldn't beat the sweet starches they had with their spicy eggs.  The tasting menu is filled with nice meals, and I think this is probably the best.  The service was great, and the food came out very quickly.  I didn't get the menu of dogs/cat/whatever they serve,
restaurant, but he, Jonny Cheesesteak, Kim Klaas and Shango roasted at their new place are all extremely healthy. Food isn't incredible. The bandit roasts are a bit gourmet and our waitress (Gina) was amazing, but the salt was a bit overdone. The "whole" crust, which I honestly think most importantly was worth it was not great. I will not miss this place again!
I've lived in Chicago from around the block, and I have never had a bar in my life (other than that 90 minutes long trek to the patio). The pizza is extraordinary! The only complaint I have is the experience. By experience, I mean walking in with a-roasted steak at a terrible pizza place where they serve complete beers, salads, and foie gras! My server is always really nice. She is always standing right next to me in the front! I haven't really been able to take my
restaurant....awesome food...the bartenders were amazing....just great....dinner was under $20!
For lunch, we tried the calamari dinner and the drizzle cake.  All in all, it was definitely worth it.  It wasn't too cold out in the summer (like other locations in downtown) and the prices were fairly reasonable.  They also use excellent authentic torta latte and their fresh produce selection makes for a great surprise.
I just ordered a toothpick a couple of years ago and will never again.  I will try next time that I have a new friend.  They call the chef-paw Rufus and this time they will always recommend him!  Best advice I ever gave.  They can really give you huge, really good ribs for $6 with rice and there are plenty to try on the way.  Our server took great care of my kitchen.  I've had hepas and it was wonderful.
restaurant. Very good, but definitly not worth the wait for the odd move.
Had a lucky night at Texas Tea House.  It's amazing.I've been to several restaurants with the same name.  Everyone loved the people as much as I have.  But I think the staff is bawling their eyes out.We stopped at a couple of times to check out, and also played around with cupcakes and truffle oil.  Nice places to watch a football game and hang out with your party.  If there's something very special, it's coffee; otherwise, miss Texas Tea House.  Go here.
a place like so many others i know and that   should have been the only place i could stand like that, try the frog salad i made my birthday night in which i had  mango watermelon crepes and tomato tacos and coriander croquettes and a side of melted ginger tea that i left the dining room with
restaurant and sommelier on Monday, Oct. 5. (Chris Dunning, also the manager, raised his hat to remind guests that the house was so thoroughly cleaned and remodeled that even staff members were shocked)
Salads here are great, but are not if you want to get any more entrees. I really enjoyed the caviar at the bar, but they haven't improved anything since the '70s. They seem to be busy and have nothing for any of their own appetizers in the tasting room. We recommend this place again, especially if you are going to go this weekend.
My fiancee had the Chicken Parmesan Cauliflower Salad last night. It was FANTASTIC! They had many different vegetables in the dressing. And the tomato sauce was exceptional too. Next time I will try something new and try the Peppers.
Plants here are always delicious, and the crusty plates are consistently great. Service at Lincoln Park is also great
restaurant. The staff, owners and purveyors are up to par - much better than you are getting anywhere else in the city. As for their cheese, I have not got them   either - whatever the case. I am hoping that every diner had a choice in cheese or the six, seven, eight hours waiting before breakfast.
Went with my friend and she got 6 burgers. We ate there for the 5th anniversary of our birthday and it was excellent.  We only had a break and were expecting a 45% boost in value!  We will definitely be back for the best hamburger food in Chicago.
The best Vietnamese food in Chicago! Great service and "Best On". I work at 760 Park, North Sixth Ave.
Excellent service by Bartender is just right.  Fantastic smoothies, great prices, great selection (all throughout the area), all over the place with wonderful ambiance.  Nice attitude. Will be back.

restaurant menus are pretty much the same as when you buy an organic food. Service at such a restaurant can take a turn when they allow server hailing. Maybe this is one of the few options in Chicago, but they've lost the button for the pretty bland classic thingier that is the Grill Supper.We had the bruschetta pizza pizza, it was delicious but we'd still recommend to you not going there because the pizza is high priced, not cheap and the toppings for both of the pizza are even better, just don't get the vegetable broth. They also have such things as black beans and yummy tomatoes which would just be a disappointment.Well my review really caught on with vegetarians and vegans alike who are keeping up. Their foods are not as bland and not as packed with flavor, but it's worth the one or two star's on their menu, especially if you find yourself eating in the grill area, only to find out that there is such
restaurant is more spacious than ours. The big plate is very nice.  I would definitely go back once they have a great atmosphere.
Went to La Palma today. Food was ok and the meat was really good. However, not as tasty and cheesy as we have come to expect. Will return to La Palma.
Had brunch with my husband on Sunday night on Lincoln Square - great food and service but not spectacular service.  Our friends complained that we weren't used to the crowds but it seemed they cared more about their prices for the experience and didn't mind us going.
Good place for people wanting their sweet home for Valentine's Day.  My husband loves this place.  We can drink in the basket for dessert.  They have that special chocolaty food called Ginger Ale.  We had that with our mom at first.  The good part is we asked for her and the girl was awesome.
Pretty good atmosphere with plenty of seating
restaurant with sausage and homemade carnitas. You can tell that Spence for 30 is as amazing as anything. Here is a few:
Michael's Cafe is great with super small tables, but another nice place is at 735 other times.  I love the greasy green eggs. I try them for the ingredients and the crusty cookie with the cheese icing was fun. Definitely do the Ethiopian roll.
My first visit to Sausage Cafe was over 4 years ago at Halloween night, which was great! I had the Best Oktoberfest the week before which included both the outdoor gathering, the Saturday night, and the occasional Winter/Fall Party event! A chance to hang out and share tasty food, wine, and candy with new friends was a big plus! I still call it Spasse (thanks so much!), but I will definitely go back for the Beer Bar. I would definitely come back here for drinks!
Wow, this place has it all! The
restaurant would not make a difference... but that's all it is...
The first time I went to this food was at a bar in Chicago, USA. I had been to all the restaurants in town and it was completely crazy. The food was to die for, and the service was rude... someone wanted to throw a duck on me because the duck was limp.  When I was assured that the duck was literally under the stress of a soupy hot potato sparge, I was mortified. I must be missing something!And in return, the seafood was too good for my taste. I didn't want my fish to become out of water or grit...it was a food. I could not remember the colors, the texture, or even the fact that the cole slaw came from a duck. Nothing of value. I was quite fond of it but not someone to recommend it...the other 1 and 2 were outstanding... beyond basic.
Well, we went on
restaurant. So nice!
I am actually not a big fan of pretzel pops or jerk roll de cuisine, but I did love the Blue Cheese Shrimp salad. Well, not all things that can ever beat those rare and delicious pigtails!  I guess I want to go back and try it, but with American Beauty, too.
Being southern folk we decided to try this place during our weekday week.  Its fair to say the food was horrible...the service was terrible and I really don't care about the people there. They just kept finding and re-stopping reservations and emails.  We decided to give this place some time to find new friends and try out its new location before coming back.  We were always in great mood and have been ever since we moved to Carlsbad from Gotez.  This place deserves a 5 star for their service.
Aw, don't be sitting on the porch and asking people if they're back for Thanksgiving
restaurant and an awesome Meryton martini pairing with an espresso bar. If you love pizza or pasta you can go without having to break the bank with a Crêpes Salad. It's a good bread with wonderful Greek crust. They are even providing delivery to your door for free. I want to go to long walks all the time.
Big Dig was very very bad.  They had a couple hamburgers.  I thought the mixed meats were OK, but I think it was just oil and nothing.  We had a table of 1 of the 8 delicious, easy to eat lunch items.  I got the salad bar.   Oh and it only cost $2.   I've had about 30 salads here and there, and they are great with only the chives and cheese.  The bread is good but is not crunchy.  The wine selection is not great.  All in all it was a terrible experience.  I would not go
restaurant - We will not be going back here. Everything i ordered was amazing.  Service is great, as always, thank you so much.
If your looking for quality and presentation, visit: OpenTable or PaaSrHOLBY!if your looking for a dining experience try Please from 1-3/4 available. Pick your budget and do yourself a favor by setting a location for your table. we will sit down for dinner at the bar.
From beginning to end it has been the BEST sushi bar in Chicago!!!  i eat here everyday and i cant wait to try it again!!
I love this place.  I love Chicago and want to go again.  Thats why I go here for my birthday dinner.  Love it.  Too bad you guys didn't stop by to wait!
Jazzy food and a great atmosphere.
Wow! I just love hipster restaurant. When you're going to order a cup of coffee,
restaurant would be a tiny bit expensive (before $35). But it was worth the extra charge, we sat at the table and ate almost everything we ordered. I had my vegan pepper jack steak. I knew that I would love it, but I also knew I would go back if I went a little more unusual.Now, this past weekend I brought my friends to our wedding banquet. We had a group of 15 who had been wanting to bring back that sweet anniversary restaurant item and needed a seat.  After waiting more than 5 hours, we sat at the tables, drove around the restaurant and waited.  Our group came to a stop just to get the best experience.  There were a lot of amazing options at the coffee bar and it was extremely important to find a table to come with us!  Once we sat, the food was ready and we moved on to the next part of the feast.Our party of 4 had a party of 15 (each had a 2 person
restaurant at the same place. I am from Michigan and when I work there is a large wait for my sushi here.  For sushi I try different spots. The chef keeps an eye on what's left and then draws a big line across the kitchen to make sure nothing eats up the space.  The place gets so crowded with everyone trying different dishes we try to get to our table at an awkward place with dishes sitting still or moving like the threshers it gets busy.  It's never clean and overpriced.
Excellent service. Hostess and waitress are solid all around but I would definitely recommend this place to someone at home on the West Coast.  For as good as this place is, they also have a few more items that are often.They use recycled high grade Brazilian veggie meat. I have been looking for a place to eat Brazilian cheese in the South Loop but I was disappointed and thought I would try it.The big issue was the food. While it
restaurant... It's awesome!!
I love this place, my favorite of all the places in Chicago.  Have not been to Buffalo yet, but I would definitely recommend them to anyone that knows them. I also LOVE all the small groups they get to try.  If you have a sweet tooth, like me, this place should just be the best!
Chocolate Mill Jamboree might as well be the most delicious food I have ever eaten...or at least I could go up to 5 years ago and eat it.  It was my first time there and we were thrilled!  The food is amazing and unlike most restaurants I have tried, I am pretty stoked for the whole family of 2!   We do wish they could use some of their leftover beans for table refills and maybe a bit of their new soup.  The portions are huge - and very small.  Prices are usually very reasonable.
Love this place and I will go again. I
restaurant: The idiom 'oucanbella waiters', would likely offend a great deal if they recognized this service and an almost non-existent service. The service was stellar and the store manager and staff were excellent. The staff was the absolute make-or-break mix of perfection. It's not the coffee that makes my brain drool, but the simple idea that a café should offer a slightly more exceptional run to a place where it truly is good.
For some reason I couldn't have gotten a better special occasion meal here.  They were far too short.  The hostess gave out a little too many flavor notes and chose to serve them in butter instead.  It took about 5 hours for each serving.  Waiters were passing out alcohol then they were looking very obviously intoxicated, their plates were not steaming hot enough.  When I started there were 7 people waiting waiting in line.  Luckily, the cabbages were unappetizing.
restaurant service. The food was quick and fresh and the portion to spare you a meal was plentiful.Our waiter, James Ann, brought the place out to us today after all our parties left. What an unbelievable experience. The lady in the face would give you names if you heard, "you may not have appreciated our banquet." She answered us politely and one of her requests for a reservation to take her husband was an autograph but I am not a celebrity the way I should have been. Our waitress even offered to make breakfast free and we were not even able to order pancakes and french toast or bread at this very moment. The restaurant you walk through is packed and at times the waitstaff will run at a standstill but you can't afford to complain and come back for another table. I am over his and want a reservation and that would NOT be what it would be if there was one. I am just disappointed and a lost cause considering that I helped him with his experience.
restaurant. An interesting place to begin with, and I highly recommend it.
We only went here for lunch, it was much cheaper, and our server seemed much better in his previous cookout place. She used to come here to meet our guests and again this time they came for drinks. Yummmmm. The food is horrible. I have never had any reservations before, when the plates were larger and the delivery guy came with a huge knife to cut the dishes in the floor. He really, really screwed himself up, really on my menu. The Service was very unfriendly and rude, and the reviews were horrible. Service really annoys customers, they seem so unfriendly, and if you go to a place where everyone else wants to impress you, just skip in, please, go.
Great. I tried it here on my birthday on a weeknight.  The staff is very friendly and they do a nice job making sure the food is good and fresh
restaurant. Maybe it's a tad over the top, but my Ethiopian friends and I have to get to some of the better Ethiopian food that's out there, so we can enjoy all of it! All in all, it's a wonderful place to go for lunch, get a cup of coffee and try some special Ethiopian food.
Hot dogs and all the people there are amazing.
One of my favorite chains around in Chicago. It is one of the largest hipster/marinate places in Chicago.  The prices are incredibly cheap, but I have been there since day one and I've been to three other places before!
There's nothing like the great casual experience that I've been wanting. For four of us, the sushi is great and the chicken and veggie dishes are a must try. Atmosphere is cozy and relaxing. The menu seems friendly and the staff is friendly and will be willing to help you with your sushi journey.
Wonderful food!! You only
restaurant(s) in the big city. Yum! If you're an avid go-to truffle lover, this place will probably give you a pop if you have the capacity. Service is stellar, and the food is great too.  I really don't want to give out too many words, but hopefully the meal will be worth it.  We'll definitely be back.
Fries have been the highlight of my visit to this place!  I had the lobsters a couple times and everyone else who ordered a plate had the fries as well.  the wait was fantastic. I cannot wait to come back!
Shrimp all over the place, is unreal! 5 Stars!!!My friend and I went for the night and it was delicious and easygoing.  The scallops were okay but not yummy and the garlic beef was ok.  Good friends and I also had the salmon take out after night and it was a very good dish, ok overall
restaurant, fondue and book, so they deliver freshness and style to any room from a varied selection of tables, chairs and comfy chairs. As the year went on and the staff got better and better, and I am always amazed with how much we get to enjoy our visitors and their food.  Please tell others on my restaurant page that we will never be able to stop with a service like that in our kitchen.  Don't forget to share us with a friend in their neighborhood so they can enjoy lunch later for their family and friends!
I couldn't be more pleased with my stay here today.  This place is a great spot for an awesome breakfast and dinner.  Our server was very prompt to give us everything I ordered. The breakfast was DELICIOUS.  Thank God our server (spoke English with great compassion) was back to his business!  Service was good, and the waiters were generous.  If you like their food you won
restaurant and gourmet food plus fantastic dining and for a great price.  As an ex-surveyor, a truly wonderful owner, and an amazing member of the staff, this little strip club is an area for serendipitous burritos.  The only reason you want to visit it is that it's so that you will only experience its authentic blend of innovative fusion (alsa), premium food, and deluxe brunch options.
I really enjoyed the parking at Burgos, especially when I walked out. I wish the owner had made sure my new mama and kids were in my car before I left. (Check out this The Vegnasty item on the 'Nanny & Charlie' website, it is a fantastic pan dish for both people who live near Burgos and those who are not.) They are at the very back of the building for the dog pit and are consistently working hard. As the owner grew and started chatting with more people in their
restaurant is also all that we desire! I had the kobold salad ($7.50 for dinner) and it was wonderful! The restaurant has a great atmosphere but is definitely the tastiest in Chicago!
My sister had a good and very exciting experience at the NYE. We ordered the Margherita, which is served right in front of us as soon as we were seated. It is not terribly chunky, and the bread was delicious. The pasta was also amazing, however, it was kinda good. My favorite part of the experience was the fact that we got our meal at a more upscale venue because the rest of the restaurant was tiny and closed off so we could eat ourselves.We settled down at the vegetarian option because I had found the restaurant to be low end and cheap.
Great pizza, quality food and service. There was a great twist on the traditional Giordano's menu from a culinary point of view. The pizza is deep, authentic, and
restaurant area. Having been here twice I had never been disappointed by the atmosphere and the environment.  I went and sat at a table nearby the DJ which at first seemed like a good place for an entertainer when I heard a click on the keyboard that lit my candles for the song.  It took almost 45 minutes before they came out on the next street to ask for my name but they had no clue what my name was.  It took just 45 minutes to deliver my request which came after two coffee shakers - which I called and came back.  At the end of the day the chairs were nowhere to be seen - a moment of very slow, monotonous dancing by myself and a couple dancing below my feet.  There were too many human faces in there.  Seriously, I asked all the tables to stop dancing and just politely go back to the restaurant with me and expect I could hear from them at least twice.  The star of the show was the fact
restaurant/lunch menu. In the past it has been with little regard for taste, with chicken and steak different from next door, even though we will never go back. This place has gone from being one of my favorite restaurants in the country and is now the hit house to take over the entertainment industry and the people who are behind it.There is nothing to say I didn't do that job.The ambiance is great. Very comfortable and the ambiance is usually so cute.I would totally come back again.
I came here a few weeks ago, to enjoy myself and to share some new experiences with my friends at Girlfriend's Pizza.   Best Womens Bar in Chicago since the Rush Hour!!  What I really enjoyed about the place was the food.  Everything about it was great and we loved it as well as our four friends in the waiting room.  The fact that one and every detail is unique and simply is an addition to any experience 
restaurant is out-of-town. It's much better than brunch but not our downfall. The food here does not disappoint, and the flavors here are extraordinary.
Bao Jiao is really great! They are prepared high quality not cheap.  The food and service is excellent too.  If you get a large amount of wine and you want to try a different side for the entire party then they have the right right cocktail selection.  If you haven't already tried the duck specials try it on the way home.
This place is pretty much flawless for what it is.   It doesn't really have a ton of cash--just the bit of weirdly reeking booze that can be found on the wall.  Everything is so fresh, fresh and casual that its a great casual place to hit a few drinks and chat, eat, go...if you're in a hurry.  Maybe that would be more appropriate but it really is such a good place to drop
restaurant above the bar, but it's still great.
I have to say that this is by far the best pizza ever! And the wings were fantastic! They added an amazing spiciness, especially to one of the portions! Great I have not had a spoon on a mac and cheese pizza, but I could never stop trying these wings!
Do the best pizza in the city! I love the strong garlic and pasta and the sweet crepes. The sandwich is also excellent as well.
I am my new favorite dining experience in Chicago.  A Christmas Eve for me, I was able to catch an hour and a half of byob.   As I had come with the order of 'Apricot' chicken not so hot and I could not wait.  For the price I paid, I couldn't go wrong.  The ambiance was wonderful.  Very creative in the meats, the drinks were highly-aided and the desserts were fresh and sav
restaurant, roundhouse, bathroom, and library. We would highly recommend this place.
This is my favorite pizza place in Chicago. While not without its faults, the pizza does work. The owners are knowledgeable and attentive. And by far the best! I came back for my birthday which is going to be huge because my boyfriend and I are based here. We all wish they changed the menu, but they have great pizza all the time, and our food was simply fantastic. I am also a fan of Alinea and there are endless pizza menu options.
I had the Pita Cacción for breakfast and it was truly the best dinner i've had, the portions were very small and the service was quick and friendly. No complaints there, just quality and service.  Got our Shrimp on the wings...a delightful experience.  I'd recommend pescatlo an extra.
OK...I will be back for more food (including a bread), but this place
restaurant on weekends, my colleagues had a week-and-a-half to relax and make it worth the wait.  We had the noggin pizza, and the lamb sausage, appetizers, sandwiches, appetizers, and salad bar.We thought that what we were getting was good, they did not have to find out about the event. I will definetly be back, as I would come back for the music night.
Great sushi, excellent service..ways to go for a romantic night out!
Great food, service, and value for your money!  Wish they would have just said,'see if we're open soon' or 'Let's not bother'?! I love to go here.  They just keep on giving us more and more crazy great food so I can eat myself to perfection!  The flavor of the bar is so fun.
This place is worth the price you're paying for it.  Great addition to the list of
restaurant will make you forget about the dishes for all the deliciousness and realize that the place needs to become bigger!
Recently I was exploring Chinese restaurant in downtown Chicago.  Their dishes are pretty great, the staff is excellent, there is a lot of variety and the food is very appetizing.  I am a HUGE fan of the pork belly because it is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to and I know it is not going to go down as a classic if you want it right! I want my Vietnamese food to be different and not forgotten.  The employees are really accommodating as well and can give you a very good personality.  Definitely a place to have a quick meal!
Richevy, with very nice prices, great atmosphere & fantastic brunch menu. Two star rating for breakfast brunch!
Been over  many times, but loved this place.  This place opened back in 1992 so some it was all it was for.  I think they
restaurant" (others speaking only for themselves) isn't in this building (but I know, it's hard to ignore that when talking about Popeyes).  They serve dinner at the small chain, which is their mom's favorite.  Don't go.  The food is great and very tasty, but people aren't quite so enticed by the food as others.  The vibe is a bit different from the movie music.  They also have a lot of older faces (like Charles Laughton).  Also, and most interesting--they have a lot of florals, too.  The size of the place is something to behold, and you can get in and out too, and everyone is so busy--one person on foot (not counting the restaurant manager) is simply traveling back and forth between the hostesses.
This place is absolutely wonderful.  The prices have gotten better and better every time I try it.  The staff has always been friendly,
restaurant you'll enjoy. Our staff is friendly and patient. How could they say we're a local foodie's paradise?
No one said "wait for someone to finish it." No person was unwell during a class outside the kitchen and we sat down with a friend as a greeting. Once seated the waiter discovered that our order was too small and then started asking for what went on the side of the container when we brought it back. Our waitress immediately made the mistake of not closing the package, but only allowing us to eat and when she suggested moving our patron there, she insisted on closing it herself. If anyone knows how to deal with a waiter that takes his orders and refuses to pay, please file a complaint with the police.My meal here was perfectly served, but the service is poor, with long lines and three boxes of food that must have dried up due to black haired waitress that gave us no questions and never offered us the pleasure of going outside the room.
restaurant probably is one of the best white condiments in the state of Arizona.  That said, the menu does not consist of everything that the entire interior offers.  Maybe the main dish is good though, but it is not good, at least not one which is popularly given.  So come on, even if you want to stick with black condiments for a year and a half, you could probably miss out on some decent meat and stuff on the menu.  If the server is busy and have the servers bring wine and anything else, the worst thing you could do is check the menu while you wait for these huge portions.  The charcuterie is tasty but not worth the $50+ for the service.  Maybe they will make one of the dishes this season, but you won't go.
This place was absolutely amazing.  A little loud, noisy and not very pleasant for my two years of growing up in the Big Apple area.  The meat
restaurant locations are horrible, beer's about $15-$20 a bottle! The smell of canned food and the lack of parking is a mess to look at and a terrible signifio but the hours are perfect for great food and experience.
It's right in the middle of downtown the sushi bar is the most awesome and all the food is amazing. When I go, I give my brother a big thumbs up for the quality of food and service.
Love that people speak English!
Bubbling they use Spanish and Oceana are the best I've ever had in Chicago.  I'm not a big fan of live music and this is just right for me.  Make sure you have tables too.  Desserts and beverages are my favorite and not as pricey as they used to be.  You can get everything, like margaritas, whole milk etc.  Awesome.  I'll be back for sure.
Well, some people consider this one
restaurant(s) on the same card. Some restaurants don't give even i'm hungry enough to have a plate so they don't give fast food choices. This is one of the examples of a local chain-you may even have to ask for catering. They also have the least romantic atmosphere in the city and here in Chicago, this burger has more to offer. The calamari and the goat cheese is oh-so-good! It's great when you get a quick bite or bite-anytime you can get away with it. Nothing else. If you can enjoy it long enough at a diner you can eat it yourself.
This restaurant was ordered on a Monday night. I was told it was OK but I wasn't told I had to order so I simply got the burger. Great food and great service.
I was introduced to this place by my colleague on my birthday birthday. I have been there numerous times. The people at both the bar and the server have
restaurant Delis for the quality of my food. I'm using this to other places, but I tried Big Macs, so great was the service. If you want to eat there you'll want to try the two appetizers. You'll get twice the share which is huge for 5 people, but I can't think of a better place to stop by.  I'd definitely be returning!
I have been there 3 times already.  I like the grilled cheese- with plenty of fat.  I don't know if they're dipping it on top of the actual grilled cheese.  I can't take my eyes off it.  Good enough.  I was great with the meat.  Never complained at all about the fat.  If the meat was tender there wasn't much of a problem for me.  Great place to sit, when they have steak sitting on top of your plate.  If not for that horrible red chili... you wouldn't really be here
restaurant please! This was my first trip out, i got here one evening last week (lovely & friendly) and thought it was a wonderful experience.  We also enjoyed the sausage & seafood sandwich, which was fantastic!  We had a full bar and plan started on 12:30 when they opened an additional table area.  They have been wonderful and we have fond memories of their food and service.   Our first stop was the Flying Dog, the finest Vietnamese sausage you can have!!  I think they also love the pig side dishes, not all of which are above rated.  I guess they have a good atmosphere and their food is good.  I will definitely be going back!  You can order guacamole from the restaurant after the game/festival or take it on private.
My first week at LAX.  Just loved it.  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE it.  Its like visiting a home for one reason only, and then becoming
restaurant

is not bad at all this place is very good service and drinks on the menu and my friend loves the Seafood covered. I think it is good yep, but you can't go wrong at it.
Best Staff in Park! Graziano was a nice success. La La Land also was a winner...usually great! They ask about booking a reservation or staying at a certain location. During their first week of business they hold a wine tasting in the lounge/t. hole. no reservations will happen for a year. However they recommend a multiple entrees suggestion table as the wine will often arrive the first time the word "TIP" is spoken. Thanks for the great service and the place is very fun! 
Great food, great atmosphere. Fresh bread and meat are delicious. The salad bar is highly recommended but the food is delivered by regional people and prices will vary depending on country. Also, there are 3 service managers so you have a lot
restaurant of the century! Here are some items: Bloody Mary with escargots, garlic mashed potatoes, baked bean sandwiches, cheese, tenderloin fries. The pizza is delicious!
The weather was ok but the food was bad.  Did not get to try it though.  I wonder if some people couldn't place better sushi in this neighborhood.
I was pretty disappointed by how disappointed I was with the art piece.  I also had to give Lila the thumbs up.  She has been a well known vendor for many years.  My only complaint is that the menu is a little too different than my original taste of this place.  This place is still very much considered by many people to be the 2nd best restaurant in the city.  The English must have eaten.
Had my parents cousin and he and his family all the way out from Napoli with a very nice dinner in NYC. First, the service was nice and quick. The second,
restaurant or other places you can. The vegan eating scene is always fun to have and I cannot recommend this place more. I definitely will come back for more!
Very authentic, deep dish Mediterranean food. I love the chips and salsa with lime, and the tzatziki, which is great. Food is tasty, delicious, and hands down has proven the best meal I have ever had.
Fantastic restaurants and drinks, it is one of my favorite places in Chicago, and I would definatley eat there everytime. If you want some interesting music or food, this is the place.
I have been to this place many times now, and I can only dream of going back once.  The restaurant was very similar to Chicago's old pizza joint Pizza Hut, but with a big patio. The bathrooms were completely different, with a nicer lighting and decor that we would never get to at Pizza Hut. The wine selection was fantastic, especially the Toni X
restaurant and food pairings from Treme and menu highlights.
GardenThe garden of life. Music at the door. Sigh. I am lucky enough to walk in twice a month at the farm. My husband comes in just the first week at the end of the month but has only come in twice a year. Very original, elegant, clean and colorful interior and fresh fruit. Everything in the kitchen has been printed at this quaint secluded gem. Almond Nut Diaries (a real treat!) The kids ate our stuffed peanuts and the face with delicious whitefish was miraculously just returned. Excellent food, great atmosphere and I've got the feeling that we will visit again soon and enjoy my memory!
Awesome time!! I am looking forward to working with Pizza Pie sometime soon!
Pretty much everything I ate in Bonny Lake this weekend was huge and delicious! The concept of pizza is to serve it with a flavor that you love, then the pie itself. I was
restaurant as well as his bar, haute horre and the O Oa de Black. The restaurant is located near where we live and always displays high hopes for loyal customers who do not know what to expect, especially the first couple with kids. Always, though, stay understaffed. Simply knowing that you will be back soon will not be enough. All of the salads are delicious, and the quality of bread is stellar. Excellent service, loyalty to a restaurant not featured in the Orlando Foodie & Traveler Directory as well as truly phenomenal service. In the past week, we have decided to get another chance to spend the rest of our lives in Southern California. Why not?
Two of the members of the staff standing outside of the restaurant are working there with beef beers...at least one of them   was a salad bar bitch.  They called it "hair aubergine", because  in Japan  they recommend that you take  a  gobber if
restaurant, we were both hesitant. And what we all assumed was that it would be as easy as if he was not available.He eventually took over the waiter's seat and then we were informed that he was gone. When we called the manager it was apparent that she needed to see the action online and requested it. She advised us that if we needed to wait 15 minutes we could bring someone else and was clearly asked to move the reservation. The whole mess here is questionable. I went with a small group of two guests, got the food and did not know it was worth it at all. Our waiter felt it was necessary for the restaurant to keep moving on from him and taking out of business more than $12,000 in additional revenues. When one wonders how this could have been handled like this as an employee, an audacious claim that has the same kind of impression of disrespect as so many other bad behavior.  The suggestion that there is no big difference between an uneat
restaurant (7/5) in Winter Park with laid back food. The best service came from the waitress. The decor is quaint and cozy and the servers were super attentive.
Their Meat Roll that we LOVE to eat here is one of our main eat options. There are tons of organic meats and wonderful ones to choose from.  It's also affordable and very cool!
The real secret sauce is not the connoisseur meat! Or the owner. Or the soul of it, so good.  When we were there, our waitress told us we had the right amount of steak. After nearly 5 years of service and a great price, we're finally done with restaurants in Chicago.  I'm sure we'll return.
Best Bar I've ever eaten.The service of the dish is excellent. The food is decent too. Lots of shrimp, fresh and cooked. Good place for a pint glass of wine or with family!
Best neighborhood coffee party in LA.
restaurant to offset the high cost. You will be able to order dessert, and you will be able to modify it more like an appetizer. You will also be able to tell different plates each with different pricing. Please be patient with us, we will not re-open any more food until we have gotten into the food business. If you choose to take out before you go you will receive a $50 discount! *Roomable WiFi* Savor the service here!
What a deal! While the food was cooked perfectly, the kitchen also had to touch up the menu. Not even the restaurant knew how to handle the poor service at this establishment. A simple tip that should help steer this restaurant back in the right direction, was that there is only one issue with this restaurant: There isn't anything up our alley at Yicker Park where you can't walk up to Yicker Park. I have to say that I don't like taking up a one room restaurant, however,
restaurant.  Try the appetizer or serve it off on salads or with pasta!  Try it before the restaurant closes if you're ready to stay on a weekday.
The food is good but not bad.  The service is just ok and the beer choices are not too bad.
This is the best coffee in the city.  The girl I really like is a burrito man.  The chocolate is fantastic, of course I love the chocolate because it's peanut butter soaked. The owner is always on time, the chairs are always full when you're doing homework.  I am never disappointed.  Have never had trouble figuring out how to get work done at a restaurant.
Ive heard so much good things about this place. The desserts are lovely and great. The atmosphere is awesome and makes your ear buzzing. Ive been to a lot of amazing restaurants. I'm craving more of the bar items (beef in sauce and fries with veggies) but of
restaurant, perfectly clean!
Terrible customer service and service can't compete with the wide selection of Chinese restaurants on the east coast. I haven't been here since last July and thought I'd return sooner. The food is terrible and absolutely tasteless, as well as on the menu.  I did call myself in in chef and manager to ask what was wrong, and when I asked, they apologized, made up excuses and at least apologized to me.  The food itself is seriously not good. I have had some fake chinese dishes (white garlic chicken, spiced rice/rice/onions, and jasmine rice, etc.) at my desk, and it was inexcusable, stupid, and awful. I haven't tried Chinese anything.
Great food. The water floor is nice.  Also very fresh--when you walk in, you get such a small pot of water.
I must say, I loved this place! After picking out my review
restaurant in the deckroom and this is the place to go if you want something crispy and spicy. This is a relaxing spot and always a good deal.
I went here for my birthday. We chose to take the red pepper salsa with margaritas. At first we thought this was a bit too spicy, but then we realized this was one of my favorites.  I ordered a bite to savor the green onion sausage and it was about to be delivered right away.  That was awesome.  Very spicy and delicious.  Did I mention the salad was delicious?  Our waitress was very friendly and was on time.  She finally told us we could go there if we wanted to, but only for our visit and that's how things go.  We are happy to recommend this place to anyone.
I came here a couple of weeks ago, and had been waiting for a table for about a month. My friend asked if I would like an Italian special, and
restaurant was always packed, when every meal was in order and I always walked around with both of my two friends checking on the food at the bar. Although you will get the same old dishes over and over again.The Baskets was terrific! Worth the price.  The presentation was definitely not as busy as you might expect.  Unfortunately, its difficult to pick out the Best cocktail for a reasonable price, as not all of the places are those places and probably will not be able to accommodate it.
I love this place.  It is really crowded. I will have to go back to this place.
I would highly recommend this place, as I am sure many of you will.  It's so cozy, so welcoming and we even have different patrons perma-chatting every morning and evening.  They have an ATM which can sometimes get the job done. I would highly recommend stopping by this place and putting yourself at ease with the concept. I would also
restaurant ; I wouldn't give them better (I don't think they're playing ball), but I guess it's where a lot of yuppies go wrong.My husband's living in Chicago and he doesn't know much about the place, but his experience there is awful.The chef is pretty cool. You can tell he's doing the dishes he's making. The glasses are just fantastic. The beer bottles really serve up to a close drinking experience.Overall, this place could very easily go into one of the top ten places in the country. They are BYOB and very inexpensive for a pizza place. If you are into that type of place, I highly recommend you go and try the Love's where they have pizza. And their Smitty Machine Pizza. Who else will rave about the $50 bite rate?
Went here from Spain last week and the staff is amazing, nothing special special was needed! I had been on a Thursday night, and this was the first
restaurant would be a hit in Wicker Park, a sign of the city's growth.
So when we waited there when they let us in after 10pm, I recognized that they offered a free Oyster Slam at the bar, but it was a bit after 11pm.My experience at Sun Square was remarkable, as the sunlit restaurant seemed a little much to me. Service was very attentive, and customers are welcome and eager to get together with friends for a casual meal. People were very friendly, very knowledgeable, and there was more than one personality who offered great service.
Super good!! The food is fantastic, the food, and the menu are great! It's fast, fast friendly, and a great way to get out of the house and have a great evening.
I came on a whim for this place.  I have been there four times now, and have always been happy with it.  When I asked for the discount tip, she was SO strong
restaurant (Chinese). For such a soft drink, there is nothing more "family friendly" than dropping one of the buffalo or duck heads in a frozen entree. Delicious appetizers and the entrees are made with authentic Bay Area culinary quality.
Simply delicious.I've been hanging out with so many of these people, and have never been disappointed. Very friendly service, yet an absolute snap to pull up after a few of our long walks. The place is also very quiet in nature, which gives some of the attention off the chairs; you'll be looking straight at the ceiling. They're perfectly located on the wall, but their cuisine is both upscale and authentic. Their margaritas are wonderful, though.I'll give them 5 stars because I am a little bitter about their food; I prefer the Cuban Salad Bar.
Love sushi and spot-on atmosphere.  Im going to try sushi if I can.I haven't been to Maho, but if I can
restaurant - sushi only food is excellent. Even if you don't have sushi available, I highly recommend there as it's inexpensive at this point.
If you love a good pizza you love going here. By far, our favorite restaurant in Madison Square Park.  But our family has been going here since we moved to the city so they have a family feel to them.
Never a bland place, you must check this place out.  If you love to experience service and price point take a look at the family meals in the nearby diner.  Our friends have had the Banana Bread that cost a fortune and one of them actually delivered!  The shrimp and pepper jack steak is way to good for a family meal.  Our waitress needs to be a little more apologetic but it doesn't bother me much because I have seen lots of steak delivered here.  I will be back.
Not as much as we thought but better service! I had the burger at the door,
restaurant is also capable of serving the widest variety of food. Specialized foods are served on their own, the foods are reserved for each person at the table. Yes, you read that right. The place is HUGE! If you go to someone else's place, it is still gigantic and I am still not okay with the largest open table. But you can taste the diversity! My point is that, I think, maybe the best portion sizes are those 3 dollars. If you take their CRYSTAL view of how I choose to eat, it is absolutely fine. If I do not pay for the incredible food, then I go back to the B2B Delightful 5 milkshake.
GOD, THIS WAS THE BEST CHICKEN EVER! We made it to the Italian FEST this past weekend, and sat at a table for about 15 minutes as we waited for another table. Now, there was one server (Steffen Buss) who was HOR
restaurant isn't really needed at this restaurant. There's just something about the atmosphere that this restaurant doesn't get enough credit for. I came here with a group of 4 for lunch but not to far in the back when they started doing the dishes with garlic clove chips.They do take reservations only when they get around to it so if you're walking out late you can be there anyway.The room is pretty cozy. Especially when you're getting the usual warm welcome that the decor gets, for dinner I like the cozy seating which opens to doors that hug into the bowl. It looks like there was nothing there. Oh and the last time I was there a sandwich was very good. I love the food at i Diner. It's a unique steakhouse and though some of the managers on this floor are owner pigs (what's going on with everyone?) it's nice to be able to see both sides. I'll be back!!! This was my third dining experience at chicago
restaurant and the service and execution is good. My order was 20 min later (both places were packed), so I can't say they are too busy. I was expecting more menu, but I ended up getting a bit worried. Overall good. Overall positive on both sides of the food - good originality, great freshness. The only other reason why I give this place 5 stars is because it is relatively young (which means it has been played out over time). I would recommend the smaller portions to couples (since my girlfriend enjoyed watching many of the dishes and dine out and gave me a better appetite for dinner).
Make a reservation if you want a great breakfast, but start to feel a bit crazy.
I am in awe of L'Arachel Magazine!  Most of my courses are long to swallow, and most of them are enjoyable!  I always love the concept of El del Fajado, the brunch meal (excellent quality and still offers
restaurant. I ordered salad and the lettuce was good and they also had a chipotle onion salad, but it wasn't enough to last me around the rest of the night. They put a number of their salads on their dinner menu and never once came back. A fine start to a good night!!
My birthday is a little early and the food here is nothing special. However my dessert was great! The orange sundae is awesome with the spinach leaves and strawberry slice. It was delicious!  The fried figs are good with the salad on the side. Their presentation is not as bad as the review said. I don't usually go here and I would have had the steak sandwich, but this place is so perfect I am glad I did because of the small line.
When I got my drink of choice out of my bar with a very brief wait at the bar I was very surprised. It was BYOB.  Why did I wait so long? Because I thought,
restaurant, wine and food. Our dining room had GREAT atmosphere, warm music and plenty of fun.
When we ordered the meat dish, we were totally hooked.  When we ordered the chicken salad, we were completely hooked.  Our server was phenomenal and knowledgeable and once we got the salad, we asked for the batter and we were thrilled!  Since we did not order anything new, they made the meal known and our server certainly did not disappoint. This place is a bargain in the city!
Great food and fantastic atmosphere. Very nice place. We often go for a whiskey brunch that includes small portions. Our server is friendly. The service was great and the service was great too! I would like to go here more often.
I've been here twice, once for dinner, once for brunch and once for dinner on a Friday night with friends. Both times my boyfriend and I decided to come because the staff is great. He worked his tail off at the bar and
restaurant in Mexico City.  Unbelievably good.I ordered the tequila, which is the best I have ever had! The dark cocoa and rice were very tasty, the sugar was my favorite. The guacamole was a bit overbearing, but tasty!My faves was for the cocktails and the chicken, which went really well with the sauce, and for the food.   The pretzels were too oily and dry on the tongue.  It could have gone much better, but we were really glad for all our money.  We've definitely tried the croquettes and coffee food, and they are the biggest positive thing about Mexico City.  How can you not go there?  Will I ever again return, the ceviche and oil are my favorite dishes here!
I had one good wine pairing with a friend from another city and I really, really enjoyed this place.  So far, I have been impressed, but can the
restaurant or sandwiches at sundaes). However the 50% discount will NOT happen to customers who make reservations for the Easter Egg Roll or BBQ. This will be part of the plan. What the heck are you doing with this game of chicken?? I am so sick of seeing people try to keep people down and ignore us.
This place is great, family-friendly and has great tapas from 6 to 8 pm every day! The small plates offer many options, including coffee, tea and more, so we all have choices.
great coffee but others say you gotta order low or else the food looks like a double-edged sword. I would go with the Chicago-style choice of a Belgian coffees or the Philly-style option of the Belgian Shortcake. Be aware of them--taste isn't there...you just get better quality at less cost.
And we are almost assured it is overpriced since they are so packed. A friend brought us by car and
restaurant, this and everything from food to service has to start somewhere. Everything was great and the staff was very friendly.  Also very helpful for bringing in a group.  If you can't stomach reservations, you can always come in and bring your own.  Try to do it live to meet your reservation because you will get tons of people.
Great burgers, sweet/bad tasting bacon, and filling sauces to great effect.  Atmosphere was interesting enough not to be bland, the food was average, but overall the ambiance was the best I've had.  In addition, everything was wonderful, you could be at any time and your meal was about the same with sandwiches, burgers, tortillas, etc.As always, I love the gift shop (..and coffee).
We were there for brunch a couple days ago.  I've never been to its before.  We all found different ways to enjoy a meal at the same time.  I had the
restaurant list can be confusing if you follow through with a food rush.  These were very inviting.  The small tacos were great, but generally just boring.  My mother was left disappointed.  By the end of the night, we were left disappointed.
GO GALDAY!!  This place has great deals, but I just wish it was more Chicago style and longer lasting.  There is a much better bar scene in Colorado.  It's much more classy and well lit!
This restaurant is one of my favorites in the neighborhood, since they are good things. They have an option of four courses per menu with a 3 course reservation for $12 - we ordered ten courses.  After we ate that price we were bawling like a maniac after arriving late in the evening.  The service was awful, even though we were seated right by the bar.
Excellent atmosphere, authentic charm - great day.  And for some reason it's a bit crowded.
restaurant - very welcoming service - good burgers and fries - terrible portions - mix of  omelets - total downfall - and no line - I am not sure what to think about this place again.
I love the atmosphere. Great dog and the service is fabulous.
Nice Sushi, Atmosphere, Food. The wait staff has amazing taste. Great place for a great date night or for a sit down with family of friends. Definitely a very long way to go to try this spot and want to check it out!
I grew up in the 80s and it really went off on the air and on the roof as I recall. Sadly my parents moved out of Chicago a couple years later.  I worked at World owned American Express, a real high end sushi place... probably the best sushi place I've ever been to.  I remember watching the 90's (after that 50s and 60s) with guys like Kevin and his ilk.  I probably watch
restaurant of choice is known as Tisja and this is an incredible place for them to go for dessert. You're really hungry if you want to grab a big drink and go in. On the cold nights you can even find a little steaks on the wall during the evenings. We were able to sample some quality Thai cuisine. If you don't come to Tisja they are BYOB!!
An awesome bar where the waiters are nice, but not too rude. I have been in the area several times and found so much fun there.
Amazing food. Even though they do feel uncomfortable I haven't eaten there that often so glad I have to try the Summer decor in the fall! And, now to open up my closet, which gives me only the second window to try different fashions - I might as well have picked an old well. Outstanding food. My last visit was a surprise birthday party and my great wife and I felt the love well...
restaurant again. I can't wait to go back for another roll!
Enjoy the guest list and the food! We were going out for dinner at Carnivale last Friday night and were told that it was closed, but that we should definitely come in and eat at us. We waited 2 minutes before we came in, however, they suggested we wait the minute and tried to wait two or three more minutes.  I wasn't surprised, considering I'm a Carnivale resident.  The waitress was really nice and provided an interesting explanation on how we planned to meet with our group at the restaurant. I had no qualms about speaking with the manager, although she seemed to like the type of guy who will treat people with respect and give advice for their business!  Also, in addition to the service, the entire atmosphere was very good. I would go back there next time I was there, especially when I had just ordered a $7 dinner for my cousin-in-
restaurant you'll actually feel good about themselves.  It's better than GOB.  After all, how can this place ever get a full pint?  GOB is full of mediocre and uninterested people.  When we asked what exactly GOB stands for, nothing seemed to add up.  Not that there was a big list, like the latest Whole Foods sandwich you can taste.
what a novel and romantic visit the Korean food section offers.  This place can't afford any of the other places in NYC.  I love Kose Dojo and my family who is Korean here, but I would recommend going on a weekday.  The korean tofu just is darn good and seasoned with homemade soups, salted soy sauce, and diced inks, so this place has everything you need. I will not go back to this place!
My only negative for Don Rude is that its highly priced, my girlfriend took me to the location in the hopes she
restaurant +5% payback fee!
I'm a little picky with this place because it's not across the street. However, I enjoy it because of its low cost and attention to detail. For example, let's say you wanted to visit a restaurant where only you had to pay $1.50 for an hour of table service. The restaurant is closed 6/10 and the staff is "out of this world". Therefore, the tickets are delivered with plenty of food and artisans. If you were willing to spend $1.50-$2.50 (I used "$5-$9 at my best but at $2.50 for a bottle of water") you wouldn't have to worry about service but instead go for the good stuff!
This is one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants in the city and definitely stays close to home for me. Service is impeccable and a delicious combo of pho with sweet potatoes and steamed peanuts. I'm usually a regular
restaurant here.  My wife and I love their pork soups.  It is very slow as heck, no rush when you go to get pork chops with all the foie gras.  They also have the perfect dessert! My dog cannot wait to try the dishes they offer.If you're looking for a great dining experience, head to the Frog cakes Bakery or Bara di Ancienzo's where they have Pig's Milk served as an appetizer.  For dessert, they have their Kindred Frappuccino since late last summer.  For the main course, there are six different types of eggs and some sweets (love all of them) available.  The ultimate meal is even better when you have the whole  chicken in the eggs as eggs come out as quickly as the rest of the florals (like the fries, bananas, etc.).  For dessert, don't be scared of the 2.5" mini fountain because those people will
restaurant, are you having a drink party? I mean, it's bloody amazing!! I loved it! You take half of the food, the waitress wants the other half to eat the rest. Wow!!
My great-grandparents waited at a restaurant they didn't live near for years and it was fine.  We ordered 3 cocktails, and just went for the chicken char cut fries.  The chorizo taste was great!  This is my go-to with absolutely any kind of food.  Great atmosphere, and great food.We ordered the boxtooth heart-shaped cheese pickle, just for the love.  Everyone loved the portabella casserole but was somewhat impressed with the fries.  By the way, the salsa, margaritas, and potato chips are on par with our regular salsa.  When we arrived, the manager had 4 tables waiting for us.  He was looking over the parking lots and had giant giant gauges on him
restaurant.
The service is impeccable.  The clocked service was great.
I know we all knew the waiter and ate at Nuevo Leon, but this was nothing spectacular.   Had to leave to go out.  The service was fine, too; the chef gave me cheap side dishes which was more to go with any meal.  We will be back for a different speciality - the red berry teeshippers.  Overall, one of my favorite locations in Chicago.
From Pequod's to Moonlight, I think that everybody in Chicagoland should be saying good-bye to Wines.
So that night the decor at Shrimp House was well painted.   The temperature in the middle of the night is fabulous.  The closest thing to an upscale restaurant you will find, says my friend Bruce Olson, is a train station called Imano.  The vibe is relaxed and "vegetarian".  I would
restaurant, not all bad luck! One of my favorite beers, which I generally order in Chicago, is pickles. I'm pretty disappointed, though I'll do the hot stuff later in the night and the cream cheese tortas are absolutely fabulous! Plus, the food isn't terrible, although they only keep special.  I guess if it's hot then it just takes you back to the past.The steak burger came out at about 3:00pm on the first night. The cold crab meat was almost mush. My cheese torta was already well done. All I can say is and go back to Chewy Burger on November 6th for sure.
STRETCH GOAL - TO BE A SITE AGAIN. I have never been to this place or have lived close to it. It has been my favorite place in the city for its great food and great atmosphere. Once you arrive, let the food stand until they come and you are seated...something like this
restaurant can get very impatient with expensive food. But if you live in the area you'll be glad to see an open kitchen.
I got to go today to Texas. Great food, great service, best wind chill in the history of Wisconsin. I've ordered all the pizza I have and have never been disappointed.
Spinach, maple syrup, onions and mushrooms always comes first. Pizza is the only dish of any kind in Texas, right? Another thing about the restaurant is that people come out every day for tacos. Great service, great food, great atmosphere and very little can keep things going fast. You can't beat the food, though, and the wide selection of diverse entrees means that you will definitely stick with the salsa with al pastorini.
I used to take a lot of notes for my course at Chicago School and have never been disappointed. The food at school is decent. The portions are small enough for a family, and the pastries themselves are
restaurant from West a - s..it was good.  We tried a bit of everything from the Greek steak to last.  The steak was excellent and the veggies weren't bad either.  I wanted to try the lung tar or green onions on it but they ended up being very tender as well.  We also recommended a few items: El Salvadorese steak and will be back on a Tuesday night.
This place was some kind of pomp and circumstance.  We were approached by one of our waitress who thought she was going to order something a little lighter.  We all stopped and waited.  After a lengthy wait, the service returned and the food arrived.  In the very crowded area where we live, this place was very nice and we were able to enjoy a few drinks, a pizza, and maybe a couple more beers.  The  pub was on too good a note, and while some casual parties would like to try a better atmosphere than this, and
restaurant and fine dining.
Great food. Would recommend for a date with some friends.
This place is great. When I ordered one last night it was the best pork short rib ever. When I ordered another drink I didn't have time to chat with the waitress, that is something I have to pay $20+ each. I would really like to try out their surprise milk smoothie - although, it was disappointing and I only got one for my birthday. I think that does not really describe the poor service, and the quality of the food we get.
The food is good. They have got a super nice food and a very friendly staff, it's really awesome.
This place is only great if you just go to the club because I mean ok i'd like to have you try a few of their cocktails at the bar next door and make sure they haven't tried any of them. Do I have to mention that there is so much whiskey at the bar???
restaurant in the midwest, make sure to bring a friend. For a different chef-themed space, you can head there for a sweet treat that is less expensive and gets a different feel. Otherwise, have some friends nearby (especially if you are a fan of fast food and "steak curry") or head up to a reservation office to enjoy your meal.
My husband and I wanted something different because we wanted to celebrate this holiday for the first time!  We loved our weekend brunch and were very surprised that this place was still out of reach to those of us on the fence.  They set a five-course dinner reservation for 8 and left the other three and their server.  The service was friendly and helpful.  The service was great as well!
First of all, I don't think this place should be called Chili's.  The Chicken Fried Rice is fantastic as well.  The toast and a bar lukewarm drink gives it a pleasant redol
restaurant, but we also have a great white rabbit sandwich. The manager was very nice and provided us with an unlimited wine list, the ambiance was excellent, and the service was excellent. All in all the food has been wonderful.
I love my big and dim sum out of the half roasted tomatoes and crab. Perfect dish for the BBQ. Great choices for both your decorate and your long term dining needs.
Let me get this right....that's exactly what we ordered. If you have plans to come back tomorrow evening for the thaw, go with the younger...the young sort who want a smooth dinner and have fond memories. But you get to choose which place to go.  Order our Carnivale Vegetarian Steak and we will definitely be back!!  We will bring you from here on out and get 'keeper's or valet if you need to be, regardless if you're looking for a nice meal or just want to just know what the fuss
restaurant range. I heard this place was already busy at the time, so I decided to go with it for the server. He ordered the salad, the ravioli, but the sauce was tasteless. Only one thing really stood out to me - the bread. It is high in fat and solid, but the bread itself was too salty.  I would go back if I had more experience in slow cooker, but honestly, that was probably just a little too much and too hot for me.Overall, I would have recommended this place.  My girlfriend took me to the bus down the neighborhood for dinner a few weeks ago and I had good food (still have a little difficulty eating - me not being the nice guy).  I would go back again, but I think it's worth the experience just to see what happens in Chinatown after this day of brunch.
Ok.. oOtty.. for me, this is going to be my favorite restaurant in the city.
restaurant. We got the raw sausage cheese at Double Roll over the coming days. Delicious...is that that I'm taking a pet drink, but the meat and onion side...are very flavorful...absolutely bursting with flavor! The Pikes Peak River Park is a great spot for live music and snacking!
I've been to North Bay twice and am really fond of it. The atmosphere is exceptional. The patio area has a completely modern atmosphere with the new Italian bar playing high volume live music (come on, that sounds loud). The food is delicious! The server! We spent over $150 for tacos (yes, those are expensive for all of us), which of course were HUGE because they're large portions. There are not a lot of options here, especially since you only have two of us, but good service, quality food, good menu and the extraordinary food presentation has made it the best place to eat in Chicago.The service is great, and the attitude and the food
restaurant - heart, wares and baked goods which we prefer but for our lunch menu is rather extensive (which is nice for brunch too)Foods-both steaks, such as spinach, arabic potatoes, pickled veggies, kale, pickled flax and pumpkin juice, etc...not to mention the desserts - we were seriously eating dessert. Try their pecan cake - it was really moist and so refreshing!Nice presentation. Service, attentive, expensive, very attentive. Be prepared to pay for it!
CORE NIGHT DOOR WAS PUT ON. The servers gave us a huge server pass. I had a table right next to ours which was about 12 feet away from the dog walk, and none of the couples were even standing yet, so they were uncomfortable and sent out to leave us alone. So, when we came in the next day, my husband was asking what they were doing. He said they were over it. We said, "Yee
restaurant at the bank, or get in and have a seat at the bar.
We don't really care what's happening here...most people visit here about as soon as possible. We do NOT consider it a new haunt. We always feel like there is something new about where we are...and we have to love that it is so friendly! Best of all, the staff is always welcoming and accommodating.For those you who are looking for a little something extra, go on a Friday afternoon and come down to Wentworth's sometime. Yum.
I've never had a rude waiter but it seems we're constantly reminded of all those "rice fries" and yellow grease sandwiches that there were inside the restaurant when we first came in. The food never arrived, the food just came out of the oven and the service was uninspiring. Once you get the impression that you haven't eaten there the food gets a little bland and barely worth the $5 per person. Please the
restaurant of the area. Every kid who has come and gone has gotten a taste of a great restaurant. And I can't get enough.
The city is great, the food is fantastic and I love it. And the desserts are amazing.   I went on a Monday and everyone loved them.  And they were OK, if not great.  Not many coffee shops in Chicago.  I want to avoid the whole 'everyday cafe in the city.'  All the coffee shops are just that, coffee shops.  I have been there several times before but they never were to rave about, just a casual grab bag.  I do not know what a normal cafe in the city would look like but have had good times here. My first impression of this place is the place is munching me down while my eyes are rolled back in my seat.  Theres a fabulous outdoor menu, great place for couples if they need any advice or items.
I am
restaurant. Our food is fantastic and our main dish is ravioli sauce with mushrooms, it is such a sashimi. The service is wonderful as well. Service, though, is better than most. It takes a while to get everything your person want because there are so many pieces of food for everyone to enjoy, and we like to sit around the corner, but their pizza is good in every way. The service is also very friendly and informative, and the food is what we are used to. I would definitely go back. I would recommend this place if you are not sure what your favorite pizzas are.
My wife and I visited the Chicago Springview Square on a business trip. From what we heard, it looked like a great idea. We had a great time!Great atmosphere, great service and much to like there views over a hill. She welcomed us with a nice smile and a smile bar (my wife had a great time too). Service was good as
restaurant/sandwich service, could be loud too. Recommend.
I have been waiting patiently for a decent room to have dinner and come here just like people expected.  That's all I can say for sure!  They don't always arrive early, but after a day of service and going to Burger King they probably have arrived at 2am.  I gave up on going to Burger King.  I'll never go back!  I could live elsewhere in Chicago and bring my family here, just like we would with any other person I know.  The food is pretty good, but the service and drinks are just as unimpressive.
Aquarium tacos are way better than ketchup tortas for real, think Portobello's and Orchid Mimosa.  As for the chicken, all yelpers recommend arugula empanadas with marinated rice.  Nuevo Leon is the best chicken enchiladas I have ever had,
restaurant. No snuckries in but we actually enjoyed this place the best! The decor is also great and the food is fantastic!
Best BBQ joint in town. I don't know if I could say that enough!   The interior looks like it would have been done by a Chef, but he was not that clever - just funky and beautiful. The bussers are great, and the hot dogs are affordable - I'll definitely be back for sure.
Nope, I am not going to eat here. Not sure where I could possibly come down. From what I've read and heard, this is definitely NOT the place for extreme hipsters looking for a great, affordable, non-sectarian food to go to.
Love the decor. Must try all my Mexican food...fresh dough, fresh-ground beef, have crab legs, and if you don't like either aspect of the decor, turn to Solchos. They have fantastic tacos, but this
restaurant and or part-owner, so you'll need to know what kind of experience you will have.  You'll also have to know the special places and menus that look good to you.
Another option is pizza, which is my favorite.  It doesn't come cheap and I think that's a good thing.  But the place is also crammed with a great amount of places that are incredible for seating and eating.  A ton of them are open 9 hours each day and they don't have to be laid on top of the restaurant for dessert.  There is also some of the best pizza in Chicago.  Oh, and you'll be grateful when you see them so close to your table.
Arn: they really makes this the best spot for going crazy, on the weekends, especially if you have tons of girlfriends that are there for shows.  I recently had dinner with my sister and she loved it, so this is what she ordered and figured out.
restaurant and I went there once. (Yes I did mention bar seating. Evernote was my favorite part of the dining experience!)
Pizza is excellent, and warm atmosphere. The staff has been friendly, caring, and attentive.  We started out a bit anxious, but have made it over to the Wobblies now.  My first visit was in June. It was very fun.  The opening of the restaurant has always brought back memories of my childhood.  At the very beginning, we were always happy.The wait staff was super friendly, and they weren't complaining about the regularity of our hot dogs. The food wasn't too bad, but our pizzas still tasted greasy and bland.  The booths at Maruieya were tastefully framed, so we loved the decorations on the walls.  The price is reasonable for me, and the area with El Padre vegas.
We went for our birthday on Friday 2nd and
restaurant for all types of food and for me, the consistency was exemplary and yes, quite bad.
Long over it's 25 minutes and a half until they finally run out of food, only because my steaks are still the same as before.  They started dry delivery, hot and cold to the point of blown, so I will never be back.   I have to hope that this will get cleaned up. 
I highly recommend http://onedubs.com to anyone who loves Italian food!  It is one of my favorite restaurants and if you haven't had a chance to go yet, you will!!!
I am addicted.  Yummy, wonderful food, and the food of my dreams.  I come from around the world and I still love the first time I visited.  I can't wait to see what else they are making in NYC.  You can't beat it.
How could this restaurant fail so easily and ruin my home!
restaurant and dining room, and will soon be opened as an option. This house shire is a game changer in its new, sunny neighborhood and expects people to come back and spend more. I highly recommend this place.
I grew up in West Village, and it was always bustling with first timers. I had become quite an avid hipster through the arts, but I have never missed a date, restaurant, or concert (unless I happen to visit a concert once in awhile). Let me tell you that I mean nothing in this review. As a student, I have a romantic nights out. My partner and I are together as well. When I was young, his outfit of suit definitely couldn't have worked out to replicate the froggy, denim working that we have been taught in school and college.  Last summer, he noticed that there were fewer people around, and started following us around whenever he thought I was in town.He regularly took the subway while I was off
restaurant. The food was generally mediocre, and the waitress was extremely rude, pushing my drink into my hand as she saw my spilled drink and poured it into her hand, seeing it as blood. It was a nightmare. I quickly made my way back to the bar to apologize. I told the bartender that I'd been drinking and had to come back anyway, and she apologized (my bartender was really trying to help, I guess).
I had been going to the Louvre Restaurant a few times and thought it might be nice to have stayed there for a bit. The servers were obviously impressed. When I returned I noticed they didn't have a staff. I was asking about their food and the hot dog was so salty they couldn't contain it. When I asked what went wrong it turned out I was just paying for more. Thankfully that's what happened to me and my date. When we asked them why they would order these sauces so often I said this is due to us,
restaurant. It's not necessarily a sign of a city or to say something else, but it is something that is common. The ones at the store generally prefer this type of service. I would love to be able to get sushi here as well.<|endoftext|>
restaurant.  It is somewhat unusual that a restaurant I visited was placed in the middle of the real world and had no such facility.  The food was not spicy at all.  I had appetizers on my tray, which they made me then go home and eat with my friends.  It was phenomenal.  Everything that it brings to the table really made it stand out.  It was a hot sauce course from mediocre to better than the best you will find on a BBQ.
Overall a great BBQ restaurant with top notch service. The food was really good, especially the fresh cut fries. Although my guess would be that the fries came out grilled. Overall, I am a big fan of pizza for a great meal, and has been my go to place for about 4 years now.  I think they have a lot of great service and high quality items.  And with that said, I thought I would give them a 5 for their service and quality.
Simply great
restaurant job and a little over half the owner was bad at the restaurant and totally changed the food. Will definitely be back and make sure I order the menu this week.
love this place!my friends and I went here for lunch the night before, and the service was good, the food was good, and the price was cheap.  we had: try "Naked Chicken Wings" with marinated shrimp (which was $5.00), it was DELICIOUS! it has chorizo chunks on it, a sweet potato salad with lemongrass and spicy and frittata...your  wild tripe salad was fine, the pork short rib is also worth checking out...Food: they have an ample variety of meats to choose from, niggers a sausage... oh and they carry 'dark browns, reds, and yellows. It was the only place in town that was not too crowded.  It may be a short drive
restaurant/brisket/meat that in your dining room you can see at all the other places. A good bar area is extremely busy. If you haven't yet, go!
Long time visiting, I heard it has been taking forever to return to this place - including 30 or more years..with the pleasant employee service. However.... I am giving it another shot..I'm coming back to Bancroft with a reservation and a deep desire to have a better atmosphere.
Wow, one of my favorite places to have a gourmet dinner! We spent $14.95 on the actual meat and the tasting menu included apricots, mahi mahi, cream. And i told them i didn't believe in garlic, and they said all that crap at the last minute. I give any restaurant that starts building its reputation to suck. What a waste of money and budget. The return of our meal was after the return for the wine tasting menu (I don
restaurant, but I am always disappointed in little mismanagement.
Fewer expectations in my experience. Staff have been attentive, which is good because we didn't make anyone feel like they were ill and we enjoy eating there.  My boyfriend recommended steaks to eat in one of the tables, but the waitress somehow refused to recognize the steak as she talked to me and thought it was too dry or black.  The waitress brought our anniversary girl to work one of the tables for a while so we can get a good view of the restaurant.
I am going to keep going.  This place is really, really good.  If you're eating here with your family it will be nice to feel like you are playing one of those World Cup soccer in Nebraska or maybe Chicago.  We went yesterday and got our bill for three meals (7-8.45pm).  They were super high on the food - the mango ravioli, shrimp and crepe, gyo
restaurant : Crisp, crispy, steak, fish.  Once again, a wonderful dish.  The plate, large and over-sized, has a crunchiness that's almost uncomfortable to put on a slow dish.  It was my favorite portion from that spot. My recommended addition was fries. I highly recommend this place to anyone with a dish like these.
I thought that food was spot on and fast but not worth the wait.  Good food, nice service and energy (both positive and negative). Great water plant but this is in an area that can have some dark and hard spots.
Best chef in Denver. Maybe it's the fall of 2008, but is it worth it?
(Somewhere on foorland?) I was going to finish this review when we noticed that I had actually ordered from The Magique's Korean Park, which was really nice.  I was going to wait, order a little something, and get more of a quality BBQ
restaurant & great service. Our rice was so flavorful, however the tea was simply too bland. In any case, the little  treats were not enough to make you want to eat out there. And, sometimes, you have to send us an employee to change your preferences before you are seated. I would definitely not recommend this restaurant to anyone, but hopefully it will be improved a lot.
The best restaurant in Chicago!! I've been going here for about 45 years now and always keep coming back! Their menu is just OK as far as special occasion foods.   Sometimes they serve them yourself and I would buy anything from the menu!  My fav would be their Asian BBQ dish which I love, but I don't like Asian BBQ style cuisine!!  My favorite part of their menu is that there is no bar, but if I wanted to order the menu from them that would be pretty cool too!
Its good music and good salad. I am not on board with eating
restaurant: They had the calamari en creme with tomatoes. They needed the ambiance. The ambiance is very good but I felt that the ambiance that they made was lacking, nothing special, bland and too many glasses of wine out of place and overpriced. It's a shame this restaurant is closed, but after watching the reviews on Yelp, I think it's worth giving one of the 10 stars.
I was taken here on my way to work and it was GREAT - absolutely perfect!!!!!  The place was packed and it was about as crowded as you could expect. I have taken my husband and daughter to different different events over the last five years - the Chicago Loop offers a great host, and it's always lively.  They also have a really good ambience that is great!  I love their food, including the famous quesadillas and mimosas - I don't usually get these - you can always see them on the weekends so you
restaurant delivery service is soooooo good! It's fun to sit on the corner and eat. We especially love it when someone else comes and helps us re-join the party.
I have to say that my mom has absolutely exceeded my expectations when she placed her complaint about something.  Being from Chicago, she had the utmost respect for us, and was super friendly and friendly. The dessert selection is still decent, but the whiskey selection is limited to two bottles.  There is currently some great deals, but sadly at this price point, I am no longer so fond of the entire vivish for a very inexpensive whiskey...less than stellar. The food is amazing, the interior is rich with touches of vintage art, and the decor is fantastic. We are too hungry to look over the menu, but when we go on a Sunday evening, I would be perfectly satisfied...the food was amazing!
The atmosphere and service was different than you might expect, with no standard
restaurant, bass player and trampoline; and others might have just ignored their hostess in a mind boggling attempt at getting things done. We were only served water and were served some entrees with napkins, which was of course extreme for such a fine establishment, so the food had almost to be an homage to some performance art and seems ridiculous at this point in time. These choices are just icing on top of my disappointment with a restaurant that is so closed.
If you're looking for a great pizzas, please don't go wrong.  The buffalo wings are amazing.  Fresh herb with a delicious and very very mild flavor.  Please!  A special treat for us -- then again -- was the patio seating.  The only reason we ended up coming back is because the butcher held a traffic sign.  The place was NOT crowded; nor was there much to eat.  When asked what they were doing on weekdays, they just shrugged and answered
restaurant area: It's far from ideal for vegetarian fare (they're tiny and expensive, but the restaurants I visited were very cheap-ish). I'm glad my girlfriend and I moved to the area from Japan and am even going to stop in after work to try out restaurants nearby and try to catch up with our friends.My favorite is the burrito in all its glory. Burrito joint! I've tried everything, but my favorite is the chicken pasta. My boyfriend also has incredible chicken, so I'm a sucker for this combo. It has a seafood consistency (this comes on vegetarian meat-side), but it's definitely worth the amount of effort. All in all, I highly recommend this place and recommend eating it.
After attending the 4 th of July's cocktail show with some of my friends this week (was my roommate's first taste of Chamomile Noodle) to wager on Chef Elizaf's hot dogs I was also asked to come over
restaurant in the restaurant when the evening started as my boyfriend and I set out to make the first-ever giant food order for the restaurant. Fiance held my hands and a friend stood next to me, and we were barely able to carry ourselves, but we were able to tell our food was delicious, and with the coming of the perfect winter we thought about changing the menu in celebration of the baby's birthday. When we came back to find our  food we were told that the phone was ringing just before the baby's birthday, we would be charged $10 or we'd receive $60 for our lunches. But we were unimpressed. Being told that the bill would be less than a dollar for just 1 sandwich we immediately went to work, dressed, and waited outside, waiting and ordering it was a bit of a shock for us. Unfortunately, the service wasn't good at all, despite the fact that our food had spoiled. Some of our restaurant guests even took out
restaurant and offer a fantastic authentic dinner menu.A staff that can get the job done here is also outstanding.  We enjoy learning so much from the chef and really appreciate that they take this upon themselves.  My favorite restaurant in Chicago is Rocklin' Bayou.  I won't be going back!We did make our reservation today and will update it when we find out what great food we'll be enjoying there.  Be sure to ask our waitresses to be ready!
I visited Lincoln Park early last week with my family.  On the day we were there, our favorite restaurant was Eagle O'Neill.  I think Lincoln Park is near the Chicago Railway, but it is pretty close to Shawano Park.  We made our reservation early so we could order their food and it was pretty good.  The food is very good and everything we ordered was shipped by post and all of us were very pleased.  I will be coming back soon.
I love
restaurant and state a little more on the menu. The prices are steep and somewhat over priced, but once they stick around, everything else is much better. If you want big chunks of Thai food, let the price tag for that has risen to $50.95. Simply put, the place is heaven.
The service was great and there are just so many attentive waitresses to let you in on your meals.  One other thing, just one note: I went there in the summer, so all the server(s) were just nice people, so this is a bigger problem.
Yum.  There is much more to these restaurants than burgers and fries.  They've got something great, I love them too.  You can't go wrong with this restaurant, unless you're looking for an atmosphere.  Food is small but not weird.  If you want to go with friends for a date, go here and get it.  You can eat at the
restaurant of choice in Texas and has consistently been very good. Its pretty much obvious that dining here was a hit and misses--as long as they had a good neighborhood ambiance to the menu. I recommend anyone else to try it out, but just be prepared to pay a little bit more for the wonderful, contemporary ambiance. A great tasting date night or simply sit back and enjoy a quiet night out and have some a drink.
The Restaurant Staff is terrible! What is wrong with this place?  For one thing, this is a really bad chain  that is headed by a very old Indian name, which I totally understand.  Plus the proprietor is extremely rude and condescending...again, just way too old for college.   Well, once you get the impression that there are no other options, you're just going to have to go elsewhere and get the rest of their menu.  Another problem is that they don't have any Steak House locations. 
restaurant in downtown Chicago; you need to go there!
I went here with my husband and son on Dec 6 for dinner at Kennedy's Market.  The food was flavorful and tasty, as always.  I did however miss the drinks we had at King Lard and Summer Harvest.  However, the menu had something for everyone.  After paying our bill, I didn't have to eat dinner that night since we were already paying for it all.  The food was well prepared.  We loved this place, but still felt pretty left out.  In the end, we had another dinner to go and could not be happier.We recommend the Sausage Deli - you can't go wrong with it!
Yummm! How quaint!  Go see that chain, Yummi.
My husband and I celebrate our Valentine's Day, and the owner forgot to tell us he needed to make reservations. We brought him a bill and proceeded to wait patiently
restaurant, that will be making or breaking up the neighborhood fast.I will do my best not to re-gather so much as try to get over my attitudes on the food. Good food can run from very inexpensive to pricey, but unfortunately this area will take care of itself.If this bakery is particularly delicious that will last for years after it closes.
One of my favorite places to eat pizza in downtown Chicago. I've had nearly every sausage the world has to offer, and I've had great deals on mozzarella, chicken and pancakes. I enjoy the grilled pizza and think we just needed to bring the most creative pizza toppings and save up for fresh ones.
Went in with family for dinner, and had the Buffalo chicken dinner with chicken, seafood, and chips. Service was friendly, friendly, great pizza, and excellent pizza. Delicious choice of pizza for appetizers. Been back for several occasions, with a bunch of changes. The person at the counter
restaurant). No oil. The food is very good. I felt as though the cheese had blown out. I'd really recommend the ranch....Won't hesitate to try the falafel.
My boyfriend and I went out on a weekday last Wednesday. We stayed in "Lincoln Square" on the 5th street.  We ended up having a pizza and lunch experience as a 2 hour wait until the check was done.  We sat around for several minutes before being seated.  After a few minutes of waiting, we made our way back.  That was about it.  The drinks were expensive and everything we ordered was cheap.The decor inside was nice but not nearly as light as what you might expect.  We left without a care of our status.  I could have had more than 10 on a blueberry martini and 10 on a churros martini.  They were either too young or too old for the atmosphere.  I did attend a
restaurant and pizza.
I loved this place.                                                                                                                                                                                            
restaurant salad; seriously.....those sandwiches were top notch, but the waitress messed up and messed up the job quite a bit. If you don't know what it is, be quiet, be patient.If you need to shout about this place (I do) and you do want to shout about the constant yelling and what seems to be being taken by an employee, head over to Complex 21. They are still going strong as evidenced by the restaurant's opening day last Thursday.  My favorite thing about them is that it is open 24 hours a day, that is excellent for people to pick their poison without having to wait 20 to 30 minutes (quite at a cost). Yes, this is just one place to have outstanding food. But it is great to have a closed or even slightly full atmosphere where you can have beer, wine and the kind that you all love. I had this wonderful veggie burrito with the olives and I couldn't be happier. The meat was amazing,
restaurant. Once again, it's impossible to find authentic.
Went with a group for a date recently, and had a great time.  It's one of the most basic beers on the menu--for whatever reason.  Still, we were hooked--they had such an amazing selection of beers, like their Salads on the Side, and we had a nice variety.  My friend didn't like the mussels, so we asked him what's the greatest in the world.  From the outside, it looked like the mac and cheese house.  The wild mushrooms were nice.  The big pile of mushrooms was nice too, but really just dipping in.  Next time I plan on coming back, I'll try out their Aged 1-2.
After chatting with mom yesterday, I found myself brought down by the gossip section - although only for a few minutes, then seated by the front desk, and got a table in which the owner sat -- finally
restaurant for all those who choose to visit it and it gets an interesting mix of the flavours.
I wish I could get past the countless reviews of this place.
I went here for a party last night, and it was so kind of a disappointment for all the wine on the menu. First I ordered a sample of most of our favorite wine from my friend's house, and he was so pleased when he saw my elation. We never ordered a drink of our own, we just wanted a hoot of benedict. My drinks were one ton, and the wine was mediocre, lacking in quality. We were delighted, for better or worse, to have the remaining wines sampled. I will say, however, that, to be fair, I will definitely be going back here once we return to Napa and consider moving to Napa. I will probably cut down my bottle list, to check on the flavor of the other wines we ordered, and would definitely be willing
restaurant would be a plus.  Our other dogs we tried earlier were better dogs, and we can get close to $25.95 for one of the only vegetarian places in Chicago for these dogs, but the prices are only about $40.00. A different price on the burger isn't quite as good and the beef comes with the jerky! I won't complain.  The beef was pretty fresh and well seasoned, which you could eat at any time of day and without worry of the cancer with the that nasty gravy, but also pretty solid and tasty too.After a quick meal or dinner we settled on a beautiful sushi combo. I won't go back here again. Maybe I'll look at the Japanese and Asian restaurants instead.  But for me it's the best sushi in Chicago I've had all year.  If I lived in East Midtown I'd visit this sushi spot with reservations all the way up the hill.  I can imagine more in San Francisco as
restaurant was left open, so that's just how we looked at it. The service was very average at best and the food was horrible. The carne asada cheese had something of a kick on it, and the cilantro cubed dip had smelly, but perfectly done and could have had a more important connotation for enjoying in a moist environment.The fruit appetizer was bland and cold. Would give 5 stars if we were spending more, but definitely give them 3 stars. - So if you like lots of health food, this place is for you. Go. - The food was average, but not bad (too bad that they let the homeless eat more fat, which was not a bad thing since I had high blood pressure and diabetes and that was way past our expectations). It is pricey though for a place like this, and the staff is nonchalant about that.
Highly recommended pizza place. Great location for the sex (nonrouseurs) or set
restaurant at the Headless Elliot. A dinner together would surely be something to come back to.
Very tasty and friendly service. Friendly staff and staff couldn't believe they were serving tacos. The last time I went we got that spicy condiment and in almost every case was fabulous. Service was exceptional.For someone who likes grits and spicy drinks, this is a nice little place to bring them in.
I love Las Vegas.  I used to live in South Bay.  The service was outstanding.  What a day the owner was putting into the Restaurant (the perfect compliment!).
I would suggest this place to anyone with any type of job (other than a job in the service industry) and that is, anyone who has studied the S&M scene and knows the Italian food...everything  is excellent at this place.  The great portions are in every category and many eateries are definitely worth a visit.  Our server is a professional, excellent person

Since I finally got to visit here in February I have gone over the costs to come up with some of my recommendations for the complete review and comments on the here's newest La Porte menu, Best Overallie Sandwich, Fajitas de la Magenta and The Toast Sandwich. This is the place for everything about a sandwich, if you're looking for something that doesn't feel overly cold you've come to the right place. The omelette and kiwi are my favorite and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the meats, veggies, seafood and toppings in a sandwich. I don't suggest food being over priced or lacking the service in any way, but it is definitely worth the visit as it really shines at La Porte. I am really looking forward to going back and going back for more and more portions and meals. I love their Appetizers and Salads
restaurant, a bit short of time, but I always make sure I get all the details correct. I've been with Oneworld for quite a few years and I'm usually happy to let the chefs talk, but a lot of the menus don't stick to that.  I'm looking forward to stopping at Pizza Boy's at another restaurant or around The Steakhouse.
Great reviews! I actually had a few weeks in the Bay Area when I went there for a Saturday brunch and it was delicious.  It was fairly crowded and smelled cheap and fresh.   Overall the ambiance was great and it was a great place to have an intimate date and get a drink at that moment in time.
Such a solid restaurant.  They were excellent food.  I like this place for my french toast but recommend it to others.
While hearing some fresh and delicious food at Lincoln Park, I stumbled on this restaurant.  It was really authentic and some of it great.
restaurant on a little South side of Grand Rapids.  They call it the Grand Kitchen or maybe it's a diner instead of a bar or a Greek cafe!  The food is always good, the service really good, and the lighting is awesome.  We only ate a few appetizers and drinks to get a taste.  I love their open booths.  Now there is a true brunch buffet, a place where you can enjoy a swanky dinner on the weekends! The best part of the drive to the Middle American Currencies is when you come to visit!
We love this place. They serve up desserts with a added twist. The food is something special, and your coffee has little flavor or there to a smidgen, but we love that the decor is eclectic and the staff is always attentive. In fact, they just started closing on a bit soon. They didn't even have much street parking to get you there. They really loved it!!The ambiance can
restaurant and window-to-showers and hostesses.  Even when I went there, you could tell he was not appreciative of us and stood by us like we were fixated on a walkabout.  We would go for like 8 of us to this restaurant, but I wouldn't be complaining about the service, the atmosphere, or the food.  And if we just call the server, he'll probably answer yes, but give you a few minutes to rest or whatever.  I also love the fresh and wonderful chocolate mousse dish (a honeycomb with mashed egg and chocolate spread on top) because I don't want a lot of bananas lying around.  Anyways, my guess is this has to be The VIP, but that will never happen again.
I did try this place several times and it's one of the best burgers in the city. I got some wings and a mix of ribs and red meats. Definitely a perfect place to get the meat
restaurant and co-owner, am this restaurant ok?
My favorite sushi spot! Perfect for your sweet tooth. My favorite croutons and delivery clients here! And I don't want to spend more money on food than a good, healthy, organic one.
I love this place. The staff is top notch! But, I know that I can't say much about the food they serve. You start out with some crappy Thai dishes, and then the fried banana wings become completely trite... but once you get a slice of that pretty big crab it gets really... well, sorta special. After paying for it, they tell you that they only make chicken and beef with no crab. So they let it rip, and it can be tough to pick your dish out of some bunch of wildflowers. Don't waste your time with the bad atmosphere that one might have a drinking problem.And, they cook food REALLY well. That's what I think you'd like
restaurant, mostly owned by Sarah, and incredibly attentive. This is the first restaurant we went to, so we had to say we would recommend them.  Rick and I sat on the couch to mix with the other chairs.  The wait staff was friendly and attentive.  The food was excellent and the drinks were a must try for those looking to try something new.  The highlight of our visit was the can beer.  Rick & I stopped by Rick's for a beer, and I had the Can pale ale (from Crinkle Stone) when I was first introduced to Can Pale Ale.  The latter was delicious!  The overall experience was phenomenal.  The menu allows you to choose from a wide variety of beers, but both of them deliver the same level of flavor that is present throughout the entire meal.  Rick & I loved the game of mine, and will definitely continue to love this place.
good art work and informative conversation..good care taken, good service
restaurant with Sushi), serves a fantastic combination of appetizers. I had three of these prawns with one hot girl who was allergic to them. Our two hosts were on a date together, so they had to wait. Although their kitchen was not noisy or soggy, our host was very friendly, and I think there were fun dishes on hand.  Even though we had a huge selection of appetizers, the service was usually a bit slow. Overall, if you're looking for a very upscale steakhouse, if you're looking to avoid the operating costs of some wimpy servers, then check to find NOLA on HUDSAY.
Totally hands down the best weekend dinner I have ever had! They are deep dish food, as always! I went first for a pleasure for the women and then took my drinks, as they serve a feast to the guests - we will never be disappointed! I highly recommend The Cheesecake Factory. The
restaurant. However, it is alright for those types of people. They're not afraid to bring their favorite drinks or food and they get the ambiance as nicely as the neighborhood. Let's review, four stars!
my food is everything. authentic mashed potatoes, duck fat pancakes and strawberry-stuffed tortillas. loved the zucchini which was tasteful. delicious! this was my first visit, it was a great atmosphere and not too expensive. each place just got right to the mark!
I love getting breakfast here and coming here every day.  I've always eaten here in late afternoon just for the food. I mean... maybe it's just me.  I have a brother who went there for brunch there and it was overhyped.  I took my brother to lunch and ordered the chicken dinner (served as the famous bread) for breakfast..(no, no I am not going to take the CHEERS to pay for the chicken and egg service
restaurant from the North side of my neighborhood, for lunch, dinner or dinner at the end of the day. Absolutely the best treat!
They've been treating you like you're their cake, and have placed a contract upon you if you order more than one of the cakes. Well....C'mon, they're ordering it!!! Someplace to get people thinking of making friends, trying new things....*sweaty*! If you're serious, a full cocktail is the best ings. More rummed cards if you like more straight up margaritas? Good but a little pricey. I'm glad to say that i made it into the next night.
Great place, great food. I won't go back for my wedding and my husband made every plate. If you're going to the Cuban spot here, do yourself a favor and go to the deliverers. The fried food and margaritas is just so bad, I'll never go back.

restaurant.This is the hub of Brazilian cuisine. So cute, I've had everything from crushed oysters to fondue, everything I tried - have had a different variety and really loved every bite! The service is exceptional, because the food is always a highlight. the only thing that would be really bad would be a side of banana bread because the sandwiches are too salty!Finally, the family section of the restaurant has some great menu choices. Everyone has fun with family. Check out this delicious salad bar and take a seat at a buffet if you're craving something different.What's next?
Crazy Pizza! The excellent sauce is especially tasty. The only downside is the pricing, if you're willing to go it's as good as of course it is at several different Italian restaurants in California.
A trip back to VEGAS! I have been there twice with many of you and in each time I gave a review, some of the reviews left a little sour or disappointed
restaurant of the week is more than generous. It's also the last meal you'll see, so if you want to go for a run to the store, try this place rather than the other wonderful pizza joints in Chicago.
One of my favorite steak dishes. I am a guy who like meat burgers and i love steak, I use to like spicy burgers too. I would never go back here if you don't know what I am talking about. The food is high quality. I have never eaten beef - just pork fat that is very tasty. Since the restaurant opened, I had forgotten that they have a great steak party (I tried to explain this in my own words; it's the word I give to this restaurant, other places take more care in promoting their steak). The bread was delicious and the meat was mostly steaks; I really like that kind of braised pork fat and saffron that you can spread on the back of the beef. The service is a
restaurant has been off the rock for the past decade. What better way to get a seat than at the bar with four people in the back?The service is exceptional. One of the restaurant's regulars - who takes care of the food - came over for dinner earlier this week, and met us on the table with his entire entree. By pairing the beer (on tap and in-line) to a communal dish of multiple plates and placing our order on the person behind the counter who reviewed our game cards, and another serving man who took care of any food in there, he gave everyone a great plate of food and gave a fantastic service. Food is decent, atmosphere comfortable, and the ambiance of bar is impeccable. Oh, and they're a small wine bar too, which was pretty good. Try it - a Frappuccino Pilsner. Oh, and it's not worth the extra fee. Total in taxes: $75.00. (http://
restaurant and patios so I couldn't miss it! The music was good; food was the highlight.
This is a very Italian style food restaurant.   I am sorry this restaurant has no branches, but if they do, I would much rather eat here again!  The atmosphere and atmosphere is very cozy and romantic.  On Saturday morning, the wait staff was very friendly and nice (was recommended by a friend).  During the party we had the clams which really charged the bill, which was far too little when paired with the ice cream.  Then there was the wine glass case which was extremely well done.   When I first visited, they gave me free wine and a free dessert.  When I requested the jus tésotas, they explained they have jus tésotas for same prices at wine parlors (the same prices they gave us at jus du vinaires).  I expected to pay twice the wine bottle
restaurant. I was already here at the summertime when they recommended it to us and asked if they were planning on serving dessert. The girl who was seated at the table told us we were going to be served a cake, although I admit that was barely worth the wait. A few minutes after we were served a special pizza, the girl in front of us let loose and got into an argument with the person in the kitchen. I apologized and went back to eat and while I was waiting at the counter she set up an appointment to let us have a snack and the staff was there waiting for us. This disturbed the customer and put a gag on our conversation and on our course of action. To finish, the waiter was overbearing and trying to please every single thing we tried in our food. Needless to say this was not a good experience for our guest. Another reason why I am calling for a 3 star rating is it just takes so long to get your money back.
This
restaurant due to the warmer weather.I ordered the Desphire Bacon Benedict beef and it was the best beef I've had. Wonderful and an hour before I left, I noticed my bill. After towing a pet by the name of Melissa, I asked the waiter what we could do about the fact that we paid for a container, which the waiter suggested, because it was red. The recipe suggested a fresh tomatoes, but at the end of it I can only taste fresh tomatoes, but the chef told us we could use some fresh basil. The crew didn't seem impressed.
Awesome food. Food for dinner and a perfect time to celebrate!!  The Salad Bar is well crafted and light at the same time.  Very authentic with enough potential to make you feel like a family, with enough of a table for all the other guests.
Very good food!!!   The only problem is that I get very sick when we go.I bought in. but the hostess

I had a Brazilian brunch and it wasn't much. Nothing to rave about. My girlfriend is vegetarian, so I would've done it myself.
Great place! Very fast service, good food, fabulous prices, Great drinks.  And for the price they offer, their food is great!
Great appetizers!  A little expensive for me, but not nothing against good food.  We have been to Hot Doug's, Connie's, Lakeview Deli and Trader Joe's and we have not had bad things to say about these places.  Best fried chicken I've had in Chicago!  I have been in Lakeview Deli for years and the local Vietnamese place (the one with the traditional wings) is the best.  I've heard about all the great Vietnamese restaurant in the city and this place has definitely made me go back to the neighborhood again!
I had a good time at the Mildurabi Bakery because
restaurant was nice, reasonable and priced. The drinks and ambiance really adds up. Service is outstanding (yes, the wait staff is nice and attentive) but in terms of getting around, their sandwich menu for next to nothing is boring. Food was way over priced, and was to die for (had it at least once). The staff is not over-dressed and chit-chat about burgers. If you like that type of environment, check this out!
Go here if you want great lunch...but not as good as the many places that call themselves North Chicago BBQ.  I got what I ordered and it was phenomenal.  It was so fresh and crisp!  The service was also fantastic!  Great atmosphere and good service.
I'm a vegetarian, since it is based off non dairy and high protein options (which were the exceptions).  The wait staff will often have more fish than there is live prawns.  Overall it's a good option
restaurant service, with excellent specials and specialties, which he loves. The service is friendly and courteous. A to go bar is always just fine but the food is delicious. The restaurant itself is nice and cozy in the mood for a few beers or a late afternoon meal. For the family, that is as it should be, and for an individual who is deeply in debt.
I have no idea if this review is sarcastic or genuine - even if it was written in the past when people called me. I've eaten there three times now, and the service is fast, there's always something there waiting for me, and I come back once I can find my way around it. To sum up, a great place! It's a relative downbeat diner, you can order anything, and you are getting dessert that you can't find in any other restaurant in Chicago. The owners are generous and consistently timely. I've never had so many that makes up for their standards
restaurant service, complimentary wine list, fun informal meeting spot and friendly service. And the egg rolls that come with the fried chicken are the best you've ever had, and they taste like old favorites.  If you're making a reservation, make sure to give it a try! We've been here on 2/12/12 and were very impressed with what we found.  Just a tip - if you don't feel like your there, come on in and give it a try.
We really appreciate the service and ambiance of the food. And this place is a MUST.  They are THE BEST!  The portion size is so large and everything goes beautifully.  Get there early, have your picnic and you'll love it!
i love this place.will be coming back!!!
best pizza in Chicago!! sorry i dont like the pictures!!! the server's sure she is very nice too.  This place has always been very disappointing and the owner recently changed his
restaurant to the heck out of my brain. Please give me a second to write a review. The burgers are good and delicious. The service was superb, we ordered the valet and dessert for dessert and they were really, really nice! The waiter was a very cool guy, he was very nice, his attitude was friendly, and he even chatted on the phone with us. The cashier was also very nice, she would not let us ask her a question, but she was the nicest person and she loved our drink! Thank you so much!  No change for everyone!!
For the ticket prices I am from Buffalo, I made the flight from Cincinnati. While I enjoyed many different options, this was the one I needed for my next stop to see fellow co-workers as they arrived. I have to mention that I went there last night after hearing about the flight from Chicago. With the crowd as large as they are, you can expect to be overwhelmed by groups
restaurant. Since it's not pizza, but a bargain, I never really thought I would be ordering from a place that has some really good pizza. There's a million other, similar places in Chicago, so I would be surprised if I'd never walked by one. I've yet to be able to find a good inexpensive slice of pizza in the city and what more can I say? Do customers go to Loop 23 to get a great steak dinner? No! Probably not. The pizza is pretty good, but not the quality. I'd definitely go back.
I've been here twice and three times on Yelp. The first time was on April 30 (the last time I ate). It was the best of the bunch. The owner was in full force that night. The dish was fresh, perfect. And you gotta wait at least 8-10 mins for it to come out. The hostess was so courteous that when I suggested you had to wait up to 7
restaurant is very healthy. Food has been phenomenal, we've enjoyed the burgers and the salad bar mimics everything about beef and vegetarian food in Chicago. Our server has a very friendly and friendly demeanor, has pointed us through a menu that is impeccable.
The food here is NOT AS GOOD as it is at the same table.  Not only is the food the same but we also have to add one thing - this guy who arrived the other night knows how to cook chicken and whatnot.  This person was willing to work for us and act as his own chef so he was good at it.  The reason why the waiter ended up out of this place was because he doesn't have any experience with duck eating.  However, the interior is very clean, romantic and interesting.  The ambiance is pretty unusual considering that it actually had one of the most inappropriate signs in Chicago - words such as 5ft 11in tall.  Well, they were pretty rude about it
restaurant's by the way. Of course this's your neighborhood for ceviche, that's a mix of the kinds you need. As a Superdome resident and owner of Plenty, I think I could probably get away with five. Great thing about going to Nice is that I have to try this place up close. Food and service will be good, and I'll also recommend this place if you've been so adventurous. Good Luck, but let me know what you think!
I'm SO sorry to have to say this place was terribly disappointing, only good for a breakfast/wonton.   I wish they had kept everything from the buffet menu instead of use it as an excuse to go to large groups.  For what it's worth, this place did NOT disappoint... and, however only served me two sandwiches and one big ol' plate of whipped cream....haha, its kinda lame... except, it was SO good....this place is NOT good anymore
restaurant back from the business office before they reached them at sunday. However, the Sushi & Salad was exceptional. I will definitely return to Codash if my girlfriend gets me!
Fantastic sushi!
How can you not love this place? Last night at Orange Lunch I was at Orange Lunch.  For the fee of two pitchers of beer the food was way better than what was coming out of the brewery!  I must say the food itself is very good.  Unfortunately the server was so jaded that he was addicted to it all.  Once upon a time the same man was there at our table, we skipped the bill and explained that this place is not authentic.  They asked for signatures, but once we stood back and watched them walk off with the empty plate, I was fully insulted.  I needed to put in a counter for the next one that evening, this place has not even been cleaned up yet.  I really need this place out
restaurant style with small plates, and everything is fine, but to compliment my regular pizza for the price, I had to try the crepes and it was no nice. Its pretty dirty, but that's ok I guess...
One of the best coffees I have ever had! It's so cute, so delicious and so simple, I felt a little tired after trying the watermelons at least three times. Needless to say they are out of this world! The only downside is that it can be boring when you eat it.
This is the best Italian joint in Chicago. The food is the best in Chicago.
Hot!   I have always been inspired by this place and that is where I'm from.  The desserts are fantastic and the service is great.   Can't go wrong.  It's intimate as it is all about the service and its reasonable to expect nothing to be taken away from the experience.   The food is fresh, the
restaurant all day!
This place is pretty decent, especially the service which is very basic. A number of things were important to me, most notably the menu being simple and the item selection. First and foremost, because I absolutely adore Chef Al. We have always been savory and fried meats as well as deviled meat, all of which have really helped us build our taste buds.  Also, very traditional if a head is full, the tofu dip and the lamb-churros. Overall, a great experience and happy hour.
I have been here a few times and never have felt that I could go wrong. When it comes to food, the service is a bit bland but the staff is decent and the food is ok. The food is fresh and easy to eat. Staff is attentive and their in-depth knowledge of each dish is excellent.  I was happy for dessert but a few tables down I was lost as to all of the dishes.  It was
restaurant and delicious food. They are very upscale and we highly recommend visiting first. the place is well served. we are all here for the comfort of the little restaurant.
That delicious red meat sandwich we had here and got a receipt today! There is enough flavor to fill you up for at least a couple hours (not frequenting the trendy food pantry, or going for 50 bucks!). Please give a tip of $5 or more to anyone who comes to this place for their full experience!They make the sure that you get the first serving of your own bread!!You can buy "bug bread" yourself! I really don't care for your bread!! Then if you decide to cut yourself off and ask for food I will, I guess they are going to give you a freebie!! Wow, didn't realize the quality of your bread just fell off the table!!
a good, quiet place for nice casual conversations. its clean, japanese-inspired food is almost
restaurant on Friday morning, an event that shows the entrees only five minutes after it's been offered. He liked what he saw: Rakhnaw's Sauvignon Blanc and Smokin' Jackrabbit Dinner. He asked that only a couple should be ordered, which is rare, but the waiter didn't want to give up his favorite crusty-ass thing for a finish.  He didn't quite get what he wanted -- clearly he wanted some quality hamburgers with real meat.He will take you right here. Plus, the wait is ridiculous, and not worth the effort. Besides the basic food, which consists almost exclusively of roast beef, shrimp, and chicken, the meat in this blend is incredibly flavorful. Or maybe it's about the taste of a wine pairing. Yes, the atmosphere is loud and upbeat, but, boy, does that dinning booth have some dignity.Instead, just spend an hour hanging out with a loud, hyper-activ
restaurant. Not really here as my baguette was riddling around. Very pleasant!
I've been to Rushmore a few times.  This one reminds me of Mexico City.  The atmosphere here has always been warm and welcoming, and the food is well prepared.  They've tried a lot of different dishes and continue to deliver on top.
I was surprised to experience the Cow Palace once again.  I know the burrito is good, the food is great, but this was more of a group of people and I would not be able to enjoy the menu of bowls we had with just one server.  I highly recommend this place.  The Chinese Out Burger is one of my all-time favorite dishes, the Fogo Bar is my go-to cocktail spot... but I'd never had one before this place.  Definitely worth going for a bite, but won't go back.
This place is stellar and always great. I had the Harvest Rib
restaurant in every breath.  They really make a good alternative to be quarantined or put on the shelf.  I also did not experience any food poisoning, but wanted to note that this may have been an intentional deception.  Will not be going back.
For my 3rd birthday I decided to be a vegan, and had the pleasure of taking part in my friend Dustin's excellent vegan birthday celebration.  I am excited about going back in 2018 and finally have it by virtue of the fact that I live so far south in one of the most highly regarded neighborhoods in Chicago (aka Lee DeLong), which is an amalgamation of Chicago and Fogo Park.   This place really has the hype.  Over 20 people were bringing out their best and biggest vegan guacamole, sauces and antipasto to the table.  All of which was wonderful.  Not to mention the sparkling wines, cocktails and antipasto we were enthused with. 
restaurant. I prefer the creative environment. For example, me and my host both have close encounters with diverse groups of people, especially from Asian and South American joints, etc.  The ambiance on a cold night is a refreshing experience.  The drinks are clean and well crafted.  The wine list is a little small and even I really enjoyed some of the IPA that I brought with me, which was the Aries that turned heads everywhere I looked!
Notices of closing come shortly in the evening. We order by appointment. When we arrive, we promptly split the bill between two tables in the bar, and have two tables sitting on the counter. All seated patrons are in no position to touch the bar until closing. We decided to wait around an hour, while waiting in line. It took us about 15 minutes to get our plates, our dinner meal (chicago, yummy!), and the salsas that are waiting for us at the bar. During closing,
restaurant, movie review, or diner! I really enjoyed it.  And, by the way, if you are a girl/woman, you probably won't like the chicken.  But hey, I am one of those girls! (Hooray!)So to sum it up, I hate going to Steubenville because they are too greasy, high-brow and very pricey.  I hate going to one of their famous hipster food joints.I love the chefs. The combination of flavours, costuming & not-so-too-narcissistic I love in terms of cost per bite.  If you want to have one of those indulgent places, you're in for a little taste of the Michigan dishes of the future. - Justin Martin
This restaurant, which boasts spectacular vineyards, has become one of my favorite places in town for deep dish pizza. I had this favorite dish first place in Chicago and everyone who has been there says the topp
restaurant. The owner went into town and left not noticing the food was being served. What changed? The waitress came to deliver things and took the bottle for me. I gave my waitress my pass and I'm all about honesty. I talked to her when I checked and the prices were reasonable. What she did was a little off course and was a little odd. The waiter finally offered me a small cashier at the ready. Then, at about 8 a.m., we heard about the salmon. And the customers.     It went like this: it had a lot of seasoning, the taste was special.   We were told the next morning that if it's falafel, that's fine.   Yes, I understand that falafel is weird, but what a surprise to receive what I was expecting when you're looking to prepare a rare salmon of the world.    Chicken is.     Okay, so falafel
restaurant * Security : Friendly, patient and helpful * Service : Hose to please, hot dogs with cold cap on as you eat, wine on as you drink, for an average meal - restaurant deals with furore all throughout town
Favorite Beer Menu: lamb chops, dogs... ;-),  both are good! We can't wait to start a weekend of family for pleasure!  I've always had  cheap  line up (like I do) but can't wait to go back once the furore is under control.
This is my favorite brunch place in Chicago.   My husband and I had a great time.  The eggs Benedict Benedict has been good for hours...no, soggy.  The party came early and seated a few seats ahead of us but after one hour-plus the other half was seated next to us.  The light was nice, the wine was good (this one was a bit under $3), and it came
restaurant and hand made pizzas are every bit as good as regular american restaurant experiences!<|endoftext|>
restaurant.
I was very impressed. The food was good. The coffee made my day, they have big variety of drinks so it makes it perfect for dinner!  Fantastic food and unique drinks. I've been coming to this place for the past few years. It was amazing to take in. The walls are festooned with camera angles and taken by buskers who couldn't be more thrilled about each new line of screen.
One of the very best places I've been in in Gatorade when I am away from the bustling Chicago area.  I had the Scutari from DBA; the crusty, doughy steak tenderloin was so delicious and moist that I hadn't even been eating it for 5 minutes!  The food is extraordinary (lovely crusty steak), the music is perfect (family-friendly to a choir) and the service is great!  I can't say enough about this place.
One of the nicest places in
restaurant/dessert/raffles/cheesecake...Don't you need help putting on some really terrific cake? Can't wait for you to head to Estevale and walk away and choose to enjoy all the wonderful food....And. Great place.   *Sarah Shea not happy with the packaging
This is my favorite sushi spot in Chicago. One of my friends and we recently moved to New Orleans, so I wanted to try the stale oyster rolls and the whole plant stand which has so many great dishes. I was expecting beef which had a tangy, tangy texture to it which seemed even more amazing than beef a couple months ago. The risotto was just ok! That's what makes stale oyster rolls so good, they seem more like something you would get at McDonalds. There was a long line when we ordered, but once we gave them a whirl we actually got their soup! Also, they serve salads, so great! I
restaurant = (p.s. Also, if you don't want to spend even a small amount of money, you'll have to order chicken.)*Penalty-it was an easy menu with a massive selection of crusts and sauces. Would recommend waiting 2 hours in line.For breakfast, it was simple and fast. Not terribly appealing if you plan to wait all day for food, but fresh meats that are fantastic! Especially great with sandwiches for entrees like granny jean. Overall just extremely good. Served well with a half-dozen or so other vegetarian options.
I was going to say this was the best meal I've had.  We were there with $6.00 in our bank account with $1 in our credit card payment.  It was simply amazing. I couldn't wait to see what dishes I'd get made with their sauce and foie gras...  We were just a quick stop when the bar came up and asked the manager
restaurant at The Lawrence Meats, and also owned a couple of other places before he'd gone to Chicago, St Louis, and Chicago Heights. With countless offers to cut out of his budget, St Louis, and Chicago Heights offer, I prefer to see if Chicago's had a better Chef's Degree to the variety.
It is totally bizarre that I've been so great to a restaurant.  It was a fresh start with unique ingredients and design (diet pork w/ sausages - awesome!).  Once the wine list starts to come together, the pricing is fantastic.  The combo of three dishes will definitely make you feel good about visiting.  Overall, definitely a good option for a date night.
THE BEST.  The service was good.  The service is great.  The service and atmosphere was great.  As soon as I stepped out I was delighted.  Did you know that when you enter the area one people enter and one person leaves and neither
restaurant is plentiful. The flavors of this meat are exceptional, like bright, greasy, and fresh.
My first American pizza. The bread is pulled up from the oven. The sauce is unbelievable. I would order a few more of the pastas with tenderized potatoes, sausage, blue cheese and a strawberry wine starter. The price is reasonable - by the pound! The pizza is half price and takes about 6-8 minutes. (the service may not be great - but just okay. )The one time we got an Italian wrap pizza that was nearly 30% off, we ordered it with their beautiful tres leches. At the time we ordered it, we were told it was just Greek and it was actually 40% off! This isn't crazy, it isn't expensive, and we absolutely recommend it as a restaurant!
An awesome thing I got here on Saturday night...I went back after a week with my girlfriend. We got together and we just stopped at
restaurant at each location. It would be unreasonable to suggest that they place more diners per table. If this is still eating at an establishment in the NTA then the staff are not welcome. I would still recommend to everyone to go to the Fino's during Monday in October, when the Oysters are still available.
First time I have been to Wicker Park Grill I was shocked and disappointed!   The food is superb and very tasty, the service is friendly, the management is always helpful, and prices are reasonable.  After watching the meal I decided that I would go for a quick bite!  Was a steal and only lost a few dollars.  The BBQ sauce was awesome!  I gave the steak a try because I thought it was tender and juicy, the pork belly was tender and juicy but not dry or fat.  I did note that the meat was very cold and no flavor whatsoever.  We did have extra tasty on a side dish. 
restaurant, 2.9 Points I've had at least once in this week.Great atmosphere, extremely friendly staff and attentive food (lots of great wine selections and exceptional service).
I've been here 4 times now...since their D20 oil bath was released. Their staff is mind-boggling...very friendly and attentive. As a service giver, I appreciated their personal preference, and hoped they would like me to be around.  The guest list was pretty good, with some extremely delicious dishes you could almost name.  Deliciously sized appetizers that could be ordered on both sides.  Just fabulous options for food pairing. Good selection of menus and fast service, very tasty and charming. Great place to relax.They also have live music, which is definitely appreciated by many couples. You can bring your parents, grandparents and even just people playing around their neighborhood. They are GREAT places to meet new friends!
My husband went here on one of the busiest nights
restaurant goes better with the Fogo Co. not being so much "coffee chain" (which still works for me).  I thought it was a nice place to get some coffee and something different to enjoy, however...I was surprised by the service and the prices.  I do have an reservations...I'll wait until they have more tables to make room for anyone who likes kalp chai, but i am definitely heading back to this place.
When you're going to a restaurant for a great meal or treat, the wait is long and it's a bit nerve-wracking... But the burger is fantastic and the service was outstanding.  Our waiter and restaurateur, Milia Chaverdi joined us for dinner, as they were about to deliver the piece of the cake.  Both were on blast with the clientele, and the appetizers, dishes and dishes were outstanding, whether the minute they were served, or over the next couple of hours.
restaurant, ticonderous, tastefully crafted food, decent ambiance and wonderful service. Our only complaint would be to see the pace of moving food if you do sit and have been there longer.We believe that playing the game with big groups of customers is very addictive to our bodies. We definitely love the environment and the food of this restaurant, whether it is an Asian or Western establishment, it is one heck of an experience to enjoy! Do you have a favorite salad bar that is becoming a hit in your favorite neighborhood? Or restaurant that is changing all over the place? We are trying to love what we do to entertain ourselves and our friends. We want to try anything, and keep our friends satisfied as well.
OK, this place is definitely worth a try!  My husband and I like the house atmosphere and lighting, but they have a heavy emphasis on authentic music and cuisine.  We've been going here several times a week and we would say that it is
restaurant, dining area and corporate hospitality. Dinner option  can be fancy - dinner can go either way!
Terrible. Nothing special to say about It's not even a cafe in the way of the Hadamiyan slice & this place is neither. I went there last Friday afternoon and had the chicken tikka masala and it was for 10pm. The only reason I haven't left it being is that it wasn't churros.  Still terrible. Food was okay - what would be worth the price is it's alot of stuff!
Food to die for. Pastas are delicious and simple. I just can't wait to eat here again.
Eating and standing at the door with a small group on a nice Sunday evening, was excellent.  Sadly the glass ceiling only served 4 people and during my visit the views couldn't be better.  My girlfriend called us asking if we wanted to have the 'big game' and we had no idea we
restaurant. My daughter ate at hers, and I don't care what happened afterwards, but we did! Thanks for a great experience and a fantastic place for the daughter and we'll be back again!
This is one of the most anticipated appetizers I have ever eaten. The food was different and different... and unique... and the service was slow and patronizing, the lines were long and noisy, and the food wasn't exactly fresh and delicious.  It was always crowded, but the server was very respectful, and continued to take my recommendations. There were a lot of new options on the menu, and a couple that didn't make it up, so it was hard to get a quickie and drink that was excellent.
Great food! Great owner and food was great! Always service was friendly and helpful, but once you are seated there will be a wait.
I've been going to this place many times. What I cannot say is how good the food is,
restaurant may well have risen over their plates, but not today. But I thought we'll finally have a seat inside the cramped cozy cardboard backdrop of a little flower farmhouse. Perfect table for a picnic-goers first.
Sales:   decent, quality steak + Belgian Gold quality lamb sandwich for $35 but still not like the pub style chicken sandwich that I went to for a picnic.  The sandwich was so good that I ate it whole for lunch and there were some which came right out and ate well.  Finally they kept it very fresh for dessert which was fun.The cheese pizza of course was phenomenal as well.  Probably one of the best courses I have ever eaten at a friend's place.When my friend got here she ordered the Pancakes and she really was pleased with how the pancakes were delivered. I really hope I'm going to go back and try them again later because I'm more than happy I haven't.  Not to mention there are all
restaurant is quaint at best and simple. For dessert you have either Jackob Salad with Churro or Roasted Churros. The price is reasonable and affordable.
Vomit is a BYOB restaurant.  The service is great and the staff is always helpful.  Overall, Great place for couples. It's a little overpriced but if you're looking to try one of the other restaurants with specials, good food, and higher quality product then they're definitely worth the wait. I plan to return for lunch on the weekends.
Having reviewed everything in this review, one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to would be the Green Lantern Marge's.  It has a pretty difficult Yelp review which I can't imagine.  However, they have plenty of reviews to go around.  They have great staff, loyal customers, and great food, which you would expect from a somewhat upscale restaurant (sometimes/all other times) but they just make things worse
restaurant status would've be about as bad as you'd think.  That's not to say that we'd want to go in our 45 minute pace with 15-20 crowd members on a hot day.  But I think we're actually ready to go so we need to use our time wisely.  We were waiting a bit while, trying to get onto the table (you know, to actually sit down) and it was late.  We chugged food so fast we couldn't walk.  So, it was a disaster that the service was stuck between us.  We'll admit it: we didn't like it.  Just to be nice, we seemed to be raving about how good we could be without everyone looking at us as some kind of japanese plasticity.  It really just went off my tongue.
This place is known for their Mexican food.  I never even got to try the lasagna because I always have to get super stuffed
restaurant, along with a set of numerous desserts.After the lunch, I finally got a drink. They looked really good and recommended that we spend a great hour or so at a nearby cafe.We did!  The real deal looked fantastic!I was complimented by several of my friends for being our Hostess, and I had some of the best chocolate bites I have ever had.  Two long wait tables before we opened the door, and we still managed to seat about 10 people for a pleasant meal.All in all, I would definitely give this place the 5/10.
Went in, very happy. Always leave by car after 4am and have wonderful/nice food.Best Vienna food. Good beer selection.
Fancy the Wicker Park Style Vienna BBQ joint?  The best.  I like to go to with friends to talk to.  Atmosphere is cozy and cozy.  I love coffee and take my kids there for dinner.  Everything
restaurant on Nogales!! :O
This place must be an exceptional place to go on days of jadob. It has a small sandwich bar, but it is big enough for large groups. Simply walk in and ask the waiter where your food comes from, and his answers will be real. It is a local restaurant based on long standing training to be the best on the block (not only a joke, but a fact). Nothing out of the ordinary by this point in their experience. Will definitely be back!
Ok, this place is great to go for dessert, but it was no fun at all. I didn't know about their original sourdough but my wife was as excited to try that thing as I was at some of the other pick-up spots for the place (Thanks to Sam, I'm tempted to mention for my wife that we also have pre-made chocolate and egg pancakes here so we'll be going there with her if we need to).
restaurant (My name is Selena Carrotita so I can speak) took care of my duck dinner while the next waitress offered to help with our dinner. She was totally nice and polite.  She made every effort to keep us together, especially during our dinner hour. Everything was very polite. Everything was efficient and professional and friendly. I have been to Guisadana before, and all of the customers there are in excellent spirits. Most of the restaurant is cheap as hell.  If I had a problem with service, I would suggest the next wait.
This is the best Wines we've had in Chicago. We didn't have to wait for a reservation, we just walked in and waited for the wait to end. Our waiter took our money and allowed us to enjoy a complimentary tab. She also took our food order which was good. They were very accommodating. We'll definitely be back, and thank them for coming.
Don't take it easy - there
restaurant 3:00 pm - 5:00 pm - 5:30 pm
This place really will be enjoyed. The coffee bar was so good with the spicy food I ate the other night. The service was always great, the service was always good, the atmosphere was pleasant and very nice...
I am a stickler for South Island fare. I am 4.5 of the scale so I tend to stick with my choices based on what's at the bar. I have had nothing like this dining experience. I love fried chicken, and was not disappointed. This place has a lot of great choices and prices are reasonable. I suggest checking the menu, but overall this place is outstanding! I will be going back.
So I had our Malgo's Double Cheeze a few months ago and it was alright. The new filling is to die for! Chicken is bhi braised and karbi steamed in a sticky gravy paste, crunchy. I wouldn't
restaurant - I will not be back after hearing about the cost to hire a chef. Will just be looking forward to reading reviews and reading their reviews again.
I love this place. It is great to try new things, change how you eat, and even have a drink. I've been to Paris from time to time, but my major gripe is that they don't have a large selection of food, so I can't get that. I agree with others that great food is better than anything in the world, and I think they are right.
Been there a few times and this place was good!  The food is good, the atmosphere was fresh, the cocktails were great.  The servers are awesome and the food is different than my friends and I will definitely go back. I am always getting asked about my favorite and if you like nothing more than table service I will go there every once in a while for a quick hit!
This place is awesome.
restaurant).My experience with Halal and Orphas is nothing to write home about - but I do think I've probably given a bad impression to others after a long day at the restaurant.  I've always ordered from other vendors and as such rarely get my order from a KEP or From space in order to eat the breakfast.  What's really sick about the halal line is it's all wrapped up in a wasabi salad bar.  I wish this restaurant were a place that offers the most authentic Halal.  Until I get some in New York, I'll be going back.
Too bad my girlfriend and I were not hungry for a drink.  We took 7 people in for a birthday dinner.  Oh my gosh did anyone notice...they were just hungry?  How could our tastebuds have waited so long for an even longer-delayed service as we waited outside.  At first, it seemed like a hotel-like utopia
restaurant in the neighborhood, while the parking lot (located on the corner between the two blocks) is pretty nice. However, beware that you should have a way of bringing a small group (around four of us) and most importantly, you should be prepared to work at least four hours a day. And yes, unless you're playing against friends or family from out of town, there will definitely be crowds. As I mentioned above, you'll have to work at least 45 to 80 hours per week. I've walked in the kitchen, run into the party, worked at this bar and a few other places, etc., to impress people, with even more people! Be careful though! Do all your best, you'll impress all of us!
I love Nuevo Leon, and have long been a fan. The delivery is great, and I feel that since the restaurant is in the same location as the soup bar, we shouldn't go hungry there.  And the
restaurant.  Now, this is what a very tiny, tender Buddha does: You're not going to see them serving you a birthday cake or a bottle of wine, you're going to be seeing a lot of the same people eating great Thai dishes.  After all, the establishment can be bigger and nicer on average than you might think.   I could eat at much bigger tables if I wanted to, but seriously, I can't see how this customer service could ruin a great Vietnamese restaurant.
If you go to East Chicago you are going to have to pay $5 for a nice Italian lunch.  This is due to the hot dogs and the margaritas.  That's right, your meal is going to cost less than the cost of a lunch at a hostel that serves them.  You would go elsewhere for your hot dog, but for the price, I really like that extra something.  You can, however, go for tacos at a bus station
restaurant, if it's fresh then good luck here.
Good food, decent service and the fact that you can eat from the window. I recently made the duck dinner which was sooo good. On a number of occasions I have had bad experiences.
well worth it from a true family restaurant. business...the value can't be beat this place!!'
Great food...Free parking on Main Street. Try getting your order there first....
go
you gotta try this place  for brunch or there and if you're lucky they will give you a reservation so you don't miss out on any of the time you wait you're probably going to miss out on. for some reason i just love them all the time. a place to go for brunch, to maybe coffee? I'm usually not the type of person who likes to talk and hang out with random people who always ask what can happen there. but this place was worth the time so long as you feel like it
restaurant: delicious, great service, great location, easy to get around. Affordable for appetizers, especially those that are longer.
My favorite place to go. The staff is attentive, great for a night out, and always nice to talk to. Very cozy place.
When I live in Springdale, Michigan I get the 2nd time in ten years. Service is always great. Highly recommended.
the food is amazing so as soon as we go, it makes our stomach hurt, but the service keeps going up as we go. Also, everything is PERFECT! I can't wait to go back to Chicago again, and this is my favorite bar in Chicago!!
This place has really built a fan following.  After going there, I said I'd love to visit with friends, and I'd be happy to wait 15 minutes, just to see the menu.  The experience was amazing, and the food was delicious.  Went with a host for dinner
restaurant is stellar. Thanks Luxo for a great brunch!
If you enjoyed talking to other new ensembles of Belgian cuisine, you may love this place. Now go try a couple of their other entrees: the Lunch/Downe, Dinner/Restaurant Kiosks, etc. I can't recommend Luxo enough. As the name suggests, they bring you salad and fresh, cooked entrees, special casseroles, and desserts for just $10. And if you want to get up early for brunch, there are two small portions of entrees available for that. Worth the money, with a few specials.
Have I not had the Trigonaki Cheese?  Can't wait until next time I go out at night for lunch!  I had my wife's on a Tuesday night at 4pm.  It was perfect, her tastes so fresh and the meat so tender. I really enjoyed everything and was actually very fond of the greasy ol
restaurant on Christmas Eve or anywhere in the neighborhood.
They don't always have them, but when I did visit yesterday we stopped at John's and had a great time!  The staff was great!  For a great wine selection, specials, and a knowledgeable menu it can be tough to beat.I am in the process of making some fancy table washers in my opinion.  I can't wait to put them together and take them out to dinner on summer weekends. And for dessert get over them!
A friend and I started out my culinary journey by celebrating their organic wine pairing, Belgian winter wines and foie gras.  When we got to Michigan there were 45 different varieties available and they all had unique combinations of meat and wine!  We ordered 2 of each style from 1 of these 5 restaurants and the other two selections of wine were lost.  Luckily we had plenty of homecooked rib roast in our order and didn't have to wait for hours for any
restaurant immediately went AWOL.  I would go back here again in a heartbeat.  If I could always eat at that restaurant in the AM on weekends, I would.  With all this cheap, light seating, I will definitely return.
Came back here last week after the Lawrence Martin was opened.  We went to see the concert, so I was interested to try their signature french toast toast and the wine cellar brews.  The wait was amazing, the food was delicious, so we ordered some.We started with the most fabulous Cuban tea which was amazing!  There were some wonderful rasgas crepes too, because we were told that it was just my birthday dessert.  The second crepe came with a citrus candy empanada which was very much our  favorite and must have been on an anniversary.  After a ton of shopping though I found that the only flavor was a garlic grass fruit that was quite sweet and light.The spinach raviol
restaurant.  Food is fantastic and prices reasonable.  Then we walked away with our lunch.  When our hostess suggested the soup, we offered her a meat a la carte, roasted beef and some sliced almonds.  We were pleasantly surprised.  The ingredients were great, the meal was enough for a starter but not enough for the huge appetite.We had no problem ordering back home, we don't crave pork and there's a number of other vegetarian options around the city, it's all great vegetarian food.
This place is great because it's deep and everything they serve there is amazing. So many different items and it's definitely a must to have if you want to go outside the walls of 5-6 blocks. If you don't know what The Third Street Food is or don't like the counter on the side, go to Shove Village or any restaurant on the north side.  Not bad at all for what you could pay for, which is the room
restaurant told us that they were serving dinner at this time. Again it was 2 A's when we checked the menu. The waiter was rude but even if it was more than 2 8's worth of service by this time.I also got the same impression with the lack of seating. Everything was very noisy and deflated. My husband says the server was reading a book he had and she hadn't even stopped talking to him. I will certainly go back when I see what she's getting away with this was.
Free wine selection - very trendy for a decent Italian restaurant, we only have 3 at that...And for $20 we could spend $25 a night trying something different...Ordered the once-a-week pasta bratia dish but I could see how they make pasta that faty. Plus my favorite place is on the footpath (8' tall), also in my thinking this is a cozy space for brunch.
Very reasonable and affordable at the end of
restaurant is jammed from time to time because the wait staff never lets you bring out your favorite meal.  Always excellent service and value for money.  Now available for you in an almost abandoned airport!
Such a cheap, low calorie product that actually tastes good!  And the garlic knots they use in salads are really good too.  A little pricey, but you get the idea.  Try it and see!
Appetizer is the best Greek restaurant in Chicago (if you don't want to eat there).  Even good mashed potatoes are good at first but your stomach gets tired and asks for a finish!  Great midday brunch but dont want to wait that long because the food is awesome.  It does take about 45 mins to get the ingredients but, once you arrive they will put your foot down!  They don't stop there because you get a soup bag and the potato is amazing.  Make sure you add 2 slices of bacon to the bowl!

This restaurant is always crowded, but if you're going to order your own thing, I suggest checking on the menu. It's not that difficult. At this point, I would not recommend it. It is an  oasis for great food. If you are looking for a rich, intimate experience, I highly recommend it, not just for the name alone. The service is always right.
There's a lot going on here, but the quality of the food is exceptional. The service is responsive, but not poor.  Parking isn't bad, but they sell it in un-secured garages if you just need a place to sit in the car. The ambiance does not keep up with the upscale Italian restaurant's exciting flavors, but everything is excellent. The food is worth every penny, and the service does matter.  I know it has been a long time coming, but I have never felt so many loyalty requests and enjoy this place after a
restaurant breakfast and dinner with family, friends, business associates and guests. If you haven't yet checked out, don't worry, the wait is long. We had the Fat Puddles which were light and moist, light to medium-fluffy (a blend of fish and fruit). The sweet potato and cauliflower with very little tomato sauce was tasty.The Steak Ribs were really outstanding. They were very delicious, just some of the better steak I've ever eaten.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable and friendly and his presentation was even better.  Of course, the main dish items did not work.  Try Margherita and Fajitas for $20+ for the sweet potato and cauliflower, and definitely consider the meat options!
THE BEST BEACH OF DEATH COMING OUT.  1.  The escargot platter has SO MUCH TO DIE.  When you get it from this place I recommend it.  The octopus is
restaurant, there is room to accommodate anybody in your situation. They can be packed and you don't want to be gassed up by the heat or wetness. The outdoor dining room that you can sit on is also smaller and less busy, and the temperature won't bother you when you are looking for a table. The only downfall to Beedroach is that it's quite busy, so you have to come by a half hour before getting a table.
Nice place. Maybe worth a visit if you like sausages and meats - but there's almost no money to be made on any of these items.
great brunch place for that kind of attitude.
I've been to many places and heard everyone here describe his favorite experiences - perfect people who can provide exceptional service. Unfortunately, that statement has lost meaning for many of us.  The only thing that has changed, however, is the word "waitstaff."  The word "waitstaff" simply means "e
restaurant

1) Make your own sauces - this little restaurant is amazing!   We love the Allas Luxe cupcake dish and all of the other desserts that we think seem to match this delicious recipe.  If you're looking for my favorite desserts, here you go.  The pasta is delicious as well.  The Chicken (fried beans), and the cheese (gluten-free) bring a break!  Not only is it an incredible bowl of ice cream, it's also packed with everything we love about this place: fresh ingredients, freshly made desserts, great service, and fabulous customer service.  You can stop by one of these wonderful eateries and pick up a bite of their delicious dessert.
I've been coming here since I moved from East Chicago to Alinea's and been very satisfied with the food.  The menu is expansive and you can taste the highlights of each dish: the onion was totally under cooked (flaked).  Nice
restaurant in the space and the blend of flavors creates outstanding ambiance, comfort, and value. It's also affordable.  My favorite neighborhood restaurant in Chicago and I am definitely a frequent returner.  It's also good to have food like that.  I can't recommend anything that feels more inferior to a cheap sushi place.
I was going to go with some friends and I thought I'd take them here to enjoy some of the best sushi in town. But there were so many reasons why I had to order it from the usual menu, there was just something missing. There was a menu and the hostess didn't know what it was going to be. I ordered the Salmon and Shelf scallops, the yucca lobster, and the smoothie, but I could have skipped the steak - It was a sampler, and I ate it for my birthday! The service was outstanding, and the food was tasty too. The service also tried something from the
restaurant in a good place, so I was all-in with my first order. I love her quick service and terrific food! We also recommend that you check this place out!
Great food. Very good atmosphere. This place is crazy overpriced!
by tinypaw crazy amazing amazing sushi line. amazing trashcan sounds dont remember lol
This is another Chicago staple. I have enjoyed the Mi Boo Pue and have been back many times since i was there. The sauce was outstanding and the presentation of the food was really good. I have been going there at least 5 times, and I have only been more than twice. The pizza is the best, the plain tortilla is also my favorite dish, and the gravy dessert dish is superb too!I am a sucker for smelly canned goods in recent years, but I love what they have in the fridge because that is what makes the noodles special. We also go here for the appetizer, which is almost as good
restaurant.   They are literally waiting to take you anywhere! I do have one thing I do really like, though...do not eat outside.   Even though it is noisy, their food is actually yummy.  Maybe one of the ingredients was just mixed in.  Try the lavender tea and you will see the difference.  You could definitely tell by the special place on the dining area.  It's definitely a steal.  The beer list is great too, so try something a little different.  Try the sourdough at their table at their picnic table.  They do not have those kind of pies, so try nothing else.  It will be good.  Good dinners.  Go!
I saw this place in July so i don't really like what they have to offer.  When I walk into the bar the bartenders leave it a pockmarked look in their faces.  You could easily tell something was wrong with the guys
restaurant was out of my rotation and needed more.  Our dinner at Pe'n Crunch was not good, the decor was bland, and the prices were over-priced.  We all paid for all this crap and we would be back!
What a disappointment we went there.  Maybe it was because the food had another stupid name.  That, I should tell you, is not OK, the food came out with one's mouth open, stuffed with SAUCE I had pea soup, and my co-workers noticed that.  When we tried the pizza, we sat down next to the counter, walked over to the popcorn and presented it to our waiter. He made me a small beer in our mouths, placed his cockroach pizza in my mouth and set his cockroach pizza away from my mouth.  We both decided the pizza was excellent.  Their owner is a really great dude.  I wish we were more in that mood.  I'm not
restaurant. The place was fun, in my opinion. Anyways, it was a bit chaotic. I'll be back again for more.
I'd been going there twice a year, which I always get the ticket for, and my parents always got it. However, the food was never great, and the owner wasnt even in our dining room. The staff was just so rude. But I had to watch it. And, if you're visiting an area where there are 3 off-the-clock drivers, waiting in line or working on a project, this might be your first encounter with this guy. If you love a home-cooked meal, your food is always higher quality and your food is purer. We ordered salad and pizza, and the price was well above what I was expecting. The thing that pushed this spot to insanity was the wait staff. I guess they needed an apology from the client. Now we'll never go back.
The house cooked chicken
restaurant. The bathrooms are reasonably close by and this place was really crowded, but good food and helpful service make a great spot for quick change.I always bring my family with me on Sunday mornings, to enjoy quiet time with my friend and while we're waiting for the doors to open. For dessert though, the dining room was empty as it was late at night, so I really have to try to make a reservation.
This is my friend's favorite restaurant in Chicago. The portions are endless and the service is top notch. My two sisters are not very helpful at all but I also love the coqcans which are made of all the finest veggies I've ever tasted in their life.  We also took the pork salad and green onions at lunch and it was good!All in all my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Best ribs and vegetarian options in the city!
Love this place. Great atmosphere with fantastic food! The owner is great as well! Our server is always
restaurant for both brunch and brunch with people after dinner. This place has a great open-air vibe, open year-round, it's well stocked with Greek, Italian, and Turkish cottages, they are friendly and always busy. The sushi and rice is incredible. A side dish of roll and rice is worth every penny. My family regularly visits, with 2 other friends, and a half adult, for appetizers like sambakshashou jasmine which are stuffed with veggies, crab legs, raw shrimp, and fruit. Other specials include the fantastic limited menu selection (except the fin ang, which it was cooked in a homemade oil based on peruvian flour) which bring out a delicious delicious variety of seafood. Definitely in the neighborhood of $3.95 (no sales tax etc). Eat there!
what a killer! The place is fun. I'm only going with people who are into good food!
I have not ever tried to make love to
restaurant 4.85 $16 one way per meal is under $20 per person.Service and many items were on the menu, but it was still about what you'd expect.  The menu was overpriced, and no good service.  Service was very good but I don't know if it helped us so much because I never ate at an Fino's but would have loved that it was fine for a non-fino there.
Diners are always appreciated! A few were looking for a mid 90's diner in Lincoln Park or if you're looking for a great beginning in a great area have some reservation. $20 and half can get you one table on the first come, first serve. You have one off the table, it's very tasty and to be honest to one I've had the best menu, i think some of the best.
My husband and I have been to many places, and the NY location has always been in our top four. The
restaurant at La Jolla.  Huge range of tastes in the ingredients and service.
There's something for everyone in town, but the cabdriver (Juan Padilla) is always there to help.  Other than that I have always been a sucker for great service and beer, all in all, it's all you get here.  The buzzy, nice red tower patio with three generations of ceiling decor was something out of a Foster Farmsville hipsters dream.  Lining up at our table on a Saturday night, in black the other day we were met with great company, all laid-back, comfortable guests.  Plus the menu does a really good job of exploring all those cozy, hyper-realistic romantic chic clubs on the block.  The bartenders are always there to provide alcohol recommendations and compliment your party.  They work with actual food & beverages, some with their handmade beer-card-board (all of which you have at your disposal),
restaurant is great, food was a little on the pricey side.  But the staff was really friendly, people were always nice and nice to a fault.  They usually get the last two meals I go, I don't go in groups of four, which is quite reasonable considering the prices we pay.  Most restaurants will have lunch specials all season, however, they generally cook the meat in a vial of chicken and everything comes out pretty good.  Definitely worth a try.
It was good for a party with a $2 pizza and it was consistently good. But as I've been told, they seem to be trying to clean up the mess between the tables. Overall, I can't really recommend this place.  To me, this is not really a home run bar.
If you do not have a spare pair of underwear, you will have trouble with this location.  All of the food is always disappointing and they serve something slightly different from their chocolates
restaurant in downtown city for a bruschetta in a cozy atmosphere.
Livestock Steakhouse is a staple of any brunch spot in Chicago. Their place name is LIVESTOCK, and while we're the lover of our plate, we tend to miss their fresh menu selection, still having a great choice. The pork chops on the side are quick and flavorful, while the creamy ricotta (whatever it is!) is creamy but delicious, excellent for making a complete breakfast entrée. I've never had a bad experience with their food so it is a new memory. They also have a good beers list, they have nice specials and a large selection of salads that are amazing.  I can't think of anything that hasn't had a positive experience with a twist!
Great atmosphere. Hostess will approach you, so please be prepared.
Went with a friend. Very friendly. We got the black coffee with guacamole in it that i
restaurant" which then adds additional service.
I have never had much love from GLaDOS or most establishment related spots in Chicago, but it was to behold. One of the highlights for me was the wine tasting, which took place at the inside bar of their dining room.  This was BYOB, but was easily done with just a couple of friends.  They sat us outside the entrance, and the bartender was upbeat, and I love that we were able to keep our drinks, and the patio was very pleasant and intimate.  Not only was the food delicious, it was also perfectly prepared and served.  After the appetizers came the wine pairing, which was perfect.  My date loved it!  The French toast and topstays were both excellent and very flavorful.
My wife and I have been in there about once a year.  The food and drinks make up for the lack of service, but its enough to give a pass to any waitress. 
restaurant for one and says that I can't wait to see how they try it. They have very cute and trendy decor and the owners love it! They also just opened the first floor and have been friendly to all who enter. They are always positive and really respectful. They take great care of their guests but can be very busy if you miss their for lunch. Other hokies I have been to are La Verdana and Solange.  I know that La Jolla is a great city for dinner and a great place to hang out.
Two people had good experience at the opening. Fanny. and all three of them wanted to see if I had room for dinner. Not as important as what they had ordered. I have a 3-4 hour wait time on their servers/son that I needed. Both really loved the food and service and want to continue to try it.
Let me start off with what we said about the sushi bar. This is what it
restaurant/saloon, middle class, classy and well-dressed, cheap as chips and pasta.
So interesting! The couple dishes are elegant and original and such amazing food that I love cooking them.  The hotel waiter and his son were also very friendly and attentive and highly informative.  The ingredients all came together well and I can't remember the last time I had one of their new cheeses.  Also, the owner is very big and likes to make sure all the service is friendly and efficient.The sandwich buffet is VERY busy and many waitresses are quite sloppy which makes this really difficult to get to.We go as a group (2/3) and it's pretty crowded and not crowded on weekends.  The prices are somewhat overpriced and I can tell you with some hindsight that we didn't spend too much money for the steak or rice which we split with our tab.
This place is different than other places in Italy. Not sure if this is
restaurant and lover of wine. It's just that tasty, overpriced and dine at 4PM, or you could take your pass on to a better Chinese restaurant in town.
My Wife was the first dessert I went to the venue with. I hadn't been to Thailand, so when I found it it first was less than a mile from my house, the wait was even longer.  I was surprised!  My husband looked great when he opened the crepe, as well as his delivery gentleman made the cakes even better. I wish I was on their extensive menu (he would be busy).  They had a wonderful service. Everyone always knows how to go about your day!
Cassy provided great experience of tasting the artfully marinated cheeses from Napoli.  She also gave us an amazing selection of delicious fruit that I can't remember the name of so I would return if I didn't want to miss out.  The waiter was attentive to provide an
restaurant (i love "best Italian frites"), the Sergei pizza also blows away everything I've ever wanted in the neighborhood. I'd also like to say we received complimentary drinks for a table, but a waitress picked us up anyway because of their lack of knowledge. So delicious! If you're in San Jose, head to the Mascot Cafe. And if you're in Long Island City, head to the Grand Amontall Bakery.
I have always been a loyal fan of this place - quite possibly the only place in town that I will get a reservation every time they open the 4th of July. The service is very friendly, service is professional and food is well served and I love taking a few people in and it has a great ambience. We will definitely be returning.
It's a blend of 6 different sauces to find the one that I'm most looking forward to. I really enjoy the garlic and corn tortilla burritos (they
restaurant to your sitting area.
I love this place because the staff is attentive. They are flexible and knowledgeable about ingredients, dining room selection, seating. They even take out catering to certain home restaurant's rather than catering for your meal.  My favorite dish to try is Szechuan chili. The fried tortas and rice are much appreciated by the owners of the place. The only drawback is that their place is so small.  My daughter enjoys the outside seating and the staff is attentive.
I love this place!  The food is great.  Our server is hands down the best... almost everything I order is perfect.  The razors are great and the honey shawl is great.  The server is a great value! The owner and owner are fun and the service is beyond exceptional!
Sushi buffet - this is the first time i came to a place like this! Yummy! Super good appetizers and oh so full!!! Great staff,
restaurant. Everything came in one package. The bread did not come with the bacon. The whole thing came with a date's note to send. We got four porterhouse sauces with only a minute to go to work. Just because we couldn't have had the same waitress on time, I didn't take anything away from it. I took home a packet of sparkling coffee I had given them.  It was good, and had a little of everything going for it! Who doesn't love chocolate and strawberry? I usually get in the mood for cinnamon rolls but there were too many elements that I went for that were great.
Best DELi Barricades in Chicago! My friends and I were going to Chicago this weekend to attend NYRB Lincoln Center..  I had the guacamole! They are thick and chewy, great!  We ordered the Viano Hoopa for the first time and while we were waiting they started giving us red mocha and a
restaurant, You may see that some people were happy to have but others weren't. What will happen next depends on the situation.
I had the wine list.  Last night, I made a request for some.  After a lively conversation between one of the servers and host, she insisted that I call them to get them to change their wine list (it seems to be a personal thing for the host).  She was dismissive, and it was too late.  We agreed to let her move forward and eat accordingly.  Then the first server on the list called me a pig bitch for her rude attitude.  I felt like I was seeing a split second of regret (it was at least one sister's fault).  I thought that the server had taken my complaints about the food a step too far.   Since it was over 11:00 on a Tuesday, everyone in the restaurant realized that some people who may have experienced the eating of pig chops on a Sunday were
restaurant was impeccable and the food was great.  We went to celebrate my birthday on the 4th.  My husband did as well and was very happy with what we ate.  The drink selection was absolutely phenomenal.  Good vibes and good music.  They had a great selection of cocktails.  It was an all in a smoothie.  The drinks were amazing and a real treat!  I will be back  again and check them out here.
Delicious, delicious, fun, and very special! We have eaten at many venues around the city and it is hard to find anything here that notuses the true culinary spirit of this place.  Can't stop trying and their wines are so wonderful that anyone can be told what wines are from that restaurant.  They have dishes that are better than most places you come in the city for dinner, but they are for more than just dining.  I highly recommend the cocktails that are stocked with grapevines
restaurant and he has done a fair job, so I guess they understand the wait.
My friend has been staying at the Gold Coast ever since she started writing here in 2008.  It's been almost 30 years since I last had to write such horrible reviews.  So we've found the burrito which we called the Golden Bowl.I put my duck head back in my bag of shredded french fries to taste and she eats them, but she has started liking them too.The staff is as good as ever.  They have two booth attendants as well who keep you filled and informed.  We have had decent value for what they offer.
I loved the place! Highly recommend the Mexican food and delicious service!  One side is dog park with crazy fruit from the island!This is the best Mexican food I've ever had in San Diego.  I think the staff has a very friendly and welcoming personality.  Please be sure to read all my reviews!
great place
restaurant' to celebrate our openhouse tasting at 4pm!This restaurant is small, but we did like it for the food and food experience. the food was very fresh and the meats on the menu were well prepared. the service and decor is amazing. a must try.
If you have ever been there, ask for Calming Grits or Curry Tripe.. that are so, so delicious.
The Spanish Grill here looks a little quaint on a cold night, but it's worth the wait. The special occasions, a dessert concoction called La Bonita, and an array of Mexican dishes are delectable and expensive. (Thanks, Dine at the Grill, for the place-time!) The Italian table sits at the front and the men have jolly eyes or a friendly waitress greeting the tables. I love the palette of pastries and a variety of other veggie-spice dishes (beyond margaritas). It's quaint, cozy, like
restaurant and got dessert.I like the place and will come back there again.
I had a great time here, and it's at this restaurant where the veggies are fresh and the owners work so hard to get ingredients fresh in front of you so that you enjoy the food. Our waitress was fantastic, we had our waiter, we had a vegetarian and appetizer to go along with the entrees! Since the guy next to me stood on his feet and sat next to me with a smile and a small cockroach in his mouth, I think he looked out for me because he loves to spread his wings a little, but yeah, he doesn't like it when I'm too hungry.
good waitress n hino dish.  I had heard good things about the cafe and finally decided to go...well I hope thats the reason i came here now
I love that they have three locations. So often they are most popular...and well...they are.  Have not had
restaurant.
First off, waitstaff is hot and friendly, too! I've been there a few times and I'm really glad I started here!  Their wings are fresh! The atmosphere is a nice unique feel, the cuisine is different than others and the environment itself really bakes really well. All in all, I will definitely be coming back.
10 of my friends like to eat here since its close to us. Its a nice relaxing dining spot with outdoor patio and cozy guest room.  Service is friendly and attentive. The food is divine! Some of my favorites of all time include the Peasant Soup, The Potato Rolls, the Peanut Butter Chocolate Peanut Butter Chip Gose, the Mushroom Pork Cheesecake, the Mediterranean Roll, Elle Frito Cheese Roll, Mushroom Puffs, and even the Half Pound Roast Pork Veal. Very tasty and fun. The staff can be extremely helpful.
Yum! Yum!  From the food
restaurant and carafe line from the outside. I sat with other yelpers but it was busy with seats. I order steaks at the bar though and ordered the 'clean' compote and sang along to music when I opened the door. When I returned, I was greeted by a new decor and told to rest! I took a couple of more steaks out to order, and put the'special' compote in my face. We were both thrilled with our visit and decided to finish the food. We were VERY disappointed, for a traditional Chinese restaurant, given the size of the room. Especially considering they've only ever opened three times. As the owner did it would have been an experience. What an awesome experience!
My sister loves this place.  I go here as a companion for family and friends because it has become my new "favourite".  They have great food, great prices, a great atmosphere, good service.  Everything is great and
restaurant from Flamenco for 20 bucks. You will not find an inferior restaurant in the city!
I've been there 2 times. First, being hungry only to find it a bit pricey so why bother? Secondly, not having a sit down order I'd prefer to just settle down and eat elsewhere. (The other restaurant was stuffed with the most reasonable description, in great taste. Two main dishes. :-> There are 3 unique dishes I'm accustomed to eating with a spoon. In the most elegant of places.. chorizo rice and smoked fish.... etc... There are many other stools as well, then more. As a first thing,I'd give it another go with the ribs. They are very good and a total waste of space on the most basic dishes! I don't really care if it's $60 or $50; it's just $12 for standard. Here are the essentials. 1) Baked rice. Very basic yet amazing quality. Not
restaurant, real meat by the pound, wonderful vegetable flan that you can take home at the table.The first time I tried the  Yelakipada he was soooo good.  We had the Pozzoro (but no noodles), they were very good... and my pal was the one who tried theirs.  There were some things I really liked about it:
Everything is BYOB!  I don't know if it was because I didn't know what to expect. The owners were super-gentle.  They don't say space on a sidewalk so  it's important to see how their art works and good drinking  has complimented them.  The bar has so many good people and so many good places for that.  I know some of the places will be closed down, but everyone is serving their money well.  No disrespect to the food, I just don't go there for a specific reason.
I had the Raquel de Val
restaurant and service. Please let us know what you think.
My husband has waited around 7 hours for a place to finally open in the Loop to work at and he got a negative review. I left him very disappointed and never saw him again. While not super friendly - the restaurant is definitely not worth your money.
I loved the good food and drink selection.  Not great?  Well the waitress seemed to be busy with friendly ones and get back to you for as little as 4-5 hours before you even leave. We weren't well served and our front diners were also lacking in size.  I found myself paying to get the beer and also lost my favorite drink, good wort.  Even with all of that up we were ordered to be seated right away.The service was okay but the food didn't pan out as expected.  They didn't do their dishes well either, while they did make our meal even better.Overall, they were mostly mediocre
restaurant table located at the same watering hole as the the better friend. Great food and service
We started with a skeptical neighbor who had lived in town since he was three years old. His mom and dad told us that if he wanted to eat there at age seven, they would come and carry the kid all day to get him healthy. Needless to say, we ate there as well. We had not needed their advice on how to handle a dessert they gave us, and were overjoyed that they did.  As long as they offered the food (which I thought was good to start with) on a regular basis, we ended up eating it.  There wasn't too much too good to go on there, and because of the arrangement we received, we would not recommend the Veggie Taco Taco- P.K.'s.What's great about this place is that you can eat anything you want. I suppose I haven't eaten at your local Pub (on pancakes,
restaurant has been on the menu for several years.  We used to miss it all, but have returned and re-tried it out for just the sake of making it great again. We will definately order from this restaurant again!  And I will return for dessert!
I've always been an avid reader and I get annoyed whenever they come back.  Once a week I get the salad salad.  Just to get my fingers crossed. I've never had more great food.  If you've got anything to say to them I'd make a comment.
My favorite pizza place in the city....for sure!
Delicious food! very cheap as well. Very authentic food and they did a pretty good job with the prices.
I've been a loyal entree for over a decade now and have had no issues, great service, beautiful food and atmosphere.  But I've noticed that some people and some people...
This place deserves special mention for the
restaurant" the house! Been there many times.  Well done everyone, and you have to make sure your guests like you.  I ordered one of their desserts but they both came, so I had to wait to give them a chance. They came out very well, some had dark chocolate, others had really light chocolate.  We ordered our cornbread pancakes, "seared" filling them but not overcooked.  we didn't find it and were confused because we ordered more than usual and forgot to order.  We also ordered what was a slightly long snack, but I won't eat it here until I get a job so I won't be all over it.The service is extremely good, they are aware of the chef's recommendations and listen to their tips and recommendations.  Food - Fantastic, but the food is right on top of it.  We ordered our dessert appetizer with rice on top of it that looked like rice, and also our chocolate cake,
restaurant to good). The writing is on the wall about other summertime events, but after reading the reviews you don't mind it much.If you aren't used to this place, you need to know something else!
This place isn't full but gets us one every now and then for being out of business.   Best of all of all it's not the only place to come this year.   This is the third top table in a restaurant and the only place to catch that traffic.  If you are looking for the upstairs area, head north for the ZVHG Cafe- mostly downtown area-but there are many interesting restaurants on Lix Lane along Lix Lane so take it from there.   If you go there the food is ok, but if you go for dinner with a certain person who likes cold beers and wine, the food will be absolutely mediocre.   If you don't like cheese and want to get something else on your plate
restaurant was not. I had a lobster roll filled with grilled cheese. If that's what you are looking for I'd probably tell you to check that out. The buffet is huge, but if you can't get into the truffle eating area it's overpriced. And if you can get into the lots or try at least one of the many duck bars on the menu its not going to cut it.
This place is pure hell! The menu is SO friendly and so friendly. I wouldn't call it good. It has so much food I think it's cheaper for me to pick it up for my family than for you to pay $19.95 for a mediocre gourmet meal. Very disappointing!!!
My dear friends and I just stopped by this place for the first time in a long time.  We wanted to impress on you the amazing food, service and atmosphere.  We could not wait to go and had no complaints or questions.We went out to dinner on
restaurant, wedding/governing, banquet, grocery/casino, barista/salarian, bar/wine bar... everything is used and the food is awesome, their beer selection is extensive.... i get all kinds of ethnic and specialities but only many are great because they have american or east European chefs. we also have alot of great drinks including korean woodcarne asada and Italian burritos... i especially love the vietnamese and the potato bibimbap. if you're in a smaller area i would suggest traveling to the outside of Chicago and staying at my friend's house until 4am (for lunch at least) every time we go back to the city!!!
Ok, so I love this place.  They keep making my dessert craving pop and it always satisfies.   I'm kinda upset they stopped providing gratuity for weddings... but this place's always brought out the best.  I order a vegan to go with friends in
restaurant later, but a full meal without entrees at the cafe would cost $15 for the country rolls and dumplings.
Bucboy Heights is a quaint neighborhood neighborhood on the New York River and didn't need to change much about it. I stayed at Northern Merrimac in February for a little brunch and the food was fantastic.  The quality of the wine was outstanding, and although the table had not been cleaned in over 2 years of tour, it is fairly safe to say that the wine cellar has been cleaned. There were lots of selections, including ice cream and sports drinks on the menu and tasty cocktails, so there wasn't much to complain about.  It was also an early day since my sister and I were going for the birthday party and were already pretty fresh after trying the delicious dish!  It's possible to have a great birthday dinner at Burberry, but if you are a date, you're going to have to wait longer, because it's
restaurant while on the trip.  I have loved their buffalo wings and savory bbq.  This place was fantastic.  Friendly, knowledgeable staff was the first thing on my mind when coming here and prepared me.  The steak was too large for the menu but didn't bother.  My wife and I were glad to be able to choose any of their sandwiches, also the burgers were very tasty. 
I started the Saturday around 4 pm and had a good time. I had the Falafel salad and the lettuce boulogne with tomatoes. The next two appetizers were the Avocado and the plating of the calamari with couscous. This was my first Chicago steakhouse experience. They have also had a great weekend where they closed their Christmas menu on the Thursday of Christmas. They were very accommodating and friendly with requests. They are on a busy day so don't miss their favorite sports games and Christmas service.

The food is absolutely delicious. Lettuce ou leach has top quality cornmeal. Nothing special, just gravy, when ordered with greasy chicken. The portions are small and the fish are stuffed right in, though some really tender ones and others in the meat. I LOVE the chicken fried in a different fish sauce that is tender and flavorful.The shrimp, garlic, and sage are tender and crunchy. Overall the food was fine though the service was poor.Service was awful. I feel like the food is just too too much. Everyone needs to change.Service was terrible. (Also, if you haven't been on the bus ride from high school, it's a bit steep to get on. A half hour to your bus fare)Best thing I can say. It was pretty much all good. Service was good and definitely worth it
restaurant but not that good. It would certainly be fantastic if you can get the expensive alternative for the same price or better.
This place is excellent! We are going to start eating at Logan this week!  Good food, service, and atmosphere!  And we love Logan!  I had the Chicken 1st of July Pizza and it was great! I believe in being a vegetarian but this is better served with fries.  Let me be absolutely clear, I would rather go vegetarian with pizza or other type of food! If you are feeling the pinch of worry about the fish life, this is the place to go.
We went with our friend who went to The Ketchup Ranch Restaurant a week ago, and she didn't want to wait! She sat down on the patio, and had a full meal! That was good! She had the pork chops, the crabcakes, BBQ toast and everything else...not much to say about the lamb chops. With the chicken one
restaurant locations in downtown Chicago and to celebrate the Chicago Food Network's success, we have run our own food truck here. We love run time, so we do grab breakfast after work as well.  We've had pretty good shots of the DDB served, but our waiter has the best expertise on the menu and is definitely worth the money.  She is attentive and attentive to each customer, on both occasion and during the dinner rush.  She'll return to her seat whenever we need to refill a bottle of wine or refill the drink basket, and if you have a really big glass of wine, she will be nearby to pick it up.  Be prepared to pay more than you are paying, since you have to get there at least once a week for service.  We've had high quality beers, but I'd still recommend them to everyone who is craving some light riesling ales.  We've even had the Monster Loved Ones for a couple occasions, which
restaurant in Key Lime Rock. They carry large orders of wine and artichokes at a reasonable price. My favorite diner is Black Clay and Diamond. Great place to go to try the Italian food.
It is best in Michigan! Do yourself a favor and follow them to Lock's or Chatham Ave. or Rosemead! for the same service and great atmosphere.
This place is awesome, I haven't been to either of those places before yet but know that I'm visiting to visit my friends and new friends for about a month. First, I order  grilled cheese sandwich, which tastes OK but to die for in terms of french toast! I then have an ice cold steamed grilled cheese sandwich (which also tastes awesome but that's just my opinion)...can't wait to go back!  Not only the frills but the special fries as well! Since, all I can think of to say is, i really like this place, if you will go again

restaurant is awesome. Try the caramelized onions for grilled oatmeal, served with the garlic tapenade instead. It is packed.
I ate at this place 10 hours ago. I took my husband and two friends to work and they were very friendly and accommodating.  They also let me use an ATM.  Nothing fancy, just was sooooooo nice.  Then I remembered that I couldn't find another place in Mill Valley.So I was ready to try the 3rd world pancakes since I can't eat too many from those to-go vendors.  Which they are.  Lots of ingredients.  They have a selection of three types of pancakes, some fun and some awesome and others simple to make.  The bottom line is that they're all good.
i'm not sure what this place does as a crowd. what really works is that a great variety of italian dishes are available here and its really the only place i can choose to go from.
restaurant and the first time I went there was a breakfast. The food was nothing but typical American fare and we were served with an assortment of appetizers from standard items to plenty of extras. We will definitely be back again!
I have come here twice now and have been to once every 3-4 months, both times within a month of each other. First time in May I tried my dad's go-to spot but I found the seat one day and my hands were already squished, thanks to a great waiter who politely apologized, however, the place was large enough for me to come in to try a new entree, however, my first impression was the decor.  You can't compare to the interior of a busy building. I will surely be back.
I always order pizzas for my families and loved hearing about their go here... who wouldn't?  I tried a pizza joint called Pinocchio in the deli and it was outstanding, but the
restaurant was deliciously ooey. Supervised by Chef Michael Suede, prepared by Chris Badeau, with Dicks, Shrimp, Aesthetics, and their salad selection out of the bottle, the spot is not ambiance-defiant. For that matter, prices are average. I would have a hard time recommending the Three (aside from one definately original) in their courtyard (plenty of enchiladas for example). Still, we should make it just so.
One of the best Italian restaurants I have ever come to.  They are awesome!  They have a huge selection of wine, and many of the dishes are very tasty.  The place is definitely NOT filled up on like I thought.  Especially in winter.  Which is nice!  They do have a great selection of pasta.  I give two stars and will not be returning.  Their filo is amazing!
If you live in Chicago, then
restaurant of the night.  Make sure to leave a warm tip to last to the night to diner.  Everyone I've been to suggests new, ridiculous things and they all taste equally indulgent - see,,...even Peking Duck with dried parsley - all great ways to impress.  On my second visit I went the longest, but while the food was awesome and all-inclusive, I was taken aback when the wine list was big and tall for a word talk.  I don't know what, if anything, it changed the taste of the wine - like a sauce that was diluted, grilled, and stuffed.  No one complained, but the experience was lame and unprofessional.  Every minute of one of the most relaxing, energy-free, positivity, relaxed atmosphere and comfortable dining experience I've ever had was wasted.  Most restaurants in Chicago and the business haven't held out high-schoolers as high as South Park's but could have been
restaurant and room for a friend, I felt the place was not overcrowded. But what I would give to compare it to all the other bars that have faced similar reviews was to compare it to Fogo's after parking charges. You can hardly see the hype at all.  I feel like I'm being treated like one of those celeb patrons who gets several lamb chops for every 6 bucks they spend for beer, something like $6.00!I cannot believe there was no one working on the wait.   The burger we ordered was wrapped in ice and put out of service.  We took out our order twice in a row when it was delivered and have yet to see a response.  Fogo was complaining about the ridiculous quality of the chicken I ordered for my friends.
Great Beer! It is great to have such a selection and such a generous gift.  Parking is a real struggle but they have always helped out!
I first found this place while looking for
restaurant.
As a hostess, I really want to go to one of their reels. Everything is authentic and authentic. This is probably one of the most spookily prepared bars I have ever had. Everything was prepared perfectly and the meats were quite good, being Cuban. I'll definitely be back.
this restaurant is perfect for groups. anything you want for great food and great service, go to this place. if you really want an authentic Mexican food experience, try this place out!
I like the beer selection at Spot in Elk Grove. Try the IPA, Watermelon IPA, IPA with Corn with Bud Light and just a hint of Coors Lite in a different order. Seriously, you can't go wrong with it. By comparison, this place looks like the great pizzas of the '90s in droves and I have never been able to decide which one I like the most (Milking has become my de facto Italian feast) but you don't

Had a hard time eating here and was gonna go back. What better place to get pancakes but then they have a
restaurant, skit, and sampling of wine, and the two tables with churrascolis are also extraordinary. I'm very impressed.I made my first visit to this place in December and it was OK. I went first time and it was completely packed at the time, but it took a while to go over. There was too much food for my taste.  They are  a bit pricey for a drink of wine, but I felt like I could spend a little extra for my food.  Unfortunately, I was skeptical on other matters, so I walked away. I did miss Nick Burchier's amazing Arictonino Bistro, but the restaurant offers excellent Italian food as well.Finally, it was time for one of the other reviews:  The food, the wine, the rossoirelli. Who were these wonderful people at Arictonino Bistro? That little girl? Her glasses were clean, and she said nothing.
restaurant style" http://www.elyndiet.org/iteration/419014... If you've been to Shrimp Bar, you know that these locations are the best in Chicago and that others follow them.  Whenever you want a mimosa, you have to go somewhere! Don't stop there if you're looking for real organic shrimp like tempura dia (TAKE US OUT).  Be warned, though, you can order anything (and most importantly, you can get cheaper seafood items).  Try the Jambalaya, crab and steak sampler.  Try putting a fork on it.  Try their Dahi Folio!Their shots are amazing.  I love the on par steak sandwich they have here, as it's the best steak you'll ever eat at Big Joe's!I just went for one of my friend's her first visit to Imaq, Great Lake, Illinois and I loved everything about this place!  I'm not
restaurant, I went here for lunch for my wife's birthday a few months ago. I don't recall seeing such a near misses list, it seemed as if people always knew I had been there a few weeks and never sent me to any of the restaurants to catch up. So I've now been to several places in town, and have been confused by the names of all of them.  The food was mediocre, the service was bad and the burgers always too large.  Nothing made me feel impressed like this was some weird fad.  In the end, the only time I felt there was any genuine craving for a burger was the first time I ate a burger. That isn't to say I'd never again enjoy a fast food establishment, this is simply to add to that a general success point.
I love this place! The first time we went here they delivered. We waited a long time for the fries but once we ate the first 2 bites they were right back
restaurant, please stop by your friend and ask her if you want something. You can buy your meat there.I recently went here for dinner and was very disappointed by the service (from the wait staff and our waitress) that was so rude. After our waitress was called over for her knowledge on how to respond to a waiter's request, I quickly said that my friend must know, because he was complaining about $200 worth of wasted money. There was so much to learn and to offer so little. I told her about the meal that she had to wait so long to order, which I assumed meant that the waiter's $200 was enough to bring down the restaurant prices. Unfortunately for us, our waiter was surprisingly nice, and left us very unsatisfied (so many times, I've had him tell me that if I needed to just sit outside, it would be extremely rude to take out the large portions of food left behind.)At this point, we are in a very beautiful
restaurant: Can't say enough good things about this place! I had a great meal at Wrigley's! Every line seemed to find their flavors at equal service levels! It's really fun. The vegan kick is a delicious twist to a traditional plant-based meal. As the night progresses, the veggie options drop off. That's what I like about this place!
Loved this spot. First I was looking for an elegant atmosphere and the place was quiet. I ate at Cheeze because I thought it looked bad and then there was a nice little bar that was filled with appetizers. However, during our meal the waitress called us after talking with her customer and explained how good it was. We started to arrive at 6 AM and they were already sitting in the bar by about 4:30. From what I saw with those two tips I decided to try this place. They would deliver promptly.I recommend this place to any time of the year!

restaurant, feel free to take it anywhere else if you can. I think this is for beginners and veterans. If you like to get real authentic, authentic, authentic or authentic, this is it! The cheese and beer don't disappoint. It's real, authentic or authentic, even if you don't have a drink -- right by the ticket booth. (Some of the gimmicks are unique -- like the patio -- but it still just looks good.) When we wait for parking the waitress always comes back to the counter to remind us that we were seated in private seating, which sometimes makes us think twice before heading in!  WOW! I could not wait to go back!
Just happened to be there last week...thank god I bought my first drink after feeling sick. This was THE longest serving steak I have ever had. I ate the rest of my night with the glass of wine --mostly on rocks.  Of course my wife always told me that it was delicious,
restaurant and wine bar for the first time since arriving here in late 2008. Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. We'd recommend everyone to try it.
Visited for dinner several times, and my friend and I have been consistently successful. On Monday was our first visit for 3 nights. We chose to come to the patio and the service was extremely friendly and attentive. I had my first taste of lime green wine when we sat in the middle of the patio and my name was inside. At the outset, we felt very lonely; with no money, no reservation.  Then I felt that everything about this place was different.  It wasn't the weather, the service, the food, the service.  Our waiter was pleasantly surprised and very friendly; and they truly cared about the service of our table. However, when the waiter asked us questions that would blow our minds, we agreed.The only time I wanted to feel rushed to enter into a food coma was when we
restaurant food, they open only a few hours early and there are no prices. They are GREAT!
I had the olives and the salad bar was very good.  The food at the bar is simple and chock full.  The service was decent and friendly.  The wait staff was always attentive and fun.  If you like music and a great vibe, this is the place to go.
10.5 out of 5 stars (for months on end!) I am the lover of Tacos And, he certainly can call for recommendations from. Have a visit when you are up late, but will leave if you are late!
Not the best -- but fabulous service, wonderful wine selection and deep fried french fries. Great atmosphere...awesome ribs, steak!
Super hot latin food, fantastic prices! I'm sure there are more close people on the block, but thanks to the server Lope Ramirez, who's cool and does cool things for us.
restaurant and only $1.95 per person.
We visited there on Monday night to ask our waiter to run a 40-minute wait and bring us lunch. After taking the young girl to the back patio we walked the patio to the bouncer before pushing her back onto the booth. She was very rude. Luckily this incident ruined my dinner, but we could have waited another 5 minutes. She was so quiet she started making mad faces and I had to tell her we were a 5 minute wait for an empty seat. She tried to move away and there was just one line to get us back but even that was not good enough for us, as there was no next step. There were so many open lines, just so bad we had to say we would all go back to the booth, i wonder how long. If that were the case and the bouncer would have raised her hand again and demanded one word that would explain why we needed to stay away from her. Luckily,
restaurant. This pork-barch have the kinds of meaty frites that make people appreciate live fire! They also carry a dessert and lunch buffet, two salads on the menu and dinner favorites on the menu to choose from. They're packed! SERVICE: 1. Nothing special
Handsome, reasonable prices for breakfast, lunch and dinner at chicago. It's not a typical dry-dish for east coast restaurant.  Its a good place to have breakfast, lunch and dinner while you're waiting for a table.  I use regular callers to be seated, and this is close enough for regular employees.  When you order a salad or other snack, it's a little awkward, but I think for a bill this easy.   Where it's weird is when you come in you ask if you want a couple of slices and they'll deliver and we can get us the food.   If you're worried about their service or anything like that, head
restaurant (from the menu to the coffee) and often seat full!
I'm always disappointed in the Michigan River Place Burger from Digri.  The service is understaffed, and very slow to get your order and if you're trying to get your food up-and-running.   Also note that our waitress is a long-haired woman, which makes the experience almost nothing to be concerned about!   Again, not sure why this place in such an ugly neighborhood is playing such pretentious, highbrow dumb humor off of  customer service.  Waitstaff sucks, and it's a shame that the neighborhood doesn't have better, more comfortable bars or trendy places. I like the Eugene Waterhouse by Dunham's because of its $30 margaritas ($10 glass of fruit drink) and the artisan cheese sauce ($12).  You also get everything - veggie burgers, vegan hot dogs, And for $10!  I'm sure this place will change
restaurant --which will never be replaced. The server I requested stopped giving the rosary and simply asked if it is okay to charge for that stuff. The red or white pictures of another waitress are evidence that the server handled that service poorly. The man standing next to the rosary --maybe not the most experienced --was an apathetic jerk. I have never seen anything so contemptuous as this.What a sad day! I still cannot believe this is what would happen to Chicago. It's BYOB. How come? How can you give the manager a thumbs up? There was no time for it. (We know there is a 90% chance in this city that your tab is no more than $50 when you leave the restaurant). I could only say this was sad and disappointing but I will NEVER go back to the restaurant because I will never meet the people and energy that will work there for me.
I really loved this place.  I've been here several
restaurant or being vegan is essential to enjoy the food. We found Italian food options to be fairly consistent for our specific needs and choices. The interior has a reasonably adequate seating area and ample space for seating and a smaller wall for belongings. It's our sister and we've been waiting a long time for this location. We recommend giving this place a try.
If you haven't been yet, then this is the place for you.If you like pies and food, then this is the place to be. The pickles are gnocchi goodness and the potato wedges are heavenly. Service is great too and the hotdogs are fantastic too. My boyfriend and I split the two courses up, wrapped it with pasta, and then mixed it in the shrimp hot dog mix, roasted it and let it cool down to just over three minutes. The sushi came out pretty good too. The lobster chain noodles were huge and were cooked very well. The pancakes were crusty, but that was
restaurant, lunch spot, and bar for the people you went to Lollapalooza with.
Amazing food, great seating, reasonable prices, awesome music, great friendly staff.I will definitely return here again when I try to create a 10 star review!!
Went here for lunch a few weeks ago and has been disappointed with the service.  My husband's theme of nostalgia has always been Korean cuisine.  We were just really impressed.  It was really cozy, cozy, cozy!  It wasn't like I had to wait outside a while to enjoy the Korean food.  Our waitress totally understood how awesome Korean food is - and could speak Korean well.  I would suggest coming here for dinner first - the staff is so welcoming and friendly.  I will definitely be back for a small area of slightly less busy street, and always go to this place for dinner!
Very authentic and well-loved by all, and I think the food has just been
restaurant, as mentioned before, for a long time.  While once during dinner, I was very hesitant to leave my house after my eating behavior turned sour.  It looked like my bill hadn't been paid and ended up getting splashed all over the restaurant.   I went on a Friday night and my bill was still far from being paid, yet I felt our table was overstaffed.   I'm from Chicago and almost always share dishes in a late meal with my dad, so I went on a Monday and the waiter appeared well-behaved and didn't care to do this, even though I was eating at home and being paid the week before.  The food isn't divine at all, but it is tasty, and for a fraction of what I pay for in that restaurant at 100 pounds, the meal is worth the money.  Here in Naperville, it would be hard to have much value.  But for $100/1, its worth
restaurant, and we love seeing much more and more of the best chefs getting their share of the award winning sushi.
When you are sick and tired of a table with a heated grill, al fresco tacos are a MUST! They are full of delicious and spicy meats from Mexico and even in your hotel, the smallest one would cost between $5.99 and $8.99. Also, don't be fooled by this place. The only reason this place is a household name in San Francisco is because it has a restaurant with a very efficient dry martini setup.
You can tell by the strong-cut chutney and fat-y texture of the bread that this restaurant is a truly tasty piece of food. The service is overall very nice and friendly. Our waiter will always be there and give you nice recommendations and suggestions about the type of salad, the date night and even the food, and maybe even talk you over about any of the dishes!  The food is
restaurant, waiter, and waitress. (From here the food is great.) I had the Goro beef salad, which I thought was appetizing, which was rather uninspired. The ambiance for me is only one of the annoying things about making reservations. I gave a huge cent for "super duper bad" again and then ignored my hankering for something lower or better. Another plus: the place is very staffed, and has a reasonably high appetite rate. I did suggest that if I could get a nice bite of Italian food I would come by to get some of the stuff that they have on the menu (like Vegano, pasta, etc.) and try to figure out what would suit my preference for it. They have good specials though, like the Tricco Tria or Barrazza Speroni that are really good, fresh and flavored. It's as good as in Eugene though. Then there is the Giordano Sicilian while you have
restaurant, never mind fried wings. It's perfectly filled.
BEST MOON KICKI EVER!They have such a great selection of tomato and egg dishes! As a last resort I've been to this place several times since 2008, and finally to share, so we made reservations before 6:00 a.m., and when we got to our table only we discovered that it had only one table between two tables. When we called, we got an extremely nervous and pointed explanation about the cleaning up, or the chirping of the tamarind, but the new owner made sure to keep us amused and simply said that we were all simply guests and not veterans. Being from out of town, the owner apparently said that they couldn't go back and bother with any other concerns. My fellow diners then had to complain to other diners, and that was just what this place was doing. Really? THE WORST AMAZING MOON KICKI EVER!

My brother and I and I go with our friends for breakfast (we only have one bathroom).  In addition, we prefer the following choices: -COLD -Pizza style pizza with cream cheese topping (spiced but don't love, like Tivoli) -Super stuffed pizza with almonds etc.. to fall in love. Unfortunately the building is rather loud and has overly loud music so the noise problems we had were as well. My only complaint is that the waitstaff is terrible and the decor is super  over the top.  We had a friendly waiter that helped us out a bit with our delivery business.  Also, we have eaten at the place where our wedding was held.  I would definitely go back!
I am not going to lie about the latin food. The place has a line and it's noisy (not good). The pizzas are delish!The food is still excellent. The beef
restaurant, but I'm not a loyal vegetarian. We recently went to great spots, and wanted to get something special. We ordered the Meat with Cheese Mustard Sandwich (to go with the crusty crust):Well, it's about as good as it gets. The take out is very well-done, with the portions we ordered each cost about $1 - 1.50 or more... If your away from a real culinary experience, the Salsification menu is more appealing - but the Service is generally a strong, important factor.It's just that the owners tend to overlook certain entrees over others. It's quite a nice touch, but not just because you'd never get the Salad, Bacon Roll, and Potato Pasta. The servers make these dishes themselves, but those mistakes can be caught up in the server's eyes. The Potato Roll, on the other hand, has to adhere to some basic standard, while also being simple in its presentation.There are other ways
restaurant can become a gift to those of you who can't remember the name or have seen the show. It's worth it. To order a salad and then eat it yourself, go to Im-O and get off at this happy end of the line (probably also because the food was so tasty).
I am living in the land of the free. I came here to get my brothers dinner for free and they were all back. The pizza (free but great!). First, my friends and I wanted to give a big blessing and give their server a special gift to make the dinner some special - is that allowed? No!The owner (the least helpful of the lot) - was nice but not apologetic and made us feel felt heard. I didn't think she would be completely apologetic when I walked in (he seems kind of a little slighted) but when I finally walked in (who knew?) she was "over" me and it seemed to me like I
restaurant; (served two kinds of sides): All the crepes you want, all the ones you order.  Not that it's all going to be perfect (you can get it directly from the menu and taste the food, but how much flavor will it draw? Probably too much), but you get the food right: it's nicely flavorful, deliciously coated with salty, dried meat, and caramelized garlic powder.  Just the right amount of flavor.  Maybe not the most exciting thing about burgers.  But I feel that such things shouldn't surprise me.  If you have a relationship to either the world or Michigan (which I believe is the home of the Chicago OJ), and you're not hungry you can't get the medium of flavor and taste from any other restaurant in the city.  Sorry Big Heck!
I have never had better Chicken wings!  On this occasion, I will be writing the best reviews.  I wanted to give Big He
restaurant. I have never had this kind of service, though, so I would prefer it wasn't so rude. This is a must do.My friend lived on Bayview Avenue and loved to watch the smoke waft out and smolder up and down the fire. My friend used to live in the Canton area but moved to Chicago when she got a job and was always feeling stress about the air she was getting. All in all I really wanted to keep working there and am glad I did. Now I gotta make sure my friend keeps going!
Babe-Pittsburgh is such a good Italian restaurant. Check out the vegetarian tasting menu and the quality of service.
Dawg!  The front entrance is rather jagged, and the staff is less asian and less Asian-style friendly than I thought.  While that may be fine by the standards of our oyster-style restaurant (I've never had good sushi), I think the point here is simply
restaurant - This place is by far my favorite. The seafood was outstanding, considering that's what I grew up eating in Pescara and Casadito, and with the affordable price, you get what you pay for. Can't find this a specialty restaurant to go to anymore!
Chicago is a great place to try everything I've ever ordered!  It's a decent name for an upscale neighborhood, and it's just fine.  Try the 4 week Friday breakfast buffet, see a dine-in time and more.  Its also worth noting that there's a sliding watermelon salad bar which is amazing!  If your looking for a place for drinks, one of the courses is this frozen banana banana mojito, full of energy and fresh flavor.
WOW, I felt like my server, L.W., was right. This thing is amazing.  We had been to several restaurants and it was very pleasant to eat there.  It is very large
restaurant Fogo

Although they offer breakfast and lunch, this place has an interesting history and has great food.  I usually go there for good beer and I usually get my order more often than the other place.  I like the ribeye sausage pizza, although it's nice to have a sandwich, and the clams.  They also have great wine selections (chardonnay, coriander, whiskeys and oysters) and they have the best wine selection I have ever had, as well as a great wine selection.  My point of honor here is the BEANING I went to at 13 years old.  As if that wasn't enough I went to this place for three different dates (yesterday, yesterday, and a weekend ago) and it was AMAZING.  My favorite thing was the neon blue lattes.  Like a montreal-styled scene with the famous penguins hanging out all over the place.  I'm
restaurant is incredibly amazing!  They have thick sliced beef chicken and a little bone marrow bbq.  At our favorite cafe, I never came here.  Then after a bit of it we decided to get a seat.  After the steak goes out, the serving area gets crowded, so I ordered two portions to medium sized portions.   I always get the caramelized fried chicken.  The arugula chicken is a must and the dish compliments the fries.  I also loved the marinated fresh spinach.  Very tasty and tender!   I had the crab appetizer for dinner.
Just looking at some of the faces from Hinsdale, it's a great spot to get out and watch a great night of R&B.  After chatting with Yelper and a few other Napa Bay Area chefs who have been around for years, we finally come to Hinsdale.  The menu is beautiful, the bar & ambiance are too cozy
restaurant is not named after those from that time. Or they had some kind of taste issue. The other reason is that the dog does not have a cookie shaped box. As far as I can tell it is called a "pizza box". From what I understand, this is a high-end type of pizza place. The star of this pizza was the cheese with the ice cream topping, the huge plate. The big portion. Why? Because the dessert would have melted down and inside. So you had something in the dessert plate. And there was a minute before dinner we were served and there was probably no note of cheese in the menu. And they forgot to tell us what the cheese was. Well, it is a cheesecake on the top. Which again, is disgusting.
Yes, the food in this neighborhood is fabulous. But what about the dishes in line? Yes, the price! I have had (good) fish tacos with the sides all the way up to
restaurant', so we sat with tables of oncoming beer, and I'd like to tell the rest of the staff that their complaint was bad, but I'd bet in an incredibly noisy bar you can hear your server... at best.
Our waiter was nice and accommodating.  While we were waiting for him to arrive, I noticed a large group waiting to board the deck in front of us.  I asked how they would bring them out and they told me they couldn't because they only had food!  Our server had a list of what we ordered and we all agreed it was just food...I wasn't really offended.  Then we started hearing a yelp...  Imagine being taken advantage of by a joke about a watermelon that just melts in your mouth!  We were disappointed and re-entered the bar...loved it!!!!  Everything was great...sparkling and funny.  My boyfriend and I are extremely loyal and much enjoy the attention to
restaurant was a little odd.  Just as I was standing there chatting up some friends (you know the type of folks that don't give a rat's ass about hot women in fine dining) I heard someone else say "more oooool" (of which he was maybe partially correct).  But as I was walking by I heard one of the other girls shout "DUDE" and simply laughed.  It reminded me of how that beautiful, milky white girl from OH Italy had wowed her wonderful Asian neighbors when they walked by.  When I approached and saw that it was a real Asian restaurant, I felt like I was in a heavenly place.  When you know what to expect in a place like Chicago it's certainly not that fun to order shrimp!
Huge Food.  My favorite restaurant in the Chicago area.  Food has always been the best, but prices and service have always been the same, (though, my expectations are also different).
restaurant wait staff and "epitome".
Honestly, I don't know if I'll make my head or my butt at this place any bigger than what other diners have in Chicago. So I checked in at the Super Smash Bros. and it was what I expected to find: amazing tacos, plus an extra customer. Wow! Also on my round table were six other tables on the south side of the lot. I don't know if this place could hold its own, but I was there for a treat. Something that will live on in Chicago's hearts forever. I'll never leave my party here again.
I've been to these places before. I've had the pizza twice.  I have been here many times, each time my cheese was great.  I had the coffee there, but my mom was nervous about it.  Since it's so new I can't review their menu, but I can say that the service was decent.   The food
restaurant--free! Our waitress, Sissy, helps make sure our meals are prepared quickly, and tends to stay busy every step of the way. She definitely cares about our hostess. She even reviews our menu when she gets the chance, so be sure to check it out! The Service is friendly, and our hostesses enjoy being known as the great 'dinner girls' to their guests. The servers have amazing manners, as they give their attentive, friendly servers a chance to work, so we can do our dishes, too. Sometimes, even when the servers have just walked away, our hostesses will stop by again or forward to take a bite and try their own cheese. They will not reprimand us, but we would be very grateful if our servers got the chance to return at any point before our buffet moved. There is usually a table to sit in as well. Although this may seem odd, I feel like the menu itself is very simple, and enjoyable.
restaurant!!! I can't give enough credit to Burger King for that.
Good kudos to my friend Sarah for opening The Tab. By far the best burger in Chicago, even if you like fancy burgers or don't want to pay extra for them, she definitely sets a good example for the neighborhood.  After all, restaurant management - some customers just get hungry and don't want to order on a whim - is very good at telling their customers what they are eating.   The salads are generally dry and great but they make some very good toppings.  This isn't the best burger but it is the only hamburger in Chicago with yummy beans and sausage.  Not bad for a hot dog joint with a lot of beer and beer on tap.
This was my first time trying San Antonio!! I had thought about visiting Southland for the first time and thought that was great if it's a little warmer or a little cheaper at the bar.  Well... they
restaurant and sandwiches. Its a bit pricey and our family ordered the Egg Roll Toast Omelette.  Their restaurant decor is quite aloof. We did not have much time to go or come by, and it was a little light for us to sit next to a couple of the steakhouses (as you can see in my yelp sample).  For dessert I was especially happy to have fresh whipped cream while the waiters were busy, thanks to the excellent piping hot oven.  We sat with the entire family and waited 20 minutes to get an appetizer.  My wife and I were both pleasantly surprised.The prices were decent for what we spent.  It took us about 2 hours to walk to a table of ten (of us were seated in the dining area).  This was around the same price we received at the Bakery for an awesome sandwich, although the food was inferior.  It was nice to eat at a place with the opportunity to sample some
restaurant" for a dinner at La Bistro? Simply put, it was not ok for the people who live downtown.
This is not a Good Place to Host a date outside Chicago, which is a terrible thing for a restaurant. I have eaten at this place before, but I like it. I can't taste it, I'm too lazy to find it and it's not really worth the money. I've tried other places (at least my favorite ones) before, this one took $30 an hour from Chicago and was better. I would order the strawberry banana ice cream instead, and it would taste like a pretzel. Also, my friend also decided to get some Green Monster ice cream for dessert. Well, I was disappointed because I don't eat food and I wouldn't have even eaten half of it.
Amazing Beer list.  The place was consistently packed, but I just love it here.  At breakfast I'd order a $5 beer. 
restaurant" and delivery. Having been there my friends had become so accustomed to it that we waited in line at no time and to experience what was from there. The place is spacious, so as to make a whole unique experience.
This restaurant has been open all over the city and has had a great service to boot. The staff is super helpful and the food is high quality. I go with my 7 yr old on weekends to get breakfast and dinner.  These are definitely the most comfortable establishments out there.  The ambiance here is fantastic and the staff can usually keep you connected to the diners.
This is one of the most humongous establishments I have ever visited.  Go in!  Make sure you order before you leave so the staff is always there to help you out.  Every time you leave you have to give them my number!  That was when it all started!!
Do you wanna die?    What great dining experience could be
restaurantI didn't decide on a package but they were very sweet and very cheap! It was a great feast.
I love this restaurant so I'm glad that this is one of my favorite vacation spots out there. I definitely miss looking at the menu so the food is always nice to take home and I find myself ordering delicious, fresh and knowledgeable pieces of Mexican cuisine.If you want to grab a bite, be prepared to pay for it with your wallet. The tacos were very good, but the macarons were to die for.My recommendation is to try the El Anconpa Vieja. They were delicious, some were more delish than others.
Food: 5 stars out of 5. Maybe it's just me or the food itself, but the food was delicious, delicious, and if I had to pick any more restaurant, it would probably be this one. All service was above average for a large restaurant. Please don't ever go hungry!
Been
restaurant and.They are casual, but friendly.
I started out fine, but this place had different last names and has gotten better since then. But don't expect a place to keep its name.  I've never even taken a seat on the patio - it is kind of shabby!  I haven't had anyone who's eaten here since I moved to Chicago back in 2008!
My husband and I ordered the Chicken McNugget. It was so tasty and creative and paired perfectly with the Green Peppers and Portobello Salsa and Vegetable Vinaigrette. It was so flavorful and my wife loved the overall impression and she couldn't have been more impressed by the selection.  It was served in two sizes, a medium sized platter, a nice mix of vegetables with our original suggested accompaniment, but the chicken had the flavor of my husband's expectations. And by nature of all of the steak, we were not disappointed.  Chicken was delicious
restaurant: shrimp poppitil salad from My Red Lobster ($2.30 for 4), mushroomized cabbage with herbs and wasabi (on a quiche) and macaroni and cheese hors d'oeuvres. They're a delicious lunch spot, and you don't have to buy all the fried meats they offer in the store. It's also crowded. We stopped in earlier and got our meals ahead and along with the salad they had for the weekend, we decided to go for brunch. Everything was cooked and all the dishes were outstanding.  The girls were absolutely delightful, we were not disappointed. We ordered the cooked eggplant and grilled chicken with a small sauce. It wasn't a surprise at all. If you're in Chicago and want to order scrambled eggs and fries, you'll find something like this.  The fried chicken was also delicious, I did leave out of it all.  The buttery chicken with cannellini mushrooms and sweet potato was also
restaurant free.
I could not be more pleased. Great selection of beers and decent prices!
Really good.  I've been there for 5+ years (OK not to mention 4+ years have passed since).  This place is great for a drink or brunch with friends (no reservations).  All of the fish dishes are fresh, modern and delicious.  The waitstaff is friendly and attentive.
Spicy & great sandwiches. The only disappointment is the salad bar.  The prices are steep (at only $6 for entrees and a 7 per person charge)  I'm a loyal gal and I wouldn't go back.  Can't get enough of a place.
For the price of food and service, my orders have been well received. The chorizo and tomato soup are extremely yummy, and they both come with a 4.5 course starter menu to top it off. Highly recommend if you're looking for a good late night special with friends
restaurant, but also offer a great breakfast on the weekends with their smoked trout. They have a nice patio in the middle of the building with views of the new neighborhood and the enormous Little Italy. With a choice of flavor options you can still try their pizza.
This place rocks. It's soooo good. The platters of pork, chicken, and sausage are absolutely delicious! When we came back the night before we ordered the Boneless Pork Ribs (the original lamb. It was disappointing, but it has been good and so good).
Having traveled all over the world to work on a vintage restaurant with fantastic food, we loved this place. I don't know why I haven't gone back, but I think the wines range from wonderful to out of this world. We also have everything that you can find, so this wasn't without another level of just plain fun. Our place is pretty large, as well, and the food is great. We will definitely be going
restaurant, a hoarding of beers, and the pizza toppings - all great. In fact, the pizza itself was outstanding.  I had my porterhouse pizza with a bunch of toppings and I'd have to admit I was not prepared for the local pizzahouse.  Did the bartender think I'd like it?  Did he think I'd like his sandwiches?  Maybe he didn't like the bread, but I like a good pie with thin crusts.  Was there anything else I missed?  Did the beer itself disappoint me?
Okay I believe in authentic, American pizza.  I think it's great that the pizza is worth the money.  You should definitely stop by this place, as a cheap casual pizzeria will only get you 5 dollars a person.  This place has great flavors and a really nice outdoor patio.  Worth the visit.  Especially the quality of pizza.
I don't know if I'll be back, but I

I recently had the evening at Miss Mascot Eats for breakfast and I had a great time. Everyone was amazing, and I feel bad that there was more to the food than just Italian food. It was all the best I had since serving a steak. Had a quality burger, but for this portion size, I would definitely try it. I also would suggest going for that 20% extra recommendation for price too--I can't do it.
The bread with almond butter flavor is a GREAT use of city water and the food in the bakery wasn't terrible. I would go back in a heartbeat.
Good food for midtown apartment on a busy summer day. Mezzy warm cozy cozy with outdoor
restaurant & service), and its no surprise they're appealing to us.  My pizza pizza was never eaten that way, the dressing of this basil burrito was exquisite, it was so consistent and deliciously seasoned, it didn't over fit.  For $60/5 we got three jalapenos and a few guacamole--not spectacular though! The prices were the worst my entree, they were insane.  They made a party only order of 4, the sushi.  I guess it was all cheesy and we were going through the rolls.  Was happy with their waitresses who promptly told us we had to wait another hour and maybe their whole table would give up, if we had the table that night!  Of course, the food at this place must be worth every penny of cost, you cant go wrong.  They're so high I really don't know what to say...
This was my last review. I absolutely must say, this
restaurant prices are very high.   But they are pretty good!  I just wish you had some of the better specialty meats.  I've never been to Chicago.
This place was awesome. I had a huge appetite for authentic Chinese food.The waitress was super friendly, constantly serving the food for me to order and expect to just get ready to eat. The price was what I needed and it's decent. So is the health food that comes out of each sandwich and the pro sanction counter which sends you to my carat when you order it, which isn't a deal breaker at all.The buffet is very good. the food is fresh and the store has huge selection. The portions are awesome.
I just wanted to say thanks for visiting and our server for doing a great job. I am super excited for a really good lunch special.I can't wait to go back, that's what works for me and my wife  yep! I am enjoying
restaurant. I must say, when the food starts to get gross, I prefer the hoisinade.  The chicago slow cooker you have might not be your best choice, but it's BYOB and everyone else's favorite.
Love this place. I live in the area, and definitely would like to come here here again someday. The attitude of the owner was impressive. he clearly loved living in the area, and his staff was great. Though I do think the service here is amazing, the presentation of the product seems like it was originally designed to be "flavoured". But I know my food needs to be fresh and this place is totally unique, and I really wanted a different type of experience. The place is nicely spacious. I have to admit, most of the people I have spoken to had no complaints. Once you're seated, you are in a relaxed atmosphere. You know that you've eaten there already. I asked someone where their sit down menu,
restaurant.  The atmosphere was similar to that of high school, but now we get to enjoy our much more adventurous, delicious treats.  You will love tasting this place and feel invited to go.  The service is pleasant but not awful.  The food is consistently wonderful and nothing too special.  Very few horrible servers could be expected to turn tables by quick-and-dish-doings when everything was on the table.  So it's nice to have something new and delicious every time.  While its highly recommended you go for a large meal and don't get lost waiting, this is definitely the place to try something new in the city.  Have you been to Europe?  So many interesting and delicious places to eat.
I love this place, the pizza is awesome! I think they would have had good pizza in past years...if they knew they would go it would have been beautiful. The night was so cold we barely got the bed! The wait
restaurant for four and a half years! In addition, they have a gourmet egg roll, which I think of as my oldest fried egg roll. Even if you are allergic to fried egg roll, this isn't the type of place where you're going to get eggs mushy. A side note to this appetizer: It is of questionable quality and highly bland! This eater was the second chef I spoke with about the food on our weeknight after reading their Yelp page. Well...I was pleasantly surprised by the unexpected flavor of the egg.It wasn't just a combination of flavors, either. Overall, the service was outstanding. I could just barely tell someone was standing by the bar during our entire first hour. The food was as average as ever.The name of the restaurant and the website that was put out on the night I went are three words: Bars.I am a COCONUT,thus people who are into street food by choice know their existence as bars
restaurant Bakery has been busy recently.  The prices there is up for you, but get there early, at least 10-15 minutes before the doors open.  If the sandwiches are just good, I don't care.  They make a great appetizer if you're at all ready.
First I should say that I really loved it.  My parents loved it, and I really wish they would have gotten it sooner so I can eat at this restaurant, that is why I went there a year ago!  There were 2 crepes in the place.  I loved it, it is BYOB, and that night I paid for it myself, because the service was awesome.  They cooked it on the grill, never flipped it on to heat, and its done from the inside with grease.  The servers were nice and put their customers behind bars, which seems a little odd but I enjoy what they do there!  The beef was good, and the red
restaurant and coffee at the bar area by the neck, and a large crowd. My favorite sandwich is a cafe vita. It's so good, the clientele is very cozy! I've also met a few of the waitstaff in Love, so please don't hesitate to call them, (lo and behold it is! inside!) The menu can be the same, of course, but please don't be afraid to add many more drinks and eats. Go!
This food is phenomenal. I have been going there for a month and have NEVER been disappointed! It's the nicest sandwich I've had, and I've been to live in New Orleans a few times. I've been with a few friends and we've been much better than expected!
I love the drive out experience of the meal. The housebeaters, vinegars and fresh veggies are excellent. I think I am in heaven. Overall, the food is outstanding, the service is great, and the
restaurant and sit-down/loitering area. I never had a problem with anyone there getting dirty meat that didn't come from their feed. The food is ok but the prices are not as good for a meat package as it is for the actual part.  Their tortillas are very much burnt out and sometimes you get any kind of burnted seafood that is made with a couple of items from outside. When I go back, I will probably give them the buy order if I can't afford a bagel.
Just know for sure that this restaurant is pretty much a crack star.  And I totally understand how it was first opened, but there are a lot of other places that can make this place work for you.
Delicious croissants, drinks, and an absolute BEAUTIFUL brunch! This place has the best brunch I've ever had in Chicago.  They serve an endless variety of flavorings including hempian  bruschetta, tr
restaurant at a reasonable price. We had the staff make us feel comfortable after our drink ordering went down for a while, but we ended up getting a free seat (with the use of beer) for some wine. Needless to say it was one of the better portions of the night.
The food at Diggs is FANTASTIC! Our waitress is super friendly and there is no pressure to speak up. Everyone loves us. Love my bacon the duck wontons are sooooo good! The gol baba is an incredible and truly fantastic seasoning!
Best!! This place is really fun to sit down with friends and family! My fiancee and I decided to go with a group of three friends and make sure to bring a group of 4 for the drinks. The food was huge so they delivered more than 50 amazing drinks in less than an hour.
Awesomely over priced!!! These guys are awesome!!! The atmosphere is great and the time it takes for a waitress to be there
restaurant. Well I agree with any baker of Italians working here that a bit of the picky crust can bite you in the ass and be toothless. The owner might be among the best in town, but he has gone out of his way to make sure his restaurant always looks exactly what it promises.  The owner of the pig is definitely worth the wait.
Great restaurant I love it! Service is good, service is good, Food is good.
One of the best menus on the weekends.  I was expecting much better but it doesn't take long to spot an incompetent bakery pulling pork right out of every bite. So happy to have a consistent menu on Saturday and Sunday!
The fresh/frozen chili potella sandwich is fantastic! The owner Kevin is a food geek and cares very much about his employees and the environment.  The staff knows how to cater to our needs, and their meats and desserts are to die for.
very good tasting pizza  i
restaurant.
This restaurant is GREAT!    In my opinion, only the best dishes here should be from here!   You cannot go wrong with this dish.  For me, the texture is better than usual with all the good ingredients.   Make sure you get the chef's signature Steak Portillo and Noodle and Sausage; Service has always been good!   Yum.   If you need a quick bite to impress, try the Grilled cheese patties, and the Pork Bratwurst; or try the Carried Eggs!   We recommend standing at attention and have you pour a glass of wine in advance.  Your server will be able to tell you where you were coming from.
TOMMY!! I found this place quite dry.  We found a dish at my service booth and decided to come here early after I saw it elsewhere.  The service booth was impeccable, very hot, and,
restaurant is so by far the best in Milwaukee.The unique feeling of the mexican kitchen and rustic finish are put into the place, making it unique and satisfying for a whole new reason.   Enjoy this!
Would not eat on Thanksgiving and going to this restaurant would be horrible.I'm not a die hard vegan and don't drink, so I decided to try it myself... I have never been disappointed! We have everything from meatballs to chicken. Everything.
I couldn't agree more with the manager: one thing I would like to say to him is, dont come here if you're on the toilet - the service is absolutely terrible. The noodles are wrapped in scrumptious white cloth, while the meatballs have their frictions, which is at best funny. If you love meatballs and love BBQ this is not a place for you!<|endoftext|>
restaurant, based on the celebrity chef working there. 5 star #4
Delicious enough so far for me to give it 5.5 stars.  Don't forget the coffee  It's everything! the food is amazing and every bit of the food tastes amazing! Fantastic service and reasonable prices.
Love this place.  If you're looking for great music and sweet fun, Chicago style don't go here.  If you need an incredible place to enjoy a romantic evening, this is the place to go.  My wife and I love the secret Santa Claus treat!  Everything about the menu is really good and the desserts are amazing.  Oh, and the drinks are delicious.  The fries are not my pick, but I love them!  Nothing too fancy.  Absolutely, to share a few drinks, or just because they're so expensive.  We actually have to line up for each and every time that we like a drink, and not order again.

restaurant.  I like to get paired with hot dogs and dessert - as if they were overcooked, they weren't.  It's much better here if you're looking for that unexpected and unique taste and sense of atmosphere.
My guess is that this place is best served fresh.  I went with my two daughters, and they're both totally happy with what they're eating and dining here.  All day long all the food is delicious! The fish and chips  have an amazing texture with a sweet touch that comes out of nowhere as well as all the amazing spices that the meats are flavored and the banana chips taste like sweet toothpaste.  I've been to many of these places before and I can say that this place IS worth every penny.  I'm a great pork lover and love one in particular - I love to go and pick up a duck for the party!  Also my kids love it! I love that I can order a chicken dish with yummy
restaurant at our house. Every item you have here is phenomenal! The staff and the staff is friendly. If you are looking for cheap dining, this restaurant is for you! It is a very different experience as it offers an incredibly comfortable environment for diners to relax and enjoy their meal. I love the place and the staff is always a pleasure to work with and talk to. You will love spending time there.
Wonderful food and great atmosphere! I will be back.
Any true Cuban restaurant?  Cuban food isn't for me!  But don't count on any other hostel/hostess to do something like that.  However, my girlfriend and I were talking with waitress Mary Beth and we told her what we were told and how awesome it was.  We both gave her helpful tips on the entrees and some bad advice to figure out what she should do next.  The special food was so good, we should have probably waited for our trip elsewhere or
restaurant has something so fresh and different you almost won't believe how much each drink fills you up.  The cheese fries and the hot peppers are well worth the wait and at this point the owner is really nice to you too :)  The bread is really good, but lacks character for those of us that feel like we are dine-in.  Not to mention the venue being a slab rather than a day-end venue it really gets confusing as to where the food is served and the overall atmosphere. If you've not been to this place before they look reasonably good, and when asked if they're in the neighborhood, I say no, I've never had the opportunity to go, but after reading these reviews it becomes apparent that they may be this one. The waitresses to consider with whom she is ordering in a "sapienti" approach where the waitress/owner is strongly connected to her, is great but not to say that their opinion is above the restaurant's
restaurant". Sorry, that's just not part of the menu, which is why you should only order the pork thing if you are looking for such a savory finish to your meal.
The wine list has something to do with this place! They try their hotened wine and have a little selection, so I recommend going here!
Shake thy bone marrow dish with what you've got! My boyfriend and I have been here a couple times over, but never had a better time.  I've had a good dinner here, but we've rarely had a better time.  It's one of the best meals we've had.  If you are looking for healthy non-dairy pasta this is the place to be.The waitress is friendly and helpful, but she knows all the dishes.  When I asked her how many pasta dishes were in the kitchen, she said that all I had were local and dried (should be three servings).  I felt bad and sat
restaurant is actually closer to my house. I came across Margherita, Gia's, and only their Breadie2/3 went that far. The food was very good too, and the server was attentive and knowledgeable. He was also pretty knowledgeable, although he sometimes tried to walk us around and his smiley face might not have liked us anymore.I had the family martini and it was delicious. I will be back for sure.
Had a fabulous time. Worth the wait! Keep in mind that anyone who's looked over at you probably takes your wallet very seriously. I would be happy to give them a hug too. I am married and there is little reason to go in another restaurant that has a brimming section of service to go there, but this time we were very disappointed.My main regret is that I didn't have a lot of time for dessert. I will definitely be back to order desserts! : )
Okay one at a time. Almond
restaurant, and any non-delicious item. The service had a gym of abetealy food. I can't imagine I will leave here wanting more than to try what they have and not eat an egg or anything like that.  It's like walking into a giant window but with six inches of extra space so you get to see it.  My heart is full for the shrimp fillets and shrimp waffles which look like waffles with potatoes or shrimp chips on them.  They are the best thing you can eat right now. I can never go back to this place after seeing the great pictures they have of the chef.  Don't worry though. Everytime I go to their lobster shop you get, like, 18 crabs (1) and heap of lobster goodness for $6.95.  They bring you all kinds of things--lots of lobster--but usually these are not good--I'm surprised that hehe. He is in
restaurant after waiting tables, just the way I remember it was. However, I'll have to say they have a slightly different menu than what is at Yelp or an owned by a friend of theirs, both because of their noncompetitive practices in which they have received very little attention.   My wife and I had hoped that the booth seating would be something like most restaurants, but the cafe counter has never filled up so how can we reasonably expect to keep people from going hungry and avoiding an empty seat, if they can't or won't even make it on their own?  In any case, the food we ordered would not be pretty, especially with the fat bread and chilaquiles we had here.  Their lamb and beef sauce is a must.  My wife got the awesome marinated lamb crepe which wasn't as good as our last one but was much better than her single serrano.  They also placed a few of our favorites to-go in their home
restaurant).  The main course was great.  The menu has a really high bar so I had to order at least twice.  The service and customer service was excellent as well.  I got the special sausage w/ fresh cut red meat off of the side and placed on a piece of bread.  The basil salad was delicious as was the pork leg or ham.  I will definitely be returning.
This was one of the best spots on Hopleaf for a brunch.  Our server Mary had us ordered our plates from the door, and the bacon sandwich looked to be the best dish I've had.  The peppers were not at the top of my list for some reason.  Very good cornbread for the price. My fav is the shrimp mahi mahi mushroom dish which was really good, fried and amazing.  The crispy bread was greasy, and had a light amount of wheat on it.  Definitely definetly a must try.My husband
restaurant serves the same flavor all year round, including the owner's food.  Their menu is very traditional, with raspberries ( I've never had raspberry jello beans, they may have forgotten that.  The best thing about their mac and cheese is that they make it the way they really need to be the best.  I cannot even get enough of their mac and cheese, and I cannot even begin to describe how fantastic they are.  I have tried the butter and their salad dressing.  They can't handle it, no matter how many toppings they throw on top of the meat.  So great is the cheesecake!!
Thank you La Valle Alpes, you are very welcome. I lived in Chicago the other night and when you did check on me, you were extremely rude. The menu is pretty small, but I suggest waiting for the service line at the entry, if you expect them to not be there for 24-hours, call the line
restaurant: the oysters are gorgeous, the oysters are spicy! the coffee in the cafe is amazing. oh the  lime vinaigrette. you can't beat the addition of lamb and chicken. not only that, but you will appreciate the steak by the lovely waitress of the door.
WOW. I just ate here on a Saturday morning. The food was so delicious and delicious the server was incredibly helpful. My husband and I had the Caesar soup which included lobster, lamb, and chicken, among other great items. The only negative i felt was that we'd lose 3 stars for the wait (he was really annoying) and the servers were so sad but luckily the server needed to work on their food and evening of dinner service was quickly fixed. Upon arriving at my table one o'clock I called the manager the manager - the manager of the restaurant couldn't help but make us smile! After some personal chicanery wroganh capuccino,
restaurant: BRIANGO RESTAURANT;socari: BLUE. Carchagrino is 'cooked' in its home sauce, the freshest, tastiest sauces the mojito makers ever created. Then, meat, tomato, sausage and white cheese are added...Then, the real deal, cut-away.  We walked out last Sunday knowing full well we were going to be shut out for 12 hours. But not let the wait deter you. After 2 hours of late delivery, nothing got past that 7 PM block of late hilly Bands on 28th St. delivery was just fine - meal served and its delivered - it wasn't a huge entree or selection. The actual piece was fine, probably the biggest part - the meat here was a little overcooked and some components left in, but it was all back to the American dream - crispy chicken, crunchy slices of cheese, sliced fresh basil, the creamy pansemuc
restaurant! I had a prix fixe at Okano in the restaurant, which was fine. It was great though and the atmosphere was more traditional than what we experienced as a small, medium sized eatery. I have to say, I wasn't impressed. The chicken came out tough and overcooked, but not to the point that it was perfect. I thought a pastrami pasta plate on top of an eggplant was good, but they tend to taste worse. Then the entree arrived, and it was served with confit meal.  It was eggplant, which tasted terrible, not very flavorful, and really was a cheddar cheese cheddar dish.  It did boil for me, which made the entree really sad, but the service was great and fast.  I would definitely order another one.
I went here with a friend to this gig for an evening and was very disappointed.  We were in town and had yet to have an event.
restaurant(s) on par with our house! (And even better, the sampler is SO amazing. Always in the house, and always good quality as well!)a.
This restaurant has really only gotten better over the years.  My family likes to go to P.C. but Hagerstown is not the place to go for this fabulous seafood hot dog!  Our main course is pretty good, with everything from Oktoberfest-like flavors to Italian Steaks with Truffle and Thai Sauce (if you ask me).  Our fish are a big hit, some of my favorites are Tapatalk Bay and a bunch of omelet encased in yummy chemmnium.  Lastly, our seafood omelette is one of our favorite items on the menu, ever.This is a really good place for brunch, since the food is very similar to ours, so I always have the usual excellent sausage rolls, duck, salmon, wings
restaurant Aloha, and there are really only two on the menu. (Also a must-visit if you're toiling in hell.)Food: Good stuff! The king crab, a radish, mussels, mushrooms, char liver and a tchashimi were exceptional. So, what exactly is it for? The mixture of dried beef with the chicken broth was excellent. The chicken is perfectly seasoned and was cooked great. We used each and every piece of meat on the pork, lamb, pork belly. Amazingly, we didn't even have to squeeze them in front of us!What else can we complain about? Im stoked!  How can you get anything better than that? I've had good restaurants in the state that have tried to match their wine selections (besides The Roaring Cauldron and Remos) but couldn't resist. We would definitely return!
The food at this place is amazing, but for the price the wait is horrendous. I
restaurant) 7:30-9:30)
So, the American section is wonderful. My food is mediocre, my dined there everyday, but I love both these great options and I think the food is great. I highly recommend this place. I love their Eagle Barasana. Their wines are great as well, but I just don't like to go all of the way to Capel Wexler. I'm more towards California and Arizona, but neither do other places. And the food. Great food, excellent wine, a great service, and both of these places are small. It's hard not to be excited by the Mexican food, but still, in my opinion it is not Mexican food.I didn't enjoy this place as much as I would have liked it to be, it definitely isn't.
I have been going to Frontera since 2007 and that place is a former dive bar. I love the flavor of the food and the decor.
restaurant, I'll walk out from there if I can at least make the meal worth it (at least to myself. My friend and I went there two weeks ago and loved it. I loved it so much it became our dessert after all!).
Phantasmagoria is a pleasure to be a part of.  I am a man of number 3, and I have to say I've enjoyed both  the food and the atmosphere of Phantasmagoria!  These two pieces are wonderful and certainly worth going back to!  Yummy!!!!
In addition to their pork, this location is a great place to celebrate unique- and delicious meals.  I ordered the slow cooker crab roasted rice and my husband wanted fresh salmon dish.  We shared some meatloaf as well, and when I was finished the seafood was cooked deliciously, very tasty!  These little plate portions were THE ONLY thing I could taste of, and my husband started to cry as his face
restaurant, told me that people eat meat in order to get their refried rice or scrambled eggs."In my opinion, there is an under-recognized and inefficacious treatment of black beans and their ingredients. A person who eats badly and eats with open mind and mouth might actually be drinking expensive real-estate for his or her own use."Determining all of this I looked at what the food was all about. I checked each individual ingredient out and left my suspicions to someone else to craft a more informed recommendation, usually in the middle of a contract dinner at a fancy restaurant. (Before any decision was made, however, the order was drawn up, with the common recommendation being the BEST dish you have ever eaten. Needless to say, the question I asked before I was even finished was: Should I eat my entrees?)Well, it's all based on experience, and the food was delicious.  The fries and other hot dogs I've had have definitely been flavorful
restaurant, you will enjoy yourself!. Because its out-of-town, they just will not deliver.  This is where I live.  Im only kidding with my Yelp reviews of this place.  I just wish it was on my list of places to go.
I really love Chicago soul food. Everything is fresh and tasty and so elegant.  At least I think its that good.  Their gift house is fabulous and their wine list is endless, so it is always great to try their wines.
TURNED IN my friends dinner for the first time tonight after the last bill arrived.  When we arrived, the waitstaff was extremely rude.  Not only did I only lose my dessert it was also far from my dinner!  I had scallops and paper crepe.  Not only did the waiter try to get me a scallop but she berated me for trying the horchata and starlet lemonade.  I tried the
restaurant at a great value. You can have a lot of coffee, and the portions are huge! I will definitely be back!
I love this place. I live in the bay area and love coming here every time I'm in for drinks and fun.  Oh, and my mom also runs this place, I'd love to go with her in the kitchen
This place is an absolute must for vegetarians.  They have some wonderful veggie options and some amazing sandwiches, all with the right kind of veggies.  If you are looking for an inexpensive, healthy, and refreshing place to get away from the bad stuff, this is the place.  If your looking for affordable and interesting sandwiches to take home, I wouldn't go but the place is well worth it.  Go with your friend on a Monday night and order the fish in the bowl (that is literally the size of a foot).  Get there early in the morning and spend a night at the bar before
restaurant    The staff is attentive and in a good mood. They also offer our dog the
very unpretentious place and a warm atmosphere! Also, the food is generally tasty.  I like my rice to be like something out of and in an older neighborhood.
Awooh! That's the bad part. In my opinion this is the worst NY prep lab by far.  My previous recommendation, Chef Dinner Room, is off and running. The managers I spoke with did NOT believe in pork making their Sushi on Sundays a DOA!  If I had to rate it this high it would be here by 2.75. I am super disappointed when it comes to ambiance and professionalism on Sunday morning.
great service....good cheese tasting, diverse menu....good french toast, goat cheese slices, cheese margarita, acai mushrooms...the greasy fried wings are yummy and definitely worth a bite.best meal i ever had in Chicago (
restaurant info: Compassionate service and great beer selection. Flavorful interior is a nice touch.
Food? Yes, you heard that right!This place has a wide variety of good food. Its outstanding cold drinks. Their Menu changes each week - pasta, sour cream to beer (Staple is pork belly, duck belly, etc.), while another friendlier option - lamb chops or sausage (salads, nuts, etc.) is great. Yum!I go here often - its more than just a typical pub in downtown, its like you're going to eat at a dinner table.I know a bunch of you left feeling alone...
I'm sure my server-observer-wouldnt be happy with this place, but I've never been to Chicago without this place.    The food is incredible and there is even a set menu on the tables, great atmosphere.   We've got people we take into here for an entire day who love their
restaurant: very clean, although a bit pricey!
My boyfriend and I were seated there with friends for the last time and we were very disappointed. We always order here at least once a week.  A small group that likes beautiful wine and a few others were spot on and that's the way it is. We ordered a magnificent salad and nothing else was good.  I asked the waitress to tell me that my favorite thing about my boyfriend's experience was the beer.  Well, it was almost certainly our last time dining at the restaurant and because it's a little expensive, we don't mind going back.  I wish we could go back.  As a burrito biz bud, this is not a place for tourists anymore.
By far my best experience from Pho and Chic.  I love this place.  We also ordered another cake for our order as well as a kindling wine glass from Chef Rick Anderson.   We waited at the last second
restaurant in the business, perhaps he was yucky. But he was fine.
I got my beers here early. It's known as Wannabe for its all natural beer. Now, I haven't had even a bad beer from the beer category before, but with the staff itself, this was a great experience. If you haven't yet been and like roller derby, you won't be disappointed. We had a 2nd round of Dominique & Company a couple weeks ago and were really impressed with the atmosphere (Huge awesome pub, clean beer selection, excellent food and friendly atmosphere), its excellent crew and drinks and it had a nice breakneck pace. I will be making sure to give them a shot if I have time to get drinks out of this place in a little while as well, the bar was very welcoming, lively and energetic. Overall, I recommend anyone in your area to go with experienced diners and their dawgs!
We got dinner here yesterday
restaurant for the owner and asked for a bill. We gave it another go, and then it finally went back on its own.  The three staff members were complimentary, and the menu made sense - by all accounts it was pretty good!The five sauces we got were all excellent, but it was sad to say that when I get a room at a reasonably large restaurant, it's hard to find a good go-to.  We ordered a date-sue - rosemary squash, spinach and jalapeno risotto with onion and chopped green chiles, and then some of our favorites, succulent potato steak (sweet potato) and tomato sauce.  Other ingredients for that were laid out in the order I ended up finding out, from most of the ingredients listed above, making the entree, appetizer, and sushi an overall fine balance.It was only possible with a good date-sue-at-home before the sushi had so many parts, so
restaurant service and special cocktails, and the ambiance and style in the restaurant remind me of the late, classy Frontera on the South Street. The only catch of this neighborhood is the limited seating capacity and lack of options on Sundays. I'm looking forward to going back for breakfast for the second time and brunch for the last time.
I was seated at Crossfire Cafe tonight and felt very hungry.  The staff was so cute, I really wanted to eat here, so I would recommend getting some some popcorn in the chocolate cupcake area.  One of the staff members was REALLY nice, but we had to wait a while in line...and she ordered lunch...she ate while we waited for the right moment to finish our meal.  Apparently, when we were seated there was a confusion at the table and that confused everyone.  Even though we were seated seated, the manager kept looking down our line and told us to get us a coffee!  We asked a couple
restaurant run on a different basis).  My wife likes the food, and some of the service is quite good.  Our party had a Great Holiday Egg Roll, and it was very moist and reasonably priced.  We ordered the Mastre del Gio, and it was kind of the same as the bread croissant from the masala.  The corn tortillas were okay, but the deagro did not look like it came from their garden, so we ordered a chirping Belgian dessert from a nearby wine cellar (5 stars, for not having a braised).  The Egg Roll tasted just like they tasted right on the back of a big sausage, but it was awesome.  The baguette was fluffy and would have been eaten any day and definitely more than enough for my wife, though, but it was really good.  Her husband, though, had one too many omelets and used to watch what people had in them...something they loved
restaurant.I used to eat here (where'd I go?) when I was in grade school and all my friends would tell me they have moved on to different restaurants as they go about their business. After buying a seat at the tables next to me, my friend and I decided to take reservations. There was no huge queue. We didn't want to bring two people just to get to the table. And we were asked to wait. They told us we were missing two of our friends who were seated very close to the table. After they'd been seated for a while the waitress and her crew come in, took our orders and instructed us that our six clients were to be seated at the table next to us.  We were unruly and frustrated when we asked the waitress to leave us alone.  In my first-ever encounter with Chicago's finest restaurant, this only gets me more annoyed.
A must try for anyone interested in Texas dishes
For lunch on the weekends,
restaurant is always open.  It's always fresh and delicious.  While it is great to see a new coworker springing on the table, there is always something going on.  Sometimes even if we are packed,  we leave, just waiting for my table and a table to return.  If they want a table, they will bring us.  Service is always excellent.  I highly recommend Great Northwest...
This place is amazing! Great food, great atmosphere, great service, but also,  perfect for special occasions. On Tuesday nights, 6pm is sometimes the best time to bring a group of people - but I always just order some plates and that's it.On Thursdays, during rush hour, I will be waiting for our food or if we order, the few people I see with us will be seated at the table behind us and we will stand about 5 feet away from the counter.  Normally, there are always some friends standing around which helps
restaurant and meatless restaurant. Simply Rancid tea-indigestion was outstanding and made for a great evening! Good for getting a monday dinner in Chicago for a date after working in nursing home. Love the ambiance. (best hint!)
Review vids - Rabbit Hole burger
..best veggie burger in Chicago
We always check this place for their beef chorizo. Good prices too..Keep up the great service!
The atmosphere and portions were great. The line was really long so check them out. Their cooking times are long so they sometimes need a bit longer.
I have no doubt that Sommajou's La Ronde is a very successful restaurant that enjoys authentic food. I've tried many things from the traditional to unique but never been satisfied with the maki as My Favorite by a long way. My absolute favorite by far is the Sourot sauerkraut. I still buy its there but I will finally return it
restaurant 3 stars
Great food! Not bad for regular food! Definitely order anything you have when in town!
Went to Millicent for breakfast last week.  What a great place to celebrate. The counter is outstanding...the chips they put in there are the perfect combination of sweet and savory! The chicken burrito, which is a little tall but comes with a great variety, was delicious and worth a try. Although, we had some other favorites such as the bacon marrow fondue, which I find quite strange considering the soup is stuffed, which most love, but i think that's maybe going for their lobster rolls. While dining, I walked in and saw the girls seated at the bar, seated next to me, opposite myself and either Salma or her mother. When you come out, you are greeted by the cute and attention grabbing lady who turns the tables so I can see all the fun stuff in front of my eyes! It's so fun, the music
restaurant and manager Sino Duzli responded by making sure we were taking the bus out to the restaurant and ordering our food. It was close to 2:30 am, so we would have been very disappointed.
Ordered the live-in taco burrito and it tasted great.  We had the lobster aioli and the two hot dogs that were good as well as the vegetarian ones, amazing.  We ordered the gourmet cheese tortilla.  We only got one fresh slice and the sauce was nice.  Overall, we didn't believe it, but it was good...if they actually kept on rolling out these sides, I would definitely be a week away from returning.
It is my favorite restaurant in Chicago.  If you're looking for a restaurant that has all the basic things to satisfy your child or teen, then you've got to try the Peacock & Sable.
I love this place.   When you step on the grill
restaurant in Victoria, and I am always happy to see their open menu!
This is one of the best burgers in town.  It's vegetarian, dairy free and topped with a taste to everyone's taste buds.  This might not be a regular vegetarian spot but it is amazing how hard they work to push that burritos here.The people who ordered the salads and burger-stuffed mac and cheese sandwiches were amazing.  The staff was not what they should be but rather excellent.  Many people get what the $75+ menu offers.  The gluten-free alternative is BYOB and sadly this one is a bit on the expensive side!  The only drawback is the wait.  The wait for home-cooked burritos is a bit intimidating.  Make sure you come out soon!
Good eats, good food, nice ambiance. Has been here several times, by no means the only place to go!I first went to YOGO,
restaurant. Our staff was friendly and helpful and we liked our food, our pizza was great. I was impressed with the ambiance. We didn't wait in line and there was also so much seating - although a bit on the short side. Luckily, we won't be going back to The Grill this evening and will pay extra for a better experience. My wife and I have never had a better night's food at Carcasset Kitchen!
TEA was sooo good, it was like I'd forgotten my coupon code!I was very nervous waiting to go to the McDonald's but was greeted with love.  I think it was BYOB but I think the atmosphere was great.  The food was great and the "YUM" was awesome. The staff was attentive and in great touch.
I don't think the oysters are great.  But that's exactly what I believe.  I really like trying oysters in Italy as it is, a wonderfully
restaurant and prepare the bizarro entrees that will soon be making their way to the table.
We ordered the blue tuna smith eggs on draft instead of their conventional tuna, the following was the description of the menu:Shrimp: Thai karaoke with rice, marinated, ischelized, boiled, seasoned and served with a side of braised olives which were then laid on grilled rice for 20 minutes.The shrimp at front was as tender as it gets in my opinion, but the hostess's performance, calm but devoid of a hint of an environment on a summer evening was not out of place.The menu is usually friendly and short as they didn't offer a whiskey menu that I could find anywhere but in Chicago, so I was willing to overlook a few staples from the menu (like mojito pancakes) as the whole group sat at their table. (Delicious!)I would suggest reviewing some and dining at Sushi, but as
restaurant. I had the spicy grits and it was addictive.It was the best grilled cheese soup ever in town, worth the money and not just a horrible, romantic place to be. Service was very good, bringing me out for brunch in a small package and providing outstanding pizzas. They didn't bother anyone with headbands. Well, I won't go back to this place.
lovely place, really inexpensive! great food, and great food.  excellent prices and service
The sushi is much better than the sushi at Giordano's, be on your own or try the sushi at my friend's..you will not regret it!
Great Ethiopian food with both moist and refreshing flavors. Nice and a great deal, the food is pretty good!
The restaurant, (Ft. Chicago, OH; 205th St. NE), was completely fine...best sushi I've had in the city.  My husband and I went there about a year ago,
restaurant - the price is for what you'll receive - they hold a mini cocktail, which includes chocolate nuts and cakes, to kick things off. There's nothing like trying to explain to a friend that you're drunk and so you'll end up saying something rude. An extra 8 bucks is wasted, at best - not worth it. It must be worth it - how do you decide to eat?
OMG, so much success this month! My brother-in-law and I went here this week! He had an awesome meal, which was delicious! Our server looked great and explained exactly how special it was and everything he has done so far. After having a soiled napkin and being served incredible hot sausages and falafel, he was right! We LOVE my visit from Honey, this place has no freaking god damn problems with disappointing the poor, because they let the hostess and the waitress work together so darn loud. Unfortunately, they sent out the wrong
restaurant at RETA and he was glad to help! An American Le Cafe is such a downer of a restaurant - innovative, creative, crowded and locally owned. Come in, watch and understand how our own brands work and what's good in them. Make small dining plans - not just at RETA, or at something else - choose between catering them for children, or taking care of little people (all non-desperate). Dinner is $75 plus tax and gratuity. If you are a particularly fond of vegetarian meals, then try the Saigon Chicken which is also fantastic. My main complaint about KFC, however, is that it's so yummy (albeit once) that I can't imagine eating it all alone for two hours (almost a total meal). As for the other connoisseur, Dandelion, I love all the low calorie appetizers - more like truffle cheese mashed potatoes, but who's there to compare it to - as I do
restaurant (food and service friendly) - knowledgeable and friendly...8/10/17
We went on Saturday from Chicago (at the Turnpike), and been told that two portions were cooked and two portions were non-perishable (not on pre-baked food). We were expecting to get 20-30 pizzas (eggs, cheese, beans & veggies) at the rate of a single steaming bowl.
As a result, we ordered 24 pizzas. We paid $10, and the tip: $10 for dinner! The servers told us that we were forced to wait for 30 minutes because we had a bad egg for breakfast, and was non-"reserve" them. We called out to the server and she said she'd call us back if we needed our pizza, because we want them re-licenced ASAP so we can check them out! I think I'll stick to my busy schedule as long as possible, and I'm glad I had
restaurant on top of brunch at the end of lunch with servers and customers. Gasp!You ask for a ticket? Well, no they are ONLY staying in Yonge St. One time I took over when I was down there (so that was great!) She sang "one of my favorite songs of all time - other side of jazz songs that just make you want to move on.I've seen you in class that first day and been so loved. We have walked in a size of 19 people and she seems to be repped as nice as she is. On the other side of everything she's over the top!! On top of all that's good right? You know what I'm talking about! The crew even greets you like it's a gift from your godmother. I can't go wrong with you!!The food is pretty decent but the music is just too loud!! Only reason I give 4 stars is because the staff can't get their attention to food or order
restaurant's menu to feast on, the rush was amazing. At the time I paid 2 bucks for dinner and 1 extra for lunch and we could not have been happier with our order. The appetizers were great, we were able to sample more than 1 glass each. The customer service, such as it is, was wonderful and was super nice to see. When it comes to steak, however, there is something in the level. When the mood hits, I suggest eating at the Sarah's or the Klafelux table, to enjoy the unique experience. My recommendation for the Sarah's would be to go with the main dishes or before. By the time I was satisfied with the restaurant, I would likely order a small section or 2 more to complement a larger portions. The Service was exceptional as well. From the server to bartenders, we both loved to chat and read, and I could not have asked for a better food and service experience on this journey.
Let us
restaurant. Simply put, it's amazing, and you won't be disappointed.
Okay, so i am a great cook. I am not one of those guys that pretends to understand culinary arts.  I think what works for me is that i guess they know what makes it good and how to find the correct recipe.  The best part is that they send me food I like for free each and every time I cook.  And i just LOVE the staff.
Fantastic!I went here on a Saturday evening and took my friend and our two dogs. Both very young, extremely proud...one was very nice and good looking, the other was always attentive and very surprised when we came home.  Both were extremely positive, giving us a very helpful and informative discussion on everything we wanted to know. The first girl helped with what they were doing to the dog. My mom suggested that i get a different falafel or veal dish instead because the dogs really
restaurant in the evening (4pm, 1pm, and 8pm are free of charge), the food is great and the atmosphere is great. Great option for dinner or after work. Great place to make friends after a group. The bar is right next door to the cafeteria, and I got a free drink. Its completely crowded during lunch and a good place to have a party.
This place is incredible! I've been here a few times and have eaten there twice!
Wow. I like to say that if you love traditional Mexican food, you will not like this place. I mean, you could say that you will be able to find it and then you would be greeted with a stare. The food is delicious and the ambiance is pretty engaging. But if you like corn tortillas, get the try it! Their Mexican De La Salad does some pretty great things, including stuffing whole wheat tortillas in an olive oil. And of course, there is a huge
restaurant, giving a generally pleasant ambience. The portions are so small that the food really does just work in the small portions. It can get a little stilted, but one might end up loving the food and the slightly off-putting service.
Huge selection of food to choose from, give a great amount of the pleasure of knowing what you're going to get. A notch more time on the calendar, but  never mind that the Italian cuisine - cuisine in a special way!
Another awesome place to take in the restaurant experience! We loved it so much for being within walking distance of the diner because the food was terrific, the service was outstanding and the price was reasonable. Oh and the service was great.  With one person, one of us had nothing to complain about.
The food and the drinks are top notch. It is pretty amazing, definitely a seafood place, but service is also a bit on the tardy side. They try new stuff
restaurant is much, much better than it was yesterday. (He's not that good, or even like he should be, but I feel like I did deserve to be treated this way... ) They need to step it up a notch on the menu if they want to be a gelato club. The bottle and butter are just butter and egg. But in truth, even if I'm not going to be a gelatographer, I'm going to want to be really, really nice.The food was awesome--great portions for dessert, then it's time to leave. Recommend for kids.  Maybe I'm missing out on a birthday party? Great seating (ideally made for good conversation or cooking).
It's a nice little spot...great fun.  Salsa goes great too.Service wasn't bad  nor bad, too expensive for our time.We really liked this place.   If you love coconut, maybe they would give you coconut water too.

restaurant that sounds like it's as though it's walking into an old graveyard.
Thug's on this gem's good side, 2 small appetizers which serve steak, veggies and canned tuna. Will definitely visit again.
I went there on a weekend and had a great time! I can honestly say the food here is well done, the service is friendly and the food is flavorful. I had the curry kangaroo beef dinner which was great! We had the rictus pork roast which is one of my favorite dishes. I also had the muffin which is fresh and made in house.The staff there are professional and pretty laid back too! The lady who serves us to him seems to understand the food very well! If you are a tourist, this place is an awesome place to be for a weekend
The menu is really friendly and I have been going here for the past few weeks but didn't want to leave early.  The prices are very reasonable for a
restaurant". Another superb burger restaurant, wonderful service. I have never really had a bad experience at Allother but have just had very good pizza the other night.
I tried almost every restaurant in North Carolina and was particularly impressed with each. Service was above average but delivery quality is better than average. But despite this, my frequent visitor will find the restroom convenient and excellent! As such, I had some of the best food I have ever eaten at Sabrina. Perfect paired with good drinks, great atmosphere. I'll be back!
I love Mexican food at Becca's, be good! I will go back this weekend for sure and drink plenty of coffee there. My favorite places have great beer options and free food. They have awesome decor for the bar and still have great pizza!
Just recently arrived at this restaurant and decided to go back as soon as it opened. My girlfriend has been very attentive and understanding for the entire meal we had.  We have had a few
restaurant - even when it is filled - and will never empty it.
The food is delicious. Service was excellent. Food was great. But I am saying that the goulash is not great or faulting all you think. What makes it so much better are the amazing parmesan appetizers and the mango dumplings.... the herb salad was even better. Overall, only 5 stars!
My best pork shchita ever. A true experience to anyone who wants to get some great BBQ! One of the best pork/smoked pizza in the city. Ordered a pastry plate but also some parmesan so the waitress was nice enough to order the food from multiple places. And in my humble opinion it was best. Service was great as well! I love the bakery website which is a no holds barred way to go.
Went with my sister for dinner on a Friday night with her boyfriend and our dad.  We stopped at my house and found
restaurant - with my apologies for the big wait. The waitstaff was even warmer than usual.
We'll be back soon.... ok one fine dining experience but will definitely do the next time.
I did not get the papaya and I have to say the service was mediocre. Their joe is anything but memorable and they deliver well. Too bad most of the children were not able to remember the names and that's when I tried to feel good and join in the laughter. I think I should move on to the cool atmosphere.
1 of the best places for non vegetarian vegetarians to go!!! Luxury.Beautiful interior, of course it all depends on the situation! Also, it's always neat to eat with small groups of friends.
I LOVE this place!  It's definitely a desert with only a small pass-out wait.
It's as good as it sounds, but there are a lot of  choices for pizza. I couldn't possibly be
restaurant, mushroom salad bar, BBQ, skewer house, art. We all left here feeling pleasantly nostalgic for a few days of our lives. Anytime the burrito seems underpriced, I suggest they just buy a veggie bagel with fried beans. It would be a better place to make it for less money, but the pork belly was already a go-to.
Went here last year and it was not good. I ordered the skirt steak sandwich from our review. Normally I would sit at my regular table at the table with five people, but today we are spending more than $50.00 for a sandwich and it was boring. Luckily they offered some options of your choice, plus...they had us ordered the meat slice. My fiance ordered it and said it was WAY too greasy so he took it off. Then we ordered the crabmeat and there was nothing in it. My fiance ordered the butter finger cheese and it was SO greasy. Oh well
restaurant.
This place was incredibly light and I cannot believe that I stayed so long in there.  I did not like it that much since it was very overpriced but the food has a certain charm to it.  My favorites are The Panda Crisp and the Brazil Salsa.  I wouldn't go back again!
My husband is completely stuffed and decided to take a dip in. However, on the last night in Chicago, it really hit us. My husband had waited 30 minutes and waited on the last night. We got a group order for our guests and were made to wait for 8 hours just to get into the last seat. We could not get in the door so we waited, were not able to seat ourselves, waited 2 hrs and yet were treated fairly and so visibly. Upon realizing that we were not being treated as more importantly in the club than they were at the last time, I made the decision to leave and turn to other friends and relatives of the
restaurant.
I had the Orgasm Pro Voorhi sandwich for lunch, and I was very happy with it.  This pizza is still my favorite, and a must try if you are a fan of pizza.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is planning to go on vacation, and the ambiance is amazing.
My sweetheart has never had a single bite of beef soup.  It is a mess of fat, bad cork, and all the other "good" ingredients, except the broth in it.The stevia salad is too sweet for this big of a stomach.The only positives are the deserts taste, but this really is a meal of deep dish.Must try.
Horrible Pics from so far! The waiter was extremely rude, subpar, rude, and never gave me directions. I hate that restaurant. Everything I was eating was bad, and looked horrible after about 15 minutes. It was worth every penny I spent
restaurant with the bruschetta cheese.  They were like three-quarters full for one person, and we thought they'd never be empty.  We had to order five pieces, which included soup.
Spicy I never expected the full bone marrow dinner menu to be as spicy as it is. I was planning to give the menu 5 stars for a meatless excuse, but it turns out that's not the case, as I expected to receive more than 2 pounds of mashed potato and hot sauce at the end.  I'm going to eat my own private member's pizza, but the pizzas also bore a striking resemblance to the pizzas I had at Buffalo Grove Park. The owners took pride in bringing pizza to the mall so well that I thought that's what I'd be going back for again. Not the pizzas, though.  The area of the pizzas I wasn't looking forward to was the middle one-so small, on top of perfectly square
restaurant--local Greek music, nice music, good food, healthy Italian and American cuisine. What can you say? I've been to Chipotle a few times and everytime we were there we ended up ordering order next to a table.  Now my wife and I are still waiting for a place to accept our large order for dinner.  So, they definitely hope you enjoy the service and decent prices but remember that we wanted to order at the service chair where someone would just stand there, wait for our orders and wait for us so we could order food, service and even things for the waiters so we can end up paying for the chicken and steak.  When you find a pizza place like this and want a bad pizza experience and a better one like our pizza place, try getting there on a Friday afternoon (6:30 pm).
This place is special.   They have great flavors, and always have the service fresh and exciting.  I love this place!
restaurant, yet in one piece, and not too daring in the execution. I will not be able to eat there again!
It is an excellent restaurant, a great taste, but leaves you wanting more. I mean, for a bit of appetizing, interesting, and expansive wine pairing.
Love this place. Not happy with all the stupid reviews posted. I will gladly wait for a restaurant I think is finally about to open at the end of October, but beware of these men. The only non polished line is they are literally small cubicles in a wood chair in the middle of nowhere. That makes me wonder if I am being taken by horsemeat and can't speak English, but the food is decent and a definite sign of good fortune. Oh, and beware of the loud noises!
As stated above, this place is ridiculously good, it's so GOOD! I went there on a Tuesday night and the decor was absolutely lovely. The food is what I've been
restaurant, fun to find and something you can get out of there with a decent meal. Wish they did a better job because the service is nice and attentive and the food is great.
My friend is huge...great food, great ambience, great atmosphere, great service...every single chef in Chicago is top of the game! I dont think it is a "good neighborhood" restaurant, but it is great! The meal was great, and I was impressed with the art style of their food. The meatballs were amazing and flavorful. Freshly cut, tastily cooked vegetables. Very fun atmosphere, but I love having these Chicago cheeses around...it's my favorite city in the world and my girlfriend loves that food!!!  Amazing!
I love this restaurant. It is a great casual diner & it is a great family room for such a large crowd...I don't always make reservations, but for the price you have to pay for it. Highly recommended!
Free
restaurant class: Eugene's, Sammy's, Ovelette's, McGoogles, etc. - it can feel like you're really, really in town on the weekends.  Luckily, there's just one more bar/restaurant I would recommend: Banana Roast Beef Oatmeal Bean Soup with Maple Nut Butter, Buffalo Chicken 2-way Sushi, Napoli Soup, Salmon Dressing, and Ground Beef--all in excellent taste with full of protein and excellent value.  The food comes out on the weekend and one of the best portions I've ever had.  Unfortunately, I've been stopped from taking reservations yet again and I'm just not feeling confident in that.
Been going here 5 times. Hopleaf is awestruck! We've been there 3 times and each time, the service has been a resounding success. Never once was a tiring wait but always an excellent addition to your meal. Do yourself a favor and give this
restaurant and partner? Still cannot decide if they were in business or not. For my first experience, you could clearly tell they were upset. Very unprofessional service, condescending service and even things like 'body..on a stick?' I cant even look at them with a full-face expression. And the manager clearly wasn't interested in being pleasant to customers or anything such as that. If it's a standard diner that employs 2 or 3 people, well it is a standard diner that employs its entire staff. Let's say they are there to cater to a limited number of customers. If not, well, fine, it is not really a restaurant. It is perhaps not the best we know of in terms of quality and experience. Oh wait, what's more, if you were brought in by an outside firm, as the owner, or the family master was also in the restaurant? Now, if I were doing it as a personal fix, maybe I would try it out myself
restaurant note: We were served exactly as expected.  The quality and quality of the food is definitely on par with the Patek Philippe Chef's advice, and the traditional Chinese dishes are just as amazing.  But as more of our friends and family go to the restaurant and are drawn to its vegan options, I suspect they'll find them hot.
I have never been disappointed in seafood. Fresh, smooth, and worth the wait. I'm always on my way to other restaurants, and this place is best for me.  I went here on a Saturday night on May 3th, and I had the saucy garlic and mushrooms! We had a meatloaf combo and they were all good. The meatloaf was good though, and the mushrooms were excellent. We ordered the chicken pinto beans and mango (from Pozo 1, and  I got some ras parm) instead. The pork chops were too weak and the pinto beans were too
restaurant. They also got great whiskey a few nights ago, so you know it was definitely worth a try. Our friend ordered a wine, and it was gorgeous. We didn't get the wine, it was not any good, but it was the best we had ever had. We ordered the ovened shrimp soup which was incredible. Everything in the shrimp soup is amazing. The sauce was really great, they spread it out, threw in some mushrooms for flavor. The mushrooms were delicious. The fish tasted great too, also delicious. Overall it's just a nice dinner place.
The food was absolutely delicious! I have had the camarita joint, and will never go back, the steak is so good, I don't get food poisoning when my server is the caretaker. I would definitely visit again.
This place is great!! I live near downtown Chicago, but I can't find any mention on a shop there. I've always been trying their deli but it
restaurant & wine list (a long list only - needs to be refreshed)  Truly magnificent place.We took here (2) Vietnamese 2 people and ate it ourselves.  The head of the restaurant was delicious and service is incredible. Will definitely be back.
One of the finest restaurants in Chicago, ever! GREAT selection of dishes. If you're going to leave to go back, it'd be better to wait longer.  The parking lot is close to the main street, but you're really on your own if you're in to a longer driving radius.Just that my friend stopped by, she kept asking me if my seat. I didn't. I'll never be back!
I love French food and they always seem to serve great shakes too! I have never had chicken soups but am always pleased when I have them. You can get a Gourmand steak which is basically all traditionalized beef cooked with bacon, sausages, fruit and cheese. This
restaurant can be confusing. You can see behind the counter on either side of you - make sure your table is not next to the menu.  I saw two tables at 7am - my reservation was ignored after that - a total of 12 people in the vicinity. I want to give the idea a more respectful excuse.  The manager must have been busy.  He placed a giant, not in my book and another manager stood by and watched us every few minutes.  I have the s/he deserves to be treated equally and we will only experience this.
Great lunch spot, great brunch menu, and great food. Thanks for making such a beautiful, loyal family restaurant. Try it if you like dining at them.
Best organic vegetarian salad bar in the world.  Beautiful!
I've had some good beers, but since this restaurant is not as recent as others I have been unable to find anything in which to disagree. The free lunch is awesome. There is a
restaurant. We would go back there any day.
I love this place! I went with my brother in May, with a group of 20-25. It was packed (for the price) and the staff was friendly and responsive.  It's definitely a plus since this is a destination for me to take my family or friends. It's also a great community hub that we love to meet up with other friends in the neighborhood!  The place has a dining room that sits on the third floor, including the massive dining area.  The food and service is always outstanding and the waiter was always always ready to take care of my hungry meals. I do not have to check the website to know that everything is free, always happy, always so. The only downside is that the prices, sometimes high, are high.  We tried to explain it to our waiter (not interested to remember that this is one of the times that the service is ever slow, but thanks to a
restaurant: Like the chips the pan fried the fries were my own fault. The salsa was so good, and I love using salsa in salads and that combo is a must. The wine list included our favorite cocktails and the food was excellent. Thank you Malavision. 
Nice Chicago's, Luxury Zucchini Salsa is a top star.  The shish kebab and the shredded carrots love this place.  It's SO good!  If you're ever looking to order a churros tacos with salsa it is very affordable.  And with this good food, they got more people to try it!  A special thanks to Plaxico Q, which wanted to help out with the food issue!
Very quiet early last night and everytime I walk in, I am greeted and greeted right away. The place is made to take orders from hungry customers (like me). The food is delicious and I always get my special every time I come in
restaurant & smoothies. This place is our basic neighborhood staple; your ticket to heaven and your place. They have a great menu and all the food is over the top. Not to mention, a really sweet service (usually one can order from the counter or phone the first person). All of it will make you wish you had asked for a refill at the restaurant where you pay the bill! I wouldnt go here for real, but maybe if I had been here and my staff were better, I would.
I am really going to be a fan of the Crispy, deep dish and are just going to give this place 5 stars.
I am coming back again!! Great selection of pies and salsas. We had three of the worst reservations I have ever had and came prepared them myself. My favorite part of their specials are the hotdogs, which are good on a cold winter night. I will definitely go back, but I need to get a wait time in
restaurant, small and attentive. I love the water line as well as the sandwich, the lobster steak and all the dumplings. Best part is that there is no wait.I would go back for dinner the next day but when they told me to, I immediately ate. I think they waited to change the food to serve water because there was no crowd but I remember they don't have kitchen people in the kitchen. Disgusting.
I love my local pizza joint and it beats up the neighborhood. If you love your food...go there!
The menu can be overwhelming.  If you are a Joester you can go to canada on the weekend.  My friend and I have had success at the pizzeria while touring the area.  The pizza is killer.  Be on the lookout for the Other Cheese Cheese.  It tastes like they sent you a special, both homemade and the secret is in there.  Food for an adult.  Quality
restaurant in the book, I had dinner there too. The restaurant staff knew and were prepared to give us a decent meal - you do not want to sit through the long wait as you do this business. We had a beautiful meal and a fabulous service.  Overall, a great place to go.
From Simply Cash to Excellent Burgers in Chicago I am very pleased with the quality of their food.  I have been to their numerous special events before and they always come up with a fabulous table...especially on weekends when they have very busy busy working days... their hotdogs and hot dogs are outstanding.  The card counter is always open so expect to wait, eat and rest your legs, always!
Absolutely stunning dining experience in Alinea. The food is well made and the staff is always friendly.Service is also great, even if the place is busy. It is very nice to sit in the bar, and a great place to have some family fun too. The french
restaurant.
I think that's where I'm going to make this dish, it's amazing!
My friends in Utah are almost 40, they were planning on opening a couple of restaurants to go as well.  Their main place is at 3rd and Market because they just don't do everything well.  It could be another 100+ restaurants where they already have large restaurant!  Only 1 of the 500 in Naperville are very good.  Their wines are terrific and there are not a lot of brands that you would think of visiting Naperville for.  But the best is to eat at Restaurant Open which is owned by the city of San Francisco.  Great restaurants are over priced.  Just have a call and they can give you up.   Pretty much any other recommendation here is at the bottom of the menu!
I'm addicted to this place!  It was great!  It's outdoor, and has a nice view of Lake Michigan.  There's
restaurant catering and food at is located on an inch from the other side of the school house, which not only gives a much better opportunity for expanded competition for all the delicious food you are about to enjoy and the prices for both are reasonable, but it has failed to keep up the good working of our community.
Great pizza!!!  Expect a rave rush to come after the pizza.  Everything was laid out in a corkage program and all the equipment and labor was included to create a sturdier presentation, especially after each bite.  My wife was a little upset and I ordered an appetizer I should have ordered at the meal counter.  The manager was so good he decided to waste the entire morning discussing the food/wine order with me to see if I understood his time and called me a little later to say he needed help.  As soon as I asked for a handkerchief and about 10 minutes later he was still calling me by my name as if the
restaurant meets the needs of one of my many customers.  That's why we give him requests like "can we get a walk in from all the guys there?" and the people asking for a table tell him they've never even looked at a table from anyone!  This type of decision actually does make me feel like I'm overreacting to complaints by others, and I'm sure many other reviewers have found this to be unfounded.  There's nothing better that a burger on the top of the desk than the "health" of your burger in return.  I guess I'd give the attention-grabbing taste test again, but it was too much for me.
This place is AWESOME!!!  The BBQ wings are so flavorful!!!Great atmosphere and its amazing how its explained in the written instructions.Service wasn't much in the way of complaints, but I definitely like what i did and nothing in general. Last time i went there i was SO EXCELL
restaurant in Chicago is a sludge den, and the salads are ever so simple. Which I suppose is a good thing, considering we have here a few times.  He comes with a go-to steaming cup, but I really love his ice cream the whole time.  A little pricey, but I've stopped by all the time.
Best food in town  so far. Keep going!
Love this place. I'm so bummed that they are still walking fast.I have always been to Chicago Fried Chicken from time to time...it is not the best chicken in the city, but the owner is good at that. Great service, very expensive to get from the corner. Prices are good but not worth the $2.50 charge.
Delicious!!! every bite is fresh, I give my food 3 stars for the wonderful side dishes  in the traditional Blackstrap chicken salad and all my favorite meats. I loved this place. I will definitely come back
restaurant, quiet, and memorable. It's a long drive from the wonderful neighborhood neighborhood, but it's worth it.
Salcador's has a wonderful salad bar and water. The owner called to say something and he was not always so nice but he handled it very well. We paid $50 for the grape salad bar with the chicken. The waiter was a generous gentleman and he made every bite memorable with the five unique salads he placed on top of each other.The food was very good. Our waiter asked if we had prepared a topping for our salad, and she suggested yuca. We came away with 6 tacos, which are definitely worth the try. The service is incredible. Our food was really good. The party had a large sample size and we had a very good meal, for a small price. They even got a "energy drink" which they made to help our recovery from stress. My only reservation was with my friend, however she won't be back!
restaurant was by far my favorite part of this restaurant. We had a picnic at the bar and were absolutely blown away by the service and generous portions.  Good name, wonderful atmosphere with beautiful food and exceptional service, has been going strong for over two years!  I would definetely go back, enjoy this place again and should not miss the restaurant!
Went here for breakfast and came across this terrible table made from fake Thai napkins.  The quality is fantastic and they also brought me a table which I wanted to order for birthday tea. I'm impressed by how their food is on the affordable side.The only downside I have is this place is only 4 stars. For example, I would have to pass on this dessert and would buy a bigger glass of wine for a date with my younger boyfriend.
I am a huge big fan of European cuisine and I always go to Francesca for dessert here (with the exception of the second reason I didn't like it
restaurant. Although there were several other refrains here, I went with the big star for most things...except -the Onion Bowl.  Apparently, you should be afraid of people over 13 who have been there. The only thing worse than this was probably the basket with the just desserts and beer glass. After walking down the street and finally bumping into my mother, she said I couldn't wait to eat at her restaurant.  Her conversation wasn't pleasant.I heard everything that was said, and I was confused and confused.  Then I saw that they were open.  I didn't hear anything at all, but still nothing, so I asked her if I could give it another try.  From that point on, the server used up all of her time and hard drink.  Then she said she was fine.  Well, she gave up some of her service and really didn't take care of anything, but she basically said that she would just pick up the
restaurant is all I could tell you about it (it's sooooooooooo good, yet it really is so much better than the others).  The decor looks classy.  It looks the part of a big bad brewery, with an amazing downtown pizza place (obviously), but overall the place is awesome.  I haven't had the Chils order of pizza...but am sitting there now knowing what's the deal...God knows what it must be!!
I was already hesitant about going because it was our second anniversary and I didn't like the delivery. The restaurant was busy, but not annoying. Also, although my wife was a guest, we needed to eat elsewhere. It was too much for our liking to pass. But she was so welcoming that she was so glad we got our food.  However, I would still order the la carte appetizer, which wasn't very good, but didn't taste like it was coming from Chicago.  It seemed like a
restaurant, available for breakfast at $12.45, is limited in our senses of what a place like this is.  It's a bit of a buy at a place with some consistent greatness in restaurants.  We've been to a lot of little places and have been to so many different locations over the years.  I guess its a little easier to say the same thing on the street though.  I feel the ice cream is worth it though.
We haven't been here in a while, but since then it has not been over the top.  With this place we really enjoyed this meal, so we went for lunch.  We enjoyed the garden basket filled with water, pasta, and potatoes.  So yeah, it is definitely worth the trip and I wouldn't recommend getting another one if you can't enjoy your meal here.
I live in Bristol so I never really expected anything like this, but I do hope to try more places to get drunk and eat
restaurant, will work. The bill includes the dinner and beer, which are fairly priced. If you want to pay for such entrees at CL, I suggest going to Main Street Bakery and trying a nice small bottle of lamb neck with porter mushrooms (they're great!), platters of meat on the sandwich, rice and cabbage salad (yes, their egg sandwiches will be incredibly good, too), soups and salads, and ground beef. (They make beers, sure?)
One of my favorite spots in the neighborhood. I loved this place, especially for a food coma. The atmosphere was really friendly and the service was exceptional. The unique pizzas were very tasty, though the food was not usually to standard fare.
A wonderful place. Been here 3 or 4 times. Got seated at about the same time as the regulars. Crispy and all up priced, the pizza was perfect for a party. It also did not disappoint. Service was superb, and did not
restaurant is two of the best I've ever had! We've done this a dozen times here and again on Davenport. We payed $25+ for service; it was not worth it. We don't like taking business friends here, but you can make an impression when they're looking for dinner. All this good food is beautiful, and we will go back and try more. Hope you enjoy the whole experience!
It's as if the city's last was remembered forever by the only time a hipster bartender had to close a restaurant. When lunchtime rolls around, the most important part of every meal at Jittery Bar will be the food. Jittery Bar is the place to go for lunch and dinner. Best of all, it's on us! The cocktails and pizza are fantastic, especially the Pastry Sandwich in the Summertime rotation. And if you've never had anything like it at Jittery Bar, now is your chance. Try it
restaurant at Fox 15.
When the apartment comes open-to-the-outside is a little quieter, it's worth waiting in line.
While it is loud for my parents and I, it isn't that loud at this place. My grandparents had a noisy Christmas party and my Dad usually was the one who lived at the friendlier spot in his residence.
If you ever want to be trendy, this is the place. The decor is basically the same but there is a lot more space. The food is great, though. I feel there are few tables on the rooftop of the room and it would definitely be nice if we could get in and out by taking a cab. It is very cool on the weekends, but the music is loud and some of it being from across the street which has a big feel to it. They put us at dinner now (one of the only places to get that standard). Definitely worth the $$!
Food is much better than I
restaurant was excellent, they put excellent service and I had the steak entree with the lime blossom sauce. Yes I had the shrimp, shrimp and dumplings but you just get the shrimp that was the best part. I will definitely be back if there is a more frequent steak dinner.
Two moustaches. Big surprise. I went there just before the first Monday of February and it was horrible. There was a wait for 45 minutes. The line was huge and hard to get the wait person to let it be. I was so disappointed as we couldn't get a seat before 6. At that time the  waiter wanted to leave us seated and forced us to wait 45 minutes in order to get a new table, he said. It took 45 mins for the girl to leave and he told us that we would have to wait 45 minutes for his table and then just leave? I asked how could he get a table on his own if he were the bartender and then had
restaurant to sit before and after my husband and I sat. I had planned to order some appetizers and place them in a salad bar because I thought I would not be hungry to sit for a dinner dinner while dining. Then I realized I was not paying for my salad bar. The salad bar definitely is not necessary because the server is very attentive, but it was very filling. The sauces were great and the gourds were fantastic. The appetizers were not what I anticipated and the portions were very generous and delicious. I will definitely be back!
really good food.  eat here for lunch if you get a visit early 
I've been visiting Bisbee since the 1970s, when my mom was here, and I always have the memory of Chicago's first black Market. My cousins lived in Chicago, and now there's nothing like the Chicago style of good food on a city block. I love the duck king tenderloin. A side dish that melts you cold
restaurant, and sign us up for your lot!  Time is telling that this place has definitely received rave reviews for the past few months.
This is a great night off for some good pizza, but the reason why I'm doing it this way is because my wife ordered the fajitas soup but it only came with coconut coconut oil cheese pasta (a food horrible in the traditional sense of the word) and was absolutely knocked down. We then had to wait 25 minutes, whereupon the doorbell rang again, it was the exact same bell you are used to hearing in restaurants nowadays, but this time it was a broken glass.  Not just a piece of glass, BUT a broken glass.  A black metal cup of espresso they were refilling for us.  Was it because they forgot to refill it, or perhaps just because I was sitting in a hot bar, trying to get by while they refilled?
Horses and a partner for a reason! Service
restaurant, her husband does not return our call. Nothing from the manager, manager or the manager's side of it is sent or delivered to her. He did not return our call. It is going to be worse.
The waiter has a spicy staff style menu and the chicken is going to be full and crowded as of right now. Overall it is a bit pricey but still ok, the food is excellent.
To start, The server pulled the address from the bill. These house-made pizzas are quite bland at best, especially for their cheese on top. As such the waitress said she waited about 15 minutes and decided that as well as setting their own guest list (as has happened in years), the pizzas would only be served at 8:30. She didn't know what was going on behind that menu. I would certainly pay to see if this server does not care about the quality of our pizzas. You can't tell the owner what pizzas is even
restaurant: The Eddy's Cafe Is alive and well, you'll get the pick-me-up service, when you don't have to go to your dinner spot to see it (they're pretty light, don't bother). And of course, the desserts are great - I don't mind waiting for a spot because they feel friendly. Tasting notes: The interior and back patio have great views of the city in the morning and afternoon. The food is nothing you'd expect from an Italian restaurant... but for the price, you should definitely try it. Recommended: everything a little pricey and leftovers also well worth it!
Super darn good Italian food - great casual atmosphere and great wait staff. We love it at 10 pm because of the pretzel flavor. The house special version is dessert here, unlike the Churro Spicy Tempeh - to which I will be going in two rounds! Excellent drinks & great selection.
This place is a staple for the
restaurant's space is a unique experience and the atmosphere and decor is ideal. Even though we're used to being downtown and taking in certain restaurants in the town, we went with our three girls and it was a great atmosphere with some great people in there as well.The fish and chips were a little out of whack. Oh I'm sorry, but I was thinking that you guys need to order specials for free food while you're there because you are going to just be like old school duck hockey -- only with big fish! The walleye was just awful. It's not common for women to eat as many items as there are fish in it, but it was actually worth it for that. There are 9 lobster rolls, so I really didn't care much about the quality. The meat was delicious, but unfortunately the drinks weren't of the quality we were craving. Anyway, of course, the portion count here was only over 1,000 for a roll, but it was
restaurant opened its doors on my birthday.  After a quick visit, it opened the door and was immediately impressed with what it presented.  The food was excellent, the service was slow and even the oysters were extremely salty (very cheap).  It didn't hurt to have a go for a date at the bar and be right back.  Thank you, Calostrada! 
I've been coming to Nicca for over a year and have NEVER heard of them. I've never wanted to go to this place... I'm sure most of you already know this and you haven't eaten here before, but then again they don't have it on the menu. Don't pass this place up...the people are not even reviewing reviews and you get treated like garbage!
Yum! I love this place!! All around the area are great and everyone gets along great. Everytime I eat at my favorite restaurant, the manager comes up to me and gives me his
restaurant - cheap place to drink beer...NOT bad... OR BAD!  That's OK with me...  All of those diners we brought at the park were unprofessional and to the point that I was completely embarrassed.  Then, we decided to start working on our community, but let it be known that we would do this work together!We wanted to make sure we had enough time for this group to relax and have some decent time with us, but sadly, the musicians were really down and we just couldn't make the effort...I couldn't hear anything. We had the tripe and the handkerchiefs too, we had the shoes too, but nobody said anything...its up to each of us to take the time to taste each of the things that we tried.  If it wasn't for the other musicians, I would have gone back to it again and get a glass of water (we were all dissapointed - because we were so intoxicated) and
restaurant. We had the ceviche, my wife made a massive mushroom stew and the alligator steak.  Loved it! It was great! However, if you're not a salad bar lover, you may want to change the tune. The waiter is your friend!  Anytime I go to his place I'm treated like a neighbor.  The food isn't too high end either.  Plus, you can't go wrong with the baguette too.  Anytime I can get away with something from him I'm super-happy!
I read the Yelp reviews and immediately gave it 5 stars.  I called in line a few minutes before we got there and in about an hour there were at least 3.  It's by far one of my favorite places in Chicago!We went there for a party.  The ambiance was delicious and they are loud.  One of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever been to! I haven't come back
restaurant may consider getting involved, especially at a summer carnival or a birthday party where crowds come to enjoy the best food.
very cheap and simple all about location and fantastic atmosphere great deal
Just enjoyed a go-go meal! We've been to this restaurant before and both times it was the food was incredible! My boyfriend and I also took in several guest chefs who took time to give us their suggestions on how they cooked. Here are the dishes we ate and what we liked. They absolutely love those things!
It was really good food, but not worth the money
I don't have a real word to describe it! I cannot justify that I need to go there to sample a vial of the bean potting mix. The names alone just leave a sour taste. The menu is very limited in my opinion and these sandwiches are not authentic to what we find inside and also remind us of busy years when we stopped going here as it was constantly closed. I simply do
restaurant., catering is great and they have high ceilings and good tasting meat like chile paste, venison or mac and cheese. Besides good food and a wide selection of seafood, I like being able to get a late lunch, and the wings are pretty good too. Service is friendly and attentive. Since I haven't had any problem it seems really nice of them to get the grill laid.
Owe it was great. $25.00 for some great pork ribs from the list. Was right! The meat was scrumptious, and nothing crazy. You'll definitely be getting into Shaw to enjoy the panorama view, and the hot coke is tasty. Some of the best BBQ I've had, and will probably be coming back.
Awesome place to eat for breakfast, brunch, or an after dinner special. I have just tried it out and it has all kinds of great meals - so much so that I can't stop eating.  It's just
restaurant is obviously not from Chicago.  Not that there is an appetite out there for it.  But we could change the crowd to more casual dining than the usual stewardesses.  This would be great as the food gets to the point of having a special combination of value - brunch, dinner - whatever, and this would be the best the place has to offer.
I took a 7-day woman there with me for lunch, with my friend (who also makes delivery all of the time) coming to pick it up. She said, "I will definitely come back. Thanks G'night, don't forget to call ahead because it's going to be closed in about 15 minutes." She then showed me the sign, was a tourist and said, "We've been here 3 days and there's another child here. They'll be getting the burritos as well, so I'll be glad to come back." The customer service staff was friendly and very helpful,
restaurant restaurant which will cost you $9 - $12 dollars. Now if you want full service, you must choose it as that, but if you want a buffet dessert or waffles, you must order one of the three desserts. For $14 (for dessert menu)  they have no doubt in mind the same should have come in earlier - that menu! If you have other needs, that is about $30 for 1 person and that is not a good deal.  For all of the school friends' worries about what will happen if I am not home, I understand the cost of anything I order, but I'm willing to pay more for a reservation in a crowded place.As for restaurants, I don't like those more than a $10 bill, but they serve lots of food. I recommend something called Sprout's Chicken, and I have always been a vegetarian, and this little pot in the rear where you get veggies for about $2.90 may be the
restaurant opening tonight, they were not so bad. We order here!
First thing I want to tell anyone is that they DO NOT have enough alcohol to go around, otherwise they could've been delivering at their fabulous parking lot. If you haven't tried their  Barry I highly recommend checking it out. This place is definitely worth checking out, and it is definitely worth trying. They have only 10 cocktails on tap which they usually have several o'clock on.  They also have a sparkling tap wine section with good prices, which you have to try if you don't want to try another one of their locations. I have heard good things about this place, but when I first visited this place, I had never met such people before! They served a wide variety of food and drinks and they have a ton of great features! The food is great and everything is freshly prepared to satisfy your needs. They also have one of the most limited portions in town, which can be an
restaurant Artichoke adds lots of flavor to the night out. My friend took my order from the kitchen counter and I chose Tortaro. Had the crab and beans and chocolate chip cookie cut fries. I also had the beef burger and fries with salmon and toast. The mac & cheese came in the 6-9 portions and the pretzel fries. The fish burger was good enough to have you drooling and hungry. The margaritas and the tortas were wonderful. The tortas were all bite-sized and had rice on each side. The sauces were great as well. Service and prices.
I recently decided to come to Pigre on Sunday night after being so excited to finally get to visit a really great place.  A rather small restaurant, this Pigre offers excellent food, a really great ambiance and a great place for a friend's anniversary party.  The experience was nothing short of phenomenal, especially for my meal.  Everything was wonderful.  The bartender
restaurant. Thank you SO much Spiceworks!!  I will be back again.
I had the Brie and Chili pizza at their opening here.  The bun came with lettuce, tomato, onion, beans and all kinds of mushrooms... not too exotic in my book but satisfying! The wine list was decent, but the service was strange and left many questions.  The whiskey list was nice but there was no chance they could turn my questions into juice.  Definitely this place should be expanded by Nana's
Went here in the spring and had the best ceviche I have had.   Don't be fooled, you can spend $50 and go into the bar and wait.  The attentive wait staff is always there.   We love their seasonal specials, and their specials were always delicious.  Your server is attentive and to your own taste, and dishes are always much less expensive than others.  Even a few bottles of wine from the bar just

Hey all! So, have you ever wanted to come to my birthday party and plan something that has become so trendy? You want to try something they will save you from their next binge. Here's what you can expect at B&R's East: We live downtown. They have a huge parking lot, and it gets pretty crowded. There's not much room for three people when we go, but the food is delicious. They even have a catwalk, which is nice because you can actually see all the outside lots/scenery at night. They have food booths, which we've yet to have, and the music is good. The place has some pretty staid things too, but it's alright. The place also has a nice backdrop, so you can see the floor all night.I have been here a lot before, and it seems pretty authentic.
restaurant?
I can't tell you what a highly recommended place in the city.  And yes, we have the impression that the bookend seats are made of traditional European staples, but these are pretty lucky seats.  Everything about the food is just fantastic, especially their fresh and raw cabbage...no tomatoes etc.  It's almost as good as some of the rest of the tacos (This one comes with watermelon (bi style), lemongrass taco, mojito.se, and more), but seriously, we cannot go wrong with the food either.  I've had the Noodles and once, they were the only reason that I took my food home.  I never bother to make reservations, but only for this unique experience.  I will not be going back.
We just made the complaint about the food.  We complained to multiple diners on Sunday (1) because the parking lot was poor (2).  The worst part was
restaurant, I don't know about you guys, but I try not to waste my time ordering from these guys.  You have great food and atmosphere, and the service is fantastic.  However, if you order the salad bar, it's pretty good. I think you have to try the beer selection here.  Myself and 3 of the family have tried the appetizer.  The chain restaurant selection is pretty good too.There are many other options. The authentic, premium, and traditional options make this place one of the best places you can get in Chicago.  When you eat, you will find authentic pieces that were never tasted before and make you feel welcome in a very intimate and tasty environment.  Try the caesar salad bar or the empanadas, or other fajitas, which are really tasty.  Everything in this place is always in great hands.
I love that I was spoiled.  I take my kids and our little brother every Friday night
restaurant and service (sorry, have not found this place yet but there are some nice places in the city), plus I can't wait to come back! I'm sure I won't be back...
The sushi and ambiance here are nice, as well as the service and food. They have some great options such as the Chicken Pot rolls...which you can share with a friend or for dinner. I've been to Bo Tabak many times, and there's always a warm spot to see the highlights of the dish.
Thanks for my order. I went in from Seattle. When we walked in I got the package.  Im going to give it a 5 star for this!   We actually waited in line for 5 hours to receive our table, instead of the wait they were able to get and order, we were seated.  Our waiter actually says, he walked us back there...at least 15 minutes later when we were left at the last moment in line.
restaurant on Broadway."


The waiter brought us out with big plates and rolled out the fish. The server explained that we were going to order at their counter but later changed our mind, but he said that we had a $20 ticket. We were good friends, and the waiters were good. They stood by to let us know when the counter would be open and we would be able to get back home. They did not bother with us and had great customer service.All in all, I think there are too many men who look like they work at Sears, perhaps they have no place in suburban working people's lives anymore.
Myths are that steakhouse is in some kind of false light (often about chicken and pork chops) due to the danger of rodents at the table. This is most likely also an understatement, as others have pointed out as well. The smell of their chicken will consistently appear on the skin and the meats will come off with no noticeable residue

I've had the Mahoujo Taki for several years now. It's something I've been trying for several years now.  I've never had problems with the environment and service of the place.  However, the owner is VERY rude.  I've had the chefy unadorned impression he had an extensive staff that was not satisfied by what he was receiving.  If the place is truly amazing, it must be the owner.  I cannot tell if he is trying to entertain guests (or to make money) just as he was trying to do with the sushi.  The menu is not much different.  The crab fries, which came with the box of spices (denim).  These are very good.  My friend told me the atmosphere is the best.  She was pleasantly surprised at the service
restaurant side of the river - i had to eat once in a while but the sauce was good - and the shrimp combo was great too - the oil and cheese was just ok. So most dishes on the menu was white and were meant to be - dish exceeded my expectations. Perhaps those are not part of the dining experience, but it is very interesting when there is enough space - well in that the menu changes up every time you eat. Highly recommend!
In my opinion, this place is a plus, as you have to come here on an average weekday at least to grab the day's bus fare and take one of the tiny more expensive self-publishing startups. They do have a monthly fee to book the bus, though, so you need to go for lunch. The bus takes about half an hour (you probably need to leave early because the parking lot is reserved; because I live about five blocks away). I've never had a bad experience there, and you can grab
restaurant I was able to eat my breakfast and lunch (w=1 cheese truffle) for $14. The prices had mostly improved over the months, but price in the long run is still prohibitive for great tasting food.
I love the popcorn dish, but they take a couple of seconds on it to fill up.  I don't like splashing it on my dinner plate like that, but the popcorn ate 4-6 pounds of that every bite!  This place was decent enough, but that's not usually what I want for such an expensive place.
Wonderful place to eat on the weekends.Great margaritas, warm pizzas, tortas, guacamole and fresh homemade bread. You get how nice the food was without mentioning the waiters, like we were always waiting 45 minutes, and there's no guarantee it will be good enough for all of our server's customers. If you like a late night food craving, and that's just
restaurant, open 4pm (No food, though in past years the menu has changed)
The biggest sports bar I've been to in Chicago has become an hour-and-a-half away.  The owner.  I LOVE their food and service.  Their BYOB is a touchy one, especially considering they have a loud early start.  In the end, I would never go back!
I love the Bakery Grove, it's the best decor and service I've ever had. In my opinion they make their sandwiches tastiest. They have a great sandwich rack which fits under your burger, dip, etc....I always order some salads and appetizers at the back table. Their deep dish burger is GREAT!Best burger EVER!Gotta go now!!!!
really good service and good food. my friend and I went here for a party, just for a quick meal and have been waiting for years for another fantastic place to serve us! Just the right
restaurant. All excellent service.
I've always liked my Thai Lao.  I've always been impressed by it, especially the soup which is easily portioned.  The staff is terrific and helpful.  Their fries (in delicious oil) can be fairly pricey but with enough extras it's worth a try.
It's been quite the few times we've had Mexican food at the Hot Door.  We have recommended it to a few of our friends (after talking to Mexican food expert Rick Miles) and he mentioned having a huge cedar red taco sauce.  Upon entering, it was the deli you needed (and only 20 min, as our server at the counter told us!) so the taco sauce arrived a little too early and far away from the chicken or chicken breast.  I never had any trouble at all knowing what the size of the dish was or cooking it!  Since the salad dressing is about half as good as the regular corn tortilla the salsa
restaurant hot pizza with everything from the wood-fired chicken wing to the sweet olives.  I've had amazing variations from it, so I hope this review has helped.  I know it's a little confusing, but if you are looking for a killer hot pizza, there is nowhere else to go!
What's a pork chop to do? The here is one of the most popular and deep dish and true Chicago success stories. Our meal was a beautiful meal worth bringing in. The meat was amazing from the bone marrow from one of the steak fryers we snagged on Tuesday night. After the dinner we waited in the front row seating for our table to cool down and they opened up. The service was wonderful, customer service was great and dining room staff was friendly. I would definitely be back again and I highly recommend your friends!
They have a wonderful dinner place.  Love the dining room and menu.  They need to get reorganized.

restaurant and light sushi with two packages of signature dishes and a vast assortment of appetizers for $9. Service was impeccable and the service was outstanding (both within reasonable and reasonable times, depending on your tastes).
I love this place.  The romantic atmosphere is good, the food has excellent ingredients, and the complimentary wine is superb.  The brunch place is great too!  Try the vegan side of the dinner menu, and at least try to get some!
this place is HUGE! everything is big, the dishes are big and the prices are a lot. but overall a really decent restaurant, one of those for parties that be nerved along the wide route, being a gem
they are in the priciest condo in the city! do not go in in the snow for the check they give you if you miss that part... just put your shoes on and wind down!  2 friends were so drunk and there was a lot of scratch on our door that was
restaurant/body wash medium should be served as much of a treat. Overall the food was delicious.
This place is fun. We love it! We started eating here last weekend night with a fan and were all very pleased. There are many amazing courses, drink specials, TVs to let you know what you are doing, and menu items to choose from. We don't mind that service is horrible, but the reason they are great is that they are constantly updated and changed. Staff is so nice! It's hard to get into Yolk's without a reservation, so please make sure you order before you go. If your a drink drinker, it's also recommended. We went for breakfast only because we were bored and had to make reservations, so we tried something else and were reminded that the brunch was closed so we would probably be sitting the whole night. Service is friendly, without a doubt, and only needs to be maintained on a week night. The drinks and pizza are
restaurant-equipped concept.  In reality they don't feel very generous towards tourists or visitors who pay a visit and instead consider it a shopping experience which doesn't do the service the large restaurant enjoys on most days of the year.  Not that it should.  The other reason they are closed down, though, is their service.  It is ridiculous.  The chef, and others are put in charge of each part of the space, not the service level.  Some chefs don't like their crepes and it's just not the right dining experience for the palate.  We sat in the kitchen for about two hours without any food or other staff, nothing to see, other than us, a few of the people standing at the bar.  I am pretty sure my waiter came right out of our check.
My husband and I are both too tired and want to take him home. However, this restaurant is just gross. Maybe I can stick to my schedule, and
restaurant location is incredibly popular and I am always checking out some more at Aldo and Moana, but I prefer to leave off the bar menu to enjoy the food. The salads are fantastic with the broccolini, mushroom kabobs and lemongrass... even the arugula, which is more of a risotto. I am always a fan of their cakes and ice cream... the vegan side is just amazing. It is very downbeat and will never leave you disappointed!!
Fresh fish, homemade butter, and pork belly are my favorite in Chicago. I hate wings, but I really enjoy this place! I live off a reservation that we'd never really had before. And finally, the music that every server wanted was everything to be quite right. I can't wait to continue to order from tonight after all the attention my Diner has paid to that decor.
Shrimp is rich and very much authentic. I love this place. I could come back once
restaurant/terrible food. I should have known better. One of the most outrageous scenes to ever eat in a restaurant was the simple decision to drop the temperature down to 35 degrees and order an offsite meal that literally became an opportunity to practice to not over drink. The wait was daunting; all you had to do was bring your phone to my door with a pitcher of hot water and they would not come back to refill it. I'd love to have a nice end to this new experience, but I wouldn't be here if the place wasn't so ridiculous. Don't believe me? Check out the above photo or take a close look at the menu (or maybe check out our delicious food section).
Goons offsite for a week before being able to leave and enjoy the deep fried okra while your sitting at the bar to relax. The  tastes even more amazing than the food, the meat. For the price they charge, and much more on tip, this place
restaurant, we ordered the slow seasonal Korean brunch at the patio. We went with 2 glasses of beer, red red was our starter.
this is the best place in Lakeview for classic Korean fusion. nothing else is great and I love that I can go there more often!
even though I live in a town with low oil prices, I can't even say I was wrong to try this place. one of the other reviews i got was all the way out of the way bad for korean food.cheap and family friendly ambiance with meating, smiling and fun.andthe restaurant is BYOB so they're very comfortable. they also have dessert that's highly inventive and unique.the staffs are very friendly and often every once in a while we'll see them and get together to talk or make a meal for the guys.always ask if they have a bus to carry you to work because the vendors just don't like moving houses!
Wonderful Little Cow
restaurant, plus a background in art.
After viewing these photos, I am not quite sure what to say about this place. My expectations were generally that it should be a wine tasting house, but these photos left me wondering if they were re-designed. The interior was a little out of place, with only somewhat bright lighting. Unfortunately, the food that I sampled lacked the thick sauces I would have needed, but the chilis were far from that strange variety of pork cutlets I often visit for my daily meals. The worst part was that the atmosphere was very polite at times, but made up for the ridiculous music and large portions. For a beer pairing, the most we got was sublime. I had a plump coleslaw with a delicious red cabbage and a raspberry pomegranate crust, and it was mediocre. For dinner, I would have liked a small glass of wine but I was not at all enthralled with the whole thing.I would have
restaurant/antique seating at a romantic atmosphere.The food and service isn't great, though there are tons of fine wines and some of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I love being outside for lunch, but I guess you just gotta be nice and chill.The service was great, very friendly. Some of my favorite dishes were being served at Chef Shaun Butcher (who has been a stellar chef in NYC). That aside, being Chicago, I could see why they selected this place. It is a bakery, and the chef would love to know where my ingredients come from. Otherwise they all have to carry a lot of saltiness and fussing around with location.I always love being on the South side of city. If you can see the South Side from one side of Chicago all the way down, you can get a great night of glassy goodness. Service was great, friendly people could help you with things and meals to pick up.There is always something to be said
restaurant charges and then we ordered another hamburger. We ordered the chicken shoulder and the steak.... & followed up with some fries.We did not know at this point that the salad bar was full and we did not understand why they didn't give us a reservation for an appetizer.  We could not believe the disappointment at our table as we got even more expensive.  On the other hand, we had no problem dining to entertain our party! We are both addicted to good food.  Our two share a dine room.  But after a meal, its like, "please, just don't charge us".  Heide had mentioned that she would be unhappy with this.  There was no place open that month but Chicago is still pushing the effort of not charging employees & employees for their first hour of service.  Maybe it was better not to put employees in charge because the customers tend to be  both predictable and educated.  They need to go somewhere else for breakfast
restaurant from my trip.
Loved it so much I had to give it 5 stars. Service was horrible and very sloppy.
This place is amazing! I had to see everyone to give me their time for what they expected me to eat. Everything was well prepared, everything was delicious and the service was fantastic. The food was amazing and even though the other customers were staying late and my ribs were cold, they never got the spicy potatoes I requested. The chicken was good but a little dry. I also ordered the swish. Their sausages are small portions with delicious tasting sauces. The slices were decent but I liked the hamburger portions because it was slightly larger. I don't think that would have made it any better.
Great great food, awesome atmosphere.
If you're in the area, you'll probably not be disappointed. If you're coming from out of town, you'll probably miss the strawberry jam alone. However, if you're going there for
restaurant Yuca - easy to find. The martini is amazing. Flavor and toppings are abundant. Everything in this great menu is loaded with huge bite and tasty flavor.
Horrible...Chorizo was a server and wait staff's worst part was that they do not seem to care about what people order...good tacos, guac and guac toast for $6, $6 to go so no cake and cake...No brazilian ganache, no poccatos... in fact, they haven't even created a BOT to eat brazilian grape...brazilian goat cheese...some Mexican BBQ (I'm no expert, but sure from what I've heard above the place was cooked good that way). However in the end it was well worth it (I gave it 4/5 because it was close to my best brother's house), if there's a chance he could stick to it that won't be a huge problem for the rest of

I decided to come to the bar this afternoon. In the back seat and have a drink, though it's pretty decent, I don't see much difference in taste. First off, I am a sucker for vintage white beers (!) and there's a big selection of beer on the menu. I am not used to getting hot tapas and cheap wine, but it's hard to resist. I'm hungry here, and it's all back to tradition, so if you don't like waiting, you're just complaining about being a 'credible customer' that you don't enjoy you coffee. Also, I have to admit that I have a special liking for Chi Chi where they
restaurant' burrito. I would not recommend this place to anyone who is not vegan. I am also not a huge carnivore but I enjoyed a good bean burrito there for breakfast! Check it out in front of our condominium.
Love it here. They put an awesome macaroni and cheese combo on top. Food is great! Prices are reasonable too, but the atmosphere is always lively. This place offers so much more.
I went to this location for brunch for breakfast, and this is the first time I have been here again. I ordered a couple of people, and I think they all liked it. I went to check in with a friend and she asked me what's the deal with you ordering desserts? I said sorry (the servers were rude) and she said don't order her food unless it's in her hand. She couldn't get a word out on whether my order was my dessert, but she had been telling me that I needed a smile
restaurant only for the rich, rich drinks (wonderful cocktails), great ambiance, and always great service. I'd never run out of beer at One Gate. Then again, this is back when we got our reservation, I suppose because it was definitely worth it.
I've been to Chocolate Chip Cookie Butter Highlighter about 5 times and never have the experience any less perfect. They make a tasty version on the reservations as well.  I had the deviled eggs that came with the fries. My dog, later in the meal, remembered the delivery man as his father. What a disappointment! He ordered a champagne glass, milk chocolate cheese, vinegar, peanuts and nuts. Everything had to be taken out before we could get there, at around 7pm. I didn't have time to have anything left to eat. I'm sure it's because they have to wait for the final price to be determined. I was especially disappointed with the overall experience, service was amazing
restaurant and      entrees (pronounced...      if i lived in the city i would call it foody because of the number of dishes served).    I have been to the Palace and had a great time.   The kids in my party do not bother about that.   I can tell from my experience that our waiter is a really nice guy and will never do anything to turn a young girl away from the restaurant.   I think his just cheated on us and he knows the price.   My own room took me a little over an hour to be seated and there were not many places like this in town so I stopped by Palace and placed an order.   After waiting a little while I was told that the crab fillet from the sushi bar was dropped on the plate and that everyone was paying $30.   It's quite a bargain for what you get out of Palace.   We also
restaurant, by far the best in Chicago.

Highly recommended! I never go back again.

Best Pecan pie ever! They send their cashier a tip to remind him that you should pay a tip and are definitely not honest!
I came here and thought I would write a review on the food, the atmosphere, and the service.  I did not think I'd come across a single thing wrong.  Not just weird, but fun.  They have gotten to my house from a variety of options (including brocco's and donuts, which are great for special occasions), so the drinks, steak dinners, and drinks are always fun to try.  This place is an absolute must in Chicago.  Awesome place to find a way to satisfy yourself during work.  They don't have the attitude or management of the pied piper, so maybe that's for the worst.  The staff is friendly and helpful, and they make
restaurant at Ennis Dining and it is amazing that his other restaurants are close by so you can get it at the pub if you want to get a taste of what life is like on the planet. If you don't eat anywhere else, this is the place to try.
My friend and I waited for 45 minutes at Ennis Dining for our dinner.  First thing we saw there was on the bar itself: new window.  Great atmosphere, and not overpriced as I often give you restaurants that are quite upscale.  We then sat down at the bar and got a drink at the bar while watching the crowd.  As soon as we left, I knew it was ready for an even better experience, but was we disappointed?  We will not go back and want to wait outside with our friends if the parking is so bad that they'll not park nearby or since the all-you-can-eat food is a giant block away.  And, unfortunately
restaurant, dessert, night, or weekend dinner? Best of all...you're going to find the place where you're expecting the best, you're going to find the best together. So feel like your deliciousness must have elevated you. The food is delicious, but not consistently spectacular. It is a combination of the meal and the night.  Try it out and eat out.
Cheese and meat is always a plus. Overpriced and not worth the wait.
This is the only place on the leftovers list I have ever come across who just can't stop loving you.  This is the place to pick up your trip away from the bland and soupy noodles and the gourd mannes.  If you love a dirty soup, this is your place.  Try this place!
Lunch really was the most enjoyable thing I have ever experienced, especially since i went with my husband on the evening of May 3rd.  Everyone was always extremely nice
restaurant and retail joint.  I recommend the under-15s only.They are vegetarian, though it still tastes a little fussy to me, but if you order something like beans and vegetables it is really delicious.  They make great yumminess and nice smoothies too, but I would pay an extra $10.99 for a half cup of food on top of what they charge for the salad bar!
One of the best restaurants in Chicago!! I love this place so much that I've had a vacation for one and forgot about it.  They eat a decent of sides, and they have a pretty great salad bar as well!  It's a great place to make reservations or just have a party while in the mood for a table.  But thats all.  The service is great.  But the salad bar is really small and the quality is simply not high enough to warrant decent reviews.  The food is lacking to mention, of course. 
restaurant service and the service is excellent! If you haven't tried this, tell us what you want!The Fish-chicken does on demand and their chocolate bar is AMAZING. They cooked all their fish on my kitchen-fired hot tapioca beans. Their crusted sea bass is your meal, no matter how you slice it. The desserts are yummy, their sampler of salted caramel and their crepe-friendly strawberries are the ultimate treat!  The decor can also be customized for your fancy style of play.
Now this is sort of like Spam! Once you walk into the door, you're sitting in, well, a party of 5. The baristas are very professional, they have you "observe" on the bill and add in whatever you want. One of the patrons is in her 40's, was a hot girl who was working at Walgreens and never wanted to spend 20 bucks. The owner was a bit angry
restaurant house 'The Tripler'
great value and fabulous food.
Overpriced...no good...not great for a "Good Looking" restaurant
*There are more prices than you can shake a rock at!*Good beer selection is lacking.
Delicious decor and food is presented in perfect form. The range of dishes is reasonable priced.
Saw both recipes. His Fat West Mac and his Other Must-Go Mac were both incredible. The Blue Mushroom Chicken was amazing. A favorite since I was a kid. My friend said it was better for dog, two days later. So I gave him the thumbs up, ate it as quick as I could and wrote about it on my friends blog...all thoughts are just off and wish they had wanted meat.
I had the gluten free pies too. I want to go back.
delicious, though it's not the world wide peanut butter and jelly cheese pizza you think it is in heaven!Thanks Kool
restaurant choices with quality seafood/oxtail offerings. We've been to the premiere of Neapolitan pizza/braised meats and I can't wait to see them at Steakies. Fiume is also providing other local exclusive items including the very special 4drinks and tiaras. They have their own beer garden that attracts more than 50 different type of beer aficionados.
San Francesco is a true gem in California.It's an authentic Italian restaurant with many exciting dishes which is one of the reasons why I have found Mastro their perfect match for everyone who needs a good Italian, whether on or off the cusp of a visit. We had the babb and amazing menu which were all highly enjoyable and and very tasty! My friend and I were disappointed that the place was listed as the new "Biological Food Choice" this time of year but the cuisine we were enticed by was so fresh and delicious that I'm certain they will definitely return
restaurant and local chain—very impressed with this thing! They were close and they were AWESOME!  The casual atmosphere was a perfect match for what they do in store.
I haven't been to kettles for almost three years. I love their rolls. My friend and I are having a nice time here. The wings are delicious and the vegetables are excellent. The sandwiches are definitely more than that! They have Persian salad, tofu, raw cabbage, gyros and an assortment of homemade soup dishes. They have lots of small plates that are large enough to fit the 3rd level as well as the 3rd level. The patio is ample with a beautiful candle-lit chandelier and with lavender candles. The service is amazing and they seem to be as friendly as you will get at Zato Roast. From simple to extraordinary they get you the sauces you have had before. This place isn't for everyone and you will definitely have to wait more than a
restaurant
This is another massive hot dog joint that is an absolute delight! The people that service us know exactly what they are doing; they are so gracious. The staff is always laughing and joking and their waiter always smiles and touches up the type of food we enjoy.We are delighted to have been given a place close to us when I went to Chicago to try Pinocchio and Antony's (which I've been craving at least once in my life, since I went there on a Saturday evening). I will definitely go back as well.
great food! great atmosphere and service. ambiance is great...the cocktail menu changes everyday so if you are in mood you can have a great night with the Bourbon de la Roja or Chicago-flavored wine.  http://pabloleonheunion.com
Ok, so what is it about this restaurant?  They spend a lot of money on its staff and it is mostly because they have to.  The
restaurant - pulled from a dark bar for my tastes. It's a really nice place and I was pleased that I found it.
I hate to tell people not to order here, but  the price and service is on par with other Mexican restaurants around the city.  I love their latino (and fun) atmosphere but the service - I don't have to call the restaurant, and the service in general is better at this place than the Milwaukee suburb.  Not to mention their delicious salads!  After a first bite at one of my favorites (pastry sausage with red bell pepper) I went back to enjoy it a second time. I came here because the waitresses had been staying over the weekend for several weeks and had asked me for a table. After I said no and they were blocking the door as well, I was told by the waitresses to stop because they were rude. I was rude and was told by the woman in the waitress that if I didn't
restaurant to be celebrated!
I have always been a fan of the chef's who is very creative and inventive. This pasta version is a must for any Italian eater! It may not be what you make yourself, but it is definitely a must. If you're looking for something different to eat and want a little comfort then skip ahead to 3 minutes. For dessert they are pretty good.  I always love their homemade desserts but my mother thinks there is a better way! The tofu is an amazing dessert and the cheese enchiladas are very moist. But just because they did mention the basil pesto pasta that they were going for makes me think I need more as they could've easily accommodated me at 2 minutes. I'd definitely give the Piccolo Giacca a chance!
Great food! Great veggie options. My daughter was given a surprise and she ordered the pizza because it is better than anything else.  Great staff (one of the little boys at the bar
restaurant, Barbecued Meatloaf and meatballs. The manager was amazing, making sure they would enjoy their seafood, milk, cheese and tomato tortilla.  I ordered a lot of fish on my food bill, something that we can probably get a taste for with our food!  These are great ways to introduce yourself to a new mom or family member.
Great food (fries, salad & wine) in a very healthy way! Would definitely go back for lunch- the steak was tasty and the small portions definitely made up for it!
Now this is what I'm thinking when I say, Chocolate Split Boneless Tortilla. It is the "best" dish I've ever tasted. It is not rah-rah, only off the top of my head. Not only that, but I found an extra bottle to give the two of us all a tingling sensation as we started to leave. It was so good, and so very tasty, that
restaurant in town!  Also-remember that the BEST seafood I have EVER been to!  My husband and I was standing right next to each other and we couldn't believe how awesome this place was! Our next stop was Sweet Potatoes! This place is super cute and lively!  I used to be a little hard on them when they opened, but we're going back for more this summer.
Favorite chicago delicacies. Chorizo aimea in white gravy, tacos tacos and Italian for breakfast.  The presentation at their booth is sooo good it's even in the top 10 Chicago restaurants.  Also a top 20 home run combo burger joint. Love looking at Yuca.  Also every other review I've gotten from Yelp is like this, next review, and worst review I've EVER read.
One of my favorite joints in Chicago.  It's kinda tough to find good beer and cheese in Chicago, but we did get some new mason
restaurant by the pound!! Best Wings on the Place!
This location has no fob, but a nice atmosphere for good food & drinks. Wore the Pork and Stuffed Turkey sandwich to go with the birthday cake, greece cheesecake and dessert. Shoe with regular glasses of wine.  Had the Alinea.Had a Side Salad and the Well Aged lamb, something else I hadn't sampled yet. I'm sure we could add the Fat Game sausage too and make the whole meat a bit more tender than it already is, but the roast lamb is quite tender and spicy and top notch for their own sake! Good beer selection!
After an awesome return and a packed day with friends, I can finally enjoy my time with good beers. I am an enthusiast of Belgian beers but the Eu-Patria is the first Wuppertal the Deutschland Zu Upp and I'm looking forward to eating with the good people. The dining room
restaurant. The chicken is soft and easily cookable. The pistachio sauce is certainly excellent. Toppings are excellent and garnished with a cornbread topping. I was especially taken by the curry powder, which was fantastic, especially for the price.
My husband and I went on a Friday night (and we decided to be extra busy, so it wasn't really that late).  In between eating our huge plates of the sun dried fish and adding their cilantro to our salad bar (our final dinner entree) we were supposed to have a standard average of 12 servings a night.  I'm sorry, it was 9 hours, but that was OK.  Our server reminded us that the place is open late and we ended up actually walking away after we waited.  Overall, we're happy we came back with several dollars and dessert on top of our usual dinner.  While the food was perfect, I found myself leaving feeling bit of a disappointment.  Although the
restaurant, selling decent burgers with fries. Rick's enjoyed a memorable 45 minutes and a busy meal. We got to go for lunch the evening before and were thrilled with the price of the food. Definitely worth it.
I love everything the "red oak" sandwich has to offer. I've seen so much here since i'm a child and loved everything about it from the table in the kitchen to the littlest doors. I've always had reservations but wanted to stop in here because i didn't want to miss out on something that impressed me.  Their wings are perfect and the service is always friendly. Be prepared to wait! It's always awesome to get the wraps.
Yum! Great entree!
What a great area and very nice atmosphere!  Reap some of that fondue!  This place is always fun to try if you're not into cocktails, but the food is something I wanted to try. It's definitely not a walk in store if
restaurant was also late. There's a reason for this: In Chicago food isn't as tasty as the dining room in other places that I've visited, but the hot dog tostadas offer not just a little comfort, but when it comes to hotdogs, an absolute must-have. And I'd say alliance (Lapu; Order de prix) is worth a try, but like many Vietnamese restaurants, they often tend to be far from fancy. In the least, the pickup of a cheap beer and a quick filet mignon should suffice.
Rates are fair, service is really great, food, service is above average. Food is fresh, the parking is great and the music is nice. People coming here for brunch can easily end up finding the place on Kaleidoscope if they sit down. I would recommend keeping an eye out on other romantic places such as 4th Avenue and South Ave S were you were served a platter
restaurant. When I walked in it was relatively light and there was a large section of seating. They were well-pretended with seats of young adults and young adults who were busy doing the dishes.One of the young adults mentioned her favorite foods was apple pie - and it was good. I wouldn't go back there again unless I had a special occasion like spending time with one of my parents. I have to say that the decor was wonderful and the service was great! We had a few wine glasses - which we enjoyed immensely - which is really nice. Not surprisingly, the owner was very patient and welcoming. Overall, it was a fantastic experience. If you're looking for the best steakhouse in the city and if you want an upscale, eclectic, and inexpensive steakhouse that will not disappoint - skip for a steakhouse with high standards.
Beer, cocktails, and food the place is amazing. Great vibe and great place to get out of the city (especially during peak hours
restaurant and a great place for brunch. My husband and I love their coffee and the chicken salad and their options are always great.  Highly recommended!
Just remembered to go by the Warehouse after my friend was done talking on Friday night for the night. Was there a bar to grab some coffee? A pint? Yeah, I'll just say the Brewpub came out with unlimited tasting glassware. Friendly and everyone was happy with the choice of place. In the end, I decided to give them a try because the food on the menu is absolutely amazing. The prices are definitely reasonable and the staff is very knowledgeable. A side of the deal is the fact that there is now a second store upstairs at the Pub. Though I've been trying the Pub for a long time, I always find it to be too overcrowded. Well, on Saturday afternoon, with orders to be delivered. Once the website became available, we were very busy, so we decided to eat there during the hours
restaurant in Noyce. But these guys do a great job getting you to The Exotic and Coast Yummy, & the Bacon on Toast is GREAT!
Good food, nice service, reasonable prices, even if it was on a terrible night.
Had great brunch a few nights ago and I wanted to bring back the fried chicken wings. Had an issue with the setting but enjoy myself and my wife sharing the restaurant...no complaints there....er if I could either, recommend this place. This would probably be a good restaurant for children; unfortunately many toddlers have not seen it yet.
The house is nice though and the decor is nice. But overall all the best spots in town. The place isn't cheap either. It's usually really cheap and, if it ever goes down, it's going to be a problem.
Great great place for a date. The food is good, and the presentation is superb. The color of the floors is phenomenal. The veggies are
restaurant, paraloupe, duck parmigiana, and eggplant. You'll find it on oatmeal and just about any dish on the menu, along with a slab of chocolate. I like to think of myself as jazz-loving, and the spinach-wrapped tiramisu and the melted caramelized cheese drenched calamari usually qualify. I've eaten at marmalade places in Deli, and Super Bowl and the Hamptons in Manhattan. These places are the best. The chef once felt the need to turn over the pan, and that's exactly what we've been doing ever since! We're just getting started here, and so far, we've received two suggestions on the menu, both very good. On top of that, we've tasted the meat before and even tried the fresh tomatoes this time. Overall, the best salsa I have ever had in Chicago, even from the delectable house salsa in the lounge. The new canned tomatoes
restaurant in October. Everything was beautifully prepared and enjoyed by all.  I'll definitely go back once I get back and order another meal.
First and foremost, I love the visit from Gina.  I tried our first sushi restaurant and the tuna sandwiches were fantastic!  Some of the items were really good but after you try it again it's pretty damn expensive! The food was quite good too.There's really nothing like a crispy portion of sweet garlic mashed potatoes to make a dish like this and they definitely left out all the bad oozey flavor.
My life was screwed up when a friend went to lunch for lunch. They called the restaurant at over 1.5pm and ordered us that lunch in my building after their first business. Our waitress had that same obnoxious attitude during the course of the call to say hi. We also had the dinner waiting for us. She didn't seem to care or that she knows our intentions, so we were pissed off about it
restaurant, special dishes, and the like. Good decor, really fun, reasonably priced - and can be better.
I have loved Paris for quite a while. Last month they opened a restaurant named Barre Toile. After that last month they opened Cafe Rojas. It's in the best Italian restaurant in Chicago in all right?
Pretty cool.   The regular menu is awesome. The chef is here to compliment you, everyone knows that he's a great manager and I've heard great things about him.
My sister ordered the first chicken joint at work last night...this was fine.  It's easy to keep up with the street and low rents. The service is overall great, they take less food than most places around;
I went to Lou's with husband, with Gail and Don, when I was on a date and was disgusted by the way the food was cooked. I felt slightly insulted and didn't like that it was cooked too thick and
restaurant lot outside of them. I recommend asking for it, but you have to bring your own pick if you haven't yet. If you have a girlfriend, too, then you don't have to spend all of your time outside for two days!
Top notch food! You can't go wrong with this service. There are kids to watch and we have plenty of wine to watch, and when we go with them we have a hard time accepting that the place is full.
First time here in over 20 years. I had the BLERK sauce and the fried shrimp for a party of 11.  I loved the yumminess of the shrimp, didn't go back.  They were well priced, but I'd never ordered to die for.  Only downside is that it was sloppy, so you end up feeling like you went to shit at a party of kids to death.
The food is outstanding, the service is great and the service is friendly.

restaurant".

I came here on a whim in February and came back late.  My server, who works as a foreman, stayed up late and sat by my table for hours afterwards.  At one point, I was told to bring back a bottle of wine for my wife, who says no one in the dining room has ever been this close to me.  Everyone said yes, and we all went home with great service and a smile.  I think I remember coming to this place so much more than before, and I would never return.
Ok ok, next time the pizza is ordered it was hard to tell what it is.  Very much like last time.  Had a second blast.  It was good but not to great.  It was ok with the crispy chicken wings so just not my type.  Anyways its about 1/3 of what it is.
Ordered seafood and cooked for dinner. Beach houses wrapped in the p
restaurant is usually booked at about 8 am and we always have open seats. Their dishes are outstanding and the prices are very reasonable. We also recommend this burger spot to anyone who's craving food.
I went to the Oahu Pigeon Fogo without a reservation...you can order them yourself.  The service was slow, but you have the comfort of having someone else taking your order.  The salsa was good.  The octopus salad was amazing.  We would definitely go back if we felt there was something we could do better, but alas, they are pretty pricey and very limited.  Our friends and I at Okami always do as we tell them...Yummy!
Bewildered.  Everything was good with pan meat.  I wonder what else they may have cooked?  They have not prepared anything to perfection! I usually eat w/ brown rice and beans (though my boyfriend and I went here last week).  Actually, we ordered
restaurant. On a recent weekday afternoon in a crowded parking space, my boyfriend and I were seated right next to one of our other companions. He ran around inside the glass door and took his orange bouncer friend out of there and took his name off the tables. I followed him off the table and wrapped myself up in a towel and watched him bleed out. I looked at the bartender, and he said something like "sweet treat" and then said something like, "I was looking for a cell phone, thank you. I think you guys are good" and the door rammed open. Since we had already been seated there for several minutes, it was odd seeing the problem. Anyway, the next time I go back and ask the bartender to let us sit next to the drinks, he just says that the guy on the other end of the phone was unresponsive. When I asked about why, he just said that he wanted to take care of our friend, and this way,
restaurant, and closed door, the staff was friendly and helpful. I am going back for sure.
Every time I go here I get to hang out with a fresh-faced couple and we still have great wine and local beer. I've had a few different types of calamari for lunch. The waiter of the day is also on the phone and he hands over sample for me to try. The food was fabulous. We love that all of the desserts are much more affordable and good for appetizers/desserts. They have nothing on the street because they serve fresh food that is tasty and easy to eat.
As the experience and experience for people entering the city has grown, we have noticed an increasing focus on fun, and we've noticed some more casual, casual clothes being introduced. For instance, they have a local strip club where the neighborhood tattoo parlor has been open, where all of the parties are young, and only a few types of waitresses stand behind
restaurant. Those who won't wait in line because they think a service will eat up the floor are down. I really hope the area doesn't feel like this, for heaven's sake!
Can't believe it. I've been to more and more bistros than this.   Food is delicious and the prices are reasonable.  We give big deal to the service and they do accept credit cards.
As a resident of San Juan Capistrano, my new favorite.I have been going here for about 6 years and love having a great time.  Loved this place as well.  Service and Atmosphere is great.  Very pleasant service.  I also like their meat (penne vieja and melted-crispy goat.)
Lettuce platter was sooo good!Perfection.If I live here I would eat here many times a year.  Would absolutely go there again.
This was my first time coming here at
restaurant and large selection of meats and plenty of juice! Must try.
The reviews for Chicago's Nick's are also amazing.  Every word on this place makes a difference.  It was lucky to have one of the world's best chocolate chip chocolate maker's in Chicago who was a friend of the owner Rick Nielsen.  Nick's is well known in the Chicago establishment in Chicago for its great food.  He was extremely respectful and he continues to make sure we were treated well throughout the trip.  If you're looking for a great cocktail or a great Korean dessert to add to your evening of Chinese food, you'll love Nick's.
Funny how accommodating you get at this place! I LOVE every second of it!  It's probably my favorite place in Chicago with Chinese food, and they make a ton of great choices.  Amazing everything about the place and the service.   I love the little booths, as well as the fact that you can bring in
restaurant variety to cater the lower-end visit for the fabulous experience. Unique and incredible service. The 3 pieces of meat give this restaurant a much better chance of finding the right menu - places to find the BEST in meat - love it!
My husband and I came here last night and ate next to our bus. We both agreed it is one of our favorite eating spots. It was quiet and casual and it was packed enough for us to all have the night. We had the Pasta and the soup that is the best part. I chose the potato on the plate, which is good since it does burn the veggie space so much and no dessert at all, but it's not everything I like but I went with the salad and smoked salmon in the evening (which is good). I have to admit this was the most we ate at the restaurant! Maybe we are a bit impatient, but it's always a lot. I will certainly be back!
Best burger joint!
restaurant, and the soy roasted pepper salsa - really nice.  The margaritas were also very good, but all the experience they put into the food was outstanding. The food was good, the service was good, but I would suggest this place not to go again.
Great art show!  You have to wait until you get a table and that is what is the reason for being here.  People just like to see what they are missing.  They're not always the best....or are they?  So for those of you that are here for the jazz style with the laid back vibe of the boy band there's going to be your meal
Went to OcetiT for my birthday party.  Most the dishes I ordered (vegan, homemade) came with all of my cravings.  My wife and I did not hesitate to order the "busy love" shrimp of choice (more vegetables, for lunch), along with some very tasty
restaurant! Our small but dedicated menu includes sis de branche, rococo amo de que las techos and mimosa joints. A bite to eat while they have the best portions.
My fav organic food in Italy. No kidding, this is a breakfast spot. Me and my girls eat at least once a month and usually get a huge cocktail entree that includes rice, eggs, and, you know, my favorite: pho with whipped cream. Next time you want to make the chocolate version of the hit thing, you should probably get the Mole than see how delicious this is.
I grew up in Chicago and I love their croquettes! All the course sizes are about 5 bucks each and all you have to do is look at the menu page to see what's available. I love the way the course are laid out and presented with a pair of matching scissors! I'll be back for dinner as soon as possible.
Theres a lot
restaurant/seation fee but the presentation is impeccable, and the folks in the back are certainly worth the purchase.  I certainly think you should try their after-glow.  As this is actually actually my favorite non-endorsement in the town, I have to say that I was hoping for a totally different approach.  I have read the reviews and enjoyed my breakfast over the last several years and found this place to be a much more convenient, appealing option.  The food was delicious, the service was awesome, the atmosphere was awesome, and the price was outrageous.  I am going back for the next location and want to add that I am BYOB and am eating out very often.  I plan to eat at another Fogo but will certainly head to Too and Oasis to try other flavors.  I have heard good things about veggie options and plan to continue to eat elsewhere as my appetite for creative.  You can choose from them here
restaurant = +10 points total. Fries. 8 hour wait.
I've visited a lot of great restaurants, so this was a good experience.  And the service was a bit unprofessional, not that it felt as if they were completely incompetent, but I was impressed, and happy to bring the Chef's wife.  We got our wine glasses on (because of the extra water-filled glasses!) and our waitress asked for help holding the glasses in her mouth while we waited.  No, I was kidding.  As it turns out, we'd already been drugged (not something I'd ever heard before) and that wasn't the point in requesting a refill at any of the places we'd been drinking.  That being said, everything was acceptable, especially because it was cheaper (like I said in my earlier post on vinglish!) to make a beer.  I guess the service was fine, but the decor is generally pretty comfortable.
I have
restaurant A&C, located on N. Broadway, and served all toffee and vanilla sweets to the absolutely ridiculous, insufferable twenty-something fans. By the time we had arrived I felt like a 2nd grader, and this event (restaurant A&C). Although no one was smiling, one comment was "But what did they expect?" before it got even more bizarre. the people eating the worst meat I ever ate for the first time came out to get my food, and if you weren't one of them you probably won't be getting it anytime soon! who lives in my area, they keep making their friends drink margaritas, just like the rest of my previous group! who lives in Boston, we keep finding them at the bar/restaurant who I suppose should probably think twice before trying to go there. god i cant see why these people eating too much ever will come back here to make me feel better. which is why
restaurant...everywhere else!
I loved this place!  Great margaritas and stuff in general.  Service was also great!  Im going back!
Huge menu! I love the flavor of this sandwich. Their salads are a little disappointing and not as delicious as I remember.  I like their homemade roll and baked beans.  Service is a bit slow but gets better everytime I go because it's a little on the expensive side.  I'd recommend trying  this place again.
Hurry up and you will be impressed. I always try my Bad Apple Sausage that comes wrapped in A LOT of sea salt so easy to dip in, the smoked turkey gets less spicy if you didn't wish.  I really don't want to live near a restaurant and if I ever go back I will definitely reccommend it.
I grew up on California Avenue. My parents died and I ate there the weekend before so this was pretty great
restaurant - simple (I think?) and crisp. The temperature was also excellent, and the food was great. The dogs were pretty fast and they were so attentive and willing to wait for you. It's BYOB so you need to eat out every hour to get one of those casual dining joints in your life (no more convenience stores, here it is!!!!!).
Very dine-in Mexican restaurant. Called it BYOB when they asked if they could make margaritas, so basically the deli said, no, you can't, but if you're going to make margaritas, the deli will be up. Then asked if the night was gonna be our last meal. OMG the servers did not communicate, who are you going to do it with?
The food was quite good for what it was. Came here twice to work after some really bad experiences in the past couple weeks. The truffle-wrapped cocktail jam that I was served was the best
restaurant of the day; give her a polite way, give her some space, think about the food and also the owner and her surroundings; listen to her, consider every bite, feel the food and the respect it requires, appreciate her feedback and tender tender support.
The food here is all-natural and fresh. The sampler  they have, is very appetizing. Definitely a welcome addition to any entree.
I love cauliflower soup (which is ridiculously good and so convenient) and toadstool's Palsada!!!! I had the qiu mao (cauliflower soup) but it was awesome...this was the only soup I felt was the best. Please come back again and more often.
we used to love goulash so much it became a great restaurant to date so many times. have been here a couple times now, i ordered something from it,it was very good and so was everyone else.  the good thing is its
restaurant offers all the food I ordered. As soon as I sat down, I remember this restaurant really being the best, and my prenup was the best I'd ever tasted. From the base of the spring rolls to the risotto that the risotto waiter delivered, to the polenta that the server slathered in shrimp in the spring sauce, the atmosphere of this gem of a restaurant can't be beat. This is a place to watch others enjoy their meal, and we really like the ambiance of the place.
I went with my boyfriend here today and waited about 45 minutes.   I've been there twice and got lucky, but the first time my boyfriend ordered the The Buffalo Cheese Sandwich, which is a medium-goat breakfast-bacon sandwich, I don't remember if it was bacon or eggs.  The only reason I would have liked to go with my friends was because of how mediocre the service is, and the food is too bland. 
restaurant and chef. Just so you know.
I've been to Chicago, Chicago, Houlton, Soho, Eau Claire and Chicago; they all have excellent dining, superb service and superb culture.  Some of the world's best sports bars, restaurants and taverns all have excellent small family experiences and are staffed with wonderful people who always bring the right information about their local businesses.  The clients I have come here for are everything from sidewalk sushi to food to hotel bridal shower.  I am always satisfied with my experience.  My girlfriend and I regularly write, eat and plan home meals based on our love of Chicago's dining, and hopefully we will be back.  I'm also very pleased to say that I am always the lucky customer for this place.  I may not be around very often, but I am always a bit encouraged when I see new people trying out the locations at this place.
My boyfriend and I recently returned to Chicago for dinner
restaurant/roasting room. We have many great locations in Los Angeles where you can have an intimate, intimate dinner and the best portion of that was Crispy Cakes, Please Enjoy!!
I've been going to this restaurant for five years. And my husband and I are guests who made this Chicago gastropub their own, however, a lot has changed since our visit. (There are a lot more upscale restaurants in Chicago, many of them smaller) The food has changed;The service has changed too;Dinner is gone!  We've had slow food everywhere else, and have had special pizzas not only in the restaurant, but also in the dining room and in the customer service. Now, I'm shocked if you know about the food being kept cheap, and there are so many moving parts that means that the portions have to go down a little. Most restaurant owners share the same philosophy.They are not concerned with your experience - their only concern is that the
restaurant is slightly creaky. The tables are crowded. Alliance tables are crowded. You really gotta bite your tongue trying to be enjoyed and having a high quality place that has a nice vibe and a nice vibe is super refreshing.
I love the chef food and care. Really great meatloaf with very extensive seafood. The kind that came with steaks and was my go-to for vegetarians. I think it was a really delicious food and everything was fresh, spicy, tasty, and awesome.I couldn't be happier with all the food we had and what it brought. The desserts was good too, like challah. The original would have come out to that happy place. If they knew where they could come up with a more unique food combination, I would be salivating and enthused about going here. The overall experience was outstanding. I just wish they would sell them out to couples.
Darn. And the sushi we had was poorly cooked.

restaurant way back in its past; it was fairly crowded, but unfortunately we never got into a party for dinner.  When my friend came in there was only one other person in there at the time, and she'd like to speak with me a bit more on my experience.  We weren't really so much too hungry and none of us found out what we'd just ordered.  I almost had to wait a moment to speak to a bunch of other seated people who kept smiling at us.  It was an awful experience and I felt bad about it.  The other part of the experience was when the waiter had her finger on the waitress' shoulder for a moment and then called her back.  When she told us we had to be seated quickly, the waitress managed to run away, but she didn't seem pleased.  In the end, the conversation was lost, I suppose.  It's amazing how some people get upset about this sort of thing.  It is
restaurant Joe DiDuca's Crossbow Deep Dish, and after enjoying dining at Colegio on the day of my birthday, I was as eager to try this restaurant as I have been. It is a modern classic with some nice entrees, soups, and toppings. The main reason for this diner is the location, and the enormous variety of options for those with bigger appetites. (We only had one appetizer at White Matter last time.) I would give it 3 stars but no thanks. Enjoy!
One of my favorite New Year's Eve experiences in my Chicago neighborhood! So come here for 2-4 people per group and you'll not be disappointed!  The and the broths are amazing... In addition to the person that is seated on the counter, there's a whole host of ladies sitting to the side like king sized black sunglasses that really cut the ticket.  There's also plenty of beers on tap, too! (Will I go back?).
restaurant (3 tables), waiting, at their table: The food and service was good, but sometimes the food was slightly bland or disgusting, but the atmosphere was so charmingly warm that you can't help yourself. I love waiting in line for a special for a major such as Boaz Jones or called in directly at the entrance of the restaurant. I would consider it another co-worker who actually really enjoys their wine selection.
a run amuck brunch place.if you can't wait wait for them to open, don't go.you'll be disappointed.
really good food so excuse me.great place for African americans,very nice staff, long wait for parking...mostly all yelp is mixed in with your other options...go for french toast
Wow, it's like a Greek restaurant in real life. you can pick up all the ingredients at the table without much hassle.  And a menu never fails to complement your entrees.  So good for
restaurant can take a bit of getting used to, but you will not be disappointed. Once you get the oatmeal latte in your mouth, you are treated like a real snob. I have to say they don't know me because I'm one of the hosts and service must have been on the menu, but otherwise they will send you to the red light, be very annoyed and actually do not care about you in the slightest. This was a girl's experience, but if I recall right, its a solid 2nd factor into getting a good credit card.  Then again I would never give myself an 8/10.
This place was huge for its quality, service, the variety of food, and the good bourbon list.  Every review seemed good enough for me to give it 5 stars.
Disappointed, but extremely happy with the food here.   I will be returning.  It is great.
I was here last week to try the signature delicious
restaurant, community service and dedication to quality food. We had excellent service.  The black crab salad was excellent and it was really quick.The staff was great!They charge us 15 bucks per person for standard seafood and you can order it and come out for free to a table.  It's the only place with good prices and is close to a century since the Eaton was open.We do not recommend it for my friends and family.  If you are a heavy metal burrito fan, this place should be on the list for you.Please also please take care of the waiting staff.  I will be back  next time I eat at the Eaton.
This place is awesome. Always great prices. Fungi stoves and sweets are really nice. Check the cash register
I've been here a couple times now.  The food was awesome.  The chips were good, some portions were really good.  And the desserts were pretty damn good.
restaurant here and nice selection.  I've noticed the maki bread is SO GOOD for some french fries, and the shrimp deviled eggs can be had on the menu.  I went for my meal today with a friend that I won't be able to go back.  The soup was awesome, the cheese sauce and sausage was so good.  We didn't have much sauce, but if we do, I'll be going back if they keep the dishes nice and fresh.
Great food, great drinks.  I wish they had more of a high bar if there's enough to go around on this weekend. I always wanted to visit at least once a month, so this was the perfect place to do it. There are booths outside and the chef will ask you to sit in the lunch room, and the chicken tasters and prosciutto mimosas are your plus!  The place was packed almost instantly, and during my last tour they had 30 flights coming
restaurant at $3.00 an hour. I would have been disappointed if they didn't get there on a Tuesday night for breakfast.
Simply Noodle and Delicatessen was perfect! There were huge portions to go around and they were delicious. We will definitely go back if I had to give it a 5 star!
Have wanted many Italian & Out of this World (Italy) restaurants, Margaritas & Carne Spaghetti Noodles!!! The food has never been better. And the service! The delivery! I went here for the first time in June and i will be back. 
I love New England Italian food, but it's mostly an afterthought here. Very nice atmosphere. When I asked for it, I was a bit hesitant at first and as they said I would have asked for meat, but they sent out a chef of course. I gave him my burger and it was on time. I don't think you can compare these two different
restaurant and is being sent out quickly. I guess they have they high risk of building out their mission or miss this part of town. It's honestly the least I'll be going there.
I haven't been here since another episode of Sunda was on.  Been to Big Evers and have enjoyed it.  The service was excellent, the food was good, and I love trying new things at Home Depot.  The staff is always welcoming as well.  I think the food is amazing.
Plenty to choose from, but what I crave is of course tea. I got a tasty tasting brie crepe with calzat, mussels & coriander leaves on sweet strawberry base. The espresso is simply incredible.   Delicious flavor is due to the softness of the protein and the yet to be determined results of their bean sausages and soggy espresso. The food is delicious but not overly deep. This place is literally great.

restaurant in the city (wait for your visit there).
I hate to say it but if I lived in South Bay Area, I'd find this place to be a riot.I can't deny that hipsterish Cafe De Mayo is a delight to go on a weekday and hope that continues into this week.  And, and this is also the first place I've been to, oh yeah, my haters will recognize me from this point on!  It's a little busy at times but hey, if I had to order, yes...  It's great, really cool place.
Great, i love the Brisket and salty ceviche.  What you will see here is not far from Saba or Fokobo or Aruja, just like the lovely little diggings. My advice? Go with the neighborhood, do you? Or maybe you're in this city or country!
I love this place!  They offer meats right out
restaurant that I've been to, I enjoyed a perfect evening of art in an outdoor restaurant. The restaurant is definitely in the mood for a different flavor combinations for something out of the ordinary.
Love this place! We just went to this restaurant when the Spring break came and sat down with customers for about 10 minutes to try the mosh pit. The service was fantastic. You only have to wait for about 30 minutes before you get your meal.The owner is nice, he knows your personal preference and he always tips the bill, making sure you are not missing out on $15 of free lunch.The prices range from about $6.50/person to $12.00/person. We tried everything from bread to fruit to corn tortilla in the basket. We love the mosh pit, it is a great spot to stand in line if you don't mind waiting outside.
Make sure to check out these places out!
I had dinner here with two other
restaurant/champagne/alcoholic wine/liquor/biodegradable alcohol by the glass
Not much worth doing in front of 6! Not all of us wait too long for his bar yet and he and his staff are friendly and attentive. Their staff also love the seafood food. Definitely ordering a sit down restaurant and the atmosphere is very romantic. Keep it up!
I am a fan of authentic Indian food which I have been to times I've felt I am on the cusp of a culinary journey. I have been to Alinea and Cibor's in Brazil, and those have proven that there is no other place on the planet, really, with better authentic flavor and homey look, better location for the authentic menu options.
This place is buzzing, with traditional styles and simple flavors from different sixties to hipsters, that becomes mites (which, for tourists, translates to what goes on your tasting plate, out of your head,
restaurant": said.
I like this place and what's amazing about it is that it makes your coffee somewhere and it is always close.If you've ever asked for a 4 person table, you have come to the right place. We asked for a 4 person table. The tables were exactly the same as the one we ordered. Besides the fact that we had the cheese and everything else was nice and small, this is a classic casual restaurant.
Wow what an awesome Mexican food that is!!The agave salsa is delicious  appetizer is great  drinks are still available if you visit.great ambience: lattes and mahi mahi too
Really funny/cool spot in the neighborhood I have had several times (I go to this place for breakfast - the wings are awesome, I had the beef sausage, the beef braised pork, the cauliflower green chile salad) and i have never had more delicious food out in the city than this...
Best Indian
restaurant,1 yolk cheese (great onion, should have been more) with steak wings, toasted unprocessed soy sauce and salted caramelised onions with cornstarch. Had a plate of balsamic vinegar and cilantro enchiladas.Definitely didn't like the parking lot, since it has an incredibly shitty sign with them. The place always seems parked by the bathroom, and you'd not think that would be out of place with someplace that boasts almost nothing in common with both Chicago and Neiman Marcus. But then I look at that sign. It was like Wicker Park was going to have an 'A' after it closed. For some reason he is so thorough, he just makes it up for it. Will not be back!
So you eat here for the family dinner. The food is pretty good, and it was packed.  I didn't get that much for a large group, but I found this place pretty busy at 1
restaurant - no wait.
Free Parking!Hot dogs, pastries, and homemade cheeses are the nicest part of your breakfast.  The food is always fresh and ready to eat. There is also a large porterhouse on a busy street in the park (sorry Santa!).  Delicious the food and atmosphere. I wish I could share this place with my mom; and I wish I could tell her that I was ordering food from a loyal customer.After coming back this morning with my boyfriend-the  Best Pizza in Chicago (albeit lean).  Yes, we could have ordered anything we wanted, but we finally ate.  All the the pizza from Milite Meatloaf on St. Croix has been consistent and perfect, and I think everyone can appreciate the quality of the food on this plate.  The sausage has always been top quality and moist, and the arugula is oh so yummy.  Gotta love the foie gras pizza if
restaurant, and she said, "Oh boy, I didn't understand my wibsh. Who am I kidding? You want corn on the pancakes? They taste terrible." She kept showing me photos, including a ruined hunk of burnt scallop and a sad, waxy look on his face, and explained, "What kind of breakfast buffet would they put on there?  No way to skip corn on these pancakes!  Do you think they would treat you like you did me a favor?" There was a quick message that was included in the post, along with the words "Go check this place out!  Your friend has recently been waiting in line for over five hours!  I'm sorry.  You aren't worth it  to go shopping with people like this.  You must be thinking of yourself as who you are.  When I see you  shopping and that they cater to you, that is just a show." He responded to my wife, "
restaurant is really amazing. And if I can get there, I'll go.  This place has such a big whiskey scene here in Austin. I recommend going here!
This place is amazing!!! I've always tried all kinds of weird cool dishes and weird wines.  The staff is also very friendly and friendly to all of us.  The service is great, but a bit slow and slow paced and if I'm in a hurry it definitely takes longer. The crowds are kind of overwhelming at first and I think everyone knows exactly what they're doing, especially since they have large beer selection.  I just wish they could provide a small variety of beer at their tables.  I LOVE my dining area as it's accessible, they run through between the classes, they have a sauna, and you don't have to stand around.  It's a great place to get to as you can get on a busy night.
Love the food, incredible service, oh and drink
restaurant at the Apollo House on the first of a three-day celebration. Because this is a first, a five-day gathering, and it is very small, the cost for the meal could take anywhere between $25-40.  We will be back to enjoy a prix fixe meal, but for now, the dinner will come with a long list of appetizers and appetizers. That may or may not be the choice for you, but if you were to find a less than large French onion dish, you could get four per plate.  The fact that you get half of the options makes this one of the more expensive dinner options, especially when you consider the price.  We would imagine that people who like carnivale soups and schmills and can afford to eat a full meal would understand the value of food here.
My boyfriend and I wanted to make this review about Yelp and now we have.  One of our favorite locations. I also
restaurant at restaurant, this place is packed with fantastic food and great service.
This place is great! I also tried the Jack Butters (I went to this place on a Monday and found out I'll be visiting from Chicago), and their portions are always full! It's worth a try.
Overall my stay in New Orleans is a disaster. The food is good but the service and atmosphere is horrible. I wanted a good restaurant with nice food and a nice atmosphere to love.  The ambiance and atmosphere has run deep and I'm not going back.  The waitstaff is filthy with rat droppings and shoddy yelp on a regular basis.  The waitstaff gets soooo used to it that everytime I come, they start picking their nickels/marbles because they don't want to wash dishes!  The best part about these things, is that the staff never eats breakfast, has no food, and is really quiet.  The food
restaurant; Beef tenderloin with a dab of lemon; butterplant with mustard; brown rice with sliced red onion; caramelized onions and red wine vinegar on top; heavy-roasted ginger cornflakes; and unsoaked peanuts.
This is definitely a sandwich I enjoy myself, a total junk food establishment worth sampling.  It's such a wonderful place to go on a Sunday night to get to try and impress your friends, which I do have every chance to at least try. The decor is complete and the food is excellent.  I have heard so many wonderful things about this place - adventurous people looking for cozy quiet places, frat houses and relaxing dining.
Awesome, but my wife and I are going to need to come to other times.  I have been to pretty much every BBQ place in the US.  When I go there, it's always good.  There is definitely some amazing service.  If I go at Chicago Grill, that
restaurant no longer offers a gratuity/per diem. Instead, it seems to consist solely of giving half the service and walking back your head to a booth at lunch instead of the dinner that preceded it. But, due to its ambiance and volume, the diner was overrun and left uninterested. They literally stopped mumbling the names of their clients, and instead deflected attention to the waiter who sat on the counter at the back. What better way to end an evening of non-plagiarism than to treat one of these clients with dignity and respect? How could you possibly open the door of the diner on a Sunday night?
POVEST AND AMAZING!! The classic veggie sandwich. It is the real deal.  This place offers wings, sandwiches and more desserts.  Not some old bowl of beans when your meal is bland and just sitting in a salad bar.  It is DELICIOUS with crust and flavor.  I do recommend
restaurant. It is the norm that we go there for evening, but sometimes its special that we try to finish our wait at first, even though our wait time is far from incredible. The vegan, gluten free (special to us) tofu rolls are great if you have a special occasion.
I usually have parties of 4-6 and I love the menu, especially the chicago avocado/red onion/sweet onion mix, but also had the rice, korean rice, tofu and rice-wash bar that I ordered to try. Prices: :   $25-30 to average meal price * 12 min. Wait. 7 min.
Okay OK okay enough: while we were on a 3.5/5... out was the panini de creole.  The perfect combo of falafel sauce, marshmallow zucchini, cheese, ricotta cheese, my lentils, buttermilk, ginger, ginger ale... this is my favorite
restaurant is low-key but affordable.  Check their menu below if you want authentic Mexican food that only comes out of downtown.  Go ahead and have a go and enjoy the bohemian atmosphere as well as the brunch experience.And remember, the pizza was wonderful, so go ahead and try it.  I think it may be the best pizza in L.A.. thank you Crispy!
If you're into Brazilian cuisine, there are a lot of options in town. But there really isn't any better place to start than Pizza Hut. We go there for lunch every day and a brisket is typically an overrated condiment in comparison. The tarantulas are one of my favorites; when paired with chicken, the sauce melts away and saves the chicken. The Brazil Beef Tacos also really make your mind go out of your way to splurge for.It all starts at the table, just like a normal Brazilian hot dog. Upon entering the hot dog
restaurant. As for sitting and eating at the restaurant, I love it. I will say, if you're a traditional Japanese eatery, your experience will be a little more fuddy-duddy.  In addition to the beef brisket for my lunch I also enjoyed a green salad with jam bbq and guacamole and a ton of family favas.  If you're not a Japanese eatery, there's only about a 2/3 of the sushi in the house that you can get at their place.It was a bit busy and I was leaving early because I'm not sure when I'd get my jibanda.  Just like the red tempura usually in his neighborhood, JIBANA is only available on Sundays.  Don't expect to spend $50+ for a great sushi meal at Fogo Shibuya.
Really excellent food. I like all the great sushi restaurants, but I think it was all crap and probably the
restaurant and if you are lucky enough to eat there after this weekend's Grilled Chicken which is a nice add on to the chicken dishes you'll be definitely eating there.
Liked the salmon bisque dish! Maybe I am what you think my $6 pancakes would cost you? I do not. I simply prefer to have what I have at home. I live in a neighborhood that has so much to offer that I have trouble letting my allergies and dairy concerns take over.  So much so that I am thinking about bringing their truffle fries to my wedding. I have never tried dipping my crusted peanuts in them, and all it takes is a little of them on the plate, it's very hard to make a simple dish out of them.   Oh, and there is some kind of stickered pepperoni on a sheet.   The waiter forgot to refill our plates! OMG
Very fresh place, interesting menu and food.  I took home two stars
restaurant!!! We have always had amazing food and we really enjoy their pasta dishes.  All the sauces are lovely.
Great food, good atmosphere, great restaurant. Great atmosphere, good decor and great service.  I have eaten here from time to time and I will probably go again.
We're just glad to get here after a nasty winter out here in the east and it's not like you get a room on a chilly night and see a band go back on Friday night on stage. My husband and I chose Pho to sit at (offstage) for the extra 10 minutes it takes for the hostess to enter the room (I give her 1 minute first serve to tell the band she's on the sofa) to deliver a loud press conference to her and us. The cafe owner is not so charming about the space (and so charming about it being packed, unfortunately), but it looks like a real and charming place.I've eaten here three times now and definitely
restaurant
Gluten-free, zero stick smoothies
Their warm brews are the perfect accompaniment to a pint of their magical ale.  The server is passionate about helping the barbeque come to life with creative twisty brews.  The family treats each guest nicely and the entire neighborhood has a happy and romantic atmosphere.
One of my favorite restaurants in the city. Only problem is that my review is ridiculous. They make it their own, another $2500 minimum. I might even call it the best chain in Chicago.
MY FRIENDS LOVE IT!  I stopped by the Chobani on Sunday night and I loved it!  Now, I've never been there, but the food is fresh and delicious.  Not to mention, I usually go to Spacca to get at least a drink each time I go.  It's really amazing.  There is nothing like going to Spacca and getting a free drink!
What an unbelievable
restaurant and coffee with our food and drink here, and most importantly, to say thanks. The food is delicious, the service is excellent. The night-ender portions are quite good, as is the delivery section. The restaurant is small and people try everything as if it was a joint but it is really a great place to relax and play. I am not a big drinker. The quality of wines is very good, and they sell some great wines here too. Definitely give it a try. Yum!
BEST! Amazing pizza place in the city! This is where I first came to Chicago.  First time I went, it was good. Then I thought they were kidding.  The first time I checked the decor on the wall, it wasn't even that good.  And then I picked it up.  One of the members with the red-toothed carrot in the cupboards started raving about their exotic pizza making great pizza, delicious and affordable
restaurant here are pretty much all they got. Would definitely go back again.
I enjoyed my trip to Deco Sausage which was only about $30 at the beginning. We had a very special table. I ordered a glass of wine to celebrate our new space. We did not have cheese on the side of the dinner plate. The crust on this dish was perfect for dipping the capri cheese so. It was a very nice appetizer. Thanks for the big!
I go to the Soup Shops all the time and the soup bar has every classic place of its size down in the neighborhood! If you are not in a rush to get ready for soup then this place is way off. They don't put in a map for you to see, so it can be confusing when you don't know where you're waiting for what you order!!?! Do yourself a favor and try to order the soup. You know this place is always full. The wait to go is
restaurant to continue their unique food experience. The dine-in menu is exceptional, with your appetizer choice included. The wine list is amazing, with variety of wines including grapefruit, lemongrass, citrus, yam, and plenty of others. You will also be spoiled for choice. In addition to the sweet tasty quail and everything in the kitchen, the menu gives you the taste of locally grown produce and can be customized for different types of dishes and drinks. Prices are reasonable too. I will not return if there is any demand, and recommend the menu to my friend.
I have been staying in North Philly for more than a decade and am always at business. Here in Bridgeport, New York, we are constantly had and happy. We often try new Italian food that satisfies all the new men and women visiting from around the world. I have recommended Italian food to over 2 million people and I have been a loyal customer. The food has always been excellent
restaurant and you will have to wait in line for the wait staff.
Aloha! I'm well into the new that's going on.  The craft beer selection is there for what is on tap at any given time, and it's reasonable, I believe.  The beers are top notch and coming in fresh, almost always.  The menu includes fried rice, which has for me been the highlight of the day.  When I saw Iquitos I thought, I'll go here.  No one gets in here after eating them.
This is one of my favorite fried chicken dishes.
The artful and one of the better fried chicken in Chicago. Everything about this place is nice, the meats are flavorful and the atmosphere is quiet but still tasty. The only downside is this place must make large portions for lunch hour before they add extra pork rolls, but it's nice to have!
Chicago is literally a zoo. Amazing! I'm going back for more
restaurant employee. He never stops talking about the popular Indian restaurant on South St. with you. He also has a great and vibrant chat bar. Would take them some special time here and stay classy on your watch for dinner. Once your satisfied with their martinis and appetizers, it's time to put the lights on.
Always good. The food is amazing and very fresh. The burgers come hot and they are deep fried. Overall, very good quality. But my favorites here are the carnivore with an ego and the entree on the chicken, the carrot bowl (except the carrots) and whatever else that is.
I think this is a private town location, and if you want to drink here, you have to take reservations. The dinner menu is great, and almost always prep prepared by a small crew (one outside each restaurant) and all menus go together for a reasonably priced dinner. I get one special night at this place for free- If you're visiting the
restaurant for the lovers

Makes a great burrito, bbq or cheese pizza at our house. Appetizers are good but there was only 1 available so much I wish they had chips.Pizza part time I could try it but it was pretty pricey for an appetizer. Now I eat at a smaller restaurant, go somewhere else. Not on me but  that's just the food part of me.Overall I'd give it another shot
I'm a really great mealgoer, and this place has been fantastic.  My fav restaurants at least once.  If you can get service from the waitstaff, well make sure to ask to use these stallion bowls there.  Don't want to wait.
I really like this restaurant, having lived with it for just under a year now.  I just wish there were more parlor seating or it would have improved quite a bit.  The staff was friendly and the food was fresh. 
restaurant and an excuse for child's play.  Chicago is a country of excellent families, but over a coffee and truffle cake, the place is great for bringing together friends and family.  The meal started with a appetizer, but we managed to skip it because the combo of fish and chips is incredibly bad.  My main course was the sautéed grilled chicken and  goosehouse pita, but when we ordered the two dishes of seafood--squaw and rice--it was unbelievable.  For a reason so surprising I had to give it 3 stars.The service is typically fast.  The subpar portions are perfectly acceptable, and the service is prompt.  The beer selection is mediocre.  You must try them if you are planning on spending some money on admission.  Chicago doesn't offer a better wine selection than Nana's.  You know what you are paying for.  To get a better drink, try saison, or the light flavor
restaurant and a comfortable waiting area! Or, you can pay by credit card or some other payment method. They also have a table and seating area which you can grab from time to time on their busy days. They bring out a beer list to relax you. Then, you can go and enjoy the atmosphere which is wonderful.
Eating the freshest, freshest cuisine is a different experience to eating at one of this city's best restaurants.  This place takes you by surprise with local and shared dishes, restaurants providing a deep-fried entree of tasty dishes, comfort food offering, the selection of delicious confit items, service style...and a good way to keep yourself satisfied. I couldn't disagree more.
If you want in on the love of burgers and hot dogs, then Don Mickelson is right!  They are all about the dough and beef.  You can't beat their cheese fries which are tender and flavorful with a very seasoned beef paste which is
restaurant at Chicago's Pig House. At least she knows how to do it. It was even worse for her.
Great service; helpful owners; kitchen is nice and efficient. Too often you get interrupted. Do not try it...your waiter was rude and disrespectful to wait so long. Nothing about it satisfied the 5-stars to me. Although it isn't as bad as things I've ever seen, I would recommend going here if your very own...pick up the pint of bluebells! And, don't feel obliged to order coffee for the wait staff. (as in long as it is not so loud)
Its awesome.  The food was delicious and the service was good.  The service was attentive and if you have a complaint the owners of the restaurant definitely do what the owner wanted it to.  There is very nice ethnic food at Wrigley.  If you love the deep dish it is a must try. The specialty items are more veggies and
restaurant on 13 Avenue: Not only is it incredibly expensive, but a month and a half wait to get a table and sit one in is even longer. Everyone else I spoke to said they could see us too! When we come back they will give us dinner plates. All the menu managers they know got great food!
We had the veggie burger and it was just delicious. Delicious and flavorful. Just some bad apple fries on the side, one of which that's got a weird aroma. Our group was so impressed it only made sense that it should never be closed. You should get the free lunch line!
Had an amazing visit to CHUNG ordered shrimp and something incredible.
First of all, it is really rude. I'm not into sushi, so I had to ask...what the hell happened in these restaurants. And it's terrible.  My sister's mother is an amazing sushi chef...we all wanted something special, and when we got the trashcan
restaurant will be on the menu for around $8.
The bartenders in this neighborhood are very fair and approachable. I also enjoyed the prompt delivery of an appetizer. We chose the classic pasta sandwich because the side salad was tasty and flavorful and the seafood was decent. The authentic Vietnamese food paired with the branning sauces was also tasty. The selection was also excellent as well. These restaurant staff are professional in their delivery of interesting menus that they take the time to understand and try. With their prices and atmosphere, you could expect to be visiting again soon.
I felt the need to go a bit sooner than planned.  I felt it would be very cramped up here and I would have had a more comfortable dinner room in either location.  Not that they thought anything like a 15 minute wait.  So what was I thinking?  They would advertise to any store that had an all adult male bartenders and menus, and this wouldn't have been very helpful.
restaurant later. We had reservations here and they were awesome.  The pizza was delicious, great quality, and very flavorful.  We went there last night as a group of 5; some of the server's were super generous (she talked for half the price of a normal restaurant reservation, but it was way too high).  We left very surprised.  It was priced so high to be going here, but it was worth it to make good friends. The food was excellent too.  They serve unlimited (wa) pizza and fresh salads, but the gnocchi has still got some crunch (spelling mistake).  The staff is super friendly and helpful too, all the food is great, and they bring out a great selection of great items - sandwiches, sandwich at sampler places, sauces, steak, house wines, etc.  Very tasty!  The items that we ended up with on the regular did indeed not disappoint. We should try more options, especially if they
restaurant? The short answer is no. We are full serving -- plenty of chips and water -- from Italy and meats. And really, nice food! We are looking forward to seeing the next chef out there!
I'm a big fan of Casa Plata and their Bar.  My friend and I have come here several times and it is an authentic Mexican food!   I have never had another negative experience with their food -- if anyone really feels the need to remind us that this is their establishment it is absolutely best not to ask for reservations, although the staff will ensure we always get a few outstanding plates with what we ordered at the tables. The atmosphere is excellent, this is the place to go if you have ever been to a steakhouse in Chicago -- do not expect to become a dinnerhose advocate.  And if you do, you'll be absolutely delighted.  I expect by far the best Brazilian crepes in the area.  The duck can be very
restaurant and just trying to get on with life.
I remember going to Giordano's and finding it to be awesome for what it is.  It is still owned by the legendary Saliva Wine Bar, since it was founded in 1975.  The wine bar's distinctive flavors are brilliantly garnished with wine.  There are amazing complimentary sandwiches, fresh ingredients and awesome beer selections.  There is a whole menu that can be enjoyed as well.  The pizza was so good, it was worth stopping at for a bit.  Amazing from the chef who consistently delivered meat and bread to the pizzas, perfectly seasoned to perfection.
It's all about the atmosphere
This is the best Chicago foodie's experience.  It's worth every penny.  The food is tasty and outstanding.  It's definitely worth ordering your own food- like pasta dip dipping sauce-in dish or heavy flavored fish, dishes on all sides.  Otherwise, their e-seafood
restaurant made to celebrate the ending of a very long night of drunken anger with a tall, masculine man and his girlfriend... but it's too bad the restaurant was so full of beer and music to be good... 'toucheche! The food was amazing, the ambience beautiful and the atmosphere loud and full.  Really nice atmosphere here but not a reservation in my opinion, I might go back for dessert.Also, if you're looking for some savory, fast paced food, then you're gonna go to Gannett... Maybe even if you're short on time you can get the after delivery or server service to perfection.... Since I don't like short and dirty clothes and shaved heads, I would expect Gannett to have a street corner... but when I went I was thinking, nope. Nothing was going to happen, it just happened to be on location in downtown! Keep in mind this is me and I'm not complaining! Loved the place!
restaurant and you get it here without spending $5 or more. I've ordered a large number of dishes and have gotten plenty of just desserts. The food is fine, although my two coworkers complained about overcooked seafood (they called it short ribs).
Decent food but what you get from Anderson County. Very similar to other foodie start-ups. Some of the food is the authentic american style pork belly that rolls with perfection. The korean gawd are ness soups, while the sister restaurants are ice cold creations. Just good for one person!
My son started out on a mission for me to become a restaurant chef. In the next year, I worked full time on my first full time restaurant. The atmosphere is very enjoyable, it is friendly and informative. This is my second restaurant with a different attitude to a local ethnic restaurant.  Also, once that restaurant comes around I will become a friend and talk to everyone at Barrington restaurant that is
restaurant in London. Always hits the spot.
This Italian restaurant has long been "the forefather" of what Miami may be once known for. While they're not the traditional pizza places in the city, they have a warm, warm feel that offers everything your heart desires. The house pizzas are good but the counter seating for all is a warm, quiet place at least that you'll feel comfortable in and out of (albeit quite empty). The bartenders are awesome as well, they work really hard, just like our friend Lisey was. We recommend a reservation if you're looking for an open service type atmosphere.
This Italian restaurant is great and i think it's a hip spot.  However, it's not a terrible place.  They have lunch here, dinner there and at some point in the afternoon you get your shoulder coffee and you have the chance to show off their awesome coffee if you aren't getting a table.  The people who do the cooking
restaurant. The desserts and wines include the chocolate decadent Sweet Corn Rolls, the hazelnut puffed fries, and of course the our own two cents for non-sauce desserts. Please feel free to suggest a favorite dessert pairing as our owner and staff are excellent and always looking for new ways to serve customers. The atmosphere and service is great, our server and restaurant manager are so nice and polite as to not interrupt our customer service. We feel we go right out of our way to support each and every one of our guests, our food tastes great, and the experience is fun. We recommend going to ANY and ALL of our restaurants to find out how to enjoy yourself!
Their menu is full of amazing experiences such as Blueberry cake, smoked pork ribs, chocolate with the crepe and pumpkin apple puffs. The pho joint with the sun food is the highlight as well! Just awesome. The best appetizer I have had in Chicago recently was the Tacos
restaurant, and it was nice to have a lil more cake! My server was great; she came with everything we wanted to try and ended up dining us all, including the spiced side dishes for dessert. I'm still going to be going back this year as I usually do for brunch but this one was the highlight. The atmosphere was pretty standard throughout the meal as well - I had the usual a&m dinner - a bit overpriced (something that most others had a hard time topping up), and the menu generally had something that didn't look right to me but was worth it (in a nice way).The wait staff was great, even if my initial expectations were inflated. We had the Churros and Marsala salads and the juices of crushed lemon cucumbers (top notch) in delicious creamy sauces for dinner.I'll be back again if the staff manages to deliver!<|endoftext|>
restaurant and show us a shop that only opens 9 hours a day (only open outside of Chicago!). Our selection is super-fresh and abundant. My sister and I use to work in Chicago and I always order at least a couple of visits a week. I have tried out several different options at Think Gum and I give them all a 5 out of 10. My favorite is the gelato-less bread, a massive piece of bread that perfectly complements the food perfectly. Go to Flamel's and it's a must have!
Food was great! great prices, an option of type of sushi rolls, and the first thing you'd notice is how comfortable they are on the salad bar! I have ordered five different types and feel like I have been at least five times! That said, the menu is a little full, although if you really want to party in the patio, skip the early dinner, and head for the balcony.Overall the food is fantastic and would definete
restaurant, but I am lazy, I just ate one - hmmm... - I'll let you know if you need anything more.  Yes this is where your reservation is.  My entree would get 5 - 6 people.  Please comment/email in so I know what you like.  I might not be even up to date on a thing... don't get me wrong, I love the place but what's up with w/on getting 10 people on your business with no reservations?
I have been going there for a couple years and they are great!  I wanted to try adding a lot of flavor to this and this was my first stop.  I had the ceviche and the sausage, and my veggie friend and I were both very pleased with the eggs benedict..the best I have ever had.  I do crave seafood (Gorgeous!) and have NEVER been disappointed with how great these are.  The guys at Ristor
restaurant: a large Spanish barlet with a steaming plate and steak. I personally love this place because I live near it. They have margaritas and chicken, but I prefer the burrito. My husband always gets a hamburger and is always happy. As a side note, when we were there a friend ordered a cilantro beer for us and when we made the reservation we were handed one bottle of "the Goldfish" at the foot of the plate. This is where we learned that cilantro is a spicy korean beer and meant he ordered the cilantro-in-a-pork sandwich at the foot of the plate!  Thank goodness!! I love the food and will be back!
There are things to say about it, I had it on tap for half the price!The place is the perfect blend of its authentic taste, service and experience. Everything is authentic! Whether it's a stand in or dish service, it's authentic, the two
restaurant and amuse bouche with people of all ages that regularly enjoy our cooking (yes, even from my hipster Chicago hipsters).
I lived on Strawberry Grove Drive, and loved every minute of it.  Not only do you enjoy a fun family vacation out in the city, it is cozy and affordable for all ages.  So much so that I order only one everyday.  And because of my love of organic and fresh vegetables, I can't be disappointed with the service.  Every diner in my neighborhood has yet to experience what I've experienced here.
Just made my way back for our 50th anniversary so quick!  And, I love it!  If your house is small or you're moving a lot, this can be one of the best restaurants in the city.  They have not only great dining experiences, but is also worth the wait.  The staff is fantastic, we ask about the weather, decor, service, and we're all extremely happy
restaurant and tables are great for anyone or the buffet as well as the lunch- special deals: we recommend the Lux Lux Nongue sushi from Napa and a bottle of blackened tuna. The food is fresh and flavorful, their tiki music always fills up quickly, which seems to hold a specialness in everyone's heart. I will definitely be coming back to this place!
very creative and super generous service by its owner, and the staff are really nice too.  i must mention the food that is at the top of this list ischeap, and not overly premium for a reasonable price.  who wouldn't love a Pizza Egg Sunda?  great pizza crust, delicious pizzas, and everything is really good.  it is rare that we have a waitstaff that has experience and heart..


This was my absolute favorite bar and I will never go back.The owner so passionate about the quality of his brews and the cuisine that went on at
restaurant, I had a massive bottle of Wonder One before I moved to Chicago, and it was well worth it. It's really good when you're watching me eat.I will be going back for another occasion to try some of their specialties.
My boyfriend and I love New Orleans.  They have also made a few more restaurants in my area, but haven't been as good as some of the other places in the area.  If you're unfamiliar with the city you are expected to be greeted by the hands of a few people...first, it's a house...with a comfortable exterior and surround view of the city. The inside was good and surprisingly intimate. The service was good and I would not be shocked if I was a customer, as I do with everything in my experience.
I had the main course, but I had the only major disappointment.  The seating was unwieldy.  I wish the menu had been changed since it was still in pre
restaurant doesn't pay enough attention to what's going on in the background to read about but is so busy with waiting tables and a lot of people just waiting at a table just for that type of price to take place. My friends and I use to like the atmosphere - especially the cafeteria - but it's rather empty.
My entire family, including three, friends and I stayed at Gaunt Carlsbad. All were very disappointed.  The food was bland and average - very bland - the chicken was the worst, and the soup was bloody ridiculous.  My server was never pleasant when I asked her what she wanted, and told her she wasn't supposed to make any reservations - unless it wasn't just the meats of the house.  She also spent a lot of time writing customer feedback cards (one for a woman and one for a man) on their behalf to act like patrons were always treated with respectful respect and kindness.  My brother-in-law read the whole
restaurant & speakeasy. Honestly they are boring though. Not something you'd choose to try and out of this world person would really recommend this restaurant.
I've been to this restaurant twice now. First time after work and I didn't notice it was so crowded at the time. Since then I've been back and have been thrilled with the food and service. The drinks are fantastic and they have fantastic wine. The menu is on point for casual dining if you're looking for something to eat on a regular basis. In addition I got to try the shrimp bisque of falafel bread and cheese. Very well thought out and I would recommend trying the chicken and chicken braised cauliflower. I'll give this place a try if there are other yelpers in town. I don't know what else I can give but it's not for me!
I didn't get my first reservation right away. Everyone seemed to know how to write English first and I felt that
restaurant. We still didn't get a full menu, but we were both looking forward to our breakfast and a treat to share a "liberated atmosphere". While we waited, we brought over a table at the bus stop, watched TV (just a box on the far wall right next to our table), and took pictures. I may have said a bit grumpy, but everyone was attentive, attentive, friendly, and the ONLY reason we ended up eating that weekend was because we could not find a phone number for our good old home. Our service was outstanding, staff was friendly, and the wine list was amazing. Our server even left our wallet on the table after their final toast after the last empty container of wine. I am not a fan of prix fixe dinners, but this was certainly a great dinner. Overall the dinner was fantastic!
Great meatloaf.  Their best offerings of the day were the pizza, which came off to be a bit pricey.
restaurant, It was enough to get a clean bill of health out of this place!We stopped in on Sunday and are eager to bring one back. Prices are very reasonable, and when we got in we were excited. While we usually bring a couple, which was always the case with our trip, it was nice to get the service to the point we could bring it home. Now that we are having the space ready to accommodate it, this is definitely a good place to go.
Love this place. The staff is definitely courteous and professional. The atmosphere is cool. The food is phenomenal. Our brother had his deli Sunday night which was great! I gave him a 5 star because we had a good steak that was tough to get but we definitely loved it. Get it now!
I remember when SteakHOUSE called me, a friend, about chicago burritos and I said yes! The atmosphere is awesome and the staff is awesome. Great food
restaurant. I thought it was a bit like something out of the Disney movie "Frozen", but I decided to go for the animal. The steak is what a steakhouses is, fried fish with hot sauce. Would give 5 stars! I am very fond of fried fish, and so would buy from there. Nicely decorated. Came a little early and because of the atmosphere I thought this place would be beautiful on the weekend. Next time I will go and try the barbeque; it is BYOB. 
Have never eaten a piece of heaven...especially the Roasted Rabbit, which is awesome.  The next time you go to pick up the store tell them they still give $10 for the chips, chips, etc and you won't regret it.  Be prepared to wait til the manager tells you what it is and you will get paid up front. The best portions of the day are the stewed chicken rolls.  Great place for an evening alone
restaurant, garlic and mushrooms only! The place is the best in every sense.
We went to this house some years ago, and each time we finished eating, a friend had a bite of bread. To be honest, the bread was just too thick to feed all. My friend, however, said the lobster bisque was good for only $1.40 - and most of the slices came out of my mouth without any flavor whatsoever. It was sad, as my friend who was fond of the bbq made him deliver them all. I guess this is why people like to go to me other houses that do not offer good food to wait too long.I think this was really an act of deference, that they didn't just order a steak steak just because a friend ordered a fries, or at least an order of fries. I think they really liked to create a unique food experience that could be imitated for everyone.
Food is excellent but i've never had
restaurant of choice for the region.We are most definitely going to recommend it as a dessert or lunch spot. The chicken asparagus is very good, it is very easy to make a delicious yet healthy meal, really delicious. The one reservation I could get was - the later portion was a little expensive (they wanted to charge two people a table for it, unfortunately) and I couldn't wait to be seated until after I had the dish and the dessert. I would give this place a 4.5 if it isn't recommended for a BYOB dinner.The overall score and the meal tasted FANTASTIC and if you haven't tried the dessert before, I'd not recommend waiting for the person who ordered the egg white cake because it could get too expensive. I would rate this place 4 out of 5 based on the results of the tasting.
AMAZING 5th place breakfast ever again.  I was originally hoping for another 5 star, as their English Specials had
restaurant, The Martini, Pizza Bar, etc.
Every place I have visited has felt familiar with the restaurant and so my head is set. The food is great, so as for the staff, it is good quality.The food, which we started with 4 shrimp and two crinkle crab
Thanks to dawg below, the cafe style bread that came with the PB&J was SO FOOD-FAST! The main course was the hubris of the middle aged pork chicken and two sides that we ordered as side dishes (so appetizers, drizzled under the pan. Not a recipe, just typical soup) to make them ready to eat (cut so it would sit nicely in the pan). Most of the waitresses were attentive and had a great time! Highly recommend that.
This place had better try, despite the fact that it was on my list. They have had pretty good food for hours but the range of options is endless, because if
restaurant*
This bar is closed on the weekends and at a cost of around $50 for a single person plus special beer/wine bottles. In addition, it feels like we are a place with a very open atmosphere. Seriously, it's overpriced for lunch. I can't wait to go there next week!
I only noticed that this place is so great when I went there for breakfast for dinner last week, it really was a feast for the senses.  Food wasn't especially good either, the pasta which I am not normally into, the charcuterie, etc.  I didn't even think about what people from out of town eat, but I think it is almost like a theme park.  Not exactly what you'd expect when a place like this has a super loud music that is impressive to look at.  I am super frustrated by the food, so even if you are interested in eating like a normal person, you will have to wait about 15 minutes
restaurant  for $12/person...we put our coupons through before our meal began because it was the only place on earth that cost $12/person.  At a point during dinner, it would have been possible for us to eat one chicken or seafood item for just $5.00/meal...just to end up with our food being cheaper than anything we had at the time.  We didn't eat enough so we ended up staying home. We sent out orders back and forth and was never picked up and eventually met up again.  Not only is that illegal, it puts our server's life at risk!  Our server was passed out, almost bloodied, while we were simply told the reason we needed to come and get the food.  I just hope this place is just a few things closer to home than it is to being cancelled.  This happens all the time and is one thing I would never have done anyway.
Went here once for dinner
restaurant and atmosphere.I have been to Alinea's twice and have never had any issues.  All of the dishes are fresh and delicious.  Delicious.
All right everybody!  It's great being here, and that's why I've been staying around for the past 6 years!
amazing and really fun place to eat  yeah i am not an overly picky eater. was into coffee and didnt have the kombucha needled by the staff, but after pizza, especially in the party, is as refreshing as the cold night at Fred's!!!!!
Love this place! So many delicious tacos (in my opinion the best i've had so far. chicken shabu tacos for sure.my favorite tacos are not on too expensive at The Blac Chichurri so you don't have to wait for plates) Our waiter was really nice and nice at every mention. Too bad all of his dishes are far too spicy and other than that this restaurant is
restaurant (made with 2 loaves of pork, organic cheese and one big bowl of red pepper flake).  (And one of them was a lot of beer!). You can be forgiven for being entranced by our experience but to try out Yerocchi' on our first day we had to wait a bit too long for our line up.  That said, we got home about an hour early (while the minimum for our craving list would be 50 sticks of wheatbread) and were able to order everything in the house.  Sadly, due to their reputation and popularity, we were told by our waitress that it was the gluten-free option that we would be accepting, not the pan fried brownies.  If it was meant to satisfy the gluten-free crowd, we would have wanted to place ourselves in a special something above this one so we had to try the available soy rolls before making our plan. (This is why I had the brownie rolls!)
restaurant-style. We had bibimbap and it was really filling. The salsa had fresh fig and lots of avocado flavor. My cabbada was tasty, too. We also had complimentary ranchero which was delicious. There is an interesting twist to this restaurant that is referred to as Sierra Larnati. It was pretty good.On the plus side, its southern-style wings were very flavorful and the fish were a little thin. Overall, a fun restaurant with some really special dishes and a small bit of the Northwest-style atmosphere.
Hotel has great food!   Plenty of food!!!  Plenty of room!  Plenty of parking!  Lots of storage!!!  Can't stop working here if you can stomach the fact that this is a remodeled place!
We went at 4:30 am for dinner.   On the night that we wanted to have some chance to taste fresh ingredients, a coxie soggy girl came to
restaurant. New dining room across from where you would be seated.Gourmet aps i'm in alan and with a little less papa chicken and the meat is great. I highly recommend!
I've been here many times, it has never lacked flavor.  Loved it from the time I first visited it to my last visit there and I haven't stopped since.The chicken is now my favorite. They start from $15, only $6/per chicken. I almost want to go back and buy another chicken even if I don't have chicken they are very good!
Been there 5 times now and it's no surprise what you have is that it's a popular place. Fresh-made fresh bruschetta and salads plus salsas are great. Hands down, the best burger ever!The walls/brickwall looks great and does exactly what you expect to hear in Texas, the ambiance comes from The Smokers, I've been
restaurant
I ordered the Casabian soup this past weekend and it was so good! Simply delicious, the falafel and crust melts in your mouth with everything they put together! They add a little extra salt to keep things fresh and good. I will definitely go back.
First thing we had were the seasonal braised ceviche - I love the herbified fruit on the side. Crispy and tender, good texture and delicious. The server was always friendly. I'm not sure if she's vegan, but I like to keep something vegan around because she knows what she's doing. The food was the best. This location had the classic ingredients (salad-based sausage, beef broth, fruit, pineapple) which made it really good. I am still thinking about the options on that salad bar for sure - that was also such a huge hit. The other dishes had some sort of fish filling for the very special occasion, which I love. All that said,
restaurant has an interesting and unique menu that looks completely standard fare. It's affordable though!
I love the restaurant.  I'm extremely pro in music.  It's a great place to get another drink.  I've been wanting to try it for a while and am glad I do!
I've been hanging out here since I was a kid but I have never been quite sure what it would have tasted like to be in one of the other regional restaurants.  The salad bar and the one stall area being quite casual are so friendly that you'll never see a new owner come in and take your spot.  Other than that they're incredibly creative and great for a romantic evening.
I did a brief review on the Douglass Bayonets too.  Great food with a fabulous atmosphere.
Nancy and I enjoyed Chicago delicious ambiance.  They host food to the party!  After just a few days we decided to try something different and decided we would
restaurant served fresh with lukewarm water or cream. MOM MO HANANED A GREAT SKELLY ROOM!We really wanted to go here for lunch. The food is okay. MOM IS JUST TOO HEATED! There were 5 tables in the room and it was a very busy place, we had time to sit at table which gave us more opportunity to have a good meal. Menu choices were thin as well and the place was pretty small. There were 2 tables for customers seated on two flights of stairs and tables for customers at the table next to them. It was always busy with people sitting outside waiting for them to arrive. Great service and ambiance. Only course that can change an eater is when an exception can be made.
I love this place! I don't know if I can leave because it's where I love talking to friends, but it's not short by any means. First of all, it's BYOB. The service
restaurant, organic food, and a great public art of the arts. It's a very unique place.The place was full when I visited the area and I had a feeling for it at first. The dining room was very private and the entire dining room was surrounded by an extensive variety of things on view from a 4.5 foot by 9 foot window. I was really looking forward to exploring all of the different menu items in the restaurant's dining room. However, it was a really busy and busy time for me as my buddies of three and I shared a table with five other friends for the first time. We were most definitely looking forward to our date or the night before, so I was honestly looking forward to spending some time and space to be enjoying a meal we have all been really looking forward to! This place is something of a prime example of a not-so-famous establishment in the middle of their busy dining experience, with very very good people who appreciate the food
restaurant. Other places nearby are perfectly placed to offer everything about the Bakery. What I love the most about the Bakery is their small selection of food. So please check the menu as it does not fit your style of eating and they have been very accommodating.
Awful!!!! I always like to make my own veggie dishes. My wife and I love their roasted pigfish and my hubby doesn't eat pigfish very often. I love their frozen capers...don't you think they also do too? If I was starting out as a vegetarian, my wife would order them and promptly get our cash (part of my budget) as well as any other veggie dishes we were going to have. And my husband's daily food order would be the side which was really the real highlight. Not only is their cheese and cheese sauces extraordinary, but their "house guests" - literally your girlfriend! I was going to write about them at some point, but alas!We
restaurant.  It's super friendly and have great food, so if you are looking for sushi, this is the place for you.  I highly recommend this place to anyone that gets there after a big night out.  I went with my boyfriend and he was just ok. I also had to dine with the waitress so she was extremely polite and had nice manners.  She did end up having a good time with us.I really enjoyed watching the show last night. We will definitely be going back and waiting.
Wow!!!
Went to Texas last night for dinner and was surprised to find a killer steakhouse so close to my home. Started out impressed by the owner and dishes. They have great food and you can get creative on your meal time. Even today their kitchen was very comfortable and their mini potluck area is filled with thoughtful and creative food choices.  We shared a bbq pork noodle soup on a Saturday morning as well as a sunda
restaurant and manager.) He left for a place he just found out it was full -- with only two families available.The poor souls that greeted me at the door and carried it out in the aisle gave me an absolutely glowing review of their restaurant -- for one of them, I had the best hash brown I've ever had at Nuevo Leon (Sausage Specials and Eel Lights) as well as the saltiest, creamy and lightest mexican chicken I've ever had. The servers were friendly and knowledgeable, and the food was just so perfectly paired with that speciality. All in all, I'm returning, almost in cahoots with dinner & a friend. We were there, rushed to full within two minutes of opening for any reason whatsoever (though we must not have been surprised at all). Don't do this next time you want a hot dogs car..
I wish I'd go back there every night but when I went there Saturday after a total
restaurant I absolutely love it.  The beef is crispy and flavorful and I've been having a great time.  I love my salad so much because I could eat raw corn salsa, which was so good! I love what you get at green.  It is super easy to find food and it's so good.  I can't wait to try the new Nuevo Leon.
Love Chicago. I've been to see all of the cool shows and the experience is incredible. Everyone in town who came here to order drinks was super stoked. All day long, we were always eating great food.  Love the owner and definitely want to visit my sister - she loves seeing our new restaurants and runs away every now and again. Thanks sardine!
The job was GREAT.  My mom had a great story about me not even kidding about being in the bar - and went out with me for the night...very charming, and informative.
Yummy! It's
restaurant-department was not always the best, but had great service and could eat anywhere you wanted. What else to call it, I guess?  The place is at a nice end and it serves drinks and hot dogs, the dogs are awesome, you should take them to the door!!!  I think this place would be perfect for a date!!
this is the best sausage roll i have ever eaten! I have had so much sausage...got as far as a garlic bbq salad...eh... the sauce came out terrific! yummy with the tomatoes and vegetables to put it in a generous bowl. came very fast. reeking gaius?in the 90 mins i got 2 of them im not sure about anymore, the wait is still alot longer.came around twice  your server so when we first came in she asked if we wanted to shake hands and we agreed, we all didn't agree so she asked us and we walked in and i dont know
restaurant, you will often find it difficult to find a spot. (Gah!) But here's the deal: we found a book of it that you are sure will just taste amazing.  I mean, they were literally completely full.  But without further ado, I am going to add my recommendation to everyone's appetizer: Handmade Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Brownie.   Handmade, and especially if you are a fan of the Banana Bread! What a difference between a complete cookie and a semi-prepared cookie!  Let me just say, I don't think I have ever had a place that tastes so similar to a freestyle breakfast place in Chicago.  There are such places.  The Oatmeal Brownie is so different from the M&M's Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Brownie.  The almond flavored Oatmeal Brownie is different and more melted than the Oatmeal Brownie.  The Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Brownie has the top box of
restaurant and delivery is by monday.
One of my favorite  loves in the city! I came here for a visit on my birthday with my wife and she loves it! The food is good too, you can't beat the atmosphere here. The girls make fun of the poor Chinese tourists all the time, by the way... ask them if they look at you from the street and they smile. I'd just give 3 stars if there was less criticism there. I've been to Italy with friends and no complaints, there are too many great restaurants on the go. My waiter, who is great guy, was also great. Very friendly and every once in a while an employee does a good job there.
This is the best place to eat lunch at!!                                            
restaurant and Saturday night's just relax your legs and enjoy the snazzy interior. The food at 395 Sorrento-wares the flavor of a grilled eggplant, the margaritas, and the salad bar under a salad bar. If you love chicken, chicken wings, or trout or it's paired with french fries or barbeque or dessert or drink it takes you up to 3 hours to come in and sit next to my tables. Really, this place has this.
I was looking for a vegetarian option. Well, quite fast.  I walked in for my family and there was no menu on how they would meet.  Maybe they got it because our dining room guests complained about reservation fees?  Maybe they wanted to talk to me about it?  If they really wanted to bring in friends to take a group out to dinner, why did they instead just ask me to write to one of the chefs and list the restaurants where we'd get reservations?
restaurant is very inexpensive, while the "best Greek food in Chicago" (or at least on one occasion) is the result of popularity.
Seriously, if you have not been around my neighborhood I really hope that you will. They have great food with excellent service and the atmosphere is fun to visit.  I personally loved this place because of the beautifully decorated dining room, great ambiance and an elegant interior.I would recommend going there if you are looking for something tasty and as per our favorite dishes. I love the rooftop patio and the Kloos Bar and Palace is a great place to sit and relax. The ambiance is nice, the food is excellent and if the owner can't please his wife or the server, there are a lot of options.
I had an awesome night tonight.  I had some huge chunks of pineapple on the salad bar.  Then my girlfriend asked if I could sit out for the night and I said no!  She ordered the appet
restaurant: After that night was just as good. It was BYOB and only had a couple beers. The service was okay, but they tried something different.  Their selection was close to average, but in the end it was the better wine than you would have thought. As for the pretzel appetizer, the cheese roll that was served in the saucepan was bigger than my dinner plate (and the cheese roll salad was way bigger). I was impressed with their meatloaf and table service, I was impressed with the appetizers that were served with their pasta tortilla and pasta sponge. After they added the mushrooms, I couldnt get enough of the rest of the meal.On a sad note, the green tea party just started. Yum. Yes, the public is waiting a little bit longer and possibly hours to get their tray ready. Check out the menu later on in the meal.
I've been coming here for about a month and I think it's been
restaurant. I spent a total of about $17 in food.My girlfriend and I decided to get churros since our lunch just didn't have enough meat.  We weren't willing to wait any longer, so we ordered things out, picked them up, and brought them home.  I didn't ask for any type of entree.  The'real' thing was very generous.  The bill came off at $11.50.  Overall, I highly recommend trying it out for yourself and maybe even sitting down a little for a game of hoyo to enjoy, since this place is BYOB. The staff is nice and the waitresses are attentive.  I recommend checking out this place very early in the morning if you want to try something new!  I really do hope you go for a bite before you go to kick around the gnocchi.
I must say the way my parents ran out of chicken yesterday was not nothing short of awesome.
restaurant and shop.
Manteca's's is one of the great restaurants in Lincoln Park. I've lived in Lincoln Park my whole life, and the food is always quite good. Their chipotle banquets are so tasty. Have anyone who is ever down at Steak Toasted Beef asked? And still the martini menu is very nice and satisfying. It's always cool and inviting to be the hostess/hostess/manager.
I love this place because of the quality, atmosphere, food, service.  It's a great place for people who love their craft, good music, great atmosphere, solid drinks, classic sushi and great food.
likes this place. my first one just didn't come and I had another one for $7.25. they have them, the menu is a bit on the extreme side but for the price it looks good.The restaurant was REALLY accommodating. The wait staff were nice and welcoming and the staff was also
restaurant. I'd definitely go back. -or--
No way there is a place better than Mike Schwaiss's at...Worst Restaurant in Chicago.The soup is bland, poorly designed, and has no flavor whatsoever...Would only recommend if you'd call it worth a visit.
Wow, really, for someone with an exceptionally extensive understanding of culinary artistry, this is definitely worth a visit. Located in uptown, we have great food, and the bar is the only thing standing between you and that other bar across the street. For the brunch menu, it's all about ordering a round or two of pancakes. The two courses and cocktails we ordered were fabulous. The wife also came with her three entrees. The main course, egg rolls, was delicious. The whole thing is amazing and amazing, too. We're both huge carnivores, so I didn't have the same craving for pig liver roll. We have to have the chopstick panini but
restaurant. There is a second wait until late in the evening.The conversation between Crust and Smith is simple - Crust is excited to share a plate of the heart of Edible Braised Pork, then pop a couple of the drinks in the mug. They also show good service. Then, when the conversation turns to your favourite new cheese, your eyes are only directed to your lips and lips will automatically dilate - why did that happen? How old did I get to taste Cheese Brunch at 4 years old? Maybe it was because, considering my age, I've never eaten such cheese - it was fantastic. Be prepared to stand a slight bit or two of it to your side. Waitresses help guys in their (obviously unique) appetites, allowing everyone in the restaurant a chance to say hello.
Amazing crispy chicken and seafood sandwich at this expensive Italian restaurant. So for the best menu in Chicago, ask for only one bite of it: fresh pork in the
restaurant last week. It's a great place to dine, but I never actually found it boring.
This place is awesome and worth having a friend. I've been here twice, and it was the best meal I've had in Chicago so far. While the food was okay, it still wasn't the best. I would definitely go back with another friend.
I thought I saw the cake when I was out to dinner and thought, no, it's not good. I even expected the authentic, authentic eating experience I had to go through, but the pancakes in this place are DELICIOUS and I have to say, they taste, feel so good.  Baked i guess, but very buttery.  All I want is to go back to heaven, to eat something  you wouldn't eat at a Chinese restaurant.
When my foodie friend and I had breakfast in the Bay Area this past Friday, we had a mason jar covered in red
restaurant, smooth-steaming sushi, great service, open on Saturdays and Sundays and staffed by new employees. The tea lounge's guests take advantage of this place, and we've received 4 fresh entrees, and every new entree I've had has more than my share of opinions and memories.
Great BBQ...surprise! I just realized I love this place. The ambience is very cool!Came here for my birthday and it was good, but its time for more beef sauce, beer, and I had to go again for brunch. I thought it was too loud, but it was the right place and I liked the beer (but it isn't brewed and its only in brine form). I recommend going again for the wine.
I will definitely be coming here more often.  This is pretty far from Greek Orthodox, they bring you wine, but not overpriced.  My go-to coffee is usually Mardi Gras.  If you are
restaurant to his clients. 1 was THE BEST! I love how the duck was handled and the meat tasted just as good as the butter dish!! My first thought was, oh oh please guys this is a divey dive bar, don't think you can do this place, you're down!  But what was fun was every part of it including the authentic nipoke in his face!The worst part about this place is the smell.  I had one of their drinks & couldn't take myself too seriously since I'd never had any alcohol. I'm a huge fan of Disney decor but this is not a classy restaurant that compliments your living room decor! My god, what do you think I was drinking? (flavours?).This may have been my dream restaurant in Chicago, just not good enough to justify the living room decor or ambiance of this eatery!  Yet, the price is pretty reasonable considering how much I want my wife & I to eat here to
restaurant: HOPPIES. By request, I also mention it is highly recommended.I know I said my bar has the best chicken dishes I've ever had. They brought in a few different ones and it was consistently better. I would definitely recommend them as a side item if you're a serious chicken lover. The staff is great and the prices are reasonable. Oh, and I also tip the man for his excellent Sushi!Just an FYI. I must say, my friend and I were at Piedmont during the week with two of our most loyal customers. The most memorable thing was with Avi, who even sent me an organic sourdough bread. One of my favorite.Had a glass of Jack Daniel's champagne which was awesome!The restaurant has a great atmosphere, friendly staff, and fantastic food. It was my first experience in Chicago food service, and this place has been going strong for two years. I will definitely be back again, the food
restaurant- size since the moment I started taking care of my bills.  It was a good deal, but probably that was the reason why I chose it.
Well, it was packed. The waitress' address and I were offered a visit and the meal there was friendly - nothing surprising. We went for the 12.5 min. a person and even a 5 min restaurant slot. They brought us a 6 cupholdor I got at l'ing. Well, once again, nothing unexpected. We waited 5 hours a table, 20 minutes in line for the worst, making it 8-10 hours. Oh yes, lots of time I forgot I wasn't there so to speak and were not taken to the cantina and sub that we walked out anyway. Let me repeat, I wasn't there to make some quick-order notes as to whether their coffee was the best and you can order it anywhere and easily. I was here to check on my credit card by the

I've written several times about service, but this place is worth the visit. Very tasty and well priced.
Great interior, i am almost there, i will be coming back soon..they have a good red pepper salad the first night and the second night it is really hot inside that its amazing and happy.
Its a treasure and home town you want to visit, If you really want to try the bar next to it, this place
restaurant!
I am a very simple person. But seeing that i get new plates a lot and never expect to find something in great price. Very good food, super tasty, I think the crust is pretty well cooked. I found the tortas to be particularly special.  I have always been a fan of the fish dishes.  In my experience this is what these dishes are about: their make up of garlic and their noodles.  If you ever go to New Orleans, go to this place. It is a bit pricey and has a good wait. And I am a big fan of Spalach, but never will be going back. Not for show-off eaters or price.
My boyfriend and I do not order any more jalapeno peppers. So needless to say, we order 3 things the same night. Our first order was 5 large, high quality churros that I've been able to find on restaurants & wholesale (the other 3 of
restaurant* with some red and gold crepes and assorted dried fruit.  Its okay they have a smoky charcuterie, but for the place it has an old school diner vibe that is the meanest as some places add music.  The best entrees are...  the salad with cherry meringue and a rather delicious ice cream sundae.I am not a fan of the fajita bar where things were consistent enough.  The nigiri and cheese torta (but just add cheese) and mojitos.  I have been giving it several stars on Yelp, but this is my favorite burrito place.
Don't go here!  Go to him!  He's really annoying and very loud.  But, you can just go and experience what he's doing right here. My Favorite... The Chicken Puffs (on rye)... great taste with a bread batter next to it.  You wont be disappointed. Also, the candle
restaurant type while trying to find food and relaxing places to sit.
Anytime and I must say, sorry I'm someone who has a limited diet. All other KBC restaurants charge lower prices and great food, good service, and clean floors.  Wouldnt give it a 5, but this place had a delicious delivery crew, care and service.
My boyfriend and I went on our first night at this thrift store because we wanted to pick up some cheap Disney comics. Needless to say we skipped out on getting anything we wanted.  Very disappointed.  Maybe we were under-informed, but most of the food and cocktails tasted like kids playing with a stick.  We were completely under-informed and not at all sure if the big flavors were from overly-sweet chocolate bars or pastries, so we decided to order the Shrimp is the King.   It was very bland and lacking on all of its other socialities.   I could easily drink it
restaurant had red beets and caramelized onions. I think the service was awesome, but it did end up being rude to leave drinks on and off the table for 30 minutes.
Crisp steak, Mexican, or grilled chicken.Great casual/eat-it-out atmosphere. Some people go out of their way to stand in line for 3 hours after eating, sometimes even multiple drinks.
This place does not treat you right.  It is just beautiful and cool.  Just to die for.  Service is pretty bad, but honestly, this is one of those places you go to in New York and eat at as long as you do, and look good.  My mom is now in Chicago and my cousin is in Mexico.  I love going to this place with a family and I'm always greeted by fellow locals.  I know good food is around the corner, so don't expect to pass up this awesome spot for some seriously good Mexican food.

restaurant; the red meat filling is stuffed, and the shawarma bun is meat and flavor.The hairbread is delicious and their beard oil is perfectly tender.The bartender was very nice and said that I could have the Beef behind my back any day.I was curious if you were looking for the most authentic meat you can find anywhere in the country or how you could get there. While it's totally reasonable I was the only person with reservations as they typically sit around open tables for 3 hours and at no cost, the ladies in front of me found the space pretty comfortable to share and are so nice.
I love this place!   I lived in Chicago and was on the reservation for about 30-45 minutes, but by 4am I was on the restaurant reservation waiting for our tables and had run into some real karjins.  Their owner, Mazy Duck is also a owner of the tavern and they staff us all to choose their menu, a bit
restaurant Chef is back.  He is cute and helpful, but he is busy and I wonder if this place has a ceiling or ceiling, except they always feel like they work closely with chef Chris Roberts.  I love this place, and feel he is a competent, honest, humble man.  I am a small child who always thinks about my interest in food and after looking at his menu I became hooked.  He's a nice guy but he's a very reserved, angry guy.  Service was fair, tasty and very helpful.  It was a little busy but we were able to get our food and are going back for sure.
I love this place. It has a loud server that is fantastic. The dinner portion is about $12.00 per person. The service is pretty friendly. It takes a lot of work. I also got a free appetizer which has also been left untouched.
Mmmm, I got a few dinner reservations!   
restaurant of the year, but unlike most the dish I found fairly well. Their hot dog bun fell apart. You could taste the broth. No, there are different kinds of red blood. And just because there aren't many of them, the wings, sirloin, tortilla stuffed and veggies, and then there are their chicken bisque were all eaten and eaten to perfection. It was a waste.Again...Do not call it a waste. I don't recall all the horrible recipes served here, but suffice it to say, as awful as these were, you don't want to miss out on this event.  If you are like me and were hoping to have a nice slow run, check out their falafel. It is simply not. Because even though they say the sauce is not bad, it actually fails to disappoint. I love this place, the music and atmosphere is incredible, it is great for cold weather, and the great food in the kitchen is extremely
restaurant menu, which also included gluten-free options. There was also a large complimentary serving of pecan bread and all our steak sandwiches. Everyone had a good time too.  From that first table we were awestruck! On top of that, food was outstanding. The restroom is like a sauna. When you leave there your body is seen, and your mind can be devoured! Check out what you think of food at Senseca's!!!!
"Goes to lunch, twice a week. I love the salmon dish..but it's not good. Atmosphere is bleak, small prices, and of very little variety. Just the price is not worth the experience.  Service has been terrible.  Has had been packed since I began my travel.  You will not go back."
Everything I have ever wanted to try had problems.  For example, the caramelized onions were actually far from terrible.  I think this was my first place to
restaurant is great. From mild to very fine, they have a great selection of ingredients, including crisp, thin cuts, greens, and greens that have a nice jolt of savory flavor.
Best steak in town on a Friday night with a great taste. I've been to Shrimp Mill before and have been a huge fan.   Great service and great food.  Love their salad bar.  Come on down the street for their after party - fantastic!
The last time I went we tried this place.  The menu changes every week and we've tried them all the time.  We both order a party of 4 and get 3 stars because I ordered their chicken stew.  At the end of the meal the way is two chicken plates and then the mix of beef and pork.  The combo of two dishes was amazing.I don't eat meat really often but this place seems to hang around and take care of people.
Went here with my girlfriend
restaurant, chicken and mashed potatoes, it is fresh and authentic. The trolley is super convenient, their gyros are ridiculously comfortable, but very expensive so we are forced to wait 4-7 hrs. Overall, great place to eat on the weekends and lunch, be prepared to miss the portions and wait hours, I highly recommend that.
I love their French toast. i don't really taste french toast so i really don't like it. this place is great but i would prefer it not to be around the corner. oh my gawps.
The chair was great, the velvet terracotta pizza is fantastic and the atmosphere is wonderful.  My fiance and I went there a few weeks ago, to the Two Island Inn restaurant! The food is delicious, the atmosphere is engaging and yet quiet.  We had the spinach stuffed chewy stuffed with a deep roasted mushroom & salmon. There was a single star too that I was embarrassed to recognize due to the amount of
restaurant, Cafe Giardin, and italian pizza, is absolutely unique. The food was fantastic and I would highly recommend to everyone who works in the neighborhood.
Big old Cuban food is FANTASTIC. I really enjoyed the Cubic bar. Brought some Italian food with me here last week and I will definitely be back.
If you are in the Chicago area and have been patiently waiting for one of those good Cuban food, chances are it's coming out soon. The desserts are amazing and italian & vegan creations are so tasty. The lunch specials are also fantastic. I would definitely recommend checking this place out.
Very good food, excellent service, and high quality brews. I would definitely go back, and make some additions to my "psychedelic brew" schedule if I am lucky to go.
Could not pass up a romantic night out with this great place!  Nice homemade ambiance, great bar and amazing beer selection!!!  Will never go
restaurant cooking. I have tried several different chefs and all have brought delicious food and meals together. That being said, it always adds up to delicious dishes!
I am from the south side of Chicago and feel like i'm visiting my favorite neighborhood in town. I tend to celebrate in new ways too often but this one is definitely the best! Food is always just right and I would try and go there a lot. To top it off, I also wanted to thank God that these refried beans come from across the street from my house!  My friend had saved us alot of money on oil now we brought home the oil. If that's not enough, we also tried Burr I got at a restaurant earlier in the month which was great! Try it, I think you will love it.
Yummy chorizo with huge portion.  The salsa we got was a bit stiff and I had to do the math - which would have been horrible if it wasn't for
restaurant size and service is exceptional; while eating the first bite (nice lemon slices) you get a nice large pie which is served so highly!We've tried several other places and each has delivered on more than a few different things (I was able to walk into this place in the last week). So, this review is a comprehensive taste test and won't be breaking any hearts. If you're ever in San Francisco, go to Bad Bar and take this! Overall, Chicago and Phoenix are exciting places to eat and it's not the place to turn to for a quick meal.
This has been one of my favorite restaurants in town.  It's packed, casual and cheap.  It's hard to get your table after a few orders of Italian food.  The food is good, decent, but overall, the decor is good.  I love the fact that everyone on the staff is in their droves to celebrate the new menu and it's fun to go and chat
restaurant.
We highly recommend a small pub if you have the time. Service always warm and well prepared. If there are five dogs in your party, the guests are far more likely to come to their table or not overjoyed by the food. The ambience and attention to detail are perfectly typical of Great Lakes and much needed modernism, if not from the Nuevo Leon.I can't wait to come back here and try the Luxini Dessert Sodas!
Not very popular at brunch here but good casual brunch. Great place to go on a Monday night.
by reason of its location on the 5way and the taste/exceedance, this place is the place to go.  Be sure to wait 45 minutes to pick up your lunch, because the real deal is waiting 20 minutes to bring a tray.  As you walk out the menu, the restaurant gets the theme: a meal.  Unfortunately, not everyone that works at the restaurant can
restaurant (family), over-priced dining, very small seating area, very crowded. The biggest complaint I have is the tables which are stuffed out at the back of the house, and are too small for my taste, I often give the library/entrance a run for it by dining to small one; no other place offers that.
this place is a must try! we have been staying at Grand Grille the past 2 years as a family...first time i went there in 2011 we had dinner at Quito and the date was celebrated there. Everything was on the menu...first we were given two courses of water salad with organic lettuce and smoked egg. three hours later, we decided to bring our other party, group 2: we were going to Green when the waitress, did a random job. wow i can't believe this restaurant is so inexpensive with just a few bucks.a must try...i went at no. 10. every single time we left it was on
restaurant for lunch and dinner. Service is excellent, especially for those who don't have their own restaurant in the neighborhood. And their service and food are superb. Expect a bumpy wait.
Fresh juices, fantastic fries. Definitely a must for this bar to hang out, eat before you eat.  What a gem to be in this neighborhood.
Great place for tacos. But, they know this neighborhood and want people to go there and taco. Everything is great, but, people are walking around with tickets and will usually come when it suits them. I know because I have been there one of the bigger number I've been there - I got one of the appetizers. Oh, and it was a huge bowl. This is amazing! One of the best tacos I've ever had! Never experienced this kind of chicken sauce without a server. Never.
I like the color. The chicken sandwiches, ofcourse. Lots of styles. More The olives, too. They
restaurant, $50 off premium....or just a bottle and a go...
Went here last night. Sigh....They have some really great art, when it comes to coffee but would have preferred the space up front more.We'll be back for dessert.
This is one of the best haunted houses in South LA. This is why I love it so much. They're definitely the best!  They have the best food,esto,iesto food - because it is always delicious.  You're always free to pick up something and go because everyone is at the same bar so it just feels right.I highly recommend This location.
Everyone is talking about this place. From Thai entrees to trendy, you'll be rolling the dice.  People usually tell me this is my favorite option since it always becomes available late. My favorite new restaurant in Roto Shores is Stew,"
Sometimes I crave this place so much I'll go here for dinner every
restaurant: Cornucopia
The loaf of bread was exquisite!
Although this place is called Italian, the interior is authentic, and well made.  Go for the fragrant spaghetti.  Although some of the flavors in the soup is contemporary Italian, they are very good.  The reason this restaurant is called Italian may be due to what that unique Italian food like spaghetti do to the Italian people.  With "handcrafted" Italian is not only an ingredient at the heart of this restaurant but also to the experience of a customer that we had personally had.  I guess that's what makes it one of our favorite places to eat in Chicago.  The food is fresh, the staff is very attentive, and everything so well is homemade.  They also have selections of ingredients.  In addition, very few Italian restaurants are as well prepared and meet the expectations of the people who own it all.  And,  while some of the better Italian restaurants may turn out to be
restaurant/stove to its diners. Total Eunice 1 servings = 3.97 half-suckers who waited over the course of 45 minutes for what is called an after-dinner joint for less than $2.95.  Gourmet restaurant food was in short supply.  (This blog is short, but I would love to share some of it.)  Portions of this restaurant were highly advertised.  The "black pepper kalamatao," the breads served on a potato-based slice, was truly excellent.  I will never go back.  The food was in quantity, and did the job well.  The potato and cheese dishes were outstanding, both for size and variety.  The cheese and hotdogs were really good.  The bread was outstanding with some great variations on a variety of toppings.  The coffee was wonderful.  The value of the food, which for this particular place was pretty solid, was high.
restaurant restaurant during the week!  This was the worst experience of the week so far.  Bad service.  The waitress (who is all wimpy for a restaurant) told me to return with an outfit or they would chop my table up.  She seemed annoyed at us until I asked for the encased pad thierher and somehow she told us it could not be removed and then told me to go away.  In order to prevent them from going in and giving us our regular meal we have to have a Special Delivery order to cover the costs of keeping a "special table".  The price we paid in escrow was also incredibly inflated and was a formality for us as guests as we waited.  Another problem with the service was that it went on for a good thirty-five minutes with no reaction from staff.
Best Caly pancake bar in Chicago. Best pizza in town!  Great place to grab drinks & check out a friend when he's
restaurant. Our burgers are better, often by our guacamole or the exchequer sandwiches, but they're still good and a lot of work to put in.
As a second rate restaurant, I admit that my girlfriend and I were our first impression of such a small restaurant. When we left our dorm at college, our father and I sat down and tried a slightly different menu that we thought was pretty generic and about the same size as what our mom ordered. I would not say that we can't agree with their choices, but I will always be talking about the past year for the sake of argument. For the past 3 months, since we both left this town in search of good, inexpensive drinks, only a few people have tried a newer, more appetizing sandwich with our family, or maybe a delicious version of an old sandwich from college, but nothing compares to this Chicago staple! We ordered the KFC Bell's premium burgers and the Spicy Beef Sandwich from
restaurant in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which alludes to the "American burger," but it's due for a visit from over the weekend. (They don't like to make anything stand out, so I'm going to stick with the burgers, unless they have other menu options that fall into the "questionable.") They're also not welcoming new members of the staff, which, especially on weekends, makes for an awkward event. (The waitstaff, however, is polite enough, since they're all so great to enjoy having.) For a bit of personality, especially for these guys, the waitress next to me was some dude named Bob. (My girlfriend and I don't usually take delivery to Cabrillo & Uno.) The in-laws seem to love Bob's personality, too: they can handle friendly people, answer questions about food, and welcome anybody in the group, all in a friendly, unassuming, and non-coerced manner. They also charge very
restaurant and waiter are very friendly as well, but the service here is ridiculous compared to in-town restaurants.I love the food, and for breakfast I'll try to pick them up at their desk.  Otherwise I'd give them 6 stars.  And if you're hoping to give them 5 stars for small portions and bagged breakfast the standard 3 star rating is definitely not the answer.
Best burrito ever.  The staff is quick and the food is excellent.  It is such a popular location, it's our specialty I usually go there twice a week.
The Goat Delicatessen is their best.   Great Spanish food and large portions.  Great ambiance.
They've been making excellent dining experience the same season and ordering very different kinds of food.The Beef Churro is simply amazing!  The soft yummy balsamic veal sauce, the Sabashes frites, the Churros couscous are huge.
restaurant.
Enjoy a nice meal. Only problem: this place is very busy and it is expensive!
My boyfriend and I visited last night and were somewhat disappointed to see that our food had not yet arrived. My words: go away.
Let's be real here: food doesn't get rave reviews from places in the big city. There's nothing going on inside the Zand Locker in Chicago.  That said, The Best Mexican Grill is great for dining and especially if you're a fan of spicy food in general. Oh and can you believe this: tacos are delicious, pretty much everyone is addicted to tortilla cuisine, but to top it off, THERE IS BEEF.... deliciously juicy pork belly with crispy, tender onion rings, deep-fried onions, and a good "germish."
One of my friends ordered the PB Poppy. The pork with carrots and cabbage was great. We got steamed lamb, mushroom risotto with alligator
restaurant manager joined us. No small expense though. My husband and I often go to bars to get a special occasion steak or a vegetarian option. The menus are absolutely divine and anything can be put into your menu.  He didn't even notice the menu was this weird and we went with him.
When I was in high school, it seemed like there was so much the neighborhood could do. But I never understood why such big a big gap in age/time/etc. was separating it all from the street food scene (since the neighborhood grew up around one place, two separate streets, fast food joints). The staff kept it casual, enjoyable, yet so much more affordable for me to sit at my desk and enjoy everyday food while learning new stuff. Our hostess took us to their signature Italian spots, and soon, I wasn't lost.The service and high prices from vendors that advertise themselves are just right for casual dining and casual food lovers. Just look at Tony Award
restaurant, very rare and can't really find someone who actually works here. Prices for the other sauces are ridiculous - not cheap (they have a high prices here), basically negates any quality within the restaurant.
I was fortunate enough to sit on this small selection when the hostess gave us her job title and asked how I was feeling about my work. She explained that the restaurant is a down section with limited parking. She seemed to feel like this place is great for people who just want to sit a table and eat.  These were not good recommendations, but that was the reason she gave us our first discount: $$ for two people plus $5 for the dinner and $8 for dessert (all prices point to the wines) and I can't imagine them taking that off their menu.   Not that great value, although the food is great, and I am open for business whenever I'm back.
I'm going to have to stop in for dinner next time around
restaurant, japanese food, and a couple other great places to start (especially during the summer months).
The Italian market is small, but they have a good selection of burritos and challah. They have japanese dinner options, which are similar to yolk, but the ingredients are different and are extremely spicy and full of flavor. It takes a bit to get your hands on one or two, and they are also packed with food to stay warm and spicy, with plenty of steaks. They are a little pricier, but that is the deal.
My favorite Italian restaurant! i have always been super excited about Italian food!  It is the very best.  Take out first class and the steak is cooked, which is great!  Everytime i go and try to take my food home and i miss them.  It is a great place to go for a good time in the week or long after the Big 5 or Super Bowl, they
restaurant, cured meats and freshly cooked cheeses!
Simply ordered the variety of soft cheeses and received a beautifully crafted entree. Wonderful atmosphere and excellent service. The oysters and okra with caramelized onions were first caught in my memory, and as soon as I had their drink I noticed the difference in the quality of the oysters and okra. I am always interested to try the fresh ones in any other restaurant, but their special sauce was excellent (including the grilled crab) and I would gladly pay for the longer wait.  They have great food and service.
I love Alinea. Can't wait to go back!
I have been going here for 5 years and will definitely go back for more. The setting is great and ambiance is great.  Our waiter just blew me away!  We even have a wife and kids table!!
It's beautiful and fun. Not as expensive, but BYOB! I go here all the time. No
restaurant set in Jerusalem and was perfectly placed. The dishes were DELICIOUS and the drinks came fairly quickly. Most of the time we will not be coming here again.
I made a reservation to get the Sizzler some appetizers on the pricey,  expensive side and the Food was  acceptable. The service was excellent. The rolls were a bit salty and the hotdog tasted more like fried chicken than I could have hoped. So I went with our two friends and ordered the live specials. The live specials were $8.50. The sizzler costs $12.75 for 5 appetizers and 3 wings. The sizzler seats have been okay, if you are looking for a cheap dinner for half a price it was well worth it.The wait staff was polite and knowledgeable. We also had the delicious avocado tostadas.
Great place. Cheap food for low prices  | but if the food was good, plus some extra pork... maybe my
restaurant is nice, and the whole menu is fresh.
If there is any positive move, it's this pizza place that will make your meal more appealing.  While you may be slow, the food and service is fantastic! We were there with a client who is a former sandwich snob, the servers at I've SABROSPICKE SERVICE CENTER have the best culinary techniques of any foodie I've ever met!  This is the place where you can pick out a beautiful piece of art and complete it with your dinner/restaurant.  I can't think of one place I've been to that won over so many other clients.  The menu is highly limited.  We ordered a pizza with goat cheese that was immediately placed on our plate.  But none of that overshadowed what we ordered.  We had been told that it was the best way to go with friends, but we had to wait 2 to 3 hours for the pizza to come
restaurant, fully the size of Italy. At least I ate one dish:  An egg salad with dried figs, a beautiful sweet potato, an apple pox with the raspberry sauce, a plain theise.  The only complaint I have for this place is the petite kitchen staff.
An excellent Mexican restaurant for the Chicago dining crowd, and for ultimate dining pleasure. Will be coming back soon!!
The food is fantastic, a very large portion is acceptable but the service is not attentive or impressive enough to overshadow their great food (or special occasion catering). The food is delicious, and the sauces are outstanding. Everything is brought together and the combination of incredible sauces, salads and stuffed waffles adds to the flavors.  Make sure you call the server to find out if they will be able to cook for you...and they will happily do it for you.
I went here to see what Chicago beef was good, I really liked the burgers but the burger with Fries
restaurant, the place was right in my face, hands down. The service was excellent and I was pleasantly surprised at all the people there. The food is amazing, but doesn't bite away at you like a back alley hamburger. My most favorite sandwich is always the la fin dale. If you have a special occasion, you will need to order the salad (which is easily over medium-rare, due to the meat) and it is $5.50 - I had this deli salad for $10.50, and the service was very professional. I have now never been disappointed with anything the guacamole was to my taste. I am not a big fan of fried chicken, which really sucks but I will eat that again soon enough.
love it. love it. I think the sauce is just too sweet.
The theme music is nice and energetic, it's done for a specific reason. Oh yeah the dishes were very good, I love
restaurant: Baibing (2/$12).
Total price: $27.95! Prices are extremely reasonable, and it's actually a little expensive on the weekends. The bathrooms are definitely crowded, so it's all just a matter of locating a 4 hour wait. In the evenings they run around asking if you're ready for a table. The Yelp reviews were awesome, and really helped me get my headache.
'Bullfrog' was my favorite Greek brunch spot ever. I love the sandwiches, its also hard to find them in the city anymore, its so expensive to come to Laineville. It's usually a little slow or dark, but I LOVE it so much!
Good deal and fresh love we ordered a little and took our waitress a few days early and discovered she didn't do the food any favors for us.  I told her how delicious it is, knowing we'd never order a slice of olives there.  My mom was completely mad that
restaurant at a restaurant in this case. Staff was great...we went here with 2 adults, 2 kids and 3 adults. It is great if your going to be close to the restaurants, but not too close for that. Had a quick lunch.
Thanks to Yelp for this restaurant. I ordered The Chicken Shrimp in Shepherd's Pie and it was delicious. It had kimchi, sun meat, red pepper paste.
Branched this food with Asian sardines and baked beans and the falafel's were wonderful! I will definitely be back and will be going back!
i've been looking forward to seeing this place for a long time but my experience here was a disappointing one. they do not make fresh sausages from scratch and usually just forget to charge. thats ridiculous if you dont like spicy foods then you probably dont understand. the atmosphere is just so tight and overcrowded and they are not really even making it in, and they actually get to

Hey, everybody. I was absolutely blown away on my recent visit to Melrose last night. I've been to Middle East Food for over 10 years, and I've found the restaurant to be an incredible destination for going and dining. (Don't get me wrong, a few years ago you could get a split pizza or fork salad). So, I would suggest that if you're looking to enjoy great food, don't go to this food restaurant. You should definitely take the SERIOUS RISK that you're going to be gone. This place is that food, and there's no guarantee you won't be disappointed, although if you don't have the juice to tell you that you're not going to go hungry the next time you come. I did bring
restaurant line up at 8 a.m., while Day One gets packed up at 5:30 a.m.

This place smells like ketchup on a tray of salty popcorn.  I tried the Belgian & Spiced Red Brunch Sandwich but it didn't taste like ketchup - it smelled of string cheese in various soggy dishes.  The pork at the other end of the line was significantly less than the oysters of the other side.  When walking to cook for a restaurant, it is common practice to ask the menu for an order for the most special restaurant.  They need to be clear about their menu and want you to be open to it.  We asked Chef Jaime for the Greek menu where and when we would be able to eat.  They suggested the pizza (a saucy Italian recipe) but I refused because the pasta was undercooked, and they insisted we
restaurant. How could you not. The pasta was extremely tender and well flavored.  If you're coming from a ton of foodie fans, this one will hit your fancy.  Try having it served outside.
Okay, so you've arrived on the right foot. The staff is nice and efficient and give you plenty of options to choose from.  Go to all the movie options in downtown!
Zombie! Mary Judson is a fun Greek foodie with an amazing range of dishes to choose from. She's off to a great start for another solid first year of her cooking career.If you are looking for Greek cuisine at all, try a Margherita as well!
Love this place! By far one of the most confusing places I have ever eaten.  They've been making incredible cheese rolls.  It's also great if you want to try different cheeses out on the menu.  They have salads that are homemade and tasty, so it's worth
restaurant, including all her staff, personal or family. SELFIE WITH THE GOOD LACE EXCELLENT TREASURE! He was super friendly and always had us fill out our order. SISTERLY, I highly recommend stopping by at Grand Central, he was great! I wouldn't be anywhere else, I don't think this place needs a restaurant like this, if everyone ate here, they would find it.
Hoo boy, I wouldn't be here again! Love Duck Hill!  My friends loved it, but if I could just pass it along to my roommate, I would!  She just wasn't interested enough for me, so I came here to try the fried shrimp and am still taking it out! I want my partner to tell her to have it later, please don't come there.  Yes, chicken are good too, but not amazing, there is simply too much oil!  They have a thin crust on the inside which is cr
restaurant, not the chef, if you enjoy deep dish or meatless restaurant. You may think this is crazy, but what they have is like a loogie man on a waiting list, a penitent grill bop, covered in tattoos and having a pretty deep dish meal. I should have said this was the best meal of the day, not as good as another bad one and I'm not giving this place enough credit. I should have been more like steak burrito but instead I'm just like dining in the extreme. Make sure you get a sushi sampler and to survive the exotic seasons...you won't find the food here boring. The food is a bit bland (but okay) when compared to the food at Deep Dish but I do get the table feel and the character of the place. Will give it another try soon as I get used to the restaurant as we walk out of here.
When the seafood was around 15 yrs ago I thought it would be impossible
restaurant. You are always greeted by the better portion which is fine, the kids are always bustling and friendly too. Plus, the food was never cooked. We would have liked to have eaten better, but at our cost that was ok. The wait and the strange dishes were out of this world. Even for dessert, they were not long. I hope the kitchen won't get that situation corrected soon enough and the restaurant can get better at what it is doing.
A little scary reading on Yelp because its in violation of the Food and Wine rules and I've had trouble coming up with my own - but I gotta say, the food here has always been good.  But its not all that cool.  Parking lot changes sometimes in the afternoon though.
Never had the privilege of a Thursday evening. Worth the wait.  As soon as it gets busy, they need to spice up the kitchen enough for the original menu - plus, the date nights I ate there were really good
restaurant website has gone. I will definitely be back, only I was having second thoughts here!
Stopped at Overflowing Rice for a few minutes during brunch. If you're from Orange County, this was a cool spot for a date.  Our waitress waited a long time for her food (first a while and then everything) but we finally got our table after 25 minutes (a 5-minute waiting is just too many), food was so good that I cannot find any food to accompany the appetizers (what's this?), and the show room (basically an indoor jazz room) is wonderfully clean and relaxing.  For $4 a pop, I would have come here anyway...
Gotta go DESTINED when I do. Service was great, prices were reasonable and not undercooked. Then they went out of their way to do something creative with the water. The pizza is spectacular and the bean bags were nice and tart. The hostess is simply too
restaurant" now you can get something for $15 and you get a margarita. I had the mushroom cake with spinach cream, and the shrimp and bacon cheesecake topped with some bright chocolate. I had the glass of vermouth water fudge pudding, not sure which one but I couldn't go wrong. My go-to, must-try counteroffer is the Gourmand, he's as good as new and very fresh. Overall, at least I'm not complaining.The restaurant is pretty. The food has a lot to offer, but a lot of high-end food, and some really excellent. So if you like breakfast, this will definitely satisfy you.
Yum! This place is always on the go.  Its a great spot to grab for a quick dinner or the lunch hour, drinks are always ready.  It's BYOB, but the place is always busy.  My oldest ever boyfriend went with him for lunch to try Vons v
restaurant, yes. Still though this place seems to get a lot of attention for their vegan dishes, which it tends to be, we were unable to find any of them on the menu. They were mostly full, but were for different reasons (and served differently). The menu features many homemade vegan options and although they're all well worth it (like the tiramisu crepe which takes ten minutes and the Salting-Pork Poached Slaw which came with 2 pieces of cheese) we couldn't come up with anything else as we found too many we liked. At least the food was reasonably priced.One to die for? WE NEVER GO BACK!
Food was okay but overall this place is a bit pricey for what you get. There are quite a few options to get to though, so a tip to avoid wasting money on food doesn't seem like a bad thing.
For the best pizza there is only one. Come on. This place is really good...so
restaurant was great!  Parking was decent and we arrived from outside to sit at one end of the bistro.   We would definitely go back.  We were seated for only $7 and we are impressed by everything we have and will definitely come back for more!
Went here about a week ago.  The atmosphere here is of great value.  The food is always pretty good and the portions are large.  If I can find something on the menu I would come back.
this place really helps me celebrate the harvest and special events in my day
Great food and great music! The Korean House House makes it a point to leave early because it always leaves no room for thought in the server's mind. The Lobster is great, the Tabasco is my favorite Mexican dish and definitely one of my favorites. The Gino is the best. The Mexican Meatballs are much better than their regular prices but you can have other things for less, which
restaurant, serving only salad chips, potatoes and nuts, pringles, beer, etc. Peruvian people used to serve only Vietnamese. Sorry to bring wine, but sure you have to go back...especially for an establishment full of Guavas on a mission to be indulgent and adventurous. And those were the same people who tried to walk up to their four dollar Chinese reservations for s'mores to take. I never feel forced to remind my wife and I, watching to see who can dish the most delicious menu of fried rice or beef patties, whether they're in a rush to try to celebrate or always like to ask, who cares? It's kinda fun for them all to go, especially when we're paying for it at a place that comes with the dates and dessert tables to sit at during the week. Most importantly, the chef is absolutely NOT the superior waiter, especially on a Sunday. It's less bloody hedonism than bullshit. It's fr
restaurant in the Holy Cross.  I won't be returning to the restaurant forever, but I hope to find something different in there soon.
  The BEST BBQ bar in Boston....a rare steak sandwich with an onion chip shake that is as good as it gets.  The room was totally stocked with something for this date night.  The service was outstanding and knowledgeable.
Food was exceptional. I was pleasantly surprised by how much beer I can drink at this restaurant. The Sunday night pizza was quite good too, but a little pricey at $6. I enjoyed the salad bar, which was superb. But by the time I got there to buy a seat, I was pretty full.  I would recommend this place to friends who are Chicago white, or folks who are visiting from out of town.
I won't be going back!  It wasn't too bad.  The service was great, food was average, but the food was also a little pricey.  Love
restaurant with cool Michigan spirits.  When we got home, it was left to us to figure out what was up.  The restaurant itself has bad food, but the service was good.  The part that allowed us to sit down after a meal was in the review section, which was on 'Chicago's Best Restaurant'.  Oh my god, we haven't had any Yakisoba eatin before.  I had one dish, which was normally seasoned meat, and it was an old style to top with onion powder and fried rice.  The real stars are the casual and flowing seating, since the food was generally excellent.  The prices were not too high as we were allowed to pay $60 for a handful of entrees.  But when you split the difference, this was the best Yelp experience.  Wow, pretty sweet!!!!
I always love this place!!  Great, super cozy environment, and friendly staff!  Staff is great and try my regular pizza.
restaurant.  If you go to Barbecue Cafe, and want to take home an honest meal you will find one of the most authentic burgers in Chicago and each one has had a large portion.  The atmosphere is comfortable and it's cheaper. There are many other food places in Chicago such as La Grange and Eastern Exotic on Lake Michigan Avenue and El Salvador Cafe.  Best of all they have a giant menu and specials are free. You also can order from them on the menu. Just because you will be back for good, it doesn't mean you can't love it...
The food is incredible. I eat here several times a week and it doesn't disappoint! The atmosphere is a great fit for warm weather and a nice sense of fun. If you're looking for a good deal to enjoy your meal, the quality of the meats is extremely high and the selection is far better than it's being. We also tried the appetizers, which were delicious and somewhat spicy
restaurant."
Each of the three compartments is incredibly comfortable with their own unique decking, and simple seating. We decided to dine at the Canopy Burger which was located directly across the street and seemed to have a very lively atmosphere. We also enjoyed the Wonderful Dog restaurant which, while comfortable, offered a welcome new twist. The Roll No. 1 combination was aptly named (which is delicious). The oatmeal Chicken with Bread was an equally appropriate line. No matter which order you choose, you can enjoy this piece of art and make friends as you walk through the dining room.
I love this place! We are going to frequent any time, because it has a wonderful atmosphere and special cocktails! Be sure to talk to the manager if you feel that they are lacking in service. Then once in the restaurant, you can order a complimentary table or even a half off table! I really love this place!
The lighting and service at the Bridge are very good, but I
restaurant is mind blowing! We brought our host and your waitress in and they started to politely explain our rules. They came very politely and thought our tables would be so large they would not be able to accommodate it. There are several very reasonable servers who would have taken this and done something about it. After five minutes, some middle aged people asked why we were in a bar. We quickly explained that although this is a bar, we are actually inside. And it all came to a boil: waitresses. Finally, her manager came and walked away. This was the most shocking experience I have ever witnessed. Not only did she get a ticket to her bar, the guy took out his cell phone to call her at 9:30 p.m. to get her to return to her hotel. It was so shocking that I went home.I will not get offended at what my boss did as this was such a horrible experience. Not only was the server never allowed to enter the venue
restaurant. He is also the host, as the second host. When people ask why you don't order sashimi here the barkeep will tell them you're trying to put money down and that that's really a bad place to go after a profit. Overall great place, if not very good.
WOW this place truly is amazing and it's hard to beat!  This is another stealster's restaurant based off of Fogo's and Tartini: the best sandwiches in the city.  The sandwiches are exceptional as well as the salad bar (which is creative on the salad bar and filling for the every one of us, which adds up really. Get the Fresh salad bar here).  All our favorites are handmade on delivery (never left back in business to customers), excellent service (the Mardi Gras is one of my favorites), and great food.  I highly recommend eating at many of the fantastic restaurants where you are willing to wait for 20 minutes for some
restaurant of course!" Fortunately, it was a nice warm wall with comfortable chairs and tables near the 2 counter. I love the fact that it was limited, but I would bring two more meals just to make sure I enjoyed the service.
The setting is really, really unique. Aside from the items, everything is very fresh and diverse. I ordered a dress for the first time recently and could not have found what was on the menu. The bar is also very well stocked with lots of beers. It's really not the place for parties, however, when you have a lot of people going through a normal typical day. There's a staff that is very helpful when it comes to making sure everyone is enjoying themselves, and that it has a smooth-going vibe.I had the dishas which were very good and I think their jusomadas had a lot of meat too. I'm sure they might have been just a little more like their traditional Italian comfort food, but I
restaurant is really good!
I am really not a sucker for things like this and I have always been a fan of pizza and the  top dishes on there are just huge and I like to give them a try.  Great food is again better than the rest in Chicago!
One of my favorite restaurants in town.  Our waiter recommended this place for a suggestion we made to my ex and she wanted to bring a small plate of fries. A moment later, she suggested it to me and my entire wife with her hot dog sundaes. It was the best thing she ever ate there and I gave it 4 stars for my friends, and I think I must say it was my only child's birthday party of some kind. The bread served in the sandwich glasses wasn't anything special though, and the shrimp and fish entree was both smoky and flavorful.  Great atmosphere, wonderful food!
I love this place!I recently visited here for dinner and a friend called
restaurant at Paradise. The staff was friendly and attentive, to the point that you thought they were pretty busy, but the food was pretty good. Service was great, the service at sight was good, the specials were awesome. I would still go back.
Ambiance was beautiful. We had a great view of Albany with the patio.It was with a very rare call of the city due to the proximity.  Go to 11th Avenue, or 15th Avenue, if you prefer the charming and quaint atmosphere of 40-50.I love the southern style restaurant.  Their appetizers have grown in popularity and if you like that little pasta salad you enjoy you are in for an excellent meal. I even asked about the vegetarian version on the menu when I was at the diner.  But the other dishes were good and great.
We went here with 8 for lunch and also split it with dinner. My friend recommended the Fritos Fritos with spinach and olives
restaurant.....the Best value in Chicago, and the Best ever.Love it.Love it for you guys.Very smooth service. Love this place. If you love smoking, this place is for you.Loved the pizza.It's pizza.Favorite plate food, from the shrimp w/pork to the lobster, with the lobster sausage and shrimp w/almond topping.Great food and great price.Cars are far more expensive and less comfortable.
Living in upstate Chicago, I will definitely be back.  Decent neighborhood, good service, no complaints.  Expect to go here for the weekend.

The best regular restaurant in Chicago that people should go to if you're up for a hot dog.  The Beef Sandwich is better than you think!
Amazing burger. The burgers are delicious, spicy and filling.  Very tasty. The oatmeal
restaurant. I had to eat there if I wanted food. I was hungry.
Smooth. Delicious. Extremely small. We've been here 11+ times since we first opened it up. If you're in the area and would like an authentic Mexican meal, there's a 6 minute wait just north of downtown. If you need a burger and fries treat, you'll be happy here. I like to start my weekend by eating at the Brewery or the Bowl. Oh and I would love to get their Super Meals with Bacon.
We were excited to be able to go and eat at Logan!   The location was just right and the staff, including my mother-in-law was incredible.  The Food:
We have been to many of our favorite places to visit and were surprised to find this place out of the corner of my eye.   Once you enter and wait outside, you will find the place to go....be prepared to wait. 
restaurant can be no worse. The coffee was good but was hard to come by and we ended up getting shredded yummy. I'm not going to be back.
Best Chicago hot dog joint on earth  I'm so happy!  Good mix of great service, and great food.  They have a great sandwich selection, much like many of their other restaurants I know and love.  I will be back!
This place is cozy and so are you. I just don't think it's better than another soupshop in the area.  The dessert entrees are more than enough if you like really their herbaceous take on couscous and creamy dessert.  Oh and their maple syrup is fabulous.
I had a late night with my husband and everyone was incredibly polite and attentive.  When we walked in, they gave us our plates before we even sat down.  The drinks were fantastic, but the food was amazing.  However, the neighborhood chef was

I have been to Chicago and been to Chicago many times. On a recent visit, the wait at the Zoo was light, but was a bit less than complimentary. Don't take away from the experience, especially for a pleasant meal.  On top of the experience, the staff was outstanding. Service was very attentive and we did not have a reservation.  All around, the ambiance was wonderful. Great dining experience at a reasonable price.
I love this place and I can't wait to go back for another visit.  We always go to La Luxe which offers authentic Italian cuisine and its an exquisite meal.   The menu has been well described as outstanding and everyone I've worked with has always been very friendly and has taken the time to try new items.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much the service was great.  The food and drinks are always incredible and, to date, all I have tried is the Red Roasted Tortilla Verde
restaurant)  Each of these short pieces of meat was great but the duck was sooooo good that I just never thought to come back. I should say that each choice of food  was some of the best I've had.  This was the first location to buy my own sushi for the home. Definitely a good start if you're a fan of sushi and you want to be surprised when you're on their menu.  So, go try it and get excited! I've been waiting more than 2 hours for it to arrive!
Very nice service, but great portions... 2 appetizers, and the main course menu is small. A great place to have a dinner and some good the sandwiches, tacos, etc.
No 1 for me, but only because I was afraid to try it. I used to order sandwiches from several different places, and never went back. In the last 10 years I've ordered there dozens of times, all of which have had to pay more
restaurant" while hoping that fellow diner was too busy visiting them in the car or a cliff hanger.I admit that I didn't get the culinary experience.  Unfortunately, the food was mediocre and understated.   I gave the meal 4 stars, because I felt it was most expensive in the West, but because I love Napoli I gave it 4 star.  On top of it all, it cost me a lot less than we had originally thought, as well as the extra course(which was for starters delicious but lacked flavor) which I didn't enjoy.So...  I've been on the internet about dinner the past several weeks and couldn't decide whether to give it another shot or not.  My girlfriend likes it so much, that when I visited, I was then surprised how tiny my waitress appeared.  On top of that the food was horrible!  I had the calamari (we both had his pancake bread) with the following sesame bread

I LOVE RUDE. BY FAR THE BEST BANGALORE GRIN EVER! REALLY! Very popular with amazing bartenders and wine tasters.  AWESOME food! BIG portions and plenty of healthy drinks. Service is also highly friendly and comfortable.
good but not The speakeasy was the only place to order at the end of the day.  We went with family and there weren't an awful lot of customers there.
I thought this place was great, but when I went I was treated like shit.  I had the staff charge me more and then asked for credit card.  This place has been on the list for years and it was always in doubt whether or not I should credit card for bringing my money back home.  When I finally asked if they would let me pay, they replied with a slightly misleading explanation that they would let me pay
restaurant level...too bad I can't hold any more reviews for it. You can't even find it on all the restaurants. Maybe that's why it is so good.  But I wish for something slightly better.
I've had food at Big Apple restaurants in Chicago for the past 10 years, but I'm sure it's the best I've been to.  The pork ravioli was only 2/3 of what we were expecting.  For dessert, we chose some marshmallow frosting over beef confit, which was HUGE - savory and chocolatey.  The service was rude, but not too bad.  The pizza was as good as it was good, and it was also as crispy as it could get.  Overall, I will be returning again and again.
Noticed with its excellent staff! First it was the peperi tacos. We went here to get those peppers and she had no qualms - the chef was in full control
restaurant offers creative cuisine that I love. Everything from fresh fruit, to fresh seafood. The beer selection is always over cooked and up for quality beer. I know, I know, you want to pay for your awesome dining experience - and then you decide, oh, hey, at least you want great beer. So that's what our friend's house takes for granted, and works that out nicely. For us, we are always missing at least one place to take our food, food, food, and a great experience to Chicago Pizza. There are plenty of them, but sometimes you'll find a bunch of you and your colleagues who will not be here. I often pass some over for "good friendly" pizza. They will let you keep those things and feel good about it. You won't notice them going on the menu for months, just because it seems that way.I think it's important to say that, if you go with traditional Italian, they generally won't care what
restaurant, I had never felt so stuffed in my opinion, I have come to try what it has to offer! I've tried so many great vegetarian options I know it's something you should try before going in, which of course is true for most deals we've seen. All my beef specialties that come from California or the US are exceptional, and i have never had a pair of chicken wings in my life. Their mojitos are deliciously soft and you get everything in one basket and for the price, i think you'll love them. I've ordered the Beef Bell and I've had the Blue Grilled Cheese for dinner too, and i'm currently eating some of the meats from both sauces. If they still have pork in them I'll probably go back for another pair!
I didn't get my check because it wasn't ready yet. I was just exhausted after spending an hour in the waiting area. One dish was delicious but the other one, Super Easy Beef
restaurant). There was absolutely no dish choice between the marinated white potatoes and the quinoa fries. Some of the reviewers gave the fries "free of salt" and other reviewers gave the fries "free of grit". Once again, this is a restaurant that eats its meal from of lack of notice, but sometimes fails to notice that they took 20 seconds or so to serve the food.  If this is happening at a restaurant, where not one person was in the bathrooms, you need to try to get out of the restaurant to get a good night's rest.  The weather outside is tough and the food always gets hot and it does get tough around sunday and early in the week.  After having my fill of fried chicken, I could have waited three hours in the bathroom waiting for a nap.  Instead, we decided to be waitresses and the cooks worked in the kitchen. After a few girls complained, the manager at the restaurant asked who she was - "garden
restaurant?" [He said the meal was $9.50 while a full tasting menu was $14.95 while the menu was $11.95. He was right. Definitely a hoot to hear these prices (when the menu still ends up having top dollar bills, all the way down to $19) come out of the bag] Well, there's always a bit of that in freebies -- we all do -- but that price gets you a drink with a friend. Well, we'll have to go back.
I never experienced a traffic jam before after going here in Orange Grove. I've always enjoyed organic fruit, smoked meats, and smoky food.  But my C&D did get worse once I'd arrived.  It was out of control.  In the place we ate for an evening, we had four people at the table and the other 4 were drunk so drinking too much.  I tried a few dishes and the food was good. 
restaurant wait for us. I am done recommending their pasta mousse to my friends. For those of you who never really tried this dish before it was found on my dining room table in Tuscany. Not even close.  Good for a skinny salad which is thick and steamed to a crisp.
i am not familiar with this place. they have good french fries and wontons here, one of the only french fries in the house.   anyone who has tried it probably will appreciate the soft taste of it.
The Food is great. I don't have a pickles problem but i have never had any that I did not like. I've been to Bon Aguilera and Carrizo de Mita which are good French fries.
It's fast, it's fresh and, it's not hip, it is totally free! Hands down one of the best restaurants in the city.
I do not have much history in it.  The food is
restaurant - foodie and classy (only one person in charge of the food is a guy for the open mic atmosphere and nobody talks to the patrons).   If I can get it right, I am very happy.  It is quite the foodie atmosphere as you hear the down low jazzy serving service speak.  It is a rather expensive place to go, but on the outside it is a perfect place for a few.  I highly recommend ordering from it as you can't go wrong.
This is the best sushi I've ever had. We came here to try Xiwan & Meza right out of the box.  It's really great because it has a great feel to it. Our only complaint was the food and service. My boyfriend and I shared a sashimi cap.  The cap was pretty good, so the money would have been better spent.  The fries were really thin as well.  It was ok that the burger was a
restaurant

I don't think I've ever had anything better.    So fresh, amazing, slow to eat, so very fresh...kinda good even if you went to a big shop like ours one night.  And if you're looking for something something to eat quickly and make an empty stomach feel like you just stumbled across something on a frosty Friday night, it's all good.  I'll definitely go back and try it out!
Last Friday night a friend invited me to her birthday party which was very expensive but a nice way to kick the rock.  My friend came to request a table for her which took 3 and a half minutes, which is extra time.  I was thrilled to find out that the chef moved away from Thai and instead served dishes made in Thai rather than the nice little Thai banyan.  The waitress seemed to be letting everyone know that they were doing their best not to taste anything that was obviously not authentic and that
restaurant is outside; we went with an Italian gentleman and ordered an excellent cheese pizza that would send me a thrill. After so many people chatting and explaining what I ordered, I started to enjoy myself and sat down with my dad in the bar. It was fantastic! The pizza is awesome. You get any type of beer you like, great tapas. That was enough to make me want to go back...thank you BBQ, Mr. BGG!I will definitely try again!
I am not even going to make the mushroom, coconut, and spinach thing a pizza about this place. It's so nothing else I want to order, and I should have tried my own. This place is really, really easy to find, and the prices are fantastic (at least for my daughters age 6 and 8). I am happy with the prices of the food, and that's a plus for me, because I don't want to eat at this place.
Love the food. 
restaurant; we never needed a table for lunch.
From yummy to not much else (mostly high quality crust, with ingredients I could pick from), this place is definitely worth the $5 and $10.99 you pay for it.  You'll taste incredible, and try some dishes you might not want, such as the better special deli at Guava Merrada, or your favorite soups.  I highly recommend checking this place out if you happen to live in the area.
The goat cheese is by far the most popular dumplings I've had on town; I've eaten them all but one time. I'd like to go back for another occasion but I'm not sure the server and the waiter will live up to my expectations for breakfast tacos. Anyway, the space is friendly and the prices are fairly reasonable.
Food was excellent, service was mediocre, quality was underwhelming, and the price was only up to $8. It's $
restaurant policy and can't wait to see what you try.  I recommend pairing the black cherry with the bread pie and enjoy!
So warm and so wonderful, we'll be back
Haven't really eaten here, but I like some and am enjoying many of the other options. So, when I moved to Chicago in 2011, this place was packed.  Even now, I tell people that it's kind of pricey to go in the first place.  I'm glad I do, because the food here is phenomenal.  This thing never stops dancing.  Love it because it is one of my favorites of all time!
This place is insane. I went there yesterday with my boyfriend and I brought the king crab sandwich with us and it was so good. It's just in the art of classic saucy sass sandwiches but the crab is missing a big clue, it's just over cooked.  We got a tray of chips to split, and then we
restaurant service and any dish I can find is about as amazing as the wine. You can even bring in your favorite members of your party. They even take a picture so you can hang on the wall when you have long restarts and fine dining. Their food is nothing special, it is one of the best in the nation. Be sure to bring something when you go and enjoy something special and exceptional.
Its not coffee though, either. The barista is known to "keep my hair neat and her warm cozy eyes a gift from the eye of God" (hence, the good food, good service).  To top that off, the food is pretty darn good. Don't expect much from this place because its private home.  Definitely considering a dinner reservation. Also, don't expect to pay for their meat.  Most likely it is not available on a regular basis, or have already gotten a plate of pork.  So don't expect to pay too much.
restaurant; the employees look annoyed to me. In line at the ticket counter I see a group of waiters, but when the bar closes it's over already. I try to order a mac and cheese sandwich to try, and don't try to go the long way of where I'm led to the counter when I return after three or four drinks. Every time I try to order anything other than the ravioli, I notice that that the count remains almost exactly where I'd like it to be. But the cost of food goes up, because we get that terrible atmosphere at such a busy time.
Went here a couple weeks ago for a 10 star dinner and it was damn good. I have to say that I would have done a much better job looking after our order of goodies here. So classy, so relaxed and quick. There were five of us in the area. Really great place to catch up with other diners and just relax at. You are looking for
restaurant. It was scrumptious. Service was great, awesome coffee, wines were sublime, drinks were amazing, and our server was friendly, but there wasn't enough that I'd recommend it to everyone.
I recently went to Twin Peaks for my anniversary dinner.  My husband and I have been here twice.  My best friend and I each have been here four times (the last time after visiting for lunch on the last visit (2012-13), and the last time we stayed the day of the visiting guests.).  Last time I checked, I was just 8 yrs old.  I was so disappointed that the atmosphere there was not inviting the adults.   Yes, you'll have to move your chair and come out.  Luckily, I was able to get a table at an excellent price.  Overall, I think you should go for a great meal.
This is a really cool place, fantastic wines and food, amazing bartender and sometimes the star
restaurant and not as outstanding as it is elsewhere. The salads were okay as well, but I would never order a salad on my last visit. They were well placed and well prepared. Parking was surprisingly difficult as the rack is over level.  I had a pretty busy lunch so I would not take my frequent visitor there for sure.
B-SICK! Go to that happy hour or wait for a table because of the cold weather...because you won't want to wait more than 15 minutes. It's never about what the inside of the restaurant is like, it's more about what you actually eat and how you eat at it. The 4 nights I lived there was cold and we were given no time to get our food. And how would you expect when you're dining in-town? Everyone was very rude about the meat that was cooked in the belly of a meat steerlette....and you know how that ruins a meal if you don't have it. From sitting at
restaurant, you're going to LOVE it. The service is great, and their burgers and fries are excellent! This place is one of the best I have ever been to.
Have been to multiple hummus joints for the past few years but have never come back.  This place is far from an Ethiopian joint or Chinese restaurant, instead it is a joint in different styles.  If you happen to see Ethiopian food, you will LOVE this spot.  I've been to everyone who works there and the service is always in a good way.  If you're looking for hummus and not a Westernesque place, check this place out!
I like my fellow ladies! I just do this week i started at Metubel where their food was delicious.  I dont get it for the simple reason this place is overpriced so i give it 5 stars.  Great people, that you can overlook in order to be very relaxed at night.
Awesome staff, incredibly passionate
restaurant service was spectacular. The falafel which was served simply topped off with the perfectly cooked-up sea meat was a tad too much for my taste, especially when I would rather dip my tongue in and eat with the little mouth meat. The menu is bright, knowledgeable and well-intended, and it is a little pricey for what you can get if you go for an intimate meal. I think you'll feel less enticed by the menu if you eat here!
Good stuff. Very cool location. Coming from the East Coast I would rate this as my best
I love having a place in the south of me that looks like a nice house, or maybe a spot where a gorgeous old house decor is noticed.  What a wonderful scene it is, and I'd go back.  Big renovations of the factory-rooms are quite interesting, but there is a ton of space on the wall, which makes for a quieter environment.  Love the non-musical
restaurant not only did it wait that long for our appetizers, but you definitely can't expect much more. The chicken wings, its cheese-crusted, flavorful, very good, ok, uhh, you have to call a cab. I love my Chicken (it's literally forever late to the party, are you saying its overrated?) since you can't beat that?!!!! Yup, I knew that would be the case!!! If your in town, visit Carman or check it out. It's not expensive, but by the food, it's amazing!!
I have been to Martin Luther King Day and the stars are clearly on the wall, the spices and the old mealler party mergut cakes. Our waitress and barista were very accommodating and always as respectful as possible. I had not eaten before and was certain that everything that stood out to me was what great meat to be, and when I moved it out of the place in my memory...
restaurant makes me go down this rabbit hole of hubby's shenanigans.  When you put the dates on the menu, you can see the wines.  That's just what they've done here.  It took a little while, but they keep it up.  They're definitely going to make you smile and thank you so much.
Well worth the wait, not for the atmosphere but for the food.  Was there any bad experience?  Not one we had, not one to be taken lightly either.  Probably a poor guess, not a perfect score, but it would be so close to 4 stars.  If my expectations are high enough to try other decent chains, I would give it a shot.
My boyfriend & I have been going for over a year now.  Our server and manager are wonderful, authentic, friendly, unpretentious, and fantastic!  The food (he always comes by for the variety and made our visit only to receive a table
restaurant- restaurant.
I just love the BBQ side (you can eat it at the bar afterwards). Don't mind the all the meat or ribs being cold burnt (due to the huge quantity) you have to go back for some hot wings. The hot wings are flavorful and have an excellent. It can be my go-to
I'm a big fan of dining at people who enjoy the cheap beer.  I have tried everything from the Chicago restaurant to the steakhouse with impressive flavors.  The Chicago seafood restaurant by Alinea is a good fit.  My brother-in-law and I always try our takeout items and end up enjoying the ingredients.  He also loves the ambiance.  We were really happy with the cakes and muffins.  The last item of our entree is done in Chicago: they come with a certificate that says it was cooked from scratch, and you must pick it up from a nearby store.  This is a unique deal
restaurant I can never imagine being any more wonderful. The kitchen is clean and very attentive, great food, and a great atmosphere. It's definitely the place I would come back to for dinner.
This place is often cited as the best Italian spot in town.  If you've never visited Chicago but want to go looking for one of the best, Michelin starred restaurants in the country, wait.  You'll not find any other place of course.  Otherwise, I try to expect something else besides Duroc, it's like the Grand Chute somewhere else.  If I were planning on moving to Chicago again, I wouldn't hesitate to try this place.  It offers terrific interior decor, best cocktails and food - and for the price, you'll go hungry.  This place is friendly and will do whatever you need and will also show you the real world results.  I would say it's a must try place if you decide to go out on a date
restaurant... it's a lil pricey for a dessert, but it's worth it. I think it's a little slow to get to a nearby church to sit on a chair and watch people chatting at the coffee table. As soon as we arrive at the local bar, we're greeted by a couple bouncers and taken back to the restaurant. They are quick to introduce us to the owner and explain the things we can expect. You can't beat the menu. After waiting awhile, they introduce us to our favorite drink - the Loli-Style ice cream. There was one glass which we hadn't tried and it was great. The service is terrific and attentive. When the waitresses arrive, they take the customers hand and pass out drinks, leaving us and our friends alone. The food menu is delicious and is fresh-ish. This place is jam packed! You'll almost always have your filling in once you're in.
The food was very good!  The salads were
restaurant..seriously can't believe that all of the friends that eat here are from Europe.
Simply Delicious! Delicious and romantic. Great sushi service and unique drinks to enjoy, even if they aren't really that great..you'll be shaking your head and have lunch to eat!
A MUST HAVE/PRICE for anyone!   Very inviting great food and service.
Best pumpkin pie EVER  to this place!  Also they give you an organic-fed sausage and say you can order half your meat/veggies in one pot!!! YUMMY!!!! SO PERFECT!!!!!  Their churros are the best part about the place. Great views, nice parking spot, great atmosphere.
Oh and it IS by far the most surprising party ever. We had the dog basket on the bar that was very top notch, they were totally top notch at eating whatever was left in there. They even given us a complimentary ginormous amount of beers with the
restaurant + breakfast for $5.00!
I had the soufflé at the Cheesecake Factory but it was much cheaper. I also have the simmered pork chops and onions on the mac and cheese. From scratch they have a fabulous ambiance that is absolutely perfection for a quick lunch or dinner. The only bad thing about this place is that the service is slow. You can't tell which hot dog you want before the food is taken out. You have to wait for maybe 30 minutes until you can get a second slice and enjoy the chocolate some more.
Quick and reasonably priced outdoor seating. They serve the best chocolate bar. A nice selection of various sports drinks. Even some of their tables are open long enough to view half a dozen or so attendees.
Awesome meal!!! They cooked my favorite stuff and called it their one of my favorite Chicago neighborhood restaurants.  All great food selections and very reasonable prices.
Gorgeous Italian dishes! I got my
restaurant was kind of sickening and if you haven't been there yet you might wanna try it.If you are a fan of the folks inside of Dobby's that literally get kicked out of there, well Dobby's makes it much easier to get your money back in - be careful! The prices are really cheap too and if you haven't tried the menu yet... thats up to you!It's my 4th time to Eo, so I usually catch more awesome hot dogs so dont hesitate to ask!
Ok, so this review is based on my own experience with this place.   So I'm not so sure about  our other reviews, but some people have been down here, and that's good because I got the Grilled Cheese on the menu after a couple weeks.   I will say it wasn't until a few weeks later that we actually found out what it was!   We went with a friend and ordered the high-fat and the
restaurant

The Arcturus Grill is a cozy and cozy bar... each drink was delicious and relaxing. The food was clean and fresh. Nothing special by comparison. The decor was never old, and looks great. You can get a martini bottle if you like. The chicken and rice were amazing, too.
Great Beer House! has plenty of beers on tap
by far my favorite Texas restaurant in the entire city!!If you're looking for a seat, go here, get your sample of good Texas beer and go find an overpriced wine bar. I love it here and can't wait to go back.
Yum! After the best meal I've ever had, I was hungry.  Really.  Go here and you'll be disappointed.  Also, the desserts were sooo huge that if you're just going to try it, expect significantly more detail.  And every other place on the list features plenty of good work and I personally enjoy the food
restaurant, the best and also tops this table because they have wings that are only about 1/2 their size.  All the food, drinks and food is incredible and the service is superb.They cook all the fish (which I'm constantly told is a food item only 5 minutes old) so they're really on top of that.  The main thing that's always noticeable is that the servers are super friendly (serve them every one of the meals) and very efficient.
I know I probably will eat there about once or twice per year, but that will almost certainly be only after spending at least $150-$200 more for the privilege of an amazing meal at Villa Zu-Quoubu.  Tucked away in the pizza bowl are the two very tasty meals. The server was very responsive with positive feedback about each of the menu items (food, wine, etc.). My favorite bite was the salad/eggplant; also delicious in its own way. I
restaurant & service:  I was promised dinner (actually delivered it).  I waited only 20 minutes, during which time the waitress informed me that everything was delivered by herself.  After finally getting my food and lighting the evening up, the waitress tells me that that no complaints should be made.  My server finally told me to bring my food home to deliver it.  They proceeded to beat me up with her backside.  The bartender gave her it out and she told me that all the Thai dishes were good.  She then proceeded to punch me in the face with her huge plate of red wines.  I had my food given me and didn't even give one proper place for my food.  I felt so guilty for what happened to me, considering that I didn't get to eat at the restaurant.  If there was a point where my experience was valid and I felt like I didn't have to look like I deserved to drink at the restaurants I actually followed
restaurant and just as flavorful as McDonald's.   Check out the menu!  My wife and I have had several times and each time it's always the best. I believe they've just updated the food menu for the month of October so we can catch up, and make it to table on time.  While we're here, we like the 2 part barresto--first is another wine pairing that will kick off the season--they should have gone with the wine pairing myself.
one of the first noodle latin cafes in the world. will stop by anytime, the fish fries are always good, best plate the sushi is cold, tea party food is great and all the food is decent. well its Chicago, all the sides are great and are so light it makes you feel like you are dining in another city. special place to go for brunch: cold i think. 9.5% off. Sunday 11, Sunday 12, Friday 7.5% off
restaurant would take 45 minutes. We paid $50 per person with bill. My friend ordered ice cream and pepperoni, he said the only reason we ended up with steak was because we wanted three more of them. And there was nothing I could have done about it. So she was extremely rude.
I've been to 3 of the restaurants I've been to in Chicago and even though I'm more into these non burgers, this is not one of them. The food is simple yet the service is good. The food alone is a 4 star review. The service has not been stellar since I was there, and the food was rushed. They also forgot to let me eat my food when I sat outside for 8 hrs, so I had to tip them $55 or take another 1hour, which I cannot attest to.  Honestly, the food was very terrible and I would say this was pretty solid service at the same time. But the staff is great as well and they follow
restaurant and will stay a while longer than normal.
Excellent portion of food, Service by Dave with all their entrees.
Amazing food, great service, friendly staff. This restaurant is truly the best sushi I have had in Chicago.
Went here in the past for a weekend dinner.  This place is BYOB!  Had a great party, well worth the wait.  The first couple were seated around 1:30pm (15am) and were seated about an hour later (midnight).  The food was very fine, warm and tasty. The meat tempura was packed as always with cooked rice with some other specialty items like fish sauce, avocado (of course), and whipped cream.  Wasabi was absolutely huge and amazing.  Would definitely return!
This restaurant serves rice; there is nothing better than rice. This is the best place to eat rice and cakes with friends.  If you like sweet potato fries in cakes and cornballs you will
restaurant: pastas. I can't remember much about the menu, but I know for sure it's always good. The service is great, though.The ladies actually give everything a spin in each dish. It took one dish to make me feel really good, and the others were an experience. For $10, a guy came to look at my personal reservation and said, "for dinner, let's go see your husband. His prices?" I wanted to express to him what I'm waiting for. His attitude was really good; everyone was positive, especially my husband. When the food came out, we were treated to decent drinks. We ordered some cakes with mango which were fresh. It was the best! I just left with an absolutely great beer, which wasn't really helpful, because it was already deep in the mango pudding. Afterward, our server said to me: "don't make a mess of us! you are thinking like me and you just brought me home
restaurant. There's so many and beautiful sushi options throughout the place.
We ordered the Sushi Deli which is very cool.  They had the pita and the wontons, meatball encased in frozen yogurt.  I guess when you are a big plump little guy, you are probably not expecting to taste so much meat.  The price on the most regular side was a bit high but what was interesting, was they still offering appetizers and rations.  Check out these great appetizers from past years!
After my visit there was one thing I liked about doing a visit there. The restaurant was completely closed (I think the restaurant needed to close down the parking lot to accommodate our daily pass holders. So, I paid $100 for a table for $55 and a guest was seated.  He didn't order the rice, but we asked the chef to send him the (low quality, overcooked) portions.  I think the chef was
restaurant, hot dogs, some vegetarian options and beer. They have all kinds of sushi, burgers, rice dishes, and quail rice in addition to warm salads (they do serve beans too), extra, specialties like the courses that are $30 or less depending on the occasion! Highly recommended!
On Saturday, October 9th, I went to make dinner. My friend and I split our split to see what was going on.   We ordered chicken, potatoes, meatballs, appetizers, and a quick appetizer.   We walked to the door with several trays full of canned noodles and soup, and each came with a $10 note.   We were told to put $10 on the bills and go to the store.  The store manager asked if we wanted any extra goodies or tips to go to the kitchen when we went back.  I asked him which dish he wanted and he let me know if there were other items he wanted. 
restaurant, I wanted to make my own, so I went to Tim's.  Unfortunately, my relatives were not there, and I did not see them so I was more than a little disappointed.  Thankfully, they have some amazing sauces available so you can get a much better deal.  I certainly recommend waiting.
I love most Italian food I've had and I always think that Cuban food deserves every bit of respect it deserves.  It's not close to my childhood neighborhood but it is so close.  I would definitely go back to our regular course menu for authentic Cuban food - Asian-inspired and delicious.  It's easily one of my favorite places to visit for dessert.
Went here for dinner and it was SO MANY FRIENDLY!!  It has numerous bowls of delicious food, good drinks, low prices etc.  Not to mention the great ambiance is pretty to look at.  Great food, but it doesn't get any better than this
restaurant, great beer selection, excellent atmosphere, awesome food, every time I go, people are always very friendly and the food is amazing.
I like guys because of the flavor of their food, service, and atmosphere.  If I wanted a more modern Steakhouse experience I'd visit here.
I have to say, I feel a little out of place. On the contrary, the place is quite contemporary and very friendly.
I take this place to restaurant and it is always great.  All I can say is, stay classy and stay up to date.
My husband and I frequent this place on weekends as a weekend amore.  You'll love this bar with some friends if you can come with a good drink.  Definitely check this place out.  On a dry winter night, I would recommend it.
I love chicago again! Great food, friendly staff, and friendly staff.  With it being very small, I was expecting very little
restaurant service is excellent. The steak I tried was cut to order and served for $30.00.00. When I ordered another order of $50 I said I was going to get a pork belly burger and was honestly not sure what to get. They insisted on saying I did not want pork belly. I just wanted another slice of heaven as I know that I will probably be disappointed. When I tried having a steamed pineapple I have to say that this is THE WORST PBKE EVER in my life. It was awesome. Nothing to be scared of, I would say.
Just found out the employee really loves rock'n'roll, it's filled with cheesy stuff, everything is crazy on bass but our menu is perfect! Word spread around on the guitar i love it! Hmmm I feel that this place is a must try, believe me.
Been to a steakhouse a few times and every time the service is so rude and rude that you have
restaurant). They are a particularly attentive staff, and it is really hard to come by here at a time of financial need. It is well worth the wait, but unfortunately it is not really worth it for the price. The meat is bland and lacks flavor, and the main course is simply amazing. The sandwiches are especially stuffed in the meat, with a deep, succulent fat and fresh steamed beans. The steak has a very light and thick texture, so there's quite a lot of mush. The sandwiches were drizzled with honey. It is possible that the eggs weren't as completely cooked as they would have been in our meat-filled bowl, but it would likely be much better with more water and fresh sauce.The todo list is incredible, too, which is a perfect balance of the relaxing presence of a good home. My husband and I were looking forward to seeing the spicy eggs again and again and, finding a place to sample their fried lobster soup, we
restaurant and owner Steve had the entire staff laughing at him. They weren't that impressed at all. Maybe they thought I was a bigot, but it was just horrible... the kid who is here runs his parents pizza business which is why they decided to harass me out of business.
I'm sorry I can't eat for more than 10 p.m. Everybody at Pizza Hut gets to eat at one of the burgers.  This does give me a headache as I wait for a server to stand in line.  My large sausage serves as chicken at Pizza Hut.  My asparagus tastes like a bite of sugar after its done.  I usually come here with dinner and to get a better steak or an appetizer I go as hard as I can.  Chef Tony's delivery works superbly and I'd love to re-order the burrito after dinner to keep my meal from freezing.
At 8:15 AM I finally decided to try a free breakfast at
restaurant?                                                                                                                                                                                                    
restaurant. We would say this was a plate which is unusual when an Italian restaurant makes a budget item for a large one. The meat was cooked hot, my friend had the guanciale, the potato salad and of course the cantaloupe. They didn't take pictures, but the cheese was pretty good, with mango it was definetely worth the wait. The rest of the thing was pretty good, but they say everything is okay as long as you order the cheese and not the soup...then you have to order it, or it is ready to go on your next visit.I do wish they could have explained the restaurant better. You are charged accordingly and get the same service rating as the one on their website. Overall I would say this was a little less than right overall. Maybe they would have fixed this down a notch, or maybe I could have selected it from the menu, but it isn't that bad - I am glad that I have found it.
restaurant, Pizza and Gifts! Every time there's a party or a busy bar.
I came here for a party last Friday night! I went here with my wife and 3 of us - at least 6 of us - and had only been there for 1 night. We got the Biggie and the spinach pie, i think the latter were phenomenal but for the average mom and pop place in town - I don't know why so many people love it. The veggie bar served chicken and I was enthralled. Would have preferred the wood chair bar which was a bit more expensive but, in my opinion, was definitely a great place for a fun place. The food was excellent, the service was super reasonable, and my wife and I got a fresh drink afterwards which totally solidified our point about coming here. The only downfall is that the place is pretty large so some rooms or back room that cannot be used, even with great bathroom service. If you like great food,
restaurant.  Unclear/unclear about most chefs, but we had our cocktail and both were excellent. Very salty tasting.  I would recommend the lobster roll I made for them over their own recipe.  We will definitely be going back.
For dessert I went here for Christmas so I figured it would be a good time to check it out.  The service was alright but good enough for me.  You could easily squeeze in a 90g glass or so.  And, by the way, it was available.  The service is average when compared to Chicago, it is not as good, but the atmosphere is just okay.  If they were an upscale restaurant it would make them pretty awesome.
It's kind of crazy how busy the city is, but I'd have to say that they took the cake over there.  From what I've seen the general complaints were a bit strange since the restaurant is just located across the street from the library, but because
restaurant would go with your dessert and or at least treat you to some stuff you couldn't handle and had a better time knowing that they were giving me a huge portion of their afternoon deal. The service was good enough to warrant a cashier seat in the kitchen. The bill was good because it was only $12.00 and I definitely got the group of 12 who got four. My mom and two (one of whom is blind!) both got about $15 apiece with the rest coming from inside. The waitress provided the bill for each person. She showed me their bill as she was busy and asked to see it after the meal. If you pay $12 for dinner and only want to be out of the way, you are free. The food at the bar is pretty good and my mom definitely gets enough of this when she is a vegetarian and can still eat reasonably well.We were seated nicely and had a generous appetizer entree, yummy pumpkin cake, and delicious vegetables

I love delicious. Frito Hella peppers are perfect and all of their flavors are outstanding. Just take my family to a Mexican restaurant and try all of the cheap vegetarian options. The eggs benedict and guacamole are wonderful. This is where I enjoy the atmosphere. They also have some of the most stylish restaurant decor, not just Mexican. So cool.  Every dish I try is just incredible, best tasting I have tried.
I'm not a big fan of "the steak" menu, but this place is incredible.  It's like seeing the father of Godzilla give back to the people who made his own mark with the way he walked into The Buddha (both the menu and menu content was different) and how they treated us.I agree that the french fries are really quite bland, but the fries themselves are a unique piece of the jagerloin that is so absolutely delicious. But yes, they're just all out there to please
restaurant has been losing many of its own flavor (including freshness). But now, it's running under $30 a bottle (yes, $30 for dessert and $15 for a sandwich). Oh, yes...I'm with Stewart. Yes. Will be back (scared).
If you haven't already, you've got to go here first. Maybe not your town, but your hubby is some aging Foxconn. Although the food is slow, food is fabulous and the service is fast!  If you're into pizza, we recommend the Quaker Sabatini pizza. It's DELICIOUS! You won't be disappointed!
I have never been to another Chicago Mexican restaurant and I have not been disappointed with the waitress. The corn tortas are typical...I have never been to more than one. They serve a variety of a variety of Mexican meals and the meat is fresh and fresh. The only thing I would not suggest is the red salsa you
restaurant has played in a couple of the food festivals I've visited, and it was AMAZING. The salmon steak gets hot with just a touch of salt. I found myself waiting for hours for a table and every two minutes it was packed! On a Wednesday evening last month, we ate dinner there. We had a reservation about an hour into the meal. The bill was $125, which was very reasonable considering the time period, but we were so disappointed. Luckily for us, the manager had come over to our table and the steak was sent. However, when he looked at the menu, he was not impressed and never took a table at all. He insisted, "This is not worth it." You think if you can't wait for it at all for 15 minutes...then why bring it back and make it an option? The manager went ahead and also charged us an extra $35, which could have been used at other places...but we were so disappointed we went
restaurant menu with several options and quality. We got the strawberry potato salad that was tasty with a nice and fruity flavor to compliment the fresh flavors of our basil leaf. It was a little stiff on the meat and included shrimp, potatoes and fresh tomato. Not too spicy or picky, they had a deep chocolate tea (a very flavorful type of chocolate cake with layers of chocolate filling that was juicy and juicy). Other things that I would recommend are the drizzled raspberry leche and chocolate cake wrapped in a (small?) strawberry ariador and it was nice to have that vanilla topping on too. The restaurant is a bit on the expensive side but it's well worth it.
My boyfriend and I have been going here for about 6 months and we really enjoy every detail. First of all, the service is great. We are not friends of mine and don't go to this restaurant alone.  We are in for a very happy stay at least. And now that we
restaurant, are near Zero Park and out of service. When ordering off of the menu, they are not going to tell you how to prep ahead of time for a restaurant reservation. The staff was overly apologetic and overly catty and it went too far in getting our food when we asked how it was supposed to be. Food options:
The Grill at the 9 is best.   The bathrooms are real nice.  That's all you can ask for from your St. Louis tour.  The pastel, which is a definite plus for outdoor dining, is clearly made in hand by Tom at Toy Factory.  Awwwhhhhhh!!  We ordered torta as a dessert.  And, yes, I got sushi on the trip.  There are still some I feel might have been in the rotation on the Chicago menu.  Some staples are prepared by other chefs in an experienced and judicious way (Gnosis makes sense for this trip and my visit ended with
restaurant and got nothing but bad reviews.  My wife and I went in for brunch at the Copley on May 15th. We ordered the PORK CHEESE plate at the great chef Jeff Green. It was the kind of thing we saw on the menu that I don't think many people would know about because so much of my people had not eaten on their own so often, and many of the dishes were all delicious and so perfectly lightened by the sweetness of the fish. Jeff Green went over all the stuff he'd brought to me with him and the dishes were what really really impressed me. I felt like I was at a perfect party and served him with his family's cake. He's done a fantastic job of giving out an apology after this experience.  The pastries came out super fresh, we went with the group for dinner a few days later and after we came to dinner, we got a little too drunk for the beers I'd order. All they
restaurant and above all, cake! If you're trying to do it right, this can be the best I've ever had. (??) The service was also ok, we never missed a single person who used the dish. Definitely worth the trip.
This one was by far the best taco and everything about it was great!  We would definitely go back, so if you like Mexican food, bring a friend.  Have you ever been to Bruce Springsteen's is on the record for this!
I have been to Xonafele twice and only this time it was enjoyable.  Both times I ended up at Chili's, everything was fine.  I always get the place was on time and everything was quite appetizing.  I didn't care for the fries though though because I usually go there for birthday dinner.  I had the chipotle house spinach which I love and always have at Chili's (a la The Italian Sausage House) and the
restaurant is new, family-friendly, clean & spacious but not too shabby as most restaurants do. Our experience at TAO is one of fondue. Get the 3/4 and tap list- it's amazing. First thing to say is I would definitely go back for another visit if you have any questions.  But with a glass of wine or some other thin round drink like 10 bucks (with a rather hefty check of the hour you paid) for the top quality food I cannot give it 5 stars but that is what i am here to offer- WINE. 11. Kale is everything else. Here we have a menu with quality, flavorful and tangy alchohol. We also have a main course that includes spicy gonzelaise and large cheese- so satisfying- and totally worth the wait. 12. Compounding its name, Le Bourget Frites is one of my favorite desserts and the server Chris...  truly scrupulous in making sure my
restaurant and warm sauna in Yolanda. Everything else was excellent. Our servers were very attentive and accommodating, welcoming and friendly.
I love chicago. It is a gem. Its fun, expensive, great open to the public. Eat there sometimes!
I've been a huge fan of Argyle for a few years now but love the delicious food.  It's very small and less busy than most restaurants in town, especially in the East Loop.  And the great wine selection is so good.  We'll go there the summer.
I have been going here several times since I was there for a birthday party two months ago. My main hope is that I can get a table before the counter opens. They have a restaurant all over the city that makes a great setting for a celebration. We decided to come here for a party on April 30 (I'm told they have to order a high five) because I was craving something fresh and fresh. I

After my visit with Kingfisher we immediately had lunch and very pleasantly the dinner went as planned and was enjoyed.  We also got our CHLOPS menu to try and give our food away and once again our waiter asked us not to mess around.  I wish he didn't order a basket of pizza or otherwise ordered something from his basket.  I really enjoyed my meal, but I also got to give my LOVE!  The breakfast menu is exceptional.   The youngsters even take their order of entrees to eat as I did.  I give the 20 cent and I definitely recommend the Oyster with potatoes,  but I am grateful my 7-year veteran ended up eating so many, so there was more I could dish out.  I highly recommend going here for this to go as a 2nd guy, but you can easily get a good breakfast with a side of organic and maple syrup, which is awesome.  Not bad
restaurant) on a warm Saturday afternoon, to hold off a bustling Saturday night. Nasty dinner places are plentiful, decent service and good food at reasonable prices! At 4:30, the dinning table will be a half dozen or so and can be seated about once or twice a week.  I'd say that these places seem normal until you're in the restaurant because everyone has tried, but there's something about this place that makes this a must-visit.
My first time coming to Lamb's Island in the suburbs was after the incredible outdoor experience in which we had the fabulous pizza there.  I had the Dished-off for my birthday.  The food was great and the ambiance was warm and inviting, even coming from a slightly suburban Chicago suburbs neighborhood.  My girlfriend and I are not usually what we order from, so this must be a new favorite of ours.  The espresso bar was awesome and the wine list was decent.  Even though the
restaurant/it's usually better to go with a lower rate. The next thing I wanted was to try this amazing kickstand of cheeseballs (you get the shakes or juices from the crust on the counter???) and maybe try it on a dinner menu, I'm just not in a mood for chicken or steakballs. The meat seems very salty and much better because I ate about 20.00 of it! There are servers that love to wait and gush with fat. Make sure you pay their server and support his food and advice. They charge 5 bucks for the service, mealing is expensive, a wait of around 45 minutes gets you a 10 and only drinks the wine. Now that you know the service and the prices the best part is that the right people work for you. Of course, the waitress isn't the best and if you can't help but try these things and you'll be fine!
Amazing seafood, chicken, guacamole & dark chocolate sund
restaurant the black cake with fried rice. Excellent service and we'd definitely recommend this spot.
I got the lamb on Saturday for birthday dinner (that was 5-6 people)- i live outside of Chicago and eat at Cabo Cafe that night. I think they gave us the Stoner "fancy" dish.  There were horrible good choices -I tried the pork w/ rabbit/dish in the side and my senses were crazy. To mention the good things:- (crunch) I ordered the shrimp on a mac and cheese sandwich, etc.  Was warned about the pork fire, but it was tasty.  The pork was fresh and the bread was extra-very good.
My husband and I went to a curry bar here tonight. The food here was good. I only ate two for breakfast so it wasn't really a problem. Would not eat more on the house menu. The food here was so good, it would make a great addition to your house
restaurant:
The plain shell pizza has a lively atmosphere.  I will be back there for more than a b/c they have a hostess from their scrumptious-aesthetic...a must try for any vegan.  Definitely find it interesting and have a good time.
Tried all the different items I have to this place,which are not dissimilar to some excellent vegan places...like Frappucino,Beauchamelops, Artichoke Bongo, No-Rage, and numerous other authentic American and vegan places (although I would strongly suggest Pablano!). They are located in Chicago the past couple months and the sandwich selections are fresh (it is out of this world delicious)...except these sandwiches are soooo much more..!!!They have to be aged before being served. This place is very small and the opening hours are Tuesday through Saturday.  They charge for the 50/50 portions. I was finally surprised with all the local
restaurant. This place can be quite expensive, but they were definitely worth the visit.  The owner offered to run his own.  If you weren't familiar with their food and don't like all of their  different vegetables and flowers, this place is for you.  If you have NEVER tried  their apple pie and don't want to mess it up, this place is a must-try.   The lime pie is an instant hit and is super simple and convenient.  If you are a vegetarian, this is the place for you.  I highly suggest ordering salad dressing as well, and continue to order delicious pieces of mussels as you go.
I had the Ravioli Chicken, PB Chicken, and Salmon Pizza. My server/special assistant had the Dinner menu, and I had the Crumbled Rice Pizza, which had better texture, but was nice and cooked. Definitely the best the world has to offer. I will go back for a try sometime.
restaurant in Wicker Park, not me. I never know about Wicker Park, because we live on 9th street, and now I know. Then one day, and I saw where it was, but without any kind of favor or political sign(talk about a "up to four year old sitting outside your back door" sign or anything like that), I moved in and we took our place in the doorway with six-year-old Jackie Curry and my older sister. We watched the game on TV, with their seats clearly ordered, and the game lights flickering. Yes, the Chicago Bulls are often described as a couple, but our small group showed up by 11:30 pm (Service staff for weathered sports minuses would want to watch and explain all of the knowledge they had about the Chicago Bulls, so we didn't see what we should. We had to order drinks, and later-on, our waitress would bring in chairs with the Chicago Bulls from the upstairs
restaurant, we've been to very few before, and just recently we went to Shaw's for lunch and dinner.
I just couldn't find the green sauce for my Chicago BBQ-based dinner.  I have been going for over 2 years and have never had a bad experience from the folks at Northwest Mississippi BBQ...Plus, having heard great things about this place in the Chicago area, I felt comfortable eating there...one night when we were out of town, we thought of going and ordering a drink at Wicker Park, but it was a bit pricey for $12, so the price was pretty standard.   Upon arrival, everything else looked good.  We ordered shrimp and our friend ordered hot dogs, what was perhaps the most refreshing thing about Wicker Park is the idea of having a slow cooker inside your sandwich... our friends (and I) ordered the duck, pork chop and the bacon vinaigrette.  We had some amazing meat on the side (by
restaurant, Pizza, Maki, and Rick's. These three dishes are among the best I have had in a long time, and I will always have fond memories with my father.
Very busy, but their Sunday brunch is a must for anyone wanting an authentic Italian American hangout in a charming neighborhood and fantastic outdoor seating. I have always had a huge appetite, but they've also offered a rare, limited edition of the great uni + carne asada, along with the pieces for dessert! Also, the service is pretty good for a one-stop shop, and their menu of pre-rolls is big enough to accommodate a large group, but at the same time they have a great menu, too!Great place to order before you go, and I'm always back!
Nice place to eat and eat the food at home. The steak up on the table is decent and they have some really good risotto as well. My new favorite thing for lunch at
restaurant, which means it is somewhat expensive, but the cake and cocktail portions are fantastic. The employees do do everything right, being a regular and super knowledgeable customer service person. The staff can usually be in touch with the server or even the manager, making their work feel more intimate. The bakery has a perfect blend of authentic Americana and Southern cuisine. They have multiple locations around the area, all that there's to see and do, so it's no surprise that they're willing to accommodate any occasion. On the plus side, it is very welcoming and the service was great too. You can get a coffee or other local, plus the neighborhood friendly, friendly staff makes the experience much easier.
My wife was enjoying the dinner service from the kitchen in the tasting room and enjoying the place itself.  We were honored and recognized, but left disappointed with the decor.  Our server was disappointed with everything we ate and, more importantly, the salad bar (grilled, cooked and

GREAT for Chicago, excellent location.
I'm a fan of this restaurant in my hometown. But when I read the reviews I thought I was taking the buffet off my list. The staff was excellent, they were as humble and as professional as they were helpful. I would highly recommend this place as a serious upscale dining destination. It could not have been more fabulous. I must say, the food tastes quite good. The stars were very promising but, have to admit, while I prefer the food in my hometown to that of here, my friend ordered his menu here from us the day we moved to Chicago and everything in between.   It's still very expensive for a traditional Mexican meal, but if you are not one of the Top 5 places in Chicago, this probably is the place for you
restaurant, wonderful food and we will be back soon, Happy Hour!
So kind and reasonable, but as soon as you hear an event about the homecooked fare at my own blog, I couldn't say a word about it. I know that I thought about going back but when I talked to employees at a restaurant they really, really insulted me and I feel sick and disappointed. Too bad, I think, they are just going to go back to work for now but I won't buy any plans they would have for this small restaurant.
I like the food, service, and music - and when you order the 12 oz hamburger it's pretty darn good.Great place, great prices, service - great dessert selection - and great BBQ sauce, but you can't get more reasonably priced without seriously losing out on some great old days for sure!
This is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in this town. The food is wonderful, the service is great, and the atmosphere
restaurant and to look nice, but having guests with a large crowd was far from necessary, since you could also turn around and take them out the back to check on any of the food and drink options.
My friend, Shawarma, got seated today. She'd definitely put her name on the menu. The waitstaff had ample feedback to support the menu, and they didn't disappoint. Being in a tight environment, we were going to grab some Gourmet burger for a (partial) lunch or dinner. She had the heavy cream lettuce salad with Pibbinus, and the Sour mustard in the mustard sauce, and the Mashed Potatoes, Sweet potato stuffed sweet potato salad with the Italian sausage, tomato, and mashed potatoes. We were served salads.  They actually had the Lettuce steak, which I didn't bother eating ( I don't like things cooked because it tends to be overdone with bread).  Just the usual fries and cold brew. They didn
restaurant, casual, of course, but the atmosphere, ambience, and service have moved on to the next level.
The good thing about both the pepper tempura and the spices is that they are almost identical.  As a side note, I like the cheese, which is mostly a spicy veggie dish, but my vegetable choices have been replaced by higher grade beef.  the veggie fat? nothing to crow about with much, it's like we're at Hopleaf, and the Ethiopian sauce is, well, tofu.  Yes, the pepper tempura with miso mayo is not my favorite dish of the day, but that's what they did here.  So, if your in a hurry, make yourself wait, because this restaurant will be right on time.
Yummy pizza! So good they have a brewery store with tasting room! Wonderful food!
just like Chickenbranche, it's so good you'll have to order (much less
restaurant and vegan friendly. We had a great selection of local cheese!
I found this place 2 days ago. I think it's called the Target House. It's a quaint little neighborhood dining joint by the middle of town. The bar, food, and atmosphere are everything I expected. I'll be returning once again because I thought they were beautiful. The place was fantastic. I had the mussels prawn with crabmeat.
This is the last stop on the vacationing movie-going gang. It is my favorite location in the Chicago area, I highly recommend going. We went at 6:30am on a Friday night for about an hour. A lot of the guests really liked the pizzas but it just doesn't feel like there are 3s when you order it at your table. What this place was lacking was a service and a great spot to get a great meal. Everyone was incredible!!! Everyone seemed to have great opinions on the menu (ie nitesh
restaurant, ordered at 6:30pm, were almost totally seated and this place seems uninspired to me because there are literally four tables, so I wonder what kind of dining experience that was! They served these hot dogs which are incredibly traditional Japanese sausage and the service was prompt and friendly. We went to Kuma for lunch and they were SO accommodating!
I won't be back... I'll be back.  We were there to see how best to order my lunch. It was amazing.  The food was good and very tasty.  The menu changes often.  My favorite was the crab and fried calamari sandwich, which I would prefer to go with the local coffee shop's tonka bean.  However, it wasn't exactly my favorite thing.  Try the Brawn Thigh Fried Rice which is easy to make in your mouth.  Don't like the pork side or do it yourself!  It can get really heavy and spicy and different options can be had
restaurant tables are massive! The owner gets super friendly and the coffee flowing - a delightfully spicy coffee.  It was a nice touch because we were heading towards our next meal.  We ordered the salad and I went to the salad bar instead.  The salad bar was rich and creamy and absolutely tastier than any other salad bar you could think of.  There was something to enjoy and there was something to eat.  We enjoyed every bite and went back for another try.   We'll definitely be going back.
Definitely go out to this place!  It's awesome too.  Great dog hair decor!
Wow! I love that I'm paying for food here...the cheese is really good, but the  burritos were pricey (around $20...the burrito was only $3!!). My favorite food is the goat cheesesteak. And since we've been in California, we've tried so many cheesesteaks here that it's
restaurant and I love it. The drinks are amazing too - like a fresh one! The flavor of the restaurant is always outstanding! The ambience, music and atmosphere is absolutely breathtaking. So amazing is this wine list that I am quickly becoming a palate cleanser. I love that we share it to keep customers busy. The walls of this restaurant are quite jumbled, but not too huge. Everything is so familiar, that for the first time it made me aware of it. I thought it was weird that it was very similar to Burberry Park. But after reviewing it again, the fact it was already much bigger then it was shocked me. I must say that every review I've had of this restaurant was overwhelmingly positive.  Overall, this is an amazing and unique family-friendly bar. We have all the champagne of Grand Arches, the cheesecake and the shrimp roll fondue - and I wish we could get the Champagne of Lovers. A huge thank you to
restaurant has been burned for hours to the ground by maniacal action from this establishment. I've never been to this place before and I really don't have anything to complain about - my server did a really great job. She's extremely friendly and I had the perfect caramelized sourdough with honey and many other unique flavors.  It's the perfect balance of all of those things. If you want something special, I recommend taking a seat at the bar or enjoy some of the indulgent clatters of heaven pouring from your chair. If you'd rather hit the popcorn place at night, then this is one place to go. Just know that if you're ever going to eat at a Big Mac just remember that it doesn't need to be really good.
Simply amazing! I ordered the Egg Nog appetizer and, after paying it back, ordered the salad combo with a salad bar combination. Wow! The owners of Egg Nog are actually quite knowledgeable and if it weren
restaurant is a small restaurant, located at 1220 South Fourth Street, for a group.We started by dining at Bakeryhouse. While there were some delicious items, they were lacking in variety.The staff is consistent and many of the dishes were disappointingly, yet not crowded and not out of place. Despite some unimpressive food, and the 'despair all it has' menu, the music was rock solid. Though, I feel that many of us want to serve what the dish says, but that's all personal preference. There are a variety of seating arrangements.The dining room was beautifully appointed, including six-person dining room or two of your choice, featuring chairs, perches, or lamps.We were curious what the dining room's diverse menu would bring to this setting. Do you know what appetizers, salads, and soups are? Do you know the prices? The number of choices and combinations is HUGE - 12 of which were very generous. The
restaurant in the city is just barely right. There are some amazing cuisine choices, as well as entertaining family and friends who love the food and really want to try it for themselves.  We are frequenting since last week for dinners, bachelorette parties and that little pizza.  We visited yesterday, where we decided to try a Brunch Lunch menu, with plenty of chicken, sausage, ham, cheese, and veggies (they are vegan; however, they have bacon on the side).  We ordered a cup of steamed tuna which was mediocre.  Chicken sandwich was not cooked.  The only thing we thought about was the caramelized cheddar cheese.  We didn't go back with any cheese.  That one is great.
Had the Burrito along with my lunch while we were there.  This place is a must have for vegetarians and vegans alike.  We always order at the window or outside if the food is well flavored.  Our
restaurant for guests enjoying their meat on the brain at their tables. We go there for a dinner and will be back. We can't wait to go back and we will visit again!
This may be our only long dinner ever.  Being the regular neighborhood slicker, all things considered, we get really excited about doing a long dinner here as this is not only my favorite sushi spot but also my favorite sushi place in Chicago!  There's really not much going on here other than the food and service.  Not an overnight gourmet diner with a capacity to take you wherever you want but a place full of happy customers is a very special place!
I have owned this restaurant for a very long time.  I had never been to Chex's before but had to back down to try it out.  The chef workday started early and was so darn enjoyable.  The atmosphere was friendly, friendly, lively, playful, and it was the dining room.  The
restaurant is   The drink.  If you think it's going to be a long ride for us, you'll be disappointed.  With the crepes!  Crispy and a light freshness, the beefy, flavorful crepes are a unique combination.
This restaurant is soooooooo good.  Really cool ambiance.  Beer selection is good.  Popcorn cakes were all I knew I would be able to find at this place.
I really like this location!  They come with all kinds of specialty items, and you will be enticed by the tasty variety!  I will definitely come back for dinner.  Their drink selection is big and the staff has a great sense of humor.  My wife and I loved this place, and their drinks were outstanding.  My husband also won a gold medal (and he was dressed in a pretty white cardigan) for his ice cream roll.  I have heard they do not allow party items on
restaurant is lucky I didn't choose to spend $12 for this, because I loved their wine selection and lacked the cashless "thumbs up" thingie.   Service here was great and don't worry - I did have a customer service problem, but I'm glad I wasn't, because I also loved the service.   The food was good, but my girlfriend likes it that much.We opted for the hostess, and ate there with us.  I didn't realize that she brought my girlfriend to pick up my ingredients.  We had the macaroni salad and salad bar which was quite bad at best.  I never felt like I was making her up about what she was up to.  We finally tried the cool concoction and my girlfriend tasted like she was a pig.  She asked if we would like it and came up with whatever cooked better!  I'm pretty sure it was the macaroni salad and salad bar which our server
restaurant, dessert and service. Their chef knows their soul. Their margaritas are very, very tasty, fabulous, and fun. As for the wine list, you can't go wrong. If you're looking for the best drinks, you're looking for genuine ales. Really. They've certainly packed some of the best wine bars in this city for you to try and find a party the right size. So if you're looking for the best fresh love and attention, what better place to do it than Lemongrass?
Tentative food experience.  Its super cheap and fresh.
What I love about this place, this place.  All of the dishes, the food, the service, is superb!
Naya's is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago, definitely.  On an informal Sunday night, our waiter was very prompt with our appetizer order.  My daughter loves her wings! The staff is friendly and accommodating of requests,
restaurant - Joe The Reindeer Stew...or the kind of stew made from an actual, real frozen, raisins...it's so well-done and so tasteful. Oh, don't stop there - my food for anyone who lives in New York City is very well prepared and inexpensive - You know, that shit they throw in the dish if you insist...
I did a little visit in Chicago last month with my family.  I had the following appetizers: onion rings (one dessert from the menu) and pineapple.  All of the food was excellent, but the dish was just not as good.  I asked the owner if I could have the pineapple and he said yes.  He added a little tartar sauce to it to make sure that the pineapple didn't flavor the pineapple.  I felt like I was missing something.  I tried a couple of the other appetizers and all were great.  Another thing was the last meal that I had
restaurant delivery service and our vegetarian section is one of the best!
The atmosphere here is very unique and the staff really deserves their time in the car! Great beer selection! Try this fine bagel as they never serve my rice/leeks.
This is one of my favorite restaurant in Dallas.  The food was always excellent.  If I were visiting from out of town, I would definitely go here!  The food is delicious and different from every other restaurant I've eaten in Chicago.  I try a lot of different meats and don't have to get a reservation for them and if you want a better flavor in your kitchen, please consider coming here!  Again, most people here will rave about their pizza. I love coming here!
If you live in the area, it's worth going and playing with the Getaround  for what you can eat...check it out on the block. They can give you 1-star food specials, but they're not
restaurant and ice-cream tasting at The Taste. I love seeing some food coming out of these places, and it's always perfect to have an order of food and a tip if you want to impress.  I have walked out after the famous event and will definitely be back again.  I'll definitely be back for more, and I'll be taking out more diners when I live in Durham!
This place has become a favorite for a family of seven to visit before the party finally gets there! You must be kidding me about how great it is! If you're not, go there now!  For a very special reason, the atmosphere and food are not to dull.  The service is consistently excellent as is the food...If you go to Loop they do get you the an hour before the party.  I mean, all about our party.  Not only that, they want your dinner for them.  Wait staff is incredibly friendly and there is a great menu
restaurant counter, the hot dogs, the falafel wraps and more.This is our dinner, they even give it a funky birthday vibe.  Their food is amazing, love the experience!Their wines are amazing and always some of the most interesting we've had.  I'm usually disappointed by $6 for a bottle.The service was a nightmare and the wait staff was not knowledgeable. It's just not the amount of experience you want with a restaurant. The others staff was amazing as well.
Simply marvelous.  Save yourself the hassle and enjoy!  Our customers have been outstanding - they are as friendly as they come.  It's hard to believe that we would be on time this month.
The host is so friendly and he know how to ask what's best! I just love going to Fox Island for a sushi joint, it's fun and nice to meet new people! The other restaurants I've tried, along with Ruth's Cafe, are perfect for a
restaurant". The bar was rather awash with people enjoying their food. It's hard to say how many people actually went there and those from the outside it was a very busy place. My wife and I had a decent pizza and I ordered a capuchin pizza which I forgot to order. I can recall nothing quite like it. I was also extremely impressed with the freshness of the vegetarian offerings. The waitress asked if we wanted veggie burgers as well as some or another salad which I never had. I sat down by my table after waiting 25 minutes for the food to finish (we were supposed to order all the pizzas on the table which didn't take longer. I'm sure the food looked and felt like sausage that's been cooked at 2-3 temp. when there was lots of mush and grease that were all in the sauce and cheese as well). Our waitress didn't have a mention of the major courses we ordered. Overall she was very pleasant and helpful!
C
restaurant bar, once it opened, it was definitely a fantastic experience. It was in a rustic, relaxed environment. They went with high quality beers, as were plenty of steak fries and sherry martinis. It is a large outdoor club with a huge patio seating area. It will take about an hour for reservations to arrive.  The service was prompt, the food was delicious, the prices were reasonable, and the time required for reviews.  The cool layout and ambiance suggested a good place to be since it is perfect for a cozy afternoon and lunch date.
Love this place!  Great potato roll and chipotle fondue.  Our only disappointment is they can't find the menu.....unless you're special, right?  The prices arent very cheap.  Prices for the service are decent and cheap.  My brother and I have been going here since we moved to Coronado.  They are very open about their menu.  Also, the bart
restaurant) and served with a combination of different ingredients to keep their jellies fresh for a holiday celebration.I was the only customer (after sending an email) who couldn't be bothered. He could have read a review and recognized my casserole's as being exactly what they were, rather than the other way around. I ordered the lemonade and it was delivered the other night. My husband and I didn't even bother checking the date, because he didn't believe it. It was the wrong time for a date in Chicago to be booked in advance, so we waited a whole weekend. I just don't want to read about a party that walked in expecting it was spoiled to be just a gift from a guy with a purple dress shirt. We went on the night in December and waited for the plane to arrive. It was well worth the wait. It really was great dinner for dinner, too, and even better pizza. The food was delivered the same way, much
restaurant, the food was alright, and the staff was friendly. There was so much great food to be had soooo much on special occasions, and the service was always stellar. The meal was okay as well, but not worth the price.
No big deal, 2 lives, lots of wine, and nothing unique to entree...WHAT THE F*CK IS STUFF! THE GORDONERS ARE LOAD TO OAT MEAT (Big Boss) WHICH WILL NEVER GO ON!!!!
I love what this place has.
I just picked up this place in Lincoln Square last week for the third time. It's been a long time since I'd walked in and visited, so this place should be highly recommended.The carob churro/cheese is amazing! The sandwich is also fantastic (again, like like the bakery that opened in their former location). All in all, I'd recommend this place, but not go there if you like that
restaurant seats and which I have tried only once before.  I guess because they don't have the capital's native restaurant space the restaurant is hardly unique.  However, if you want a solid, top notch experience, I would recommend staying here for just a few dollars.
I couldn't go wrong with my meal.  The pasta is always great, even if they use plastic cups instead of small bagged wine.  Other than that, the best part is I always get the chicken, and the crab.  I definitely recommend this restaurant!
The stuffed gator roll rolls were spectacular - the cheese topping was really flavorful and balanced. The ranchero was a little crispy but worth it. You have to spend some time to get used to the toppings. and if you're going for a sophisticated meal you can't go wrong with the grits.  I would definitely go here again.
This is definitely one of the least important places I've gone before.
restaurant and serving the specialties they make. I LOVE YUMMY! Every time I go there I order something new and it comes to me with a short review. My gf and I know everything about veganism, so why not try it?  YUMMY! YUMMY!
We are coming back for a dinner party and the restaurant is very interesting and friendly.The music is great, but not too loud either. I like the dinner too.
This place is quaint and quaint.  The food is really good, but the service is not good.  There is food deprivation when you go there. The service is not as good and busy as it used to be.  Not good for the cuddly crowd of friends.I definitely would return.
Oh man! The Tipple Bar will no doubt be a hit if you go there! It is probably the most romantic place I have ever been to and the seafood dishes are top notch! Also
restaurant group was fantastic. I had the cream-a-days drink and had the Hot Paschal. I've been a restaurant fan since I was 9 and am not disappointed. Also I've been taking courses and working at jazz clubs. One of my worst experiences of my college career. It has been on my radar since the '90s as my favorite time to go to jazz school.
Nice meat, hard meat, and great drinks. I've been a tipper for years now, and always am going back. I'll go again when I get home.
First time I went there they brought me a girl with a beautiful nose, which is the most awesome thing I've ever heard of.  It's a nice cozy touch.  They have jazz music and their music itself is absolutely remarkable.  Oh and I also wanted to check out the decor.  You will love it.
This place is a real hit with those that only care about the true food
restaurant. Lovely egg roll and a nice side salad! and they also recommend trying the XXXXX and XXXXX Family style of seafood dishes for sushi.  They also love to take and use fresh marinated shrimp in it.  The meats used in the salad were undercooked and would have to be overcooked to bring them to life. The best thing about this place is that everything about it is better than just how you eat the salad.  Now if you like BBQ and want to eat with one of the many dozens of big family-friendly restaurants in your town, you'll definitely be glad to try this place. You'll love the brisket, but also the scrumptious soy sauce.  And the beers are terrible.  Not a very good quality one for beer.  Good beer selection.
Oh boy the art is impeccable.  The culinary tricks are actually neat.  The food is exactly the sort you're used to seeing here...the bean salad
restaurant and he could do that if he wanted.So far I have been disappointed at the service!  To me it was very rude.The tables they were in front of were stuffed very thin and had a person in each one watching.  The heat had not been too oppressive and the only reason I am underwhelmed by this restaurant is because they have no decor whatsoever and would like the grill to remain untouched.  Yes, it was a small grill on the grill.  What a waste of space!There was a reason why the friends with reservations or customers leaving at 11:45 that they were back.  I have never been to better seats with better service!
Great food and amazing music.  What makes this place the best? I tried it at Toplek which was an out of town rave.  Highly recommend!!! Great place to dine at!
my friend and I would recommend stopping in for lunch. Our server was nice and friendly.  I
restaurant was rude and patronizing, nothing special. At least they took $10 from you.
Another good Mexican restaurant I ordered two of them as soon as I checked.  Well done so I wish I had been there sooner, but all the staff was extremely nice and patient.  I cannot say enough good things about the food.
Few e-liquids here.
This place is full of food and not only that, very reasonably priced.  Really smooth.  I find good bargains in the happy hour at around 6:00pm the downside, that the parking is often a mess.  Wish they would do better next time I go.
Make sure you sit at the counter ( when he swears he is on their best watch list and you're in no mood for good food! ) and sit at the left corner before going to pick up food (I know they have this delicious line but when you leave they get down and dirty anyway ) 
restaurant even like it. Just in time for dessert here, we went with a group of around 5 friends.  Their decor is quite contemporary, with catfish plates, dried meat, seafood, sweetened sourdough and some fantastic treats. The list of drinks and appetizers made the night interesting, so if you'd like to bring some friends, we'd love to have their food. Unfortunately, we were completely down and by mid afternoon they were running out of space, and the host was just screaming at us for food.  At the same time they were being jammed, which would explain why there wasn't any food left.  Our groups made our meal too much longer than expected, so we ordered a couple more beers and decided to leave just to get their share.  After a couple beers we had to put it off because we were just too hungry.  Great restaurant in Yolk!!!  We had dessert and fruit/food at this upscale restaurant for the price of
restaurant, and we really wanted to sit on the dining room floor for this party. You'll find it there many times, and here's hoping you'll be pleasantly surprised if you are seated with the hostess.Our server took over as the server, our hostess was the point of interest. I know that she is a good hostess, but it was really hard to take on a seat because the place was packed. We are usually seated in the dining area, and my partner and I were too. Aside from the lack of seating that we had, everything was good. But when we were brought in, and there were no tables, the wait got to be beyond the point of being "come here". To top it off, the waiter seemed to be under any sort of stress. With our table on the table, the guys sitting next to us proceeded to work on the chicken, grilled cheese, and cake. It was still there. All of this was completely unproductive
restaurant. It wasn't my cup of tea at the steakhouse or parking lot, but it was there nonetheless.The steakhouse had different type of red meats.  They had cut oysters which were soaked in white flour to melt, as well as saucy oysters on top which were fried in white flour to melt.  I always had this. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich which was served with the sausage and the meat broth.  We had the Chicken Zoucan which was seasoned with shrimp broth which I ate with my family of 8.  They didn't have that good sauce.  We had the chicken breast which was wrapped in carrion oil to caramelize and cooked like bacon but still nice.  The restaurant did a great job of balancing our appetites and those of our guests.  The extra flavors made my mouth water.  Not having chips and salsa was a plus!  I would definitely be back.I really want to go back with
restaurant? Would it really be the same as on a traditional tasting menu? I'm still trying to decide. The taste is incredible.The food was top notch.I recommend this restaurant to anyone. It is a true story! I will be returning for brunch. It's a great place to eat some different things to settle in! I love their Peking Duck soup.
Food was great, decor was really well done. Great unique combination of kinds of burgers and salads. I love greek like beef- Fajitas deli like being B&B's/Perry's/Tamales which we also prefer. I don't usually go on, but I thought that this place was awesome, so I might have ordered as many, if not the ones in our car. The only issue is that there were a lot of mistakes in the delivery service.  Not a big deal, but not so good that they didn't even bother to post it on the drive up (
restaurant?  Obviously, there's not enough space for the 5-8 people around it to compete with... but wait... do I need any more staff?  Really.  Sure.  Maybe I should thank the Aunts for putting together an impressive party at the morgue?  Yum!  Wow!
Amazing food and ambiance. Excellent service, for a lot of people. Their breads are full of artichoke hearts that make you wish they had pancake batter. Their black beans are great.  Two people over 20 and we are family and friends!  Service was great. A nice little place that gets a mention.
Good lunch for a 2nd one night in. Food was good.
Be the first to say to the lady at the top right of the front table that when we go to Antiques, we should make sure that it's worth the extra $10 to get there (or $2 for a refill).  And they
restaurant atmosphere. We love the shrimp with the homemade popcorn and appetizers that come in the meal. If you want to celebrate with family and friends you can do that in a few minutes. This is just too rare for our staff to serve food at Alinea. I wouldn't go back.
Great owner! and safe walking distance!  Breakfast, lunch and dinner were excellent!
Hands down my favorite Italian place. Del Nino is truly a favorite. If you don't find yourself avoiding them out of fear of getting blocked and scolded for eating their soup, I highly suggest this restaurant. The staff is knowledgeable and attentive as well as caring and accommodating. Both the pastry chef and his assistants work with daily to provide excellent service, quality fresh ingredients, and tasty, innovative, delicious food. A couple of more times i don't use them. Its been so good for a while now.
My dad loves this place!!!  It's BYOB, of course,
restaurant. Delicious. Staff was attentive and attentive as well.
I am a Chicagoan and I definitely had the steamed pork broth first time I was there. I had the beef and it was alright. The first time we went there I was more interested in our meat options then the pork in the broth which I ordered in the grill. The waiter helped me once and he was wonderful. My wife and I took our two - 30% off of every steamed pork we ordered. We just don't eat meat at breakfast. My wife and I look forward to her returning as well. These people who work at Friday night I went to for lunch have an incredible and talented restaurant staff. We had the mango deep dish. The mango deep dish is more flavorful than the other dishes. Our chicken was delicious and the steamed pork, like nothing I have had, was a perfect match. Good food, good service.
I really enjoyed this place but from the previous night when we
restaurant and hangout (you know, the one at 521 Boyz N Dawg). Also a great place to have something to enjoy like sandwiches or chocolate! If you want out of the way get there early. It's surrounded by restrooms that look good from the sidewalk but are also warm, loud, and hot. Save some money here and come the next day!
On a typical Sunday night at Lusitania, the cast of characters in the TV show The Big Short will each have a piece of ice cream and a short beer....and its getting hotter (maybe by around 2 p.m.) after this only hour ago they thought, "the fanciest thing about pizza is this delicious crust on a plate" and they went on to offer numerous changes to the cupcake recipe....one that could have been invented for several years and slightly modified if time were not on their side.  The rest was a bunch of dumb questions, guffaws and results that
restaurant service is fantastic, we definitely want to go back and grab another reservation.
I used to run down the great Bonappold and de Clardrie this time around.I think it's about time that we come here again. I've had some pretty good dishes here (good) but I don't think that's due to cooking, I just eat it like it's supposed to be served. They have their own servers, so I just have to have wait for that big box delivery lady. You don't have to wait for a happy hour. I also agree with the fact that the atmosphere is a little ridiculous. We walked in very early and were asked for one guy to sit next to us, and he refused. I think the wait was far too long for most patrons to enjoy, the service was definitely awful. The table was overwhelming, but we still had a wait and i don't think that we have the right to patronize a venue that has been buffet
restaurant and wedding guest. The food was very good, and also very inviting and fun. The diner staff was knowledgeable about bringing you one plate at a time. There was the folks from each plate (can't remember names) who was very attentive and quick to find an appetizer, and who provided what made a particular dish unique. Some of the best sandwiches and salads I've ever had on a Saturday night and Sunday morning. The service was friendly and the food was different from a brunch.We also ordered in non-traditional courses (i.e. salad). There were some great courses, and the service was extremely helpful. We had brought in a group of 1-2 because we loved every one of our people and loved how the food was cooked!
I finally managed to get on this recently, thanks to my friends who mentioned to us about Will Leffer's book & were impressed with it.  The ordering process was smooth & simple, but the service was great,
restaurant, service, atmosphere, and factfinding are all beautiful memories to have. The meal I ordered was very expensive.  They only had about 45 minutes to take my friend to the restaurant as I had a few reservations in advance.  Our order was stuck and left as we left and ran outside.  This is the restaurant where you have a reason to do a joint menu, and the owner was very rude.  There is another restaurant in Dayton, but it is too small, too crowded for me, and still gets it at the restaurant at this time of day, the reviews on that website suggest it is better than the average joint on Michigan Avenue.
Gooooood!!  The options are amazing, and nothing is under the radar that will upset you.  But then again, I am pretty into food and I love it!  The prices on many things are reasonable.  I will definitely be returning.  You must find a good location for this steakhouse.
restaurant, bringing fresh produce, old soups, food, and everything in between. Food for all. While staying at the restaurant I must say I went to Steak House & the host actually brought his famous sate-oh teasy skillet with a firecracker on the side. Oh my, it was such a strong sauce! I have never tasted anything so good!
This place has a very eclectic selection, and very loud. There is usually a line but I guess this is the place to come.  Food is just normal, good and pretty. My only complaint is that there isn't a quill sign to run the restaurant so I can be cold for the evening but otherwise this place is just great.
I know that when I think of delish tacos, I am taken aback at how beautiful and delicious those were. All of them are very great, and it was an easygoing place to enjoy a weekend meal. The meat, to be exact, was
restaurant, cara romance and server behind the counter,are all fine, but the service here was terrible and my wife had to choose between their "super friendly" great chicken entrees or the terrible food.  The food was very disappointing, especially the ribs... not sure what the price was, but your average menu goes to a sub-$10-12 cheeseburger, and the beef had a lot of meat.  It really didn't make sense.  Instead of waiting 20 minutes for one of the things that made for the brisket, we went to a BYOB bar and got the Bloody Mary thing for under $6 a box.  We never again went back!  Finally getting the shrimp on the side, my wife and I stood at the counter and had to wait, so she said, okay.  I mean, this was a very good plate (I never had shrimps on my end, which is often acceptable), but the prices for
restaurant." The catering, however, is good and the number of selections are impressive. The steak bar, steak house, and some select wines are less than stellar.
This is a restaurant that I am always looking for something special. And quite honestly, don't expect to get anything that I can't believe, just that I cant believe it. Although your place makes it look as though everything is totally out of balance, the hostess is perfectly placed to help you fill your pallette. If you are all too used to being overwhelmed with flaky table top dishes (from the grilled sardines, griddle cakes, etc.), then maybe you will at least consider ordering the two entrees that are topping the menu with the meatball salad and the churros. Or it could be that the waitress offers a big variety of vegetables, such as basil and onions. Is this just a work of art?? Food is great, service is excellent, and this place is giving all
restaurant, I must say that this place really ran out of their shrimps. I'm not saying their food was bad, but I doubt a mule would be happy with them because, yes, they cut the ingredients for their steak, but in all honesty, I felt badly for the people at Sorento. I'd rather that it was 2 other 5 dairies. So, I will always go to Sorento once again. I do want to mention that, for my birthday, Sorento is one of my favorite restaurants in town. The service really shines when working with staff and maybe I can be a bit better with my hair? Now this place has their own name. It's a far cry from their traditional 7 year old burrito, because it lacks fries, and the burrito is pretty much full anyway. The food has something different and refreshing in a completely different way, but the burritos are the best. They do
restaurant who continues to work hard, tries hard to come up with tasty menu choices, and treats his customers with outstanding service.  And, these people make their own wine.  At only $14 a bottle, I feel like I'm standing on the verge of a behemoth.But that isn't what they were told, and a lot of its hard work is done at Tenderloin.  That was the date that I did this whole drive back.  When I arrived at the restaurant on another date at 3:30, and I thought that was three days ago, the manager greeted me at the door and said, "We have the Sunday brunch menu, we'll give you a free swiss rue," and we ran downstairs.  I will never forget it!  Then I walked back, rolled up my sleeves and walked out, to a group of about two dozen people waiting outside.  They were all young people, less than twenty-five. 
restaurant, it was the best lunch I've had there in Chicago and I've always enjoyed the dishes from Schuyler and Schuyler as well.  Schuyler's snacks include the nachos, sandwiches, coffee and grilled chicken, and the salad bar, which I think is the best I've ever had.
I enjoyed this place.  The food was fantastic.  I didn't believe it when I went.  I've had meatloaf in Buffalo, what a mistake.  I like their topically handled raw veggies, but what about the spinach?  Mmmmm....I don't think so.  Didn't get the seafood.  Make sure you get the chicken as well.  Very good.
If you don't think it was amazing then you're looking at a garbage bar.  The food is bad, the decor is too broken and the food is just not good.  We tried, three different beers, wines and wine
restaurant is this one, let me explain. It is an elegant restaurant that provides the best in AMAZING coffees. These desserts are so super-a-grunge and oh so refreshingly generous. I am an intimate, very intimate restaurant here and I am very sad to see the unassuming restaurant that is Deloitte considerbe leaving. Please let us in on the secret. It must be the afternoon before the parade. It must be them time! I will have to put my point about their mannerism behind them and with their no interesting chicago related menu, and their typical Italian decor, it seemed to me, would eventually serve more simpleminded dishes than my usual pizzas. Great place to catch a half of your time with friends!
I love this place! Food is prepared so well by you guys and our two girls who work here! And now we eat at the happy hour instead of outside, the women sit around a corner with food coming from
restaurant is always wonderful, especially if you've had his regular menu (slowly reviewed here). A couple decades ago, he ran a simple tasting menu with meats, vegetables, beans, and peas. It was a little too eclectic for my tastes and he decided to leave me feeling like he was taking it down with me! It would have been a great way to come back to save some money but as I've gone with my wife it has become a more 'accessible' place.  She is a total savy eater and she has been running the dim sum restaurant since it opened in 1997.  I definitely will definitely be back.
My favorite Italian pizza in Chicago. I am talking about the Four Seasons, almost. You are probably thinking, this is a thing.  Why do you think they carry more than two and a half food, while they seem to be extremely limited in choices?
Really good pizza with great service, food, drinks, and dessert. Will back
restaurant, location, food, and service. I recommend paying one-time fee for a menu but will definitely do a weekly check out!
The chicken was good, but not everything that you would like from one of the best restaurants in Chicago. Overall I would go back to Chicago, but would highly suggest going to Blade's.
Huge selection of Asian food in Chicago, service and delicious.
Went with my boyfriend today and took home about $50.00 worth of wine and food. Not a true crepe diner. Had the dog in February & had the soup in October, had the shrimp and chicken in May & February, and stayed to pick up the food and go to the restaurant the next day. With the rest of the staff, the food was good, yet the menu and recommendations were extremely consistent with what they posted on Yelp. Definitely recommend!
Having visited Lelio recently, I'm extremely pleased with what I'm seeing in the improvement of
restaurant/food menu) : Good seating layout and excellent overall experience.
Bacon is really, really good. This is definitely a staple of any living room. i love the caramelized onion, kalamata olives and seasonal lime. their chicken dishes are amazing - huge portions and the rice gets your to-go and your bum's feast every night.  some of the best smokestack in Chicago.  bring your own bathroom item to have.your momma love to cook there - even her children do that. make reservations now, thats good.
Great food,and great pizza  There is really a lot going on here. This is the only place in the city you will not find a place that is NOT able to give away the street food. I will stick with their eggs Benedict.
GREAT!  For about $6 you will get the BBQ chicken with good quality Mexican sausage.  The food and service is awesome, all the vegetables are
restaurant at the top of this amoebaa is the best in Chicago. I love Triton Soup here because it is rich and has an excellent panini taste. The roast potatoes have been cooked perfectly and are tender and tender with little chunks of fresh (simply cut) shredded skin, and are delicious! Besides, it's a pleasant thought for sure! On a recent visit, the waiter came up to us and was disappointed. He seemed entirely indifferent, but I understand that a friendly waiter is needed in an emergency situation, especially after a failed brunch.
I do not think I would describe the location of this restaurant as quaint, but rather as idyllic, a castle-like setting. We had the Clok (the rarest of all sausage forms) and the Black Bean Scallop and quickly realized that we could not order a single piece. We ordered the Asiago, it was amazing, but the mojitos (lucky most sausage form)
restaurant and in an ideal light. We believe in high quality food, strong service, efficient service and the world's best Steakhouse. Eat here frequently.
I've been going here and I've always had a great experience and I'm glad it was this popular. But if you're like me and you find yourself annoyed and rude by visiting it in order to get into the warmer spots, don't go. Do it for friends and maybe coworkers and even for yourself, rather than trying to snooze. If you're a long time Luxe fan looking for a relaxed dining experience with open wings on the weekends (probably, but I'm planning on going there on another occasion) check this place out. And if you're looking for a decent dining experience, go with the ample amount of thought and attitude on your plate. So much for smiles on the face, happy little joints.
The food is excellent.  They're pretty decent too, especially on the meal specials
restaurant, tea bar, and delicious tables.On a Thursday night, it takes 6-7 good people of the community to get into the hip neighborhood.  If you live nearby, ask around and try the Slenderman Pub.  That is like having a bus stop on the opposite side of you.My family lives in the area and they would not mind eating at the hot dog joint upstairs. It's just another cool warm scene in the area. The regular family like us will dine there twice a year. If you are coming from out of town, try the Diner on Broadway, Old Havana, which has lots of food, friendly, and friendly service.  Try taking my brother on an afternoon alone on a weekday in the South and get over your special needs issues.As a fan of old favorite pan fried chicken, the Pig in the Iron Door, and especially the Three Step, ask any of my friends at 6PM if they like it here!

restaurant on a Saturday night

I love looking at this restaurant as being connected to Chicago's city of ups and downs, but I must say that the Chicago Sun-Times is a disappointment. I've had been to dozens of Hot Dogs and in all it is more snazzy than nice. If it is not on the top notch that is, a taste test may actually be warranted. I have been to 20 Hot Dogs for business so far but I have never found an item above average. But wait, I knew this couldn't be good. While the Hot Dogs are exceptional and delicious, they do not place an appropriate value on the quantity of hot dogs in a restaurant. We've had hot dogs of all sizes, some with special locations and some for $5. I was completely unprepared for such a statement on the Chicago Sun-Times, not least because I'm from another city and have never been to Chicago.The food came down to the essentials, and the server gave
restaurant;they can choose to split it with small portions;the sushi is definitely better than most because it was decent;the chicken is cooked hot with tofu (and i suggest steamed hot!),and the entrees are spicy;and they all look like a big high school feast!and to top it all off, they had the large assortment of desserts - which i think is cool, but a little expensive for something like that.
I've been to Mushroom Lovers many times in the past. All the menus are terrific. The staff is friendly and the waiters are very professional. Just get to know the customer and you'll definitely be a hit. -My absolutely favorite place to have such a great lunch in Southern California. -The only reason I've ended up staying here the first time is because I'm quite waitstaff. One of my favorite moments of my trip was my presentation of Dr. Marcio Caratolai. The host seemed in no mood to listen
restaurant/perks/cheese/fish specials etc. Their food is small and inexpensive and delicious. Everytime I go I realize it will be 10k-15k diners. They have a nice new word for it: DISS.
Not sure why I'm posting this but I think I'm a very bothersome chap. This place is the 'Cocaine Pool' but just for any place. It's big and the atmosphere is very nice. The closest Cafe I've been to is (Smoothie) which is the closest sushi place I've ever seen. If you're into sushi you can usually order food and not be bothered with the quality of the rest of your meal.
Love Cuban food, Family owned and is for boys only!! this place is on my school bus, they have to wait on my bus,  so I have to wait for them to come back
This place is really good,  I can actually enjoy it at least
restaurant & get to enjoy the food!
Just a short walk from my neighborhood bar, here in Bayview!  Our server was super polite and did everything right with everything I was asked.   Service was really good and staff is always up to par.  I'm not sure about this place, but I think we would all prefer that.  There's always one person who is SUPER friendly and my friend had to be nice and to wait.
If you love country music,  roll into our Musique Orleans instead!  Love the crowd and atmosphere!  Bring the lemons and onion soup and take a bite!
I am an avagel and this is my fifth visit here, and I have heard great things about the dining experience in terms of food and service.  I think the food is good, and the presentation is better than any of the others and if you are something of a surfer, my recommendation would be to go and enjoy yourself before
restaurant.
Most likely the City of Craig could never give us the green light to go here on the weekends and I definitely suggest go here. The desert was romantic. We went from north of Chicago to the suburbs by car. Some years the show was basically over, never mind if it was for an episode at very best, pretty par for the course. For sure I will try not to bother going again.
One of the best can't beat this place.  The bathroom is impressive and the food is amazing.  The service can be nice but we know what you are getting yourself into and don't pay too much.  Maybe the space is small for some reasons, but it's worth it.  You will not believe how many times I've stayed there and been very much loved by the staff and guests.  I really do think that was the key to it.
I had the BLACK ARROW tacos a while ago. I know I'm spoiled by
restaurant and provide a great sense of comfort and service as well as great food. The menu is a different from typical pizza places. We ordered the duck roast with fresh olives that was a great meal but also came with an entree of potatoes and rice. The beers were nice, but they still don't have the consistency and flavor I like. The sandwiches are fantastic, but you have to go with a large portion to enjoy the special and I really need more beers to get through the years. Just make sure to bring some friends along too and bring a can of Guinness because that really tastes like lollipops in that neighborhood. For my next visit they'll give me some peanuts (did I mention it's great?) and they also have a Chicken Tenders as well!Cheers,Katie
Went to La Farge this past Sunday for our "Year of the Pig". We were happy to have had two people in the group.One of them showed us how
restaurant. Very very good food and the fries are flavorful and the can you expect are slightly shorter than in college bar ones. 
This is the best dining experience I've had at Madison Square Garden. Food is always in class, lovely atmosphere and the same great staff.The vegetarian/vegetarian version is missing in comparison. I love their ceviche which is great.  They also have the ice-cream they deliver. The main dish is the french toast where I'm always giddy after eating. Plus they are usually busy and take my friends by the hair very seriously. These are high end establishments, but I try to avoid them.
this place is awesome
Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
restaurant manager says there is no promotion at the mouth of the road but when we arrived, there was about 20 people waiting. The list I had for a long time from the table came to about 30. Next time, I will be looking at the very next table but will probably wait until after lunch to get a seat. Now, if I see an opportunity to change, that is my option. If my tastes are not so interesting, I want to come and take my complaint to you because when you come in there will be no kind of cookie menu or anything like that. We would make the trip again, wait for the table, and pay to have a complimentary drink while we wait. The thing I had the worst experience was the extreme service. After a long discussion, there was no applause when the waiter informed us that the wait-time for a seat was over 40 minutes, so we left feeling bad. They quickly contacted us again, apologizing to us. Now I realize that
restaurant, 5 star. Besides, they had a great entree for each menu item. Great because we never get to go back.
Honestly, a good burger joint. A&W better steak and lobster than Grand Slam. Highly recommended.
I love the food, service and ambiance of this place.  The only thing I am going to say is that the wings are not all that flavorful, but in a way they were all great.  I have been to this restaurant twice.  The first time I had a wonderful turkey and the second time was hot dog.  However, the hot dog only lasted about 45 minutes and they said nothing because it was getting hot inside.  My food always tasted amazing - hot and fresh, not very tasty at all.  The names of their servers and the number of that drink was just enough to ruin the meal.  If they are supposed to be their own owners I'm going to take them out on a date soon.
restaurant, noon to 12pm, they come over as friendly as they get, and they do not get my grease, just mine. But when I came down for lunch this past weekend I couldn't wait to see what was inside. They will be back!
People. Food. Loved all the tasty ingredients. Everything that I've ever eaten has been incredible. Come on, here's what I want to say: they don't care about what you say - if you're not a pizza lover or a stickler for good quality, by all means go and check them out!
Best dessert EVER!   I've been wanting to try this place since it was in my forties. The falafel is the biggest thing that makes it special: It's basically just old me (not dark in color) served this way.  I am not sure why I gave it such high grade - it was a meal off of seasoned beef which is never so golden. 
restaurant may change.
I couldn't wait to go to the Fonda on the Cestino.  But once we get there (at 12:15), we order the pasta that we feel like it was made in the kitchen before our establishment (1 lb. here, 2 lb. there).  We're kind of a fan, and we love thinking of moving to this place with all the food we eat, and over the years we've got two areas I've wanted to return to - but never lived out the dream.Now, when you think about this place! The BBQ shrimp dishes are a perfect way to get you up, grab some quick fries or something, and eat a few bites in that, right at your fingertips. You can even make your own desserts, so come back and try it, because it has me raving about it. From the appetizer. It's practically the best food in the neighborhood. I will definitely make a return visit.Thanks
restaurant; Hamou & Soufry; Veal with Bread & and a Salty Beef Stew; Piccolo with Maple chips and Sriracha; Chicken with valsi (going only 2/3 the cost); beef with almonds with spaghetti; spicy tuna with potatos; avocado salsa with Shrimp; Beef with Ravioli (crispy and nice) & SAUCE OF YUM. For everything else, we had a huge brunch reservation.We had a Great Food, Lots of Consultant,Awesome Service. Our waitress was well known, and attentive and sweet. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting. It was a great blend of Country and good drinks.For an inexpensive lunch it was an interesting and wonderful experience.
I love this restaurant so much.  I just wish there was another spot nearby so we can get more drinks in there.
This is the BEST prix fixe brunch in Chicago. I live a no-nonsense, almost
restaurant) 5.5/5
I had good time at the BBQ my brother ordered at the same time with my sister! We shared a table at the Grand Cafe and had drinks at the bar. I waited a bit while for dessert and then got there. I was so happy I ordered the paper burger which I liked and tried it.  It was better. We won't be back, or go back.   We will definitely be back to try the Lincoln's.
Shaw was fantastic!!I could not be happier with the food!  It's definitely worth the money.
I bought the  Plan B Voda and it was a rather loud music venue. However, it was very comfortable and delicious.  Food was tastefully prepared.  Overall, one of the best vacations on this mezzanine!
Service was good. However, the food was really bad. Service was not in the industry and I apologize for this.
The chocol
restaurant are so good. I never looked to see them at any of the other places I went. When you get to the yuppie space at the Corner, you're sitting on your stomach and your eyes closed to the sun. When you are all alone in your seat in a cozy, comfortable space and windblown ceiling covered by deep blue curtains, you are saying something to yourself, to yourself, to yourself. My friend and I are not only seated on a five star Yelp rating, we've been at a location they call The Sausage Market. We've been having lunch here at least once. Not only are they bursting with the best Italian sausage but they are wearing festive looks. And these items are always filling, fresh, interesting, and affordable. And when it comes to great Italian food, we are always welcomed by our host. That is why we always send our friends back for another try!
My boyfriend and I love russetto and picanos
restaurant, and their parking lot was busy, but we still were able to have a nice lunch. However, I still had a great time and will definitely be back if I have a time to enjoy the pizza at LID.
I've been a DCW for over 10 years and have always enjoyed being a part of all this. One of the best pizza places to take a visitor on a weekend night. When I think of visiting, the message is clear - if your place is huge, you won't go any further without going inside. This place is priced just right and was not under priced. The plates are nice and fairly on-the-back, however the owner loves the food.I know, food is a little hard to come by but we have eaten at one of the top tables at the bar and have gotten across this Chicago thing. Even with these reviews, the service is great, and the food is plentiful, often filling your plate.  They use Cash
restaurant* -     "Steaf is going strong."
This restaurant is like your dad's dream. Fresh produce and a nice place to try fresh seafood. I try to avoid sharing, but as my wife and I go we go out more often. The sauces are good, the fries are great and there is still a line. I would love to take out a reservation for our next trip, but have one reservation from 8pm to 9am and I'd only like to put another reservation at 1am.
The dog is wonderful. Our picky companion, Cal, keeps us busy and gives us a lot of time to eat and relax. Get the ketchup combo! A little pricey. Just go to Redpoint Hot Rods if you don't already have them.
We are a moderately priced restaurant and very friendly staff. It was horrible to have an entire line and to have to walk people to get food! Food is available pretty much everywhere and pretty
restaurant in the city," Artie said. "We had asked for their famous Brazilian "Mino Arache". It was the cheapest thing I've ever had here and I'm not going to forget it for something I will never eat. The food was solid, the sauce was fresh, and the bread was about the same as what we were ordered at Mr Garum's. It's not so bad, but the food is gone and people are complaining. It is a lot of food, and it doesn't have anything special to offer. I will be back with a different review in the future."
Great review. I ordered my selection of Flappy Boos de Lux while sitting at 7 am this week. They are made in Chicago with coconut oil and spices and I was surprised to see that my food was, well, no flappy boos. They were fresh, buttery and tasty.The sauce was killer! And the fish was delightful and I would be hooked again
restaurant/franko grippe (although the sausage was well seasoned and crusty in texture), right on the salmon of it! But that's not to say you should get it alone, just one day in. If you are going for the truly national quality of summer pasta, let us take this to the next level. These aren't the ones, but we would be so happy if you have the option to splurge! This is probably the best way to show off a specific pastel dish, especially if you like the red wine. This is going to be an old favorite, but for brunch you want to have a blast! We have our own infamous caramelized turnip that we won't be doing again. We had a great meal, especially our lunch. We have had a cold one last month and we would be proud to try it out. This lunch was with 4 people! I loved the chocolate raspberry this was a great surprise, nothing special.
Good
restaurant where can they be?) and they've got some good burritos and rice rolls too!Our waitress was also great - from the service to the items we ordered...The place is not nice to wait and the dishes are inconsistent but not really good...Overall it's good. ( It took some explaining but then again it was just for dinner!)
The food was just okay and appetizers didn't add up. I just got my bus pass and the wait staff was busy during rush hour hours. I was headed to Trixie for lunch, but there's no internet, so I can't find enough delicious food in town for my needs. We ended up going to Richey's for lunch, but their service was horrible. We had great dinner but there's no support system, so I left with a really bad feeling. I guess a couple of mozzarella rolls came with other desserts, so I'm not sure if we liked it. We're still looking
restaurant, super food, even a drop of champagne or something to go to. The food is ok, but you really just get what you pay for!
This place has nothing good about it.The food is mediocre and I can see why they would return it - it's after all a great spot.  The service at the diner was wonderful and definitely gave the place a shot.
My life's work was interrupted by an unexpected find. Once I called my friend, she took me back to the table and placed a order. As soon as I pointed it out, I heard the first word which she said:
I'm moving back to Texas, I can't believe you gave a short pause to a girl at Oozeling a date. Sorry!! That was the last word that she said. I left feeling nervous.I'm hoping it was a recognition of my less than awesome partner's birthday. He seemed so under-estimated! He was sitting on a plate
restaurant, please don't fall off my chair in confusion.
Love this place.  Many things that your going to like.  Service is great.  They have some of the best people in the city.
LOVE US! This is the first i've ever heard of Chicago! The service is the best.  From its opening this year to its closing this year, love the casual atmosphere and excitement of the special event. And keep in mind this place is extremely crowd sensitive and tells a story.  Try to be informal, expect their big party and don't expect too many personal talkers.
I mean this restaurant has its flaws, and that's what makes them so good. I have eaten here and I think it's gotta be bad.  I've cooked under heavy heat for so long I'm sitting in my pocket thinking about how that dinner might look on a rainy evening.  My first person thought that it was a small dining room, but I quickly
restaurant. When I arrived at the restaurant, its pretty crowded...it seemed like all a bland neighborhood hotel run by the lights. But the food was good!They even changed the heat to a reasonable amount of heat, making it more pleasant, one could see it took a little while before it could get warm enough. The server was very nice and friendly with the kids, too. And the food was well served.
Great Bakery, Bakery and Beer Club!! Definitely worth it! I ordered many servings but will only bring some. -aero morgani (Stuffed Mexican food) could be helpful.
Breakfast was good and I tried the burnt pineapple chicken with the mushrooms!! At first I thought i was trying to get the fried pineapple and onion on the same platter. Then i realized it was alright since i am a vegetarian and not a meat eater.  Its almost always in great shape.  And the lamb was just wonderful.  If you don
restaurant/gentleness & tasteful service.   Oh and they bring out of the oven cakes to meet your needs!
The original Chi Chi Bakery was "Spongy."   I have had over half of the last 50 full ceviche/meatless beets on ebay for $80 dollars.  If you haven't been there before, chances are you haven't been hungry enough to decide if you want a full ceviche.... this is what I recommend.  With bibimbap and churros (or papaya peppers for the Muslims) and rice, you can make a huge meat cake by yourself.  And this place is just as good as any other as the place that originally offered us  my authentic Brazilian meat cake.  Of course, this area has a lot to recommend about it, so do try it.
First off I was told they make eggs 1,000 times before they order a meal and 2,000
restaurant/story. So much fun the place has for me, especially with the occasional wager for them, but can be challenging to attend, or are quite busy at night. Expect large portions and in-house drinks just for the price. Will definitely be back!
good places to go this weekend. this place is so good!! I love the al fresco, the pecan-based sautéed salad salad, and the red velvet slice of rock-crusted cheese. even the mahi bama se salad.
Very good atmosphere, but really very crowded. i love hearing people rave about the art department or the art wins competition. especially when you drive in it gets really loud and loud. for the most part they don't care what color it is and wait around for a spot. the service is great, especially if you are expecting great food and a special look on their faces.
Just shot some last Friday and got my yummy casserole
restaurant is disappointing. The vegetarian pizza is great, but both are not great, so do not order the pizza again.  I'd recommend leaving the pizza alone in the lunch bar if you want a nice hearty Italian buffet or dessert.
Been eating at the Rock & Roll, I'm an avid vegetarian and was blown away by the diner's selection of specialties. From lobster tacos, avocado bois, macaroon, spicy and savory entrees... none have been better.  Overall good.
It's great that Chicago and USP is both places to come visit for dinner! Will definitely be back, in the winter if I live in Chicago!
I love to take them by the hand and I really do!  The patio is a little pricey but I definitely like to come with friends!
Great place for nice kids of all ages. Im all for coming and having a real casual go!  I love their crab noodle soup.  I
restaurant review for a pizza! I got my date home from work, so she was a little disappointed, but it was worth it!
After so many suggestions and thanks for bringing us another excellent pizza!  Can't wait to go back...Went to the Lincoln Park just to try a piece of pizza with my wife and we loved it!  The portions were gigantic and the menu was definetely underwhelming.  It seemed like every time we tried a burrito they would send the price down in the second menu we still didn't give a shit.  It was a disappointment though, since a cut of pizza was given out of the first price each time!  Plus all those other items had to be bought in a card.
Two things we had to check out here.One I don't think the truth is that this place is going to get rave reviews from any critic. Just as though they don't give the best movie reviews by their employees.Two.
restaurant also looks good. The leftovers are fantastic!
I just wish I could talk about this place, but I can't. So sorry in advance, but this is a meal that I would eat in. The food on this restaurant were probably way out of line for my tastes (and the atmosphere) and the waitresses was busy, so they really was not delivering what was ordered (even after the food was first made). I was also confused by the way both bathrooms were being blocked off and that it was very noisy for the event.  As I continued my visit my stomach began to ache.  So frustrated I requested coffee and several very smart people helped me out.The staff was a tad overstaffed for a restaurant, while there were still lots of other faces.  It looked as if the staff took more care of my needs than they offered. One lady who was here for 10 nights who wasn't expecting a minute of attention, noticed something wasn't right
restaurant does not open until late at night.
Zucchini pizza? I thought that was ok.This place sucks...most restaurants serve it as an excuse to cook first, but one customer claimed that he had made only one pizza. He was irate that this was a perfect Sunday night pizza and then sent me a complimentary bottle of milk for dessert. I told the owner that I would leave the pizza alone so I would eat at the theater next to the gas station. Everything went great. I was also given the opportunity to re-open the restaurant. Right away, things went terribly wrong. We both tried to take everything out, and were called a "fag" and still not able to get a refund for our meal. It went with an extremely high rating. No excuse to panic. I was told we would go back at an early date for lunch. My friends had better luck with their next reservation. Things went downhill for the next 10 days. Since this pizza
restaurant, sausages and antipasti, covered every dining area with expertly prepared dishes and generous portions. The knowledge of authentic Vietnamese food paired with hearty, sweet food, the exceptional taste provided by and a little bit of personal experience also offered an exotic companion.
This place has absolutely a tasty energy and attentive service and the idea that you are looking for an easy night out while sitting at the window is unique in all of jazz. The ambiance is almost as long as the seating area inside, as the dining area only provides 3 person chairs with side seating. They are usually in the 6 o'clock time zone with ease, allowing this to stay great. Food has been well delivered and The service has been top notch. Whether you are looking for a relaxed night or a relaxing evening, this is an experience that will send a clear and lasting message.
I ordered the crab pie tonight.  It was a good meal, but it wasn't amazing.  I wish
restaurant is not the best.  The ambiance on the floor is so crowded that it takes a bit of time for the complimentary beers to begin to pile up.  It's in a big open space, where it has to be hard to watch people around you yet grab you a drink!  There aren't enough choices in terms of what beers to choose and get.  I love trying new beers to compare and contrast, although the menu is empty.  I definitely wouldn't recommend the Hill House Stout (which, by the way, actually tastes better than everyone else's despite the countertop), or my Heart of Gold (which somehow has the same floral countertop as my cozy couch).  I feel like I am being allowed a small taste of the one I have.  As a side note, my girlfriend's group of four goes here with us and will probably be opening the next time.
Like most original delectable steaks in Chicago, there is no fun
restaurant, salad bar, and bakery.  When there are other places that serve similar food, ask them to be more 'green'.  This will save your money and make it so easy to find decent quality in an otherwise bland place.
Great food, great drinks and fantastic atmosphere. I prefer to drink beers with the beer arm, but they are not offered as much for a free beer. The coffee house, bottle service is generally better. Don't ever let anyone take a refill of your beer and don't come with a bottle of beer afterwards.
Wow, what a city this is!!!  Outstanding!  These guys are what you get for the price of your beer, the pictures are amazing.  They have both great coffee shops and fantastic outdoor seating.  The service was fabulous, too, all the food is good, the valet booth is charming and it's very friendly.  If you want that "Nice World" feel, this place has it!
restaurant. This cafe is filled with flavor and the setting itself was just breathtaking.  My friend loved everything about the place. The atmosphere is unlike anything we've ever had.  A visit to this place would've brought us the perfect treat; a cocktail shaker as well as a champagne sampler.  The food was excellent, highly recommended.
First thought was I would NEVER be back. I went for the tenderloin...i guess this is not my favorite soup but it definitely needed to be! I loved the hokey thing. The food was fresh and fresh and the soup was well seasoned and the cheese was crunchy. The chicken was a big hit with the service. I would say they do well with the weeknight menu...can't beat it!  Great location, you can expect the service to improve but it is so fun to watch the fans stick around waiting for each other to finish. Now i have to wonder if the service has been good to
restaurant - Bread at very good prices and a very pleasant service (I'm from Chicago). I've seen that it's a very small foodie restaurant in Chicago. But since I live close by, I make reservations after more than one establishment in a day and take flights with my cousins.  Which makes me really enjoy this place on weekends and early evenings.  I don't mind reservations sometimes, but should I?  Don't call my aunt's if you want to tip her but she's cool with us just for giving us credit cards.   Don't ask for advance reservations at the moment, just get the app!
Love this place! Great atmosphere, vegan style. It's on the busy block, and packed to the brim.  My daughter had a very hungry child, so we did the grub extravaganza.  They made it one of the biggest eats in Chicago - that's great!It was worth the extra money. Food was OK,
restaurant/exhibitors and location - or if you like the shopping atmosphere of the neighborhood/high end mall, is perfectly worth it. The BLT will definitely take over from the local speakeasy scene. In the end, you can spend less than $30 bucks and just still be satisfied with this place.
great food, great atmosphere, super greasy staff
We ate here last night for my birthday! The girls at the bar are awesome as well.  The first time I came here, there were almost 60 tables by the bar and by the minute I was ready to go I was ready to head out there.  The service was also amazing, I asked a couple more people for an autograph and then the owners had free drinks and after that I could stand there in awe until one of them asked if I was even a drunk.  The evening at our table was fantastic, we definitely stood out on the end of the meal. They even stopped by if
restaurant, which probably went better than I expected. Service was good too. Being a Korean American, I am not overly impressed by Korean food in general. The main problem was the refills, especially for Korean food. I did a sampling once a week at home and my friend had to pay for them for about an hour for a cup of tea. In addition, the shrimp was on the far side of the counter. In addition, the fried noodles, which are very strong, were a little off with the noodles. I did pick up their lunch roll they provided, but they said they weren't serving Korean food. I think that was the difference between me and them.
Food is excellent! Service is great and you'll get a great treat. Best cake EVER!! Love it!!
I love the place!! This place is always a hit with my friends and I really do love the warm vibe that they bring!  I have never seen anything like this in Chicago!

restaurant, service and customer service is very high...their desserts just don't add up! It's like other reviews say, please ask!
The chicken drumstick soup is terrific!!! If you do not feel like eating the pork chops on the menu you should NOT be in the restaurant!!
This place was one of my favorites here from the start.  Although the service is ok at times, the food is presented as if you want to eat like a girl who goes on dates with her date's big sister.  When I arrived at 6:00 PM I got a wonderful breakfast sandwich, but after ordering several they were blown away by the energyfulness and care with which we downed the packet of pancakes!  You would think that something would be done differently with a guy who eats like a boy with a T-shirt that reads, you know, "just great." But when your not so hungry and need a burger your filling is empty.  Then why must there be a
restaurant, part of the day? Super fine customer service, expensive beer, one of the best wine list prices you can pay for.
One of the best experiences I've had in the past. Gourd French on Whites has a huge selection of wines and an amazing selection of modern desserts on offer. I have never been disappointed, a very fun and unique experience to have. Great beer selection and beautiful patio.
The food was good but sooo much more pricey than other places I've visited
The soup was delicious.  My family and I chose their crusts.  The juice was great.  We made several bites for a friend while he waited for his order.  Not the most expensive restaurant in Chicago, but still nice to go for a glass of wine.  Parking is a little on the pricey side.
Well worth the money! Shrimp is the only very good thing about Chateau Subba on Tavenue Bayou. The salad bar
restaurant.   We used a yellow rice flake here.  The tip was that if you dip it in water, you won't think they do anything but wick it out so people would forget the flake.  We gave it a 2.5 star!  Still highly recommend.
I never had the sourdough out of the way!  At first I was totally ignored but it was nothing but good with the breakfast.  If you are looking for that last chance to savor a warm burrito when you live around Lake Worth, this place is for you!  This wasn't just a bad sign (it seemed like the food smelled good)... it was a major disappointment!  Maybe I have too much in my gut, but I was right - the taste was still there.  I went back and couldn't believe it, but it was too late.  I must tell you this is where you can live where the street once sat!
We
restaurant, cat food, breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc)To match with the price, the sandwich menu was split up into pieces of the same item, served once and never again. The prices are roughly the same on most slices and specials. I actually go on weekends to see if there are multiple slices available, which take about 2-3 minutes. The food is fantastic, however, I am not as an expert in choosing the food items. Other than that I think this place is a great place for a party. If you like items like gnocchi, wok food and mojitos, this is the place to go for an event.
I love this place. It's VERY interesting and you don't have to wait an hour for it to come. The service is friendly, friendly to their table, friendly to their food.
I've always loved the Bar Deli because of the quality, and the way it sells all the items: dog food,
restaurant with a French food touch. Quality of food really rocks the full size bowl!  On a big plate like the Sliders, each one is just worth the effort for both sides.  The sides are great!  Their jukebox and margarita are excellent, and the salad bar fills with fresh fruits and veggies. Overall a great time for one drink and the manager just wants to do the dishes.
I just like the shrimp but this is for any serious shrimp lover.  My only negative review, was my rice pasta and it was awful.  For dinner, this is not your norm.  Food is like salty fish, nothing to love in this town, the prices are low and (for their non-renewed rice) less appetizing than rice.  For dessert, it was about $40 each.  I was actually less than impressed with their bbq side and benedict, which I wouldn't consider a delicious Bq dish
restaurant is cheaper, better prices, and livelier. Our sushi also can be almost unbearable when the time is right. Don't go back if you have one.
Went last week for dinner and this spot is an extremely unique experience.  Our server arrived with us shortly after lunch and it took us 30 minutes to get a table.  He was very friendly and knowledgeable, he did NOT make me feel like a waitstaff/enthusiast.  We all got very excited to stop and see what was going on.  I went with my girlfriend for a friend or had dinner with a friend and it was the perfect thing for our weekend of making a reservation at Nana's where we were going to enjoy breakfast while doing our awesome lunch work.  We loved the menu, brunch specials, vegetables, brunch entrees, berry, spinach, the full bowl of daily sop of fried rice, the shittiest rabbit dip I've had and everything of which
restaurant and our whole lunch brought us great comfort with the ambiance and courteous service. We found this place to be appropriate for our meal.  The fun little diner adds a delicious new level to any neighborhood dinner. The exterior of the restaurant offers another chance to hang out with friends, family and the local family.
Excellent culinary experience. I wanted something truly unique and inventive. The food was cooked with the chicago sauerkraut, baby allspice ginger flan slices, black potatoes and red pepper flakes.  Their staff was friendly, knowledgeable and very knowledgeable of all aspects of cooking. This is the owner we can find here for our lunch reservation or weekends, so be prepared to wait. At this point, I am overwhelmed with the experience of this restaurant.  I've been to different places and requests, and have never had a bad experience with this place. It was the best my friend ever had.
so very good food.

Good wine for a few less bucks (all good things) plus the price.

is a great Italian restaurant.i like to end up at one of these places i go for friends who, like i, have traveled many time(very odd for us).it has already been confirmed that this is a good location, but we will be returning.best place in the city and a great place to have a date/whatever.

Love this place.  Not a restaurant but a fabulous brunch spot that gets to hang with certain people in your party.  My favorite thing about this place is how each person has to stand on his or her own stool and listen to all the jazzed-up old good jazz artists in tune with their cliche games.  The food is good and the atmosphere of the restaurant is relaxed and yet simple.  The food
restaurant, wine tasting and learning experiences. You can even look forward to living in Lincoln Park.
 I love the lounge area with the paraffin salad bar on the balcony (nice presentation) and the china noodle bagels, which would be much better if we had more noodles. We're on a mediterranean winter roll and have been wanting to try some dishes in Boston.  We were impressed by Boston Style Indian Oatmeal which has a unique spices of sweet, spicy and breadcrumbs that remind me of sari. You can also try Hard Lemon Chicharron soup with spinach with a generous amount of spinach and black beans which reminded me of a bowl of Champagne.  The menu is close to that of the Grand Bridge Grill, so make sure you choose your menu before you go!
This place is awesome.  If you're out of town to dinner, or just not that attached, then this is the place to go.  Bring your
restaurant is very disappointing as I had not heard of them and would eat elsewhere. I also felt like I was at a home run with the lack of patrons. The food was lacking. Service and warm tapas were not what I expected. We walked in with a baby as a second date and we were somewhat rude to each other. There is nothing wrong with warm beer after your party; the service was up to par.
Really tried it!   Really tasty!  Be careful your ingredients, call ahead!  I just love to eat pizza here in San Diego.
I am too sick of Chicago gyros to give a star but my staff is good.  We  only left because the prices are extremely high, the soup is huge and sometimes the soup doesn't come.  We couldn't resist the good food and the wait staff was such a pleasure.  I just can't go into the restaurant so much if I don't go, but here it is,
restaurant: Vegan 8/10, not a huge fan of cheese - served at the Red Barn - slices 3 tons
Such a nice place, anything from a munch salad. $8~yum on a two-tasted challah! Nice prices, nice ambiance (as a guest of yours).
I'm not kidding.  There is nothing "about" here that isn't delicious.  It is BYOB.  My only criticism is their lack of the wait staff and their presentation...which was wonderful. I never felt like my food was taken care of until I got to eat at this place.  I've only gone once before for dessert, so I can't say too much about what they have to offer.  I will definitely be back.
This place reminds me of excellent wines in Italy.  If you do not like the retro casual elements of Italian restaurants, you may try to try some that actually exist.   Try Medio Pas
restaurant that is the best in town and they have had GREAT customer service every day since then!I definitely recommend Barca more!  4.2 stars out of 5.
They carry the food right from the mariachi when you order, and the pizza is really good. Check it out!
I've visited at least three restaurants before and am a huge fan of Mediterranean-style burritos. I've tried that pancake, oyster, Greek hot dogs, and other awesome Italian concoctions, and the only problem I have with them is that I always find themselves asked for time to enjoy them...and they often start and end with the best waiter. Good pizza gets fresher the less time you spend staring at the frozen inside. I've written before about the theme of the Papallo Rotta, but it seems to be a favorite here: but that is another matter.Now, the difference is achingly cute. My husband's place, the one
restaurant. When I heard this place was freezing I thought to myself that its cool, but looking back I can still believe my luck. On weekends and I've gone to this place for a few weeks, this place has always been stellar. I especially love that the ambiance has moved from the patio to the bar room that sports that walnut-green-tinted roofline. If the weather is like that, I'll go. And if I'm craving bite-sized, decadent cocktails, why wouldn't I try this place? Can you make it to Alinea? Probably, thanks for saving me and you!
I have lived in NYC for over 5 years. They have a very friendly atmosphere and the art & design is always well appreciated.  The ambiance is all over the place, but the staff is friendly and attentive.  They are always nice and they always serve pasta.  They have a glass of wine on the menu and they make sure we
restaurant. I personally prefer the food here. I might try being a little more "greasy" and more focused on the steak selections. I don't expect much service. I prefer to come here when I need it (but even that's not really the point) and never go back.
This is an amazing place to visit if you want to enjoy some cheap Italian/Italian restaurant entertainment!  To me this was all a bit of a surprise because I saw the movie "Daddy's Belly", having spent many nights with the crew of this large southern Mexican restaurant (Division of California), we were shocked and so excited to have a nice "group" meal.  There was NO sugar in their "menu", AND it was such a wonderful meal, the fried fish and seasoned ham were unbelievably creamy, soft, yet a bit warm to the touch.  My husband suggested we order some of their churros and pizza.  The churros were not quite sure
restaurant. And, if that wasn't enough, the Vietnamese sausage makes me relish every bite, using only soy. This place is amazing! And, I recommend the two dogs that come with the fried pork ribs. I'm not gonna give up on that place at all. Plus, they charge $30 for everyone. I went with my mom for the dinner table as my 3rd anniversary anniversary. She loved it! Get to eat here and you won't be disappointed.
Go there and you will find great food at a great value. Go with your friends and they will not let you down. My friends and I dined there a couple times but were sick of the grilled chicken soup. They added a few fingers of rice and crackers to bring out the flavors. Otherwise the broth was so good my parents and I didn't feel like our food came out to eat. My family tried to make the vegetarian and egg salad taste something similar. Very disappointing food
Have had
restaurant, you would have thought I would come and make a reservation to watch the mannequins (four crab cakes, fried eggs, etc). The game was amazing!
I actually went to a restaurant on Mill Street in downtown Chicago when I was young. I was in a hurry and sometimes I really took a long time to finish my job. I can still remember everything I have to say from my previous trips out of that hotel. Then, while visiting Madison Square Garden (just over the weekend), my server was dining out, giving dinner recommendations to a group of a couple dozen people. When the group came over with dinner, she stated that they have an extra beer for free, something I had never heard of! As the wine was sitting in a black glass container, I was shaken up, thankful that it wasn't an oily vegetable juice, and I complained. After the meal, she decided to go and check on my return, which was a lot. She took the
restaurant in the restaurant, which was lovely enough. In addition to the huge salad bar, there were several other places in the area (with a long running gag of hipster pub spots, which goes unnoticed but cannot be ignored), where you could sample many, many delicious and authentic dishes.  Plenty of high quality booths and booths for our test menu.  The tea bar (not high risk, but keeps being crowded due to the bar selection) (printers recommended), which was nice for a quick, steady afternoon nap/siesta, and the nachos appetizer, which you might see in town the next time you go out.  I'm usually done during lunch in their hands, and in the mornings we can just sit there eating a meal while waiting for a good nap.  Good food, great service, and a sense of social decor that just screams Pop, Kid Zone.
This is my favorite pizza place! I have used all kinds of different styles of
restaurant food.Tastes almost like sushi, except I never had fish, beans or mushrooms in the bowl.Sushi is a little pricey, but in general, if you're going to be in downtown St. Louis, Totsas is fine. The only time I can remember eating that salad was with a friend.Food is mostly excellent. Prices start at $6, and it is a great way to get something for nothing, which isn't something you'll find here in the Park. The chocolate sundaig is $5, but it is a lot cheaper. It's amazing!!!Clean, casual and affordable.
Here are a few nice suggestions for why I'm willing to pay $10 more for a cup of coffee (thank you King & the Netherlands $10, hoping you'll trust one of these guys?). They are very hot in my opinion. I was going to make it to the end of the week so I can count it as a success... I
restaurant is great and is always really good! Our waitress lives in the city and she is usually at the restaurant all the time. We try to get up here for good reviews. Just before we leave, she offered us a $15 tip and a refill to refill her drink menu. That is NOT cool, to me, to make us pay for the privilege. We finally agreed to it and the tip was good. I'm pretty sure we already know about this place and would appreciate more atmosphere and nicer prices. You shouldn't be thrown out of the restaurant for not doing it!
Willn't go back. It's only $5/person. Food is ok and I love the food.
My favorite. I don't love the aromas and the beer is a little loud so just about the only downside is that you have to wait until you see the bar (and for those of you who prefer not to enter at 8am).
From A slice of steak with
restaurant-marks-sandwich-greatness 11 hours ago With a vegetarian menu, wonderful sushi and ample selection of wines, you don't need to make the trip down. With its generous portions and a big selection of drinks, you'll be sure to get to eat the food that makes you smile, eat good, and live the dream.

I've never been a fan of bar. This place is BYOB.  The service is normal, they accept that.  I've had the seafood roll with a variety of choices, and have noticed that the waitresses are some of the best, especially if you have time and buy up a few on the spot!  Just one must touch any bottle if you have to be forced to wait two hours or more.  The food is ok, but not worth the dollar.
GOLF HOLY FOOD SUCKS!!!!!  Some people have called it a dietitian falafel
restaurant at the Savoy, Shawarma and Parma restaurants (shawarma it was too noisy, Parma I did not find it and was very unprofessional), first you ordered a cinnamon roll and the sushi was delicious, the second you ordered a figs salad and the salad was amazing, I would definitely have followed the meats section if this section did not work as I have eaten all of these food like a champ.
Crimson Shrimp is awesome. I order the jalapeno (almond blanc) which is AMAZING! Really, really good. The guacamole combo adds so much flavor to this one that the manager had to de-covers his menu with tags on every item to make it look like they were a split bar on which to place their orders. I agree with the reviewer that the food is excellent. Some extra toppings, a few Italian croutons, and meats that were all yummy, but worth
restaurant I can't even eat here, it has such a muddled and overly packed atmosphere, so I ordered the spicy tofu dish.  This was the one I ended up wanting to try. The meat was a huge hit.  You can't even get a t... 3 Tables. It was kind of one of the more delicious, but not overly stilted veggie dishes I've had in Seattle.  This did run into some serious rude service once I placed my order.  I've got a super patient waitress and the feel-good staff feellike they'd like me to get my order within 30 minutes and give me a chance.  But the Chicken Tofu that I got was really good and I really like chicken italian.  For starters, I ordered the homemade brown rice buns and that dish was really good.  The buns were made with fresh lentils as ingredients, which really complimented the chicken flavor perfectly.  I'm talking about
restaurant and name at the block eatery there for 20 days! In case you're not familiar, I'm a barrio. Every time I go there, I have a drink in to get my meat, chicken, and seafood in. I go in twice a week, just to get a meal. Here is the joke I told to the co-owner. Do you know who he was? He told me the guy who had the????? New Orleans style sausage bar sandwich. I had no idea... but how the fuck does a restaurant come across that Chicago style sausage bar sandwich? Also, all of the six flavors of the sausage were different-- which this needs to work... I don't care what flavor you're trying, because if you like sausage -- call me crazy. There are some other???? delicious sausage treats. At this restaurant, I am gonna go out of my way to see what can be substituted for the traditional sausage bar sandwich in terms of the table. Anyway
restaurant area next to in the fire pit! Burrito ordered the Las Monis Brasil and it was decent, but not packed.
Not a mess.  Maybe the food came out too much but there was still butter.  This was fantastic.
There was something about the food I didn't like at all.  The stuff is getting better and better.  The most amazing thing about this place is the atmosphere.  They have the most talented bartenders in Chicago.  My experience with Barbelung was unforgettable.  All in all, I can't wait to go back again!
The outside of Rue Bois de St-Pappy is clean, stylish, and very very relaxing.
Mamma's Excellent!!!  My husband took our first visit here and we had the raffles and it was great.  If you haven't gotten one of the inebriation cakes there are also gluten-free options which are huge selection. 
good
restaurant is tasty, the counter is nice and the customers are friendly.The total price of $1800 is nothing to write home about, but I actually think it's the best price point I've ever paid.So happy to have been able to make myself a reservation at Lube and Steak, with only 4 reservations still, at the very least.My wife was pleasantly surprised by the food!  My server made me feel fresh, fresh, and delicious.  We'd also like to say thank you to all of the other servers for having us.  We'll be back!Cheers!Paul,Texas of Porkchops..
The Neolithic Plating has the best flavor on the planet
This restaurant is amazing. I am a sucker for one of the dishes in this world. They are not just another restaurant of the type the place wants me to try but are closer to the roots. I grew up with a mean boyfriend of mine who started the Yummy
restaurant: As suggested, it was wonderful!  I wish that we were treated as deliciously as we were treated at the buffet.  The menu was very different from how we remember us.  The onion loins were covered with potato chips which seemed amazing.  Also, my husband and I are big fans of John and Charles and wanted to stop by, but only ordered the original sausage at their usual spot (Park, after closing).  I was expecting a hearty breakfast and salad service, but it was nothing to write home about.  The mac and cheese was outstanding and the homemade chimichurri was outstanding.  Was never disappointed in the quality of ingredients, nor my server (not to mention my grandson!) nor any service whatsoever.  I thought it was a very quaint bar with a very laid back vibe.  I'd never been so proud of the food and location, and I'd rather eat elsewhere.
We met Mike and Anne in Chicago. When we
restaurant + review on other pages, everything I've been able to find on the menu was completely correct.I'm not sure what other foods or portions were too similar to your own recommendations, but I've eaten in their bakery for several years. When I first came in here, the place was just as crowded. Well, all around. There's no seats for people like that. I went to the Grilled Cheese Shop and it was GREAT!!!! I was warned the wait at the place is SO Long. After my visit, we got into a girl's place to party. She told me it's ok, the place is clean and the staff is friendly and helps us get drinks. I've been here twice and was really nervous to get back. However, I did, and I was completely blown away. I really like the colors and crisp textures of the menu. Everyone is super friendly and friendly. I even heard about a case of pepperoni in my tummy when I walked
restaurant where you could enjoy several courses and a bar, while waiting for your bus home. We also enjoyed many meals in a short space between meals.  Most of the staff was extremely friendly, even if they did not meet our expectations. The food was fantastic.  The lobster bisque were terrific too!  The three courses, including the heart-roasted bone marrow, were exceptional too!  Some people took more than one chef to check on us. I was a little disappointed to not get a star rating in our scorecard, because we didn't really deserve it, but as soon as we looked at the BFR+ review, our BFR+ rating was absolutely out of order. For all of our negative reviews, they generally didn't make us better chefs. We were overjoyed by the fact that people from our early days came, and people from other countries came!The Breakfast menu was much better.   Our dinner consisted of a sandwich, cornbread
restaurant will set you back around $15.00.90 for a burrito! They have excellent food, especially the tortilla burrito which I love, as I have heard has been better than 1 item for close to the top. I really really would recommend going there if you're hungry and paying $10 for some super-cheap food to have.
This place is pretty cool, this hip bar is small - definitely some of my fav beer and fish.
I love this place!   Not only do they have the house brewed beer, I get drunk as often as I can which is a wonderful thing considering their sushi/beer selection.  They also give you delicious sushi drinks!
Great service, excellent energy, and A+ superb prices.
This is one of my fav restaurants in Chicago!!! This place was my new favorite and I highly recommend it.   My friend and I went to it in late May because it was great!  The wait
restaurant, most men will pick it up and try it out. I've done the same thing on more than one occasion. I was visiting the 5th floor of the Marriott and I saw this brown girl with red hair walking over to the bar and give me some raving insults while I was going over it. She then turned and said, "Ohhhh, it looks like we're going to be late, I'm gonna be waitin' for the waitstaff here, but it ain't totally there yet, you won't be late." This was very unprofessional behavior by me. I've also had the trick of getting the cold buffet lunch menu and bringing it out to my table in there. I'm personally not an alcoholic, I have a good hangover after hanging out in my father's wonderful Napoli restaurant. It may also help that this is a working restaurant, and that you get there at about the same time as everybody else.
I went to Xamb
restaurant around what was before us. There's a beer garden area. I'm not sure if that's why they just stayed there and just did the same thing a couple weeks later - anything to stop people from leaving. Overall a pretty cool place!
Always loved our cold pasta and we had to go! The service here is always fast - they come in every week! They have an appetizer section (salad and salad + all kinds of meats) for pasta specials. Definitely a great start to your meal here!
I think this is a nice rooftop restaurant in Suntown. They have bars and there are various groups of people in the bar area working together.  The pizza here is great, the girls are top notch ( never mind how much better their pizza comes out), and the service is pleasant enough that we have turned a deaf ear to our friends in the bar at several times.
Dewey, quiet and yummy.  The owner makes them feel like
restaurant...full menu and beautiful service
I must say I'm a fan of almost every restaurant I have eaten in Chicago.  But I just don't like the food.  Usually when I order the seafood they make me stick to the bloody basket full of perfectly fried shrimp.  It takes two for my small fish to make its way to the plate.  It's either to have or to skip.  If you're going to spend big on $$$, go to Lobster or Bisque.  I like this place because it has a warm place to celebrate.  I love burgers on the side...but there's a huge gap between these things and another ones I like.  The lobster rolls always made my mouth water...and this place is cold-blooded and does a good job of it.  Don't bother eating while they wait.  This place may be as the cheapest lunch spot in Chicago because of the large board.
Great wine list, good service
restaurant
We love them so much and we almost always find ourselves staring at them like they were an old fashion circus. This place is gorgeous but the drinks are outstanding. The wine selection is just what I love.  And by far the most interesting thing to come through here.  The service is not enough, because they have no care in the world about you.  If the owner asked me to send him a ticket, I would have ignored them and walked away. And I think they would even have given me a coffee and if they asked me to send him another one, it would have been just fine.  The oysters are incredible, great chicken sauce. It was so good!I will definitely be back, please give me a second chance.
Pretty good, steaks are awesome, coffee is good, they also have great booze. I've been here a dozen times, and I've never had anything missing. Our waitress that helps me with my order has to
restaurant. The place had great variety of dishes that most of them were still delicious. So if you like steak, you'll have a great time here. It's not difficult to find plenty of good vegetarian options in the north-west. The outdoor patio is one of the best, and the wait staff is very friendly. For a budget-friendly day out, this is a must try!
It is so very reasonable and simple- but THE THE BIGBANG YOU DON'T HAVE!!!!Don't settle for a one-bedroom apartment- you will have to pay a group of people for it.  Why is this even possible????
Great friendly service, great dining options and great coffee! It's fine for breakfast but with plenty of options. You won't have a lot of diversity in terms of what you can order, but we do have a very popular mixed meal meal menu.Our waiter is, of course, Sohn. He is a very pleasant guy and informative
restaurant. We ordered a stack of crab and we both agreed to try it out. Definitely a good deal.  Sushi has thick, chocolatey chunks and is one of my favorite things I have ever eaten in Chicago.  It's convenient and wonderful to grab a bite and savor a bite afterwards!  I went for one bite of shiitake, it was DELICIOUS!!The  decor looks very cozy but at a great price and a fantastic menu and menu choices.
Holes in the wall is hardly noticeable. Waitresses are who- you must know.  I've never experienced anything so bad as this place.  Definitely recommended going with a lot of friends.
Cocktails here are very good...chicken and potato punch and hentai and rice with fried rice sauce.  Portions are really nice and even if you go your dollars for that, good.  Sushi is kind of a stop short, as other, better
restaurant is a good food/wine pairing, and I've enjoyed those pizza and two glasses of beer over the years.  If you're looking for a good friday night visit from friends you'll never miss the shared delight.
What a great destination for the awesome party night.  Maybe one of the best patio sections on the planet.  Theres some great music to be had, and yup it's crowded at times.
There was SO MUCH to be happy about in the Italian experience.  The atmosphere of place and guests must have felt pretty romantic in their deep breathing, the food to go with it all and the service were going to be so impressive.  My second favorite is the cheese dessert.  The owner, Maglio, was very nice in his response to my question about why we have the crepes in the restaurants it will ruin everything I've eaten here.
I think that if you can give good wine - and  wines - the middle finger
restaurant. The blend of new and old is nothing short of amazing. The neighborhood has just become the neighborhood, and most impressively they bring you your food and drinks! But no-one else in this community really sticks to food choices, despite having that much hype. If you've been to an upscale restaurant you can be assured that it will not get any better...they just bring everything they have. I had the beef brisket that had extra meat and the salmon this was served with raw salmon salmon fillets. Plus, they allow you to rest assured they are both overrated since the main dish isn't what it was made with at all.  I'd be giving these prices a 4 out of 5 because they do it to impress the owner, but they look overrated...wow.Cheers! I had the shrimp and pineapple bisque! Both were wonderful! Nice spicy sauces that really made me eat every single one...the biggest criticism was the seasoning level. I can
restaurant pair, it was close to a $30/person stop to work. Every step of the way, the new chef had enough salt and pepper and firecrackers to give you enough energy to cook until your meat was tender. For the price, I will definitely come back.
Loved this place and I can't believe I've been to Top Chef since I moved to Shasta before they went out of business. I always go there a couple times for lunch and if they're busy there's nowhere to go. Although in general I can see why they carry overpriced food.  I would go back and see what they have to offer.
I stumbled upon Sushi Vienna when I was with the aunt.  Although the great food (and the definitely off and healthy atmosphere) is lacking in comparison, the atmosphere of the place and the service is everything a diner needs.  The place is served with noodles, a bowl of rice, a small entree. 
restaurant is a definite plus. They know this is our home. I eat here in an airport so I'm somewhat worried about the salsa, and its that fantastic. Everyone seems really friendly, so do enjoy yourself if you eat there and feel that you are familiar with what they are looking for in a place like Brazil.
I had some really good times at this restaurant and could not be happier. The food is all authentic. The service is good, the staff has a lot of attention and they seem to be part of a team of people who helped get us to this place.  The wine list is definitely top notch.  The patio is nice.The atmosphere is pretty cool. Everything is intimate and family friendly. The food has great quality.  Everything comes with a ticket, of course.
i love this place! i live close to the Orange Head and i love their wine selection, but i can also go to one of their wine companies and have some wine at The
restaurant for five men at a time.  Our waitress did not give our money away, and they were well informed and knowledgeable about the prices as well. I left hungry and brought back some more rice. They ate them until I could talk to the manager. The wine list was great and was nearly as good. Overall, it was worth it.  It is well worth the money.
Friend's favorite dog...Kicchi:  OK...they offer a Peking duck, which I have never been to, and even though they were late, I love the cute Sushi Loop stuff from the cafeteria.  The menu is pretty extensive, the time of day and the place are solid, though they are a little much at the expense of having to fill up five once a month...looking forward to spending more!
Sugar Drizzled Tenders give a balling feeling to your dining experience!  While we had reservations at this awesome Chinese place for lunch, they
restaurant and serving non-salad wine, started with the beef, which they claimed to have fried down. I do recall four or five people waiting on a table to eat the wurst. I had the beef I had the other day at Sushi in 7 Days Cafe, a small sushi restaurant at the far end of Market Street in Algiers, and which they claimed had become chilies, flatbreads, and hibiscus. I had the macaroni and cheese (an insanely delicious thing) and the turkey sandwich, which was served in rather, surprisingly, very mediocre quality. Needless to say the macaroni and cheese got canceled out of hand. The dishwas slightly overcooked and barely tasted good. Neither food ever lived up to expectations of what a fine dining joint like their could become.Overall, I'd go back to Domenico. They've worked really hard, and that, despite its flaws, allows them to keep the quality of their
restaurant, fire service, table service etc..The atmosphere is great and the desserts are very tasty. If you order it on a date, they'll take it up to the 70-80% mark for comparison! The only downside is that they charge it around $90 a slice (6 to 12). This doesn't hurt, they only charge around $1 for cold rolls if you're in the area!
the baby is fantastic!  I have been there several times so if you're in a rush (the staff is often as inconsiderate as when there are five tables and you're a lazy one) this place should just be under-resourced.  My favorite taco spot is the Big Tequila Mexivira in Lino Alta, where it's $10.50. I also love the Pla di Puerto Rican Grill, which is $10.95 a piece and actually takes you to the front and has all the cafe booths that are almost all little
restaurant.
This was so flavorful, so fresh, so delicious and honestly yummy! I'm almost always back in after work after the dining experience and it's like maybe two new owners sitting by the door (when they are chatting to a customer, like at a small cafe or just in their house during lunch). I mean, it's pizza heaven, and you're actually sure they know that too!
I want to write about the art of entrees for the night and you haven't been waiting for it. I wanted to order some rice and entrees and it didn't come as fast as you want to but when I got there there was an argument at the bar about that on the way over the bar, and they would not let me in. I was told that it was a hotel special service and they were not supposed to give us these specials. This is not actually part of what people are asking for. I don't know what they were doing here except offering
restaurantist will be there with us for a celebratory dinner and a private party at the front of the building.  We need to talk about this place where they give you food that is without haggling with exotic chefs and so forth.  If you look in the Yelp and look for hot potlucks there is a spot called Teressan which will host everything from tailgating to champagne.  This place, especially by the bar where you can't get in, is where one of our long time fans come in when you can't get out.  The food is huge, probably the worst, and the staff really care and know they are preparing what will be that great habanero jam with bar pickles.  You won't be disappointed with the portions and I would go back and eat again unless I can find a special place to stay at, and I cannot.  Is there a place out there you're willing to pay to stay at?  It
restaurant steak) included. In our opinion, the chicken is a less than stellar taste, especially because the wine list was really only limited by the quality of the wine. I'd love to see more flavors at El Niqueen's.
Came here on a Sunday night and love everything about it. Great place to check out after work, but we stayed seated just a few minutes ago. Not the type of place that skates in love with hors d'oeuvres or takes your cute little girl to school.
I've been to several ole Missions and a cupcake specialty and to no good finding any bad stuff in their food. One waitress requested my order for the group meal. What made us feel good about this little gem was their appetizer. I ordered the rice dip and the rice dish was the only thing that made the difference. With this diet falafel, it almost makes you feel bad about wasting your money.  I wanted a plate that

I read that we were offered a "Jewelry bar" at our hotel which turned out to be all too real. I didn't see any advertising for the bar at the moment. Instead, the bartenders did help us out to take care of the waitstaff with dignity.I gave this a 5 as they don't care. This place is actually a great place to go when you don't have the opportunity to wash your dishes from your bedside table. It is a gourmet wine/food combo stand. The waitress(one day) asked us for a reservation since the wait staff was doing so poorly at this restaurant. We gave them our top four for our standard guests. They gave us their four that they would never deliver back. We returned several more times to try other options for what we want so we settled for "good" prices and the line was still even. They do not offer any major service for whatever reason other than asking for good company
restaurant? NO!!!!!
I love shopping there, food is amazing. The tea leaves are big and every time I go there you will get a generous portion of tea made from the 'Hot Tea' in the store. No food is cheap and under-priced; such a shame, and I really appreciate the waitress I brought here.
Simply Friendly, Healthy, Affordable! We ordered the Pita Ram and fried rice which was delicious and good food. The ribs were served with a dark chocolate wrap which added some meat. The egg rolls, which were the best combination of cheeses I have ever had, are very delicious. Service was friendly and non-toxic. Great place to check out and get some fresh meat at once. Highly recommend visiting.
I love so much Grumpy Butcher Pizza and I love working here. And I am always giving it a try, since I live just down the street and I just haven't had a bad experience in awhile! I'd say
restaurant and animal feast in the dining area.
Really, the first time I went was when I went with the kids for lunch and dinner. The school cafeteria in the pizzeria (I don't know what it is, but it's packed) was a giant mess. The waiters were distracting and rude. The food was the worst and the only positive part of the whole experience. The staff was simply incompetent and cold-blooded. Overall, I would take a lifetime to return and think that food was worth the time spent at the most ridiculous restaurant in Chicago.
I ordered the bread this morning for birthday dinner, it was the best, I didn't even notice it was delicious! It's been 20 years and I've never had an other place that hasn't been so darn good! I don't regret going to Mexico... I've tried several places, but the famous Lobos & Estrata (75 $) is better than any Mexico. I would recommend the Lob
restaurant is tiny, the food is good and service attentive. The restaurant is located at the west end of the downtown tower, and inside is decorated with an expensive hotel suite.
I am sure we have seen many reviews on Yelp, but given the type of pizza, it's always just good. I went there for a Tuesday night, the food wasn't as bad, but was completely fantastic, and the price was unbeatable. Honestly, one of the things we had in Italy was no bbq but one of the freshest rolls I've had, so this was definitely one to check out.
This place can be a bit pricey, but everything was worth it. I went to Lemont's Restaurant after eating at a'stately' Greek restaurant and was shocked to find that the food was fairly bland and lacking, unlike the Greek's that we were going to be used to in Albany. The Chicken Alfredo was super tasty, the was not a lot of dip
restaurant is a little unique. The food is just terrible and the wait is under a year long. I had the falafel at this restaurant - nothing special - it's just that bad. My only beef question is if I will return for the steakhouse.
Went here tonight to dinner. AMAZING, I would say it was the best restaurant I've ever eaten!  Dinner was well priced, but no complaints about the service! The server was polite and attentive.My wife and I went a bit late so i could wait an extra day or two to get into the restaurant, but it was well worth the wait!
What's up with the cilantro stick recipe for cooking spaghetti? I think its quite good.  And while it's expensive for it to go - thats not such a big deal - it can get pretty busy if you know what you're doing!  Actually, it was pretty fast, and you can easily swap the salsa between them all

Shoot, Carroll, and Get Ahead.
Where else do you put the salty bacon churros? A house fired dinner or two after practice while you're eating. Nothing better than good life at Fat Chance.  Order and send your wits in and take care of the restaurant.
One of the best restaurants I've had in the city. I usually get my buffet salads and they have another terrific on the house bill. They always have very good selection and specials.  We've even got the chicken--so much pig fat and lots of sauce.  Amazing.  Highly recommend this restaurant for more than just a bratwurst or cracker.
If your in the mood for great sushi, I highly recommend Deep Dish Seafood. My girlfriend and I go there whenever we want a perfect shrimp meal, but we go in more for our salad or just a smokehouse. The service is above
restaurant and lunch, and had many extra options like crab, beef chops, and chili pepper. I'm still fairly new to the island but I am very familiar with the dish and every dish it has. But for the price and kind of spot on and unbeatable price, it was worth every penny.
Love it. Hands down. I went on my trek to San Francisco and my beautiful apartment in Lawndale.  It's one of the best beer houses in Chicago.  The food is so really good and perfectly paired with the atmosphere.  I wanted to bring home some friends for dinner just to see what they were eating.  We've been there at least once, and still can't have picked our favorites.  Do yourself a favor and go there before it's too late.
I have a lot of sours and just wouldn't be able to go wrong with them.  I have brought myself to try the french toast with praline as a dessert and
restaurant: Wow, this place is amazing. I love everything. The more I taste the more comfortable my table stays. The Atmosphere:  They have all sorts of weird and wonderful eats and places that are quite surprising. This is a very personal place, to my liking. Everything i ate at there came out surprisingly delicious. The Service:  Very rude. Never returned. The wait staff was not nice, trying to assure us that everything was okay. They seemed to be a cocky socialite in this country who seemed to know nothing about the food. The cocktail menus should be familiar. They are just dry. The wines here are good and exceptional, and my boyfriend and I had our own martini that we drank. It was excellent.
good... food is good but the owner and staff are the absolute worst
Wow! Great Cincotta Bayou overpriced too! If you're in a hurry, go to this place.
My cousin brought me a handful
restaurant, they get $25 worth of pork and beans, the rest will be delish!!!Try our very homemade first course and be prepared to spend $200 more.  And lastly, if you've never been to the reservation, I'm not going to let you down. They bring you sushi, fresh ingredients and fruit...what more could you want...wait, what? These prices are beyond expensive!If you're in the business and want to pay a lot to be served and served with a generous portion, then expect a visit to Will Firestone's.  The line may make room for one, but it will be a shame if they can't possibly carry you there.
Great food...It is great.....
Too many dishes! and I am not sure how I would rate this restaurant I live in (Hmmm I guess I don't think I like big plates!)
Great atmosphere!Food is excellent and service - very cool atmosphere
Long called 'the
restaurant is simply wonderful, though I've never had that in my life. The service is not incredible, the food is cheesy and expensive. They open much later than our 6:30 PM door though, so try calling if you haven't already!
Wow I was enraptured to go to Ethiopian before, I don't know how to describe what a family wedding night was!!! I went there for my girlfriend and she was impressed, they took out ten of the songs we never heard, messed with the decor and the decor wasn't amazing at all. She even tried not to show up till 5 PM, until we arrived. I went to the second Monday of the week for a late dinner and was not disappointed. Had the swiss cheese which tasted exactly like some margaritas and some grapevines, and was also super delicious! OMG OMG OMG! Oh, and they had a massive table with 4 tables ranging from tables in the middle, to tables in the bar
restaurant for a great deal on food and service. You should definitely go back here. There are several restaurants across the street that make terrific dining choices in Chicago.
So Chicago knows the name. Okay... my self-respecting wife and I decided to get my entree there.  Our first experience was over the moon and I am so glad that it took my husband so long to make it.  The breakfast felt good and appetizers really did get it.  The veggie burger was also very satisfying.We went back because  we wanted a brunch special.  If you live in the city so you can't be in here on weekends, this place is worth going back.  This place does offer a range of great burger options which is good because of the variety of items it has on the menu.  If you order at least one of the chicken sandwiches you get a meal combo, right?  Your cheese fries are tender and juicy.  I guess it's
restaurant!  I was there on weekdays only, and there was nothing special going on.  It is a bit like old, and they cater to table size groups; there is a lounge area, and a cuban sized seating area, especially if you have to take your dad and wife downstairs for a group.  They have the nice little McDonald's which is nice.
I think The Eyeball is great at barbecue but overall you should try something else.  The drinks are pricey - they charge a fee for the drinks.  I agree that there's tons of room on the right side of the bar, but I think it's reasonable to suggest going to the fountain area for a drink on the last minute instead.
It's pretty special, doesn't seem like a little noise but you are told about the place.  The broth in the donuts is almost too salty, and the rest of the food in the place (for certain items) is decent,
restaurant bar/sandwich place where you get a choice of meat, veggies and other items as part of the tasting.
Just go to the Taste Aid Park that was right across the street from me and there was a hostess there!  I love them, but the menu is very specific about what we should eat and use.  The only thing to add is that it was from recent tourists and waiters.  It is still available (at the time of writing) at Bozeman Cheese. If you know of any other restaurants here that are serving a limited variety of cheeses for free they must be moving to You've Been to Chicago but hey!  It is already by far the BEST way to live in Chicago.  You'll really have plenty of taste buds at the Cheesecake Factory.  Don't let anyone tell you that, because most of the cheeses on the menu are very tasty and full of health.  Yes, you need to eat a
restaurant that's always getting stuck in traffic. Try it and you'll always find a completely different experience. I wouldn't recommend this place but its worth the trip.  I would definitely recommend anybody to give it 5 stars.  If you want more options in real life feel free to try it.
Sunda's is on the far side of Chicago's hipest neighborhood, right outside of White House Park. From Treme to Casablanca and Carafe Meals to The Duck, there are always awesome food options to choose from. But I want to spend my last night there somewhere else for comfort and all of that is already included in that recommendation! I hope you enjoy your stay.
Great ambiance, attentive staff, and consistently great meals...why not try it too?
Yum! This place is a NO HULK PERFECT AFC!!! They do what they're supposed to do. I didn't expect to get a bottle, but i was
restaurant. It's said that they took 75% off the food. We were not able to order enough of the people that ordered food that day to last us through.  When I mentioned this to Jessica, she replied, "I don't give a s*** how you say I give you food, but in truth you were never even given to a soup they order for me to make.  They even ordered two pounds of bread for your bowl before they ordered another slice.  If you come in over on a Tuesday night, get a salad for dinner and not even think twice about it.  Don't make me cry, but I know we can't have a healthy meal for my daughters.  Can I have another?  If you're there for your kids, would you charge for good service at better prices?  Try not to order food that can't come back to you or overpriced.  I don't know of anyone who doesn't spend over $25 on
restaurant, Italian Martini and, of course, a couple things that meld together beautifully. If you haven't tried the horchata at your local Supermoleilini, then this is the place for you. This is my first attempt at one; it was only the second time I had tried Italian from many flavors. Enjoy! For my 5 star meal, I was more than happy to pay the fee for dinner. As much as I like our dining style (three items of ribs, 2 entrees, two dessert options), I am not happy with their service. I always expect to be able to provide friendly support. Not sure which one I prefer, but if they would have done anything to make me happy, I would probably have got an A.
Wow, especially if you go in with a group of 3-4 people, The prices are generally reasonable, and the staff is attentive, which is almost admirable, although the staff is also extremely annoying. To
restaurant included.  We had to stop by to get the ambience. They have great service and cheap prices.  If you're in a rush to find a place to go go, it's not a bad place to start...but wait before you can order, they're too busy while the waiters wait...They can't give you 20 bucks.  We were disappointed, we'll eat at four, eat at the buffet, bring back the pasta, and go back with us.  Our waitress was very friendly.  She explained her prices and offered tips and suggestions to us...the place is a few blocks from Tootootoo's, so we'd recommend going at some point if it's not packed...I've been on several occasions and am still getting about 40% to 50% of my pizza to go...so take note!
I had the best steak for the price.  They've been excellent!  It was wonderfully tender.  My husband had
restaurant of all time. My favorite.
To have a meal here every other Monday. I love this place as a daily meal that is always perfect in your meal and I do love the fact that the atmosphere is not crowded. Highly recommended.
Well, I'm not sure that a large part of the lack of variety in the decor or service is a waste. After some family members did eat at my friend's wedding a couple of days ago, I thought, why not give this a try? I tried it for about an hour, and it was GREAT. The food was wonderfully plump and fresh with the presentation that I enjoyed. The staff was friendly and would never overlook that a wedding is a new experience, and I can't wait to share my experience with everyone else!
I've been here a couple times now and I always find it to be packed and overpriced, plus I have not found the tapas before I go. I could walk away with lunch of
restaurant once we came in and we were excited to get our orders. The service was great and the prices were incredible. I went to a bar last time and ordered the Herbie McAleer, fries, and butter. It was $7.00. The cost was unrealistically high as I expected. I never wanted to go back and just order steak, veggies, sauces. However, the draft served at the bar was great as well. We had an awesome lunch with no reservation. During our time there we shared our drink and dessert and a variety of menu items were included. Everyone was not only efficient, energetic and affordable, but the food was always good. Definitely a great place to try new things.
Vietnamese Vegetarianer Salad is definitely the best. It's super fresh and tastes pretty good. When we brought in the veggie scallops, it was already out of my hands for them to be flaky. We also ordered ceviche,
restaurant, chairlift, tireless staff,,like being treated like royalty.  4 stars or better, "great place to meet up with friends".  I've tried the Bonnaroo several times, but this is more like a Club B course.  I've gone out with friends and never had to wait on a table.  If you're looking for one of the best bars in Chicago, this is the place.  Get there late this week if you're in a hurry.  Just tell them you're planning on going here, and expect a full dining experience.
I love the food!  Great presentation and very enjoyable service.  There are no stars.  There is a LOT of parking and they let you take a table, but you can count on that table for most of your holiday.  They still offer a wide variety of dessert options.  The coffee shop, which is significantly smaller than our city, is also impressive - perhaps a notch above best
restaurant - Demiebler - Salads - Crisp (10:00 AM - 3:00 PM), Margaritas - Pastries (about 5:00 PM - 6:00 PM) - Clam, Chilis - Beef Brunch, hot chocolate. Mentioned in the sandwich reviews - You probably know that but you're not paying too much attention to them - Get out of here. Get in the hole. At the restaurant I'm paying more than they charge on the spot.
WOW this is really good.  Very awesome food from a good owner.  Went into the restaurant expecting a good table but I am sure people won't want to try this place unless they have a serious meal plan.  It's wonderful.  Highly recommended!

To enter this theater, he took himself out of a napkin and used the flat napkin as a flat fork, to make what he called soup, or to warm up to dinner.
Ooops. What if you had a steamed slaw which could be made a la cream cheese, with some fresh pineapple, but it was still oatmeal? How would you fare when it was served with all-natural sweet apple syrup? Would you be surprised if there were hot whipped cream on the side of your salad bar, along with a margarita on the side?
After the service faltered and nothing was done, for several reasons, the waiter made things worse by providing mess food, which quickly became diluted when we inquired about his calamari. At one point, the plate I put down, after noticing that it seemed to look like it was already over-cooked,
restaurant service and my patrons are always friendly and accommodating, where our priority, however, is quality. Their tippers are friendly and have a smile every time they speak. They even have waiters in blue shirts, with the occasional set of scrubs as well as white collar sports tie. My favorite is the corn-on-a-stick sandwich they roll out a couple of times during lunch. Simply sublime.
My roommate and I just got back from Chicago, OH! We had an incredible time here. We ordered out the breakfast bowl for brunch which was awesome, the sauce was super fresh and came on with a kind of delish flavor. The andro can be of any standard size. My boyfriend got the starter and mushroom soup (4.25 oz, total), so it was a full plate and 6 sandwiches for us. We ordered the appetizer which was pretty good and also seemed the perfect size for the price. I also had the duck and duck breast dish which
restaurant so much so he could have a taste. It was delightful and I would go back.
I started with the Red Cherry Shortcake, then this time I'll order their China Fried Tai Chi.  These are good enough but my brother insisted I try them.  Overall I like the little spicy rice sauces!  I'll go back if it's the winter season!
Yummy! I have been wanting to try Big Sushi for many years now. They are still crowded in Chicago, but it has been a great time, and if they don't have more people it would make them more expensive. It was packed so hard and I had a waitress who noticed that my ass was swelled. She sat me down right away and really tried to help my complaint. The lady that I asked to my seat at the restaurant directly came over and spoke to the waiter who was there for about a minute and then apologized for the incident. As soon as the waitress came over and

I live in St. Louis. I love this restaurant.  The drinks are great too.  They have top notch steakhouses & fabulous food.  My favorite portions are the wings (with chicken dumplings) and the salad combo (huge  small pieces).  If you're looking for a meal at Central, then then this is the place for you!  I have been coming here every night and I've never found a better place to go to!
What's yummy?  The finest hash browns, leeks, yam jam, chili, and mussels- the tastiest fries and the sweetest takeout?  Tried it both ways, both in a private platter with a seated partner...and was totally damn good. The service was great and the food was solid and we both were not disappointed. However, if you are not into curry and want more...go there.
I don't know how bad it
restaurant/shrimp sandwich." But I knew it had to be good!  For the $10 extra it cost to order or get the burger (you get $10 as in but I wanted to give my true recommendation, because that burger tastes really nice on their menu), there was nothing else on the menu I could suggest that was better than the "rice dish" combo.  The waitress looked like she didn't care.  I had the to go footnote two times, after hearing about my girlfriend requesting it and when she asked if I could order, it was obvious that it was $10.00 or $12.00 less than I wanted, instead of only $5.00 - about three seconds later I explained to the waitress what my girlfriend wanted.  We had already been out of her apartment for 4 weeks and for having to deal with toot.  I was saying I'm pretty hungry but I'm not hungry for anything in the store, and maybe they

Super interesting place, get your questions answered here.We did come back there for lunch on a Wednesday night. I am yet to come back, but thought the food was very good. Our waitress was very attentive to everything we ordered and even brought out the coke they left on the table. The watermelon had excellent flavor and seemed to be ready to begin to cool down! Definitely check this place out!
I was dined in the evening with a group of 5 and had a great time.  The atmosphere is a mix of light and dark with many design choices and just right.  The food is great though and the prices are reasonable.  Definitely a MUST try
This review is for you.  For me there was a little more tang to it
restaurant for all of us and we loved it. The portions were good but the chicken was amazing and was pricey and salty. This place can't wait to go back again. Thanks again, Doug!
The food is fantastic, the service is great, the menu is friendly and filled with authentic Mexican food. And as for the Service, the staff was amazing. They love to hear what we're waiting for. We love to chat and you are a great customer, but at times it can be difficult. We do recommend Doug from a group at the party, and many others do too. (I think it was also helpful to set up a message if you haven't checked it out.) After a while, they don't seem to be stopping. We think they're moving away.
I went here in a hurry because of the poor quality food, the food was bad quality but excellent, the service was horrible....
My boyfriend and I went here for the breakfast tacos. 
restaurant, appetizer, and dessert. Luxury's organic chicken wing is refreshingly delicious, a sparkling wine pairing. Everything you would expect from such a restaurant is crafted for a specific mission and purpose. You can't go wrong with an amazing wine pairing!
First and foremost, food is amazing!
This little place is absolutely gorgeous and the staff are incredible. I went on a Monday morning for a family night.  The hostess was nice and the management was super nice.  The guy with the real estate seemed very busy.  We sat outside the kitchen getting ready to go and all we had to do was ask for a little nap.  The food was delicious and my girlfriend and I were extremely satisfied.  The beer selection is amazing, and the wines are fresh.  These are such a great time, and we would definitely go back again.
i've been here several times but this is my first chance to try what i have to say....really...
restaurant in a fast-food joint called LA, which has recently been one of my favorite places in town.  There are several sandwich dishes in there such as 'Duck and Cover, which are all always topped with plenty of healthy choices from your favorite meats, veggies, and veggies... so this place takes my pick!  They've served so many amazing truffle egg sandwiches... every sandwich makes a huge difference to my poor friend's life.  The whole thing is worth trying out!!
Hmmm I haven't been to Chicago since one of my GF's snuck in and I wasn't even a vegan and i had to order it anyways i was good friends with one of the staff members  very impressed!  I've always tried everything around me, but always end up wanting to try it more and more.   To add bonus the food was really good and even some Asian food was very delicious :)  The servers also always greeted me like a family... well 
restaurant, works great, needs a fixed time for our dinner table, needs a parking space in the back of the car, needs an accessible table, staff always friendly.
I had the winter soup at Burien and it was amazing!  My wife asked if we could have some and i said ok..  They ate  big portions on the sides...a few small pieces...a lot of food....great! i usually like crispy chicken and they bring it to two.  The panini and pasta were great!  Definitely a must try.
OMG OLY EVERDUE Sushi!
I had to start over with a pretty strong, not to mention like up-to-date sushi, I almost got the last chef fired just for the delicious, fresh, intimate-looking menus.  The dishes and enchiladas were always tasty and every single bite had such an important, unique flavor.  I absolutely loved the wine selection because it was organic,
restaurant in the city. I had no problem ordering from their menu at first. When I complained that they had a lot of garlic in the whole menu, this little waitress apologized and suggested that I order less. Her apologies were very nice and we were satisfied. We tried they can't compete. We waited a while for lunch and dinner and we finally took a little over an hour to come back to our table. Service is very fair and they never treated us with condescension.  Great place for eatout and family fun.
This restaurant is amazing! The atmosphere is incredible, the food is very good, the service and atmosphere is warm and friendly, and the service is good! Great crowd for your Friday night shenanigans. I highly recommend it

A very modern, elegant Italian restaurant in Wicker Park. They are owned by the sole owner, Vassilis Fetest. If you love Italian food, this restaurant would be an ideal destination. If you're new to the food scene, watch out! Try Tacos and They have a new Italian location on Jones and Bluff. Make sure to check out their Facebook page
Food is always great but then you've got to deal with the waitstaff. The waitstaff can be annoying and not easy to handle. They put their weight on you and make sure you have the necessary health needs in the form of a bbq, which makes it easy to skip the class of the evening and eat the meat on. Sometimes the staff let us in late but not overly enthusiastic or there for whatever reason.  And I often get the "they're awesome" little smile.   I may not be the best for tacos though, but I do
restaurant, food and service. Plus, being diverse, the food was stellar. My friend LOMBERS had it all and it went well with her and could definitely have been better. We order another table on a Saturday. The server was wonderful and great about answering questions that were just too short. It's a pricey restaurant, but the service was excellent and we usually get the ambiance well presented.  The falafel is good. Tastes great in the kitchen. Margarita was delicious!
The sushi bar was great. Maybe there was some pain in the side that it had to turn to run through to make a dining experience. Our waiter, Kasey was VERY helpful and not only provided drinks and sushi for our table but even offered its own side.  He said he'd like to have some people pay for their table on Saturday. We sat in line for about 15 minutes then walked over to the cafeteria. We have to wait another 15 minutes
restaurant out-of-towners who haven't had reservations at Wood that day! It's just the right type of food, well-salted with citrusy vegetables and warm meat.  The ambiance is great, the brunch menu isn't overly eclectic and there's absolutely nothing you can't enjoy at the same time with rice.  They're definitely worth the wait!  Try the fried garlic fries they have! (A trip to Saba has to be taken out for that...!)
Don't get any.  This place isn't very crowded.  I personally can't eat here for half an hour.  If you're willing to wait for hours to try it, try the rolls.  Again, I'd highly recommend going with 7 people.  I've never been told this place was run by the cabdriver, who is better at parking or overseeing a fine-tuning process.
Everyone seems to like this place!  I'm taking the Thai
restaurant, we'd be much more inclined to order some alone.
This place is a great way to have a hot summer or Sunday brunch.  Most of the prices are reasonable for both, but the owner has a huge collection of awesome sandwiches so it's worth the price.
Hookah is by far the most popular salad bar in Chicago. Their version is quite delicious and at a reasonable price, especially if you're familiar with them for their Chick-Fil-A Sausage which you have to try.  If you're a fan of burgers, then I would go for it.  If you want lunch and dinner, I would go for quick.  The server is fantastic, and you can get lunch & dinner pretty fast in here, which helps immensely since it's such a big selection of food in a small space.  Try the breakfast, steak dinners or night dinners with a slice of lemon.  Try the meatballs, always perfect.  Also,
restaurant. This sandwich is loaded with amazing food and pretty much a one-time treat.  Get their dipping sauce and grab the Dinners are a $25 minimum!  Come up with an address and let us know what type of restaurant you live in.
Bite my husband and I off the street to breakfast. This place is fun & well executed. I had a craving for fresh eggs, and had no problem with the quality of their eggs. My sweetheart went to set one up and then placed the chicken tenderloin on top.  My fiance got the falafel, and he gave it away. Great place to try out fresh juices if you are on a budget. I will be back.
I love this place!!! It's like a mini house with Raffles. Everything I order is perfectly executed and the ingredients are always on point. It's a little pricey, but the food here makes up for it. You'll feel free to come back once
restaurant. I have visited it recently and still have no idea how it's been being served. The old menu is still there for the reservation and we can't wait to see what they can make for us. And the name of the place where you can start every free event that starts now....it just never stops evolving.   This place is the least expensive restaurant I've ever been to, $12 for the family dinner, is on the pricey side, and the service at this restaurant doesn't seem to care at all.
pretty bibimbap joint, which is why i recommend it more, the sandwiches are ridiculous if you cant eat them, and the food is grossin aguuu milky delicious, really entertaining and maybe even even that cheap cheap italian dinner bowl at yumour. service is ok but their salad service was a bit shitty, the salad bar is really not deep enough and so on, be patient, just have your steak in that juicy
restaurant + wine list 
Cakehouse is my second favorite steakhouse in the city, but this one has the BEST!  The attentive waiters provide excellent service, and wait staff is knowledgeable on the menu so you won't have to wait for everything.  My go to restaurant is Mexican food and they are the ones that my friends and I can go to with asap.  It is loud, energetic, family oriented, and available for all kinds of reasons.  Great food, quick service and a variety of options.
I love Peking Duk!  Chicken Beef & Truffle with Meals is definitely my favorite!  We have had shrimp, salmon and venison which are soooo good!  Sometimes the server goes under the hood and asks if it is for our friends and we laugh, but most times it's us and our friends who enjoy the perfect meal.  What more could you ask for?
The Hot & Poisonfish was
restaurant for adults, it's cheaper and has a higher selection of beers.
Sure, we didn't want to give up the hostel steakhouse experience, but I guess the large menu and still-intimate atmosphere all make it worth it. After an extensive reservation, I decided to come in here on a whim and be done with what I had. I did so after a quick try at the night club and I'm so glad I did! I had a beef belly sausage and margaritas, and afterward I was immediately craving the huge portions, beef steaks, and one of our server's shawls! The food was always stellar, and the prices are always reasonable for the size of the steakhouse and just what the owners expect! Enjoy the steakhouse over here!
My husband and I went to Phoenix Park for our wedding anniversary in Chicago last week and had to give a big thumbs up!  With the restaurant in the area and a ton of restaurants around
restaurant that my guests are fond of; it has almost half a dozen pretty tasty entrees and prices go up every month, usually pretty steep and pricey - so...you can't go wrong. Do yourself a favor and try this place!  Highly recommended!
not as much as others on the list but when i do like their food this place gets the job done. i love their sauces and italian menu and fast friendly staff. i can't wait to return soon because it is a new location! also highly recommend the soda shaker and its fab black taranari!
Nestled in the very first upscale neighborhood on Long Island. It is about as upscale as town, everything in it looks like it was built for advertising but its still nice and cozy. The place is charming and pleasant, although the lights are dim.  They give you only 20 minutes to wait, but once you get there it is packed.
I'm not a Chicagoan but just wanted
restaurant was awesome, wine list is very informative, probably my favorite setting on Valet!
We ordered one of their flights from Chile.   The steaks were pretty good, but they had some okay shrimp on the side that tasted a little weak.  The waiter was really good, though he wasn't rude about anything or anything.  While we waited, our server walked up to our table and asked if we had ordered food.  There were some chicken fries and fries all over our food.  I asked how many of us could eat in total and he said the food might not have been good if it had just been cooked properly.  As a salad bar eater I have to say it was pretty good.  We did share a couple of the hot dogs and served them.  The duck fat fries were cooked, but tasted good.  Not a huge deal, but not a huge deal.  Nothing else to rave about here.  We also ordered the k
restaurant? It's great, but the prices are a bit high for an upscale establishment with large tables. But if you can do some fun things like wine tasting and outdoor seating, this place has a pretty good selection. The chips are always cheap so you get a full spectrum of creative-ities. For me, one of the best friends here is Cashmere which is one of the most expensive pieces of chips you'll ever eat. A must try!
The kitchen is always bustling with wines, and good food in all the appropriate flavors. I really prefer the popcorn bar to the fountain. Even though I ordered so much because the onion fried potato cake tastes like unicy or some un. That's a big deal for a dog or one of the young dogs at the bar. The fries are delicious, the salads are tasty and overall quite good. Highly recommended.
So, I've just been to this restaurant, and it is AMAZING! I have had a pumpkin pie
restaurant. If your opening/house dining is crowding us, try Ann Pezzard's BBQ, which has been a staple in Chicago for over 15 years now. The menu was great, as was the experience of waiting in line for an hour for our table. I also ordered the beer with which I was fortunate to have our party for this night; there was always room for improvement, but you shouldn't miss out on anything more than that.
First of all, we ordered a few of the desserts that seemed to be of standard size; Charcuterie, Lobster, or Goat Cheese. Then we ordered the salmon that went with the pretzel crust with the few chunks of white chocolate filling on the side. Only negative was the taste. Although the pretzel stuff really is fancy, the crust flavor was weak and also slightly weird. Finally, we took our waitress on a date and she sent him to bring us something that he found on Craigslist that she had never seen
restaurant (8 hours ahead), times are better when there is space - you get to eat in-person instead of waiting. From their 100$ margaritas with beans (which I felt was literally a dollop) to cocktails served with steak in slivered lines, they made me feel like a casual eater.
When i was in high school i ate at  Sweet Buddha whenever they were still busy.... The experience went like this...first it was the BEST BBQs i have ever been to! Second they had my buttery homemade peanut butter sandwich. third they had the sweet potatoes with the eggnog tray...being of Indian background...
lots of food on the list....here we are in Minneapolis and my area has so many hot spots to choose from and in terms of chili peppers.  Many of the hot spots in the city will have good looking coffeeshop service this past week, and if you are craving some hot dogs you may not like this place.
restaurant, and drive down to Don-Duffy's. These were the great pasta dishes and they were pretty good too. I had the golden portabella falafel and it was amazing. The rice was a huge hit too. They have amazing lettuce and olives so you have to try them before you go! It is an average wine and there are other wines that are good too but they were really good as well! Service was super quick! The sushi was good, the sushi was killer. The most delicious thing about this place is the only reason why I tried it out in the first place - it is BYOB. Just always wanting something different, it makes you feel like there is a middle ground between being looked down upon and being a tourist destination. You don't want to deal with any the people in the center of the crowd and a stop in at the waitress.
I really love this place, I've gone for almost all my favorite dinning trips and have
restaurant was where the main dish would be but it is definitely one of the more interesting dishes to try in different areas of the world! He ended up being very helpful in planning their menu and getting us their orders with prices as well as prices of everything in the group.
I love this place! I went there for dinner for our first time and it was great! We went here almost twice a month and got excited about dining out once in a while. I loved the wine list. It includes only the Horoscope bottles, which had that little bonus for us. One of the specials was a bottle of Marietta which was great as well as one of the herb sauces. I love that the meats are the same price as in-laws menu! I'm also pretty sure that many of the food is good. Our servers were friendly and informative and if you're staying with your friends, it's recommended! I was pleased to have a couple for dinner, plus was highly recommended
restaurant/potato pairings, and several specialty boutiques.
All in all, this area is great. Great wine selection. We recommend trying some of the neighborhood bars, like Phoenix or Papquemada.
They know Chicago. I've lived here for 20 years.  If you were here in the first place (you'd never understand their outdoor seating), and you're already been there, I strongly recommend stepping down.  I was in the area for months at a time, not just drinking beer or something.  I'm a frequent speaker of Chicago blues because this place is like Rock & Roll... One of my favorite places in the city.  They have incredible food--leaves blowing hot after a rainy afternoon.  From the soups to the eggs, this is a one stop spot for the dark beers and the ones I like.  The bars are great, and the food is great too.
This is my first experience with glacial duck and
restaurant also had good food, too. We ordered the Pork Chop Beet Benedict, which was delicious, and I didn't disappoint, to no avail. I liked it a lot, but it was a bit overpriced, and quite difficult for me to get around to eat at a restaurant that I frequent. I'll return.
Great Saturday brunch in the summer or fall - but still pricey. Make sure to get a reservation for just one seat on time.
I came here for a lunch one evening and we had a special occasion lunch so awesome!!!We always order at our table, and always get the food and samplings that we ordered. It was always better, though, and they always run the normal two check and bag - so we never went hungry.I love this place! They're so great the only downside I have is the wait staff at the door.
Food is wonderful, service is great, and atmosphere is cool. Best sandwich i have ever had. Try
restaurant and was consumed with joy.
We came to this place to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  We would go back, but in light of all the signs that the pizza is substandard and needs to be replaced with better pizza.  A bad pizza can ruin your wedding day, it can ruin the feel of your experience as well.  Can this be it?  We were thrilled and delicious on our first visit.  I also asked the pizza guy to point out a good sign and suggest that they add a light coating of crispy fried cheese to their crust and a few other items.  When the pizza guy refused to take anything off of me, we asked him to change it, however, the new crust was already getting on my tongue and started licking my hand up and down, which felt good!  They came back to the table after clearing out my mouth and tasting our pizza, and offered us the opportunity to do so in a different ways, perhaps even bringing out all
restaurant at River North.The rice noodles are the best in Texas. The tamarind churros are phenomenal!We take reservation for $45 for appetizers. There is no service on this place. You need to wait 20 minutes to order. While they have a huge amount of food and atmosphere, the food was mediocre. Not one to wait, check yourself if you order a 7, look at the menu before you order 3. Just for starters, listen to the music.I wish they wanted to set up door temperature for the food - not sure if it would have frozen cooked by now.This place is NOT good.They have great food, good people, but not great service.Not recommended for anyone with allergies or allergies to bread.Don't get it - see this story?I just think, since Bong can always be closed when it's a hot day, that they think all the hot stuff on this place is really uninteresting.Atmosphere:
restaurant. So, who knows?
Huge selection of desserts and delicacies, and a variety of styles that made this a pleasant trip to the bar. Other recommendations:
Lovell, the red currant & olive oil torta as my favorite!
Lovell has a nice ambiance, its amazing! Their steak has the best taste in all of the US. Excellent service!
Went here with my father and friends on a whim - our waiter insisted on calling us first and we waited right around 3:30.We felt like we had to do something to make the table warmer because it was pouring so heavily! When we called they were there around 4:00! We tried the torta, which was delicious. The toast and mussels are both incredible and the high performance meat sandwich was excellent. Pretty much like great food with some delicious innovative ingredients!Best appetizer I've had since eating here!!A+++ We also ordered the fried albacore
restaurant to the frog tacos. What a great meal it was. Spicy and well seasoned, and the fries were enough to satisfy that craving.
Went there at 3:30am with my mom. We ordered the clove mushroom ravioli but it was the worst experience I've had in years. I've been there twice before and its always pretty good. It only cost us $5 for a good dinner and everything in my restaurant was fine. I'm sure my mom would not go on a date at the party with the cuisine and I would go elsewhere. However, that thought will never go out of the mouths of anyone who feels this way about dining at Quicken Loans. Everything we ordered was overcooked and stuff like that ruins my day!
I did some recent reviews and here I was.  I want to finish this post and I decided to make a quick review.  I love the Service and the food (and the neighborhood bar).  I've
restaurant made burgers, burgers with shrimp served with chopped fruit for us, and waitresses' meats, salads, etc. (Some people consider this a go-to cafe that you just can't get anywhere else.) The place is great. If you've ever felt especially out-of-town then I can say that I am not the same as you. It is definitely worth your time and effort. Best of all I am giving the only and only reason I give this place 5 stars is because I live about 75 miles from here. Cheers!
This place was wonderful. The menu is very good, there are plenty of good food for this price, and we ordered: the crispy fried seafood (and orange oil!), the nice Sunday brunch dishes (both excellent) including this huge little shrimp dipping sauce (and my other favorites): fresh truffle (grilled and cooked and dried), coconut bacon w/ salsa, sauce with pickled and homemade mushrooms, a blend of mustard and
restaurant and restaurant. Loved this place!  The place was perfect with their petite tables.  The other dishes were exceptional, especially the super softened sushi rolls!  The prices were fantastic for what they were.
Loved this place!  The only issue I have is that they are slow sometimes. It was very cheap (I know it's cheaper because they take place over bar), but it was enough to keep me up at night.  Waitresses showed up early to speak with the manager and maybe charge extra.  At least it cost me the extra money and dessert.
No, I'm not kidding. When I saw them make their first trip to Stone Cold, I couldn't help but compare their past to the past...but hey, this place is different. We ordered a small bottle of wine at the beginning of the month, now our waitress makes sure we're eating as part of the meal...and it really was fine! You can't complain
restaurant was pretty much unmatched. They offered to re-create this spot to fulfill our requests.One additional good thing:We were not given a reason for the initial reservations. The owner, whom we saw and talked to several times, told us that he needed to go and show us how to have a tasting bar; however, he had previously explained that they needed to wait two hours for their alcohol to be needed. This went against the Red Cross requirements. This basically gave us nothing else to do besides return to the restaurant. The owners were quick to point out the violation, but we still had to wait an hour to get our drinks. After that, we were served our truffle casserole, but we decided to eat it on the spot. Another gratuitous disaster for a waitress, which we described as "the worst Red Cross incident in Chicago". After spending $300 which was an awful price considering the entire restaurant was without service, and the chefs, the food never came
restaurant" (around $8 per table) he who is entirely owned by Hastings, sells food without competition and still just serves food that is creative and affordable.This place started in 1972 when I was visiting New Orleans for the first time. The food was really, really great. We talked about the prices and finished that conversation with an ironic smile. Hasted was way ahead of what people expected. Second place was very different, for the first time in nearly 30 years. It was all about bringing a fresh seasonal menu to each table. The menu was a small bundle of grocery staples from different plants - chicken nuggets, scallops, pasta, ravioli, marshmallow. There was nothing special about the food. Other things i have recommended about this place are the beer list, the noise setting, the kitchen cleanliness and signature dishes. All this brought us to something VERY special. Ristorante for the most part, from the general manager for the food to
restaurant/ghost/lost glory. the place is the best in Chicago. I know that there is a lot of scallops there but i don't love it much anyway. after a couple days in the cold when we were in, i was disappointed. we decided to go here for the first time.  It was pretty busy especially since i was still in the diner for a night out at work. if you come to the chain and get your meal early, for all its flaws, you might find that the food is excellent for both sides and excellently service.
The service is great, the food is ok. but the food is awful. always ordering and going there, except if the wait and they say it's okay and not worth the wait time
Great pizza! You guys are awesome, it really is what it is. The weirdo, curio, crepes, etc are amazing! Food is good, too, but the Italian man is amazing.The
restaurant. All the people who work here are super attentive. The french fries are GREAT! I also ordered the red velvet paper. My friend got a tip for a porterhouse presentation and the entrees were amazing.
We went with another group of four last week. Everyone came to our table dressed up in pajamas with garters from the down-high street. The food was fine, but it was just more briney, full of crap.  It was hard to find a place to sit, and they needed a table. There was a few tables in the area and their owner offered to be their escort. I think it was a trap, but after an incredibly long wait, he eventually showed up, and ushered us all to his place. We didn't really care for the food, but they brought us out for a drink while our waitress ran around and barreled away. We were kind of impressed with their service, but I don't think they
restaurant left and found his way to Dr. Oel, which was clearly done with a 3-4 hour wait. The wait was no longer an ongoing problem at all. The Parking space was not updated and the floor floor area between the tables was untouched. I guess it was because of the public meeting scene.
Date was a little away, but that isn't all there is to it. Food was excellent, but the food tasted good, not exactly what you want from a food brunch. The staff took a lot of time to respond.  The soup was a little pricey for what it cost but got the job done (really annoying, don't you think?). My only gripe was that I went with the 2 week policy which said there was no guarantee you would be allowed to use the Green Leaf salad bar. All in all this was fairly poor service and I wish my server would have been more attentive. The last restaurant I've been to I'll probably go
restaurant (by far) was the best Korean food I've had and definitely will never return. My favorite place to eat in Chicago is out, but know that once in awhile you can try a new restaurant. When I come to go for the first time, I feel I am standing a chance to check it out.   Get up there and enjoy this funky start.
lots of great place to go to for great menu(and i love it to high)
im not sure if this is coming from me but i love dessert places, but the Chuan Lue is the same as old it was from sits inside the department. i love sushi at this point. more... not just desserts. so amazing that when the place opens it will be great, like i am saying, for sure but it may be just as great when the name Chuan Lue is on the menu!!
I just found this place by chance and I have always been impressed by the
restaurant has about half the menu.  It's beautiful and delicious!  They do have little french fries in there (make sure they're good but only use sweetened ones in it).  Just ask and you'll be pleased! It's fairly priced.  But it's nice to have the Schwab who serves you.  They might be the best bar in Chicago.
Ego dessert, and I was blown away!  Chicken heme with apple sauces and Bajillion burgers went great.  Also a fun drink.  The servers are nice and polite.  The atmosphere is very friendly and cozy.  The dinner menu isn't overly elaborate, yet the energy is nice and energetic.  I only experienced a couple of bites/takes because I had to leave early.  That said, you have to order the chocolate torta sandwich first before you get in.  If you're going with gluten/vegetarian dishes, pick up the special one
restaurant / desserts. There's also real bargain prices and great prices. The real deal part is very nice and cozy. Get there early!
I always don't like great food, but that's what I'm going for. Service is always excellent. Food is always fresh, inventive and fun. Food is inexpensive. So, if you are into that, the quality of the food at their restaurants is a little lower. Maybe it's because it's crappy. But then, there is only one place on the planet that has anything very, very good.. which it is here right now.
Don't go if you don't want to miss the wonderful atmosphere.   If you plan on staying until late in the evening, you'll enjoy a spectacular night out.  Definitely make reservations for a private dining room or over the counter in the dining room.
They make the menu  different than what I thought they would for my taste, but great price for the price. I

I've been working in the jazz arts for over a decade. That means I've never experienced anything like this, but here it is: less than a week ago, my friend and I were working on an assignment for a girlfriend's house club in Christchurch.  She had requested so-called spinoff drinks, and after two weeks of explaining the main ingredients of our taste buds, we decided to give her our names.  I was pretty shrugging because they're so trendy and the kitchen serves them together every time.  We ordered samplers, oysters, and hash browns, all wrapped and wrapped inside eggs - not including the kirchata.  She was thoroughly disgusted and she even attempted to open her mouth to speak... but none of this happened.  So we ate lunch in the basket and she started joking with the staff.  But what happened next was totally different.  After several minutes in the restaurant, the manager went
restaurant. The food was very good. Honestly, I wanted something else and the place is really cute on a nice day.
So fast food makes you feel like a hiker in Chicago. Spent four hours in Riverview, exploring the neighborhood, and I didn't believe what I read about Illinois once.  It's not that bad, it's just slow and the service is not top notch.  I tried mine, and it was delicious.  That's why you have to wait, its like a 5 star
This is a must go.  The oyster sauce adds to the flavor of the dish. The Seafood was great, and the beer was good, but it does not disappoint.  The milking shrimp was also very good, and the dumplings were very good.The food was decent. The salads were ok, but the most important part of the meal was the appetizers.  The pasta was very flavorful and much more flavorful than the
restaurant
Great, good service, wonderful cocktails.
The fall has been amazing, but with a warmer atmosphere, more festive atmosphere, and a small patio there is a lot of room for all kinds of different parties to bring out of the den with an awesome atmosphere. Rooftop Lounge - good location, very eclectic and very-good bar area
Truffle Shaw was great at, but I did not think much of it until I moved here a week ago.  I thought the ingredients were superb but seriously the menu lacked balance.  Great place to drink tea and they are consistently good.  Especially good if your looking for something quick and quick, because you get your portions plenty of time.  We made a reservation out of disgust but the bartender was upstanding - he said we needed our order before midnight on a Saturday and thought we would be available when we heard we were getting ready.  Unfortunately that only served to exacerbate our concerns by sending us down to the
restaurant. At the breakfast menu they also add other sides: oatmeal braised apple (scrambled) and dill pickle pepper roast. We have also ordered three menu items and will be back for dessert, dessert and dessert pairing.
great i like to have an elaborate glass of wine and take a refill 
Good ribs, good beef, and good tomatoes. Great drinks with amazing t&c. Friendly service and friendly atmosphere are the key to keeping going. I took my friend and the next night we did lunch at the Edgewood neighborhood bar where we decided to do our, but not the service itself. When I asked for a table or were seated in the dining area we were quickly told by our waiter that the service was being worked on. After our meal at the Edgewood, we decided to share with a few other friends, but we all would prefer that the ambiance be the same since the food will never change.  When we finished we
restaurant at Jamas.We started out with 10 veal dishes and each dish is 1/2 to 4 shits tall. I won't go deep into a specific dish, but I really like this one; the veal is packed full and the guac is packed to the brim. If you can find 8 portions in the bowl you will be an extra when you order. Also, I'm sure you'll also be able to get 2 wings, which are actually super expensive. So, I really want to try this dish. I'd definitely order something else here.
Best DELicious place in Chicago I have ever been to! Their customer service was top notch. A great fun evening to get a table that feels like a place to see friends and family. I'd definitely recommend for birthday celebration. Also, that btw, my co-worker recommended the ema baki sauce because I was so hungry.
Delicious! Ripped a coke from the counter
restaurant, entrance is passable but the service is terrible when they leave!
At least we found out that I live and work in Albany and expect great service.  We had a great time at the El Plata.  It's really great that the eating area is there....and you can pick your own food!
My boss went to North Side Doughnuts and was greeted by an appreciative girl. She was very helpful and always has a smile on her face. I have a couple other owner/ owners in Grand Lake and they have always been so friendly and accommodating.One thing that I did NOT like was the lack of opportunity for finding the beer or joint, and it is in a really bad way.There is just no art and music on the floor. The dining area is pretty bare, without ceilings, ceilings or other building components. We ordered three glasses of pale beer that were pretty much a overrated, decent beer. The staff also seemed to be kind when
restaurant and specials from the salon. It is the place to go for you if you are willing to take your precious run.  Call 1-866-331-8205 for more info and inquire.
This is a wonderful neighborhood restaurant and at the same time it has an exciting history and wonderful atmosphere. I am the exception here, so I ordered the steak bisque and the crab bisque. The crab bisque came with a nice white sauce which was very flavorful. You can definitely tell the chef was much pleased by the nature of the dish. I highly recommend going here at night.
YUMmmmmmmmmmmm yum! So good!  Food is good too, the staff is nice, atmosphere and atmosphere is nice too! Also if you get the pork chop sundae and have to pay the full price, a plus!!  The apple squash and apple pie are fantastic and the salad bar is a must for those of us who need to make a belly bump.
restaurant; authentic charcuterie. The ambiance and atmosphere is great and the crew is professional. Service is great too.
I was invited to over a dozen times. I have three different times at Whole Foods and one time I ordered the dog name from our menu. I ordered the three ribs from Poppy from Lard Ave. One of my friends ordered the carrot cake and was one of the lucky ones who ended up with ribs (the rest of the meat was not).  I ordered the casserole plate which was terrific, particularly the fried rice which was greasy.  The flavor, overcooked, were very intriguing and could make even the most basic portions taste different and that is why I said I had the lobster version.  My time there was certainly outstanding, but one last gripe is when my friend noticed we had a new cheese addition coming on the menu which we suggested for a different cheese cheese.  My impression was that Cheese Cheese was a better cheese
restaurant a la luncheon.  Not such a fine restaurant if you don't want to pay $40-plus to get some drinks.
These are such great people to work with and talk to and I can't think of any other place they could enjoy themselves. My favorite of all my guests were Curry Cereal and Spicy Chicken Steaks. I have a lot of favorites for my BFF and had a great time eating here! They also have some real amazing wines and delicious desserts. The service was great!
I love this place so much that I will probably never again visit.  The food is excellent, and the server is a great example of the kind of guy we want to hang out with and get the intimate experience we wish for.  Not so much that the place gets to me, but that it can be authentic and memorable.  I've come many times, and my friend Jokeman brought her here every time.  I am pretty satisfied with
restaurant).  The former abbot is pretty welcoming, the latter is more of a coworker trying to figure out how to be a better business owner.  After we had a tryst, we loved all the food and took a wonderful time to re-grind some.  The atmosphere was classy and had a good quality of music playing, considering how fussy our server really was.  But the amount of liquid soup was overpriced and the waitress left much to be desired.  In between which, the waiter was a jerk.  When this place gets trendy it gets heavy, but if they can just walk away from what I've been doing and move on, good for them.  I've had a different kind of restaurant recently, and their food tastes like they've just made a fool of themselves.
I really enjoyed this bar once again! It's the best. I used to love, but they have become so busy and so too overrun with their food that
restaurant there.  If there's a date, attend!
Yummy treats! I like to think that this is something that I can go to once a week or twice a month. It's always so full of flavor, and their fruit is very sweet. This was a shame. I like their honeydew breads with marshmallows instead of what I know as little mustard.  I found that the olive oil seems to have more healthfulness.  I found that they send me a steak, it's just spicy stuff, like before. Overall, I am a fan.
Beer got really loud during dinner and has had no complaints. Get in line at 3am and enjoy, but before 9pm start frisking.
This place is great. The food is good, but the service is still sloppy. I do not like trying to go on a roller coaster like that, except for yourself. For a start, the service is great, but it is
restaurant/ie t beand they have for a dinner/delivery.
With the hype about The Davey and the life it's like, right now, it seems like we've eaten here like they wanted to. I wasn't expecting the sandwiches as large, the fries to be small, and the salad to be high in oil so the cheeseburgers were cut the size of Chicago elaborate cheeseburgers I know nothing about, but yeah... I'm glad they can afford to hold on to what they keep in their bill.
Entrees are absolutely AMAZING!!!The Cafe Pigeon Dessert is A MUST for one night stand.  The only really nice thing about it is the menu!  The prices are high for what they charge for everything.  And the selection is so diverse, the last person to eat at this diner had to add a huge Cajun dessert to his plate.  My order was too small, and that
restaurant, but definitely a nice addition.I would definitely recommend it!
For the best artisanal bread in Chicago, it's with the tradition of delicious bread created by Chef Scott. Once upon a time we felt a bit superfluous - and that's exactly what we've found when looking at this place from nearly a hundred different angles. In this unique new restaurant with a more contemporary feel, Chef Scott is working from the inside and using the best ingredients of the city as he makes his way out of the kitchen and his bread. Don't give him credit for the city's culture, but rather make an effort, as Scott does, to deliver a regular, consistent menu for the good people that he is. We all feel that in order to eat here, we need to get a good experience. After serving our breakfast with a memorable steak loaf, our six-year-old entree, & one half of our catering plate, we both noted the place was extremely busy, so
restaurant/scheduled seating and all will be checked. Then we all take the money to pay for an extra 30 minutes to go eat at Crank? Yeah it's go get some help, take the chips off our tables, put your money down to play, just for me to mess around with this isn't the place for me. 10 20 dollar steaks and a weekend. Had the cook tell me he only added the food and then let them cook it (i think he gave the eggs, salt, flour, butter?) then we were eating, only to have them burn down and our waiter call for a refills until he left. When I realized he only forgot half of the calories (not at all any of them) he called the b/c I hadn't eaten in over two days and said he didn't need this money and said he had a clean table next door. He's kind of upset, sorry folks about that. Needless to say, no food
restaurant, and service at Fogo.  Service's really been great, but when you can't have one, you're just going to sit and wait.  We also experienced some slight pain in the back, which I am sad about, but still a thing when it comes to the comfort level. My husband really likes this place and I think they have nailed the dip-in-a-seafoods thing.  It's a little bit dry, but it is cozy enough and you are feeling hungry at last!  Definitely recommended.
For a Diner!   The food is fantastic and most importantly, the service is stellar.  Always provide a tip so that you can pay on time.
This place is deep dish of wood wood.  Make sure you have a decent duck short rib!  The cheese melts in your mouth.  The lamb chops are well done and the eggs are nice too!  Be prepared to wait for tables to be ready
restaurant, which could be gotten right away in my area, isn't exactly the best combination, but it's close.  I'm hesitant to go back because it's packed so quickly. The food is mediocre, the service was bad, and the type and the size of the ordering (if you order from the bar you get 3 plates, 2 of which are in the final product) can sometimes turn off, it was horrible, and the wait wasn't worth the money that I'd charged.
The food is good.The atmosphere is very traditional with a style reminiscent of old...Tim Hortons looks very modern.The service was really quick too, the server was very friendly and even gave us a casual comment. We ordered several items (love those) and it was always delicious...so of course very good! I cannot recommend a better place for wings and pizza...try that area...you wont believe how good the wings are!
Shrimp and seafood is in a huge
restaurant may not be as stellar as that theres been with us and my wife that for ten years  and it we dont even cook it once. NO Sunday roast week course, that wont happen and it's all in the most melty blend of dress's  Where they go 4 times per week.
Do your own homework on Cofagrigo and the GREAT menu.  The price is only $29.95
I love the food.  I would definetly go back to many other places in the city or my area.  There's not much I can do about this place, but considering the city I live in and the entrees I've had, it would be worth every penny.
It seems at the end of the day I'm a client... I really love these lobster rolls and cheese-infused rucquettes.  I'm always pairing the spicy rucquettes with cinnamon and a cup of wine.  I also like
restaurant: Yakisoba or Joe's Pizza
Bicycling: 1 mile or 2 miles
Food: The Porte's pastries, delicious egg crostini, and parmesan pizza are excellent. I've seen them serve up a beignets portion on the menu and those were great. The smaller baklava ravioli is also great. A must if you're craving raw or tender meats, not to mention raw egg-and-white crepes.
Very friendly service and a great place for vegans.  The house comes with a selection of appetizers that aren't totally vegetarian.  For the rest, you can also buy some meat and cheese.  There's plenty of sun throughout the night so it's always a great time to catch up.
What's the worst?
This bar is my favorite to get a drink on the neighborhood strip and therefore isn't really run by the one management as easily as a doughnut bar.
restaurant is so really good, the steak dishes are, yes, top notch.But, I am not sure what I'll be visiting! The only compliment I can give is that I think they have a new roast dessert? Every weekend we're so busy that all we need is to get to work.
I always crave a beef sandwich and steaks. I love this place for their light friendly food with a good spicy side and a very cozy atmosphere. A few other places I would try for sushi and a couple other meats would be very well received but I am sorry for the salt n pepper.
The French toast is the best part of this place. The salads are always delicious. Only downside is the wait but I never used to have to spend about $45. Yummmmm!!
Great fish.  A great place to go for lunch if you happen to eat sushi at the Food.  Great menu and just like the perfect steak dinner.  The chef did an
restaurant on the menu!If you are looking for your next entree visit my website. And if you are not a huge fan of beef & lamb, go down to the Stenny's.
My boyfriend and I have been enjoying incredible coffee. We got our reservation online at some point, and it was absolutely filling with the anticipation that had us thinking about coming back, but we ended up taking it at 2PM instead and found it really stressful, really, because it was Sunday in Chicago. The place is packed. Our waiter came by to bring the rest of our group up with some tea for us. Apparently we were only trying to pay and receive some delicious food, so we ordered a HUGE belly of rice, and it took 15 minutes of service before the rest of the party got on the table and sat. SO, even though it was a HUGE disappointment, we called them back, stating that it was a serviceable way to get a drink. During that time, the
restaurant and pianist, your hot dog is ALWAYS the best!
We were headed from Chicago to Lakeview when they offered a fancy dinner at the McDonald's on Friday night, and it was fantastic. We are a meat eater myself.  We used to go there at 10pm and couldn't wait to get home!  So good are the meat dishes you choose!  The homemade beef burger is just as good.  The shrimp wing sauce is very nice, and the bacon is not just spicy.  We would definitely go back to Grand Rapids if we ever go there again.
This place is amazing. It's not all new or unusual but rather has a fresh approach to the menu. The food is also great. The servers are nice and prompt. I will definitely go back to keep this place coming back. The ambiance and atmosphere is nice and looks professional. The service is excellent and the staff are efficient with just the right word of mouth.  It takes about
restaurant at Dinos. But, in about one week, some of my friends and I will be heading there and not take my friend or I from my place to order to order.  This may be a little tough, since it's not all Ethiopian. But, if you're in the area, you will see that Halal food is something that makes some pretty rich Ethiopian customers feel good.  Will be back!!!
my favorite restaurant in town. not too expensive and not too fancy. everything is fine..except some fake rice....5 stars for the rice..not worth anything..unless you like the Brazilian fried potato rolls. I don't eat a lot of chips. I have found that a lot of the alcohol we are served in will probably make a dish just a little bit bland.  the salad bar is a little thin..but you just HAVE to try it out.
The place is quiet so it doesn't bother me that they can be quiet. The food
restaurant's authentic

On Friday we'll be taking reservations. The hours are long, but worth it.  Our waitress, Bob Lovejoy, is kind and helpful, although she may be a little slow for a meeting place.  Sometimes we ask for a table, but she is always busy!There are 3 tables, all located in one area (outside of a small parking garage), and the price is a bit steep. But they are affordable, also. They have spare tables or storage units in nearby bars/restaurants, and will often give you a beer and dessert.  I always order very often and each guest who comes over is greeted with smiles and very respectful.  The views are fantastic, and the food is delicious!  I've had an appetizer a few times and the special one was tasty.  Thanks God for the beer and dessert, but really, everything on our table and dining room needs to be eaten with enthusiasm.
This place is
restaurant_and_wine. We loved it because it wasn't supposed to be like a restaurant, but it was warm, comforting, and my wife loved it. There was a lovely washroom, breakfast table, and hot dogs. Everything I ever ordered was delicious.I would definitely go back if I wanted to get a special, large, totally recommended entree. There were also great reviews of the wine and service. It was full of amazing textures, aromas, and flavors, really delicious as well as an extremely pretty little date. Having a great romantic evening, might be worth the day's drive.
Delicious.  I enjoyed having a table in the kitchen that felt like it was cozy while going through dinner.  I LOVE the subtle pictures on the wall of the restaurant where you can see what the chef was doing.  I used to have a few customers wait in line in the restaurant entrance the other day who had literally disappeared.  Food is always interesting.
restaurant with the meat dishes and my girlfriend came over to my table for the first time on Sunday morning. Upon arrival my girlfriend and I moved in together and both of us were surprised by the hospitality and the warm vibe this place offers. However I did not expect any sort of walk-in or limo management with some sort of sort of stellar engagement service - for the moment we had to wait to sit down and even decide whether we would get seated or leave (one group was allowed in while another was left standing and looking at the ceiling). Overall an outstanding experience!
Amazing brunch
The cozy, yet romantic ambiance of the bar is a must-see for all new patrons alike.  Although the lack of foreboding sounds like a corporate-like deal, the price point makes me want to steal it for myself and three other guests on a Friday night.  While that may not be an appealing concept to all, the hostess was "kind" enough to show us
restaurant. We have always tried to have everything good at our table. The meal was cooked at 6:15. The restaurant is reasonably dim, but the wine selection has almost gone up. A few dishes (such as churros) also came from the store (where we bought wine) that we didn't like. I will give the Applejack Dark chocolate cake to these three. :)
This is one of the best tasting restaurants I have had in Chicago. Service was warm and friendly. Excellent music was played and it felt a little empty when we arrived.
Came here for my birthday party. It was an awesome place, you will definitely be back.  It has a great mood and restaurant has a unique taste.  Excellent decor!  Extremely friendly staff.
I went here after a short lunch and really enjoyed myself.  My server(staff member) left a nice smile on my face after I walked in.  The food is very good and delicious
restaurant, pastry, and appetizers. In my entire kitchen, I have to say that I am one of the better spotters in the world.
Can't find what you're looking for! They got their Churros and this place IS BYOB. Everything I've experienced there, I've had on the Chicken Palace. My favorite is the Thai Sopa, and I guess their on Toast Cake/Pizza are exactly that. The more drinks you order, the longer they serve until you're hungry.  Give them a call and say they have a cash limit, when they can't see your bill.  Get back here on a Tuesday night and get in! I hope they have a staff that will say, "Do you want to leave on a Saturday night?"
The food was bad! Then again my kids barely attended school and so, if this place is based on the U.S, then, it is BS. And the closest will be our house
restaurant must have been set up just like that. This restaurant is so overused in its glory. Even though the name suggests that it serves the perfect feast (but as we found it to be you have to taste what you get). Maybe this restaurant does it right...but all I can say is that this place is a world unto itself. The only time I saw such an old burger the lack of scallion and coconut tasting sauce was a terrible taste for me...probably a sign of a better damn place...since I'm not an eatery kinda it's pretty lame to write a review before I decide what to eat...love you will.
Best In Chicago The
I am a big fan of this place. Everything was so friendly and laid back.The service was excellent and it would definitely be back in a heartbeat if we went.Also, many of the employees are super friendly, but they weren't really there to ask for suggestions and it would be nice if they
restaurant after the service room was cleaned and under seal. I went with my friend for dinner and ordered a chinese ranchero sandwich, fried pickles and beef dinner. It was both delicious and bad. I think the restaurant is a little overpriced.This review has a few meh complaints, but most of the things on offer seem to suit the bill.The beef is called raita meaning prime rib ( I guess in case you were not eating beef so it is pretty great), lobster-style steak with mushroom entrees, and pork bowl, it is basically just good;I had the sea beef calamari with feta cheese that was probably my favorite dish.Food is worth it, but most of the people just aren't getting what they pay for; and are choosing between a better steak, water pie or other sandwich which is better in the cheap quality.  There are so many appetizers, plate sizes, dishes and desserts that a lot of people find hard to
restaurant, game day, big menu item - cliche, from personal delivery.5/5 for lunch for a great conversation with my godfather but no 1st spot.They carry a sample salsa for you.5.5 for dinner (out of these last 2)Our food is excellent and well prepared.This restaurant boasts a large amount of slow fire artichokes that can be cooked on the spot. My boyfriend and I did a short weekend on the shrimp from Imcca and he had to leave 5/5 to save a 3rd of a dessert.If you're going to go with this restaurant for lunch time then simply take a quick sip of this stuff or pick up and go. I know Imcca does not offer much in the way of fast food but honestly the queso de timo does not disappoint.
Good food, but not bad. It's not fancy. Food is mediocre, it's fresh-made and reasonably priced.I'm from Texas
restaurant, and real quick to make your meal.
Enjoy a real yuppie brunch and this family staple at Imported Bakery.  Love the dress-up and this neighborhood eatery's delicious food.
This place is like you must have been inside a get-together! The menu consists of all the different kinds of entrees and the crew is extremely knowledgeable about the beef and lamb meat. This experience will leave you thirsty and hungry for more!
I made this reservation because I'm always looking for better sushi options and I had been coming in from time to time for my dinner. I just can't find a better spot here than the one I was traveling from a few weeks ago. I had better luck if you're in the area, but I don't think I had as much time to catch up.My service was excellent, but if you don't want to go to this place for a single meal and do your own sushi, this is just the place
restaurant in Chicago, but it is not what you think. The manager left me weeping while I sat with our waitress. Not because he walked away with them, but because I was glad to just be able to leave and wait to see the  food/service.  If I can't enjoy dinner, then please go. If it means I need to do something that is inconvenient, and it's just a chance for some stupid stranger to find me, so go.    Go out of your way for options and beautiful and authentic food.   Best diner ever!
Great atmosphere.  Disgusting food and bad service.  Service is below average and possibly overrated.
One of the most fabulous restaurants in the city.  They have many different selections of vegetarian, vegetarian, vegan, and all-around happy couples all over the world. I've been here all over the city (not to mention it's amazing) and it's as if they've
restaurant on the opposite side of the building. Don't even know where to begin...this is Chinatown. You don't have to.Winestag was also great. Brought in the shots at the end. I could eat it tonight and you could get a bottle of it when you get there.Great menu with solid selections of wines. There are many restaurants around in Manhattan in Chicago and it only gets better when you know what to expect.The food was fantastic, I'll definitely be back for sure.  Just not our cup of tea.  Still a long way to go in terms of house.
The friend who brought us a tea mug, she was very impressed. Even though we are both in Illinois, we really enjoy visiting here and seeing their excellent cuisine and just need to get in on a date. This place is spot on, from corkage, to seating and cuisine. It is the perfect coffee or tea and drinks to dine at. For
restaurant on Mother's Day!  We've waited patiently for several months for our order and they are fantastic!  We won't be back.  This place is important to us!
I live in coastal, mixed city. But when I hear Arlen, Arlen's, and all the success of Rick Ross in a few weeks we are still fairly skeptical of his success, especially considering his rants about the criminal justice system. I understand this. But the truth is that this is a place that, aside from being one of the best establishments in all of Texas, still will make me want to move. But I would rather go to NUKE because the atmosphere is great, the bar is large (22+ booths), and the line is barely 5 min for it.  Very expensive. (We recommend Garbo to Arlen at NUKE) If you need a good bar to drink out of, I highly recommend Arlen.
All I can say is
restaurant costs $25.00 (persons only)
This place was first and worst experience, however I can say that they did their best to arrive at a decent price to close the deal (that very day in DC)!  The waitresses were like "what a terrible place to be! i ordered sushi to try, then my order was there for what it cost! im just salty and lost stomach, remember?"  The waitress was very rude, she stated she just wanted to talk to our table, and insisted she don't talk to us after we were gone!  When she looked at our entree she was extremely combative, she said nothing, she got it from scratch and asked, "where were you for?"  She said the menu was available to our table but we didn't have our own so the only way we could get our place was to have our order delivered to them.   Then my husband could see he was actually in the way and his
restaurant, wine pairings, snack, appetizers, coffee, quesadillas, sauces, etc. It's just so amazing, food.  We've tried The Pichman - my favorite of the 11.  The italian bar is amazing - unique, beefy and tender, sure to last.  We've tried giardiniera di Ribe - usually 2 star, but sometimes we hit both.  Honestly, it is great, the broth is over the top.  This is the place to try some dishes, food and happy hour specials.
Best American Express ticket in town!!?!!!! Are you kidding me!? Stop in, you're taking the odd trip over to Lakeview!!!
I love the food and the experience! The service is just amazing. I am always stressed out, but love the food and the service too. The weather was beautiful and the tables were full when we were going out of town! If you want a romantic experience
restaurant. Sushi and food were great. For the price, I would go back to Lenders Oyster Bar.  Hopefully we can eat there too!
I love the lunch menu, seafood served at big cheese plates, and fresh veal salad.  Everything is spot on!  The peanut butter bar and free Asian stall is some of the best in the city.  It's small, and though the outside looks beautiful, the interior is just your typical diner.  It's great for the price, just a little expensive.  It is probably the most amazing lunch spot I've ever had in the city, and I'd recommend it for anyone looking to take in some fresh shiitake or flavor of the Vietnamese food.
what a disappointment wth its owner to become a wannabe doorman! one of my favs but becass it allows us to order something of the same sort
I always go to the Tom Kroll Cafe to eat at
restaurant on the scene as well. I love that you can even take your wife in and make great and unique treats for her! While traveling with us, these people always ask if you have the food, the service, and the pricing! I usually have no problem paying the bill and then we get seated and get complimentary wine and tea for the night. I will give the other restaurant another chance after this!!
This place is THE BEST restaurant in Chicago. We spent lunch there and they have been on the cutting edge of contemporary Italian cuisine. So if you're looking for a slow, fun, romantic dining experience, great restaurant, and can't beat the outdoor vibe, this place is for you. Great area for people looking for a great downtown location, just because it's a relaxing place with large outdoor terraces.
Ordered on Christmas night after seeing the turkey buns taste very good!  The place is so crowded because they have really good ribs!  The husband and
restaurant would have eaten without them!  It was the only time that I think I'd tell people if I should have!My family's favorite restaurant in Chicago, CAROLINA (also available at Cabrini and La Chorizo) was named after me! Seriously, that restaurant has good food and excellent service.I'd love to go back for a late night dinner but I don't know what better place to do that!
I just came here for the first time.  The food was delicious and excellent.  I had a huge appetizer and it was worth the extra money.  I didn't want to go back for dessert, but I have to say they had a good portion for just $9.  It was so nice to try their food but I will definitely be back to go again!
This place is awesome.  I LOVE these little "giganteeks" inside the traditional burritos!  And because I have a BBQ,
restaurant" (arriving at the public sidewalk is $45 and for whatever reason? they have huge tables, seating, warm drinks). I've been at such a high rate that other reviewers have also assumed I am on a skeevy runnable old school fare, then picked up a bottle of ketchup on my way down. Yet my basic bill for soups, which is a bit over $6, is still more than $5. Those of you out there who do not drink, try the corn noodle soup which is best. Their chicken broth is tender and flavorful and fresh and the crust has been fresh and flavorful. And if you're in a rush to get away, their soup comes with napkins and can be stashed at the back of your car. The soup also has 2-4 different sauces: olive oil and butter ricotta. My favorites (seriously??) are the white bean soups and the red curry paste. I would go
restaurant. We were seated on a portion of a very small, taffeta-y roll with slices of cold-pressed orange peel slices, and the atmosphere was very warm and inviting. I also had the pleasure of looking at the patio and marveling at the garden, even though the sun was far away from it! I do not recommend spending $200 or more on dinner here.
I have been to most of the most famous top notch in-marts in Chicago on a regular basis. However, I love THIS place to go.  And it is great.  Best steak I've had in Chicago.  Really everything is fresh and delicious.  So when, 45 minutes after you order your order, there is a closed 3rd party corker outside waiting for your table.  I have never experienced this since.  We order a couple of different occasions for our take home dinner and the chef absolutely moans and makes each occasion a special experience for everyone.
restaurant and food is great. It would make a great location for Greek parties. Although I don't plan on going back, I would definitely make it another visit.
I started with the morning rice, which was reasonably tasty. However, I did notice something was missing in the day menu: the rice was supposed to be cooked by hand, which made the atmosphere inconsistent. I'm often amazed at the variety of sizzling tomato and cucumber dishes I've eaten here (I have two things - an ice cold Brazilian style bagel made with pecans and sliced oranges and soprano peppers, a ginger firepot dipping with sea salt water and cilantro rinds - I did it with this dish).  We ordered 3 different dishes with cucumbers and one dish with onions and carrots - we didn't even come back.  They were all extremely bland - just ok enough.  We ended up eating 3 of those dishes, 2 were sweet and 2 were absolutely delicious
restaurant can be overwhelming, but I do enjoy all the fine dining service and decor in the mall. You can't go wrong with this restaurant, either.
I recently was going to see Husky there at The King. The place is nice but they're a little pricey and I think it's no great choice to go there once in awhile as a stand for bacon at downtown.  From what I've heard, they also offer bigger plates which is a nice perk but doesn't seem to be worth it. So if you're looking to get the feel for how great this place is in Chicago and want some great burger in a neighborhood that may be a bit loud, and not be surrounded by the number of burgers, it's not going to happen here.  Oh, and I love that the croquettes (my favorite pastry cheese stuffed with mussels) are all rolled into a tortilla, so you can enjoy the delicious food while you wait for the big meals. 
restaurant... and the sauces in their burgers are an outstanding selection... But at 40 pounds, they're not anywhere near the same quality, nor in line with the sales side of diners in Chinatown and the droves of Wrigley brothers in Tustin, even when you add their famous cheeseburgers (Frozen Jack, Apple and Wildfire) and the wintry dining environment.If anyone feels that I could get away with throwing $40 of my own money at another restaurant, well, you're not going to be disappointed. That's not a small price for a steakhouse, you're going to be ripping it up, you'll need to get out your check.
I'm so happy with this place. I also recommend this place if you have the patience to come here after being snagged by a buddy of mine who used to be busy.
Went to ALORE Saturday night and was seriously surprised that there wasnt a sign for another bartender
restaurant, tea bar, bakery, and retail locations, in every town in Chicago and the Chicago River.
Only other reviews I could think of that are anything other than 2 stars are from Calipari-Glazen Park and Eagle City. Keep in mind, at the bottom of the list there's this real gem, which is not a pizza place but a cozy cafe. No matter how warm it gets, how light it is, and how welcoming it is, you get a ticket for a seated person and a table by the kitchen door.  It's definitely one of the best pizzas I've ever had. I only wish they were here early on in the morning.
Favorite food pairings are: Waitstaff, Chewy Salad, and Rib Grilled Chicken.  The one thing that is a bit unusual about the three is that you don't get extra and there is a 20 minute wait for each serving that takes you to your table which is usually a true
restaurant, but I thought that was the right move. I also thought that I can sit a couple up the chimney to enjoy the food and that the staff is knowledgeable and attentive. Everything was delicious! The chicken was deep fried and cooked perfectly. The sushi was good and no excuses. I have never had better service. I would like to see more of what they have at their amazing restaurants so maybe I can see myself in Texas again. My mother knows I am an avid cook but does not like restaurants that make food known to other women. Since my visit I cannot wait to try their other amazing food in Mexico.
Probably my favorite steakhouse in Chicago. When I went last year, I wanted a quick burger. After asking a friend for advice on what she wanted, she recommended sticking to the humble menu. If you like the "comfort food" factor, this is the place to go.
I love this place!  All the great things about it - great staff
restaurant, beer selection, and service

When we ordered it after dark I didn't remember anything else but the menu was reasonably priced and I had the Olives, Jalapeno Truffle burger with shrimp and avocado, vegan options. The maki roll was a perfect touch. I got the Roasted Zucchini and the Caramelized Cod with Jack, Lime and Asian flavors. Finally the calamari plate was a dream to share with friends. When we waited we went to a friend to get their dinner so I was happy to wait

We can all agree that this place was a hit with the locals and we're here to help. The service is great, the food is fantastic. The breads are good and the prices are reasonable.I personally think that this is an upscale gastropub, and the best prices I have seen in my long drive from Albany to Suburbia.
We are not sure how to describe our meal at 10/10
restaurant, food, sound management and lively atmosphere.
I feel really bad for the Bossies who couldn't have possibly cared less about celebrating our celebrity guests, despite their second coming twice.
You guys have to eat here, not cause it's HORRIBLE. Not a great place for silent auctions, don't tell anyone else to eat there unless it's your own family but that's totally the definition of success. So how can they possibly look good to the underdogs in the spotlight? I mean, why would they even bother with that thing when you paid for $20?Now I know why the fat is bringing people's prices down in ways that are shocking to see in the industry. All because of one stupid sandwich salad. The ketchup sauce is literally a blood sugar bar in its own right. But after that, the rich fries and miso soup didn't fit the bill either, it didn't do the salad. Gotta have good money for all the same
restaurant). One of the rest of us complained, and refused to pass. So we were finally taken off of the bus. My buddy and I were in the back of a one-car BAPPER bus and asked what would be best for you and the others. We ordered lemon vinaigrette and tried to tell the bus driver we don't like my sweet tooth. At one point the BAPPER employees asked us to let the menu be, before putting us back in the back of the bus.I'm willing to bet we were totally wrong. After we explained that we had to pay (yes, I know exactly what you're talking about, because this is the same bus that we had to put in place prior to this bus stop), the manager kindly said, let us clear our plate with the kitchenware. She said, sorry, then she just got upset and the line on our bus suddenly went silent. When we arrived back on the bus, we finally got
restaurant shop (the waiter is friendly). Also, if you do like kebabs, you should definitely visit!
Great meal. The food is great and the service is slow. The bar is staffed perfectly, which is definitely the best way to go from Chicago and the best time to work or have dinner. The salad bar is great and helps to ensure the wait is high and attentive. The service is so well thought out and consistent that sometimes they won't even stop telling you that the salad bar is full. It's the best fish you've ever had!
Great place to drop in with friends and take away food from them and deliver it to them, I'm no paranoiac, but this place and the ambiance makes this a great day out when you catch a nice looking bar table. Kind of daunting, but I think it's a wonderful place to look for a place to have a nice meal. They have beautiful craft beer booths and are serving great tapas
restaurant, there is a huge outdoor patio (not the Rooster Steakhouse). Also, I ate at a friend at my last restaurant and asked him if he wanted to come with me to his house so I could eat and drink. Our first bite of pizza was pulled out by an overweight half hour waitress who was hungry.After that meal, I was super bummed and so dilly. She called my name, never really coming back, and when I called again the next day, the waitress told me that she actually knows the manager. So I called a customer service rep and he said that she has no experience whatsoever with discrimination. He asked the customer service rep for a business card that was returned. The customer service rep said to no good.My friend and I thought we could take him to see a doctor for treatment, but his plow couldn't even come in. But that doesn't even get the point.

restaurant and waiter will warm you up and leave you pleasantly refreshed. My partner has tried it every time we have eaten there and says it's never too crowded, but it does try to be along the line at times. The menu is friendly, everything is in the mood for a serious, table-to-table experience, they are always ready to serve you just as soon as you call. This place is a must stop for any Day or Sunday Night, and you can see that they just can't beat there. I must say that I would recommend this restaurant over the jaguar pork a la carte.
I started here about 10 years ago and am just now able to justify spending a lot more for the food and service (it is...not sure where I got that number from). i've been there a few times but i'm really not sure what to say anymore.   It is food heaven and i absolutely love it. I like that you make your own
restaurant, and another fantastic sushi menu! Service is fast and friendly. The place is packed and always full to capacity. Highly recommend!
Best Noodle ever!!  Amazing atmosphere!!!  The buffalo wings are extremely tender and juicy and taste of chicken hot.  LOVE THEM!
First and only time I have been here since my parents were kids and never had a complaint that my seat is empty. Food is amazing and the wait staff is also highly experienced.
Never been a fan of either the Peppers or the Lincoln or Burgers.  Not a fond preference of either but they have both.  On the other hand I have tried my fair share of other food and none of them fit my taste of comfort food.  I love both of them, they are both so flavorful, their flavors turn out to be much more nuanced.  It is in many ways the place that keeps my parents out of a hot dog heaven, simply because it's so good.  Wish
restaurant/deaf burrito that people don't get before I die, but then again, they use only fried eggs and the choice to live up to their hype...to roll out cilantro rings, no bacon in them...of course, the presentation is pretty bland, and the menu is so tight, but overall I'm happy with what they offer.
I had this brunch which was a great casual, upscale dining experience. We both liked the organic chicken entrees and chose locally grown ingredients in the name of making up for the cornbread variety.  The food has great ingredients and we didn't have any issues with the food.  Everything we ordered was fantastic. I usually come back for dinner that they do not bring out, which would be ideal for taking the flight to enjoy a breakfast that is more traditional than what is being offered there. We got about 25 people to enjoy the dinner and were glad we did.
I came to Colorado for brunch on Tuesday night and
restaurant, great food and comfortable service. They serve the perfect amounts of dairy. My wife and I cannot say enough about this place!
this is one of my favorite places to eat in Minneapolis.I ordered the #tarnished keds.
this place is awesome. I had the fish tacos in the chicago style.  I ordered the pizza,  crispy okra (most of the entire crust), potato torte.  They have the milkshake as well.   The only thing I would consider changed is the pho...
Goooooodyy!!!! I love this place!!!! I ordered the sausage dish and it was absolutely delicious!! You get sweet onions, eggs benedict and then it's vegan bacon. But the real goodness, the hollandaise, really is as if you have already eaten everything.
Recently the coos Alinea died but the reason for it was because one reviewer came by late. Not a great quality, but
restaurant In this step you want to take the restaurant without a bar. You choose your salad bar, you go to the dim sum area, you take your order, you choose your specials, and then you get a waitress to help you wash dishes. You simply get to do with your salad bar, and are never forced to wait for others. At Tortilla Hour you will find a variety of chips, sandwiches, and courses. Best part is that all the staff is all new, very friendly, and very friendly.When you visit Tortilla Hour, you will find everything you need for a great dining experience in a BYOB experience. Tasty and addictive food. Come here and see what is up!
Nice place for quick i-try. I tried karaoke after going to YUMMY last year, which was excellent.  Fantastic wings on pasta!  Pros: .2 stars- health food is very good and also the service is extremely friendly.  Other
restaurant is fantastic and it is a MUST try.  We never had to ask them to re-think a breakfast joint and we must say the waitresses were average - especially when I saw the king crab fried chicken sandwich and grilled chicken wings.  If you are looking for vegan comfort food and can cook with little water and have a completely organic food system, this is the place to go.  I especially recommend going with any star-traded member. They've never been left out...you just need to experience.
Came here at the end of the last college party and love this place!  My friend was in the kitchen and the smell of garlic and sea bassified me.  Will definitely be coming back!
Decent spot! the food is good, at around $40-60 which is good for what you get, but do not buy a cheeseburger or fries,it wont be cheap,get some cheese, theyve from specialty shops in /
restaurant.
The bill is $40.00 and it is pricey.   This place has some of the best staff I have ever been to.  Their avocado sandwiches are spicy and perfect!  We also decided to come on another date there.  We should absolutely come back!
i love the food so much and love the small plates and if i don't like, wont stick around. dont even bother to write reviews anymore.
Went here for my birthday and the seafood is outstanding -suspect your garlic chicken will melt in your mouth and taste delicious.  No complaints there. The portions are large, and the stuff you eat is homemade.  Save the margaritas or sushi.
Yes!!! On an average day in Wicker Park there is a 4.7 out of 5 for condiments (equally as impressive as parking) AND there is probably more than a 45 lb pitcher of condiments in the cupboard.  That's what
restaurant, stand in the doorway after take out of the fridge and hit your place for the first time. PICK YOUR BUSINESS TO LUCK THE OWNER! Harsh service, crammed with 3 kids (too many to get our whole bill), and done looking creepy all the way to the boardwalk. The milk brought home to children can be taken home and carried out if we want something. The decor lacks sophistication for the food and everything is stylized to be interesting. If you're a Westerner who likes to burrito's, don't go!
I love Hot House and wanted to try it, but came across a 'disappointed,' bizarrely depressing - that: Why? (sorry, the plate was so dirty. It was $2.50!)  So this was my first visit from The Crusty Man's place to the Kwik master's home.  The food was good, but it was also about the hot tables, but things got not
restaurant/wine shop by the ton!   It was packed so early and so hard for me to find a table - but the mixologist took care of it so I took that as my main service!  If you're from your own neighborhood, sit down for the appetizer, or try the sushi.  Always appetizing!  You can't beat the place for small change :)
Wow! I had this place down before and could not have asked for better food. I would definitely go back and recommend this place more.
I love the slightly different vibe of this place.  The food is really tasty.  We all have wanted to try the soups with lamb lamb chops in their famous turmeric hot sauce but the stuff that is great in this location is amazing.  They also offer soups for vegetarians as well as those looking to fill up on just the purest foods that will serve you from day one.
Went there for dinner on Saturday
restaurant and elegant dining room. The entire dining room is filled with old style charm. Everything is built around the kitchen, not an overly decorated place that draws you into feeling old but cozy. Additionally, the server love to bring out old recipes that bring out new items in the dining room, pastels and sommelier's margaritas. As a true vintage Chinese food girl, I find that I love being seated here, even in a casual setting. This one was a bit too cozy for me but still has it's appeal. I also love the exotic wines and garlic mushrooms on top, we have recommended their Carnivale and Cerveza, which is just amazing. The service is fabulous as always, they do quite a little for a reasonable price. A lady also brought out the best in me too.So that wraps things up.What's the biggest disappointment for me? The Chicago police didn't show up. I'll take their word for it but it doesn't
restaurant/price/all times.All Food & Wine selections are listed on the menu at some point.Food is usually completely cooked for a cash fee and is always fresh from the outside. Notable Specials:My wife and I go to POUW with them all the time (they'd send us some for desserts!) and this is one of the few dishes that they'll always have very good choices for.  Good friends and I have been there three or four times, with only one reservation.  The line is long, and crowded (this place has about 2,000 seats, but this is a popular spot for a late dinner.)We have tried not to be hitched when dining here, but I guess that's probably because, after all, it's a Uptown neighborhood, so get out of there and go look at the coffee shops.
Wonderful place. Will definitely go back. Just what I wanted: great food and good decor. I would
restaurant, you will have to eat again next week.  They have had the friendly service which is as good as anything I have tried.  They pay me less, i don't like it.  I am glad i dont have to go to st. pronto when the wait is all so long!I want to mention they do take time off, not that I like that since I do not take vacations out of this city.  If you are in need of a refund I would definitely try to get one of the food servers to come, I will be back.This place is loud enough for a wedding but I don't like noise.  On the weekends they offer free lunch and dinner.  My advice is to look outside and get in the mood when the main character and the waitress come.  I hope i can find a better place somewhere in the city for a large meal and business meeting.
First time I have been to Fireobserver I had good experiences
restaurant too. I had the Artichoke soup and it was way over priced. I ordered pasta glee cashera with salmon risotto and had the jack goat blue crab in it. The third time we asked if there was a line down the street so we asked what to bring. They told us we had to get on another item. So when I left, we paid the waiter and two of his attendants and asked if he was drunk. Once the line was gone, we started getting stuff in it and left. They cut the tip off and took us to the next floor and removed everything. That night after the first time, I brought in my partner and the waiter was just from left. We wanted to report this to the police, but our waiter did not get this because he was not the employee in charge of the area.The next morning, we found out that they had been asked to find out why we had not paid. We didn't even want to pay the
restaurant, salad bar & martini room; foodie friendly service and a great outdoor patio overlooking the river, & lots of others...
Good food, cheap drinks. Yum!
The courses are definitely worth the fee, the staff is friendly and fun, and the atmosphere is fun and friendly. Everyone in this neighborhood is friendly, everyone has an occasion to relax in their special day at the house. They are always positive when they see it,and I always do get to meet the people in line the night before.  And the wait staff is always very attentive and knowledgeable about their needs and is always just doing the right thing.  This place is definitely worth the money and you will always come back for more good food!
For me, this was one of my favorites for Chicken Bayou. I went here during the Decorary Dance Marathon for the first time at the invitation of my girlfriend, who was having dinner with them in June. As we entered our 10
restaurant The milk brought me over to this place. Good pace...on line to order ahead.
I'm not one to write that I'm a hipster. I don't.I suppose what some would consider to be "flavored sweets" or even the words to describe them does not usually come to me.  But once they arrive,  customers get their plate of  French food, and afterwards the servers haggle with us over  the types of  salads we ordered.   At the end of the evening, I ordered the Tomato Sautee with Eucalyptus Caprese and it was the BEST dinner ever. There were so many of the ways we had been treated that one person should have been able to say that.  The server provided exceptional service.  Everyone was super polite.  The tablecloth was more pleasing than the menu. I'll try coming back for more dinners (which I do).
I was very excited to go
restaurant and Yelp friendly service.  It was just a hot dog place. I love their grocery and entrees, fun food choices, inexpensive prices. I also tried some Chinese food, tofu but it was great. I may return.
Wow it is amazing, needs some more flavor left, but have been coming here since 1970, so it's a great place for fast casual drinks.
After 12.5 years in the food world, RUSSELL returns...again with no loss. Our waitress has pretty much nailed the vibe with our food! For the casual cocktails, she works with the kitchen manager and even manages to touch upon the entire menu! They include lots of menu choices, including many dessert specials. This is a stand out area of mine. The service is very friendly, friendly, and way more playful than I'd ever had!
I've been coming here for years, visiting the city, enjoying the environment and enjoying amazing Chicago history.  It's not
restaurant is had much better!  Don't expect the $12 tacos that come with the taco sandwich but with the beer.  Don't bother the cleanliness but rather the hardiness and the pricing you should be paying for that food at the door.
Great Mexican food!!! The onion rings were fantastic and the catacombs were absolutely amazing! And the steaks were awesome!  Super crispy and even more spicy than a classic burrito. Huge!
People hate to bring their dogs here, so I went here for lunch early on my 5th birthday to try the Salsa Barrio de Huela.  They were terrific, only better. The spicy food was exceptional, and the place was the highlight of the night.  Its also worth mentioning that the tomato taco is really good, too. The general opinion here is that the quality is definitely higher in the neighborhood of the old ones with tacos (although you need be a little invested to try it), but
restaurant...for every seat this is an absolutely horrible experience.  I've just made my decision and since then, it hasn't changed much, even though I will continue trying.  It's not the same food, but it is reasonably priced with good portions and decent service.  I'll have to say that I love food here.  I know it's not the pan pizza, but that's pretty good, I'll have to ask the guys to slow down and service it accordingly.  I love to try what they've brought in.  I have to say that I love the pizza.  And, yes, they've brought in some money to the restaurant, which makes sense.  With that said, if you want better pies, you should expect better service, but the chinese price tag is too high.  This place is at the mercy of the local supermarket, which makes me suspect that most people would find themselves very happy.  I will say though that
restaurant was very good. Warm and fresh, unique ambiance that makes you feel like you're getting a cup of coffee or two. Lunch for $12 was delicious. Not surprising considering the cost of it.
This place is great for, well, brunch, so please, start getting breakfast here -  go to yesteryear's ollie, eat there.  The blue and white one, the meatballs are good, and even better then these black ones.  Some really interesting dining options... The only disappointment is that our friend, Sarah, went to the movie with me and we were all very disappointed, although the star ratings are still overrated by the old world, so don't be like me when you can't get a ticket and to eat there.
The veggie burger, made with maple syrup is my favorite. The chicken burger, lightly creamed, with sweet and savory notes was my favorite. Always go back for a free dinner or just

The water job is better than the kitchen.  The staff (whom I am fairly certain don't like) seems to be full of blackouts.  Also, as you can see from their location on the way to my bus stop (the corner closest to my cousin's house), all the bathrooms are boarded up.  We wait for our table and the wait staff is always lapping us up.  As soon as they call, they go to the exit and they don't bother saying what a breakfast is.  This place is so loud it seems very thin.  So our table is over-sized to put more diners in the bar area.  I think that many restaurants take things such as pretzels, french fries and mascarpone to private party rooms and families just in case the server
restaurant) but the heart of the restaurant is surprisingly tiny and small. You will catch a good meal here and it is definitely worth the price.
Great food. Great portions!  Covered in lime-soaked apricots.  Some pretty amazing spiced waffles!  It's a bit spicy, but worth it for what it does to your eating pleasure.  I suggest visiting the local library on St in Sandalwood for a couple bites, as they have an extensive selection of stuffed treats.
I must confess I am hooked on Dark Horse last night. I went for dinner that night and was very, very disappointed in the food choices on the menu.  I have had this place before and will be again.
I have long waited in line at McDonald's (superb restaurant). Everything was in order. You can see our order is close at any given time with our meals being cut directly into the meal. We had chicken breast at dinner (1
restaurant, opulent, atmosphere, and amazing food. I have been to Suburbia 6 times now, and will be coming back again, this is the best breakfast on the planet. So get in early!!
Delicious, deep dish cheeseburgers and much better than their cheap rockabilly burritos. Every time I go there it's always a little bugged to me because of the crowd. I normally visit though and run up two or three times for the same item. I would recommend going ahead with the cabined chestnut sandwich or the slow-penned lamb dish. If you're a lot of vegans and vegetarians, this place is definitely in your top five.
I LOVE THIS CHICKEN IN A SMALL PLACE! My co-worker even sat down on my bed and chatted with me on the phone. I've had Vietnamese, Chinese, American and Chinese and loved them all.  The sandwiches (which was
restaurant, counter and cookware. Also a great place to take my daughter to (and for the longest time visit) of Burakkam restaurant, after working at Ground Zero twice.
We took the first class back from Colombia and dined at a trendy bar called Barquattie on the Uptown. The decor and food was so much more relaxed than we had anticipated. We definitely went home with the best selection of food.I would highly recommend to anyone in the state of New York!
I love this place - close to time (which is on nights that I normally work) and casual.There are a lot of great restaurants in Chicago and take advantage of this spot - great service and a great spot, with all the full menu.Also to say that its a great place to grab drinks. I have never been to Blackbeard and thought the atmosphere was a bit unappetizing; but the waitstaff was a little banged up. Also,
restaurant. Our waitress was patient and helpful. The restaurant really should move as quickly as possible. I am disappointed by the home review. Very low priced and very flat, to say the least. Poor service at an out of town establishment. I live in an area with no tourists and will be looking elsewhere to visit.
I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for brunch drinks and try to fit into the non-grit category.  From their ambiance and breakfast menu, there is enough in the house there to warrant its place on a typical Sunday brunch.  Make sure to pick up some early favorites like the fried chicken with chive, or the arrozito and quiches with cheese cheese gnocchi.  Try it, warm up for lunch, and eat some of these little things on the side.  Just don't go wrong.  I would leave it hanging to be another Paul's Burger.
wow! I was very nervous for
restaurant that wasn't on the menu. You've got to go there, get there early.
I'm a Chicago native and a regular go-to for Italian food at Target (family friendly and well known in Chicago).  My friend and I ordered  three items at the bar, chicken bisque, and enchiladas on two weekends.  At the time, I wanted all of my recipes to come from my table or order by phone.  Needless to say, none of the choices were as appetizing.   The foods came quickly enough for me to decide the best of the options and the other two had ample options for other dishes.  Not a big deal, but I was extremely disappointed.  My friend did some server service and had some top-notch service.  Although the service is not stellar, I am glad the restaurant was large enough for its unique and eclectic staff, and really acted like a home for the rest of the friends and family
restaurant and it's well worth the money. The specialty pork dish is the stuffed duck soup. If you're looking to get steak and braised beef, this place is a must try. Service and menu choices make this restaurant worth your money.
Great small table with great food.
I actually ordered a beer at this place but my husband & I wanted some fresh stuff to make dinner as soon as possible after my birthday. i didnt want to wait about 45 mins while waiting for my  friend to come back with the birthday cake and a strawberry ice cream. the waitress was very apologetic. i thought i was being condescending but nothing happened and now i have to cry at the end of the course. i love the food but after the food, I decided to go with the fresh fruit dessert with some hash browns...my friend gave me a book on how to make it.  im so happy she let me bring them as they arrived on time because there were a ton
restaurant, intimate, friendly, stylish, have fun and give people everything they love
I'm very fond of this place, what more could you ask for?  I'm always planning on stopping by and taking in a good time.  Their drinks are phenomenal and I can't wait to try their homemade cocktail bar once again.
Good food, great beer, great wine, pretty much the best pizza in Chicago.There's nothing wrong with that. It's me, if not the other guinea pigs, actually being here. (for those of you who don't know, this is how long we have been here and it's a known fact that they have become hard to find).Overall, a really good and well-delivered restaurant.We loved every second of the stay. The experience was extremely fun, the food was decent, and the staff is also very nice. The servers were very helpful and welcoming. Our food had plenty of freshness, a decent amount of
restaurant was slightly garrulous. The coffee, too, was delicious and the service was great.
We've been coming here for about 45 years. The owner, Michael, grew up here and I'm lucky enough to have walked through the gate there last week. My father and I also go here regularly and the service is always attentive and pleasant. Everything here is completely nailed and I always am impressed by the customer service and the food they are offering for a low price. We've been eating here once a month and are always ready to order again.
Go to Roast Ale with drinks. They have food delivery.  This place only makes me want to visit new places and eat, so make sure you bring your mom and dad along if you want to get your fix on what does taste like beer and juice. Good and hearty meat, fish, beans and stew. Good beer selections and excellent food selection from beer selection and numerous that line the building. And as for beer
restaurant and an expensive wine list.  My mind just went blank when I called to see if this place would be open within 5 minutes.  However, I have never been a fan of Melange's Summer Sushi.  The bowl of noodles has been a nightmare for me.  I had to be in and out of the kitchen for a while until I finally got home.  The servings are the shortest, and the flavors are a bit milder than they should be.  The crust was a bit thin.  But  the chef seemed to know it and helped me up.  The food wasn't great - it was way too dry and bland.  My friend had the duck dish and the shrimp and ceviche was really bland. 
Outsiders used to have to go on the Sunday morning in the rain. Now the best sandwich on the menu is the Restaurant Impersonator Taco. The waiter is calm, friendly, and has manners. The service
restaurant special (This time, we never had to ask for a new entree!!); the food was good and the service. When I thought to bring another pan or to sit down while I ate a dish to change the hot dogs I felt like I was going out of my way to pay attention to food. The waitstaff was so great.  Upon entering the restaurant, I was greeted by the manager who said yes on a score of occasions and said hey, feel free to come outside for a takeout stop.  The fries were tender, the beef was tender, the onion rings were medium tender, the chocolate chips were small.  I was finally satisfied and one should only think that I was going to come back, but the couple of times I was there the manager was constantly asking how everything was.I'm not a fan of coffee when someone has to look at the coffee tables.  I have a table in the 90's, so we ordered nothing, ate nothing
restaurant staff is very friendly and our restaurant is a great way to get a quick bite to eat at lunch or dinner. If you're looking to improve your American dining experience, this should definitely be your type of place to start. Just to put it into perspective, if you really want to get to eat good food, go to Bulgogi and you'll definitely be able to eat a lot of tasty things at lunch or dinner.
Amazing Bakery! The cool atmosphere is perfect for a brunch or dinner special. We'll definitely be back, keep coming back!
Best sushi in Chicago     The romantic sweet spot with a romantic vibe can only be described as fantastic. While I've been out of town for a week already, we were impressed with the service. I've got the best chuvito and croquette soup ever, and they keep pushing their service even when it's being a little slow. I've been to many amazing restaurants, and this place is
restaurant in the city.  Try 3 different dishes at once, and then forget the generous portions, since the special tastes and weather in Winter are so great.  Service is wonderful.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  Everything will go together and the food will add up nicely.  They are the perfect place to eat at lunch, dinner and more.
Too sweet for my liking to review.   They just get a bit sweet, but good enough to make a good meal.
I've been here since 11/2/95 and have had a few huge dishes with good recommendations (The Salad and the Barbecue Fries) but I think the'must-try' is closest, especially since these are my favorite options (as I am coming from a college and it was very rainy). I'm not a veganist, so you should look elsewhere for good vegan options.  Aside from the fact that they are so special, we only order some of the
restaurant. This was similar to the actual bottle party, but with less whiskey and more light meat and vegetables. In addition to the bowl of pasta I ordered, the pasta portion also included the Egg Rolls and Quail Sandwich. I love the flavors, the Chicken Parmesan, and the poached eggs!The service is incredible. My wife ordered the burgers and mac and cheese, which they only seemed to eat once because of the high chocolate portions. The tortilla patty was fried and was almost totally charred on top of everything! Overall a good experience.
I've been here quite often and am always on a strict vegetarian diet.  This place is warm and welcoming and provides you with the right attention for your cooking and eats.  A great choice for first timers!
I've been here before and had the Wine Fish Spiked Soup and the Bone Shrimp and Eggs.  I have never had a bad experience with this place and they actually sell a lot of the delic

i wanted to go for lunch so i went with a friend and brought our $9.99 pizza for dinner which was AMAZING. The service was super friendly and smooth. I ordered a few pieces and got the vegan fried chicken with brown sugar. I recommend them to everyone. I am surprised about the quality of the service at the worst restaurant in a town that still has high teen smoking age restrictions. Girlfriend came with her baby and we brought them to this place and for all the mistakes i took in thinking it was a good restaurant it definitely was NOT. The owner wanted to fix everything, he did not care that there was a raging madman in this place that wanted to try and kill me by driving with our baby in front of us. he i dont think i was even suppose to like this place at all, i was just saying nice word for the past three years. 
This place is great. I have
restaurant and library. I actually had the Latin cafe the other day. My husband and I wanted to order the wine for dinner. He really loved the wine and  we had the liberty to bring over a wineglass to carry it over to our table.  We ordered the solid red sea bass platter. Very appetizing and juicy.The rueful look on his face was wonderful. He seems to be standing at the door and enjoying the guests and staff. He asked if I'd like to come and see him again for some extra fee.  What a great experience and one I can't stop doing.
4 stars 4 stars 1 star Rating : 1 All reviews are generally wrong but I can hear someone say "I was going to say no" every time I go in there... I don't think anyone else would say "no" and I understand it's a problem for a place such as this and the good stuff, but they tend to think of it as being
restaurant are other things you may have missed. The food is fresh and delicious. Please give them a try! And remember, these are only 4 restaurants.   If you want lots of different dining options, we recommend checking Out Black Beer. (We always go out with our veggie rolls - it's an absolute must-have for us!)
First time went here! Made me hooked and I am craving this place again!! I mean, come on, this place's been going on since it first opened so many years ago.  It has been a long time since I ate here and the staff is always there to help, it seems.
The experience is worth it! I like The Green Jewel but this is my first time coming in here.The bread the items are amazing. We only had beer a couple times. The green lechon table with cheese was amazing and gave us great salads and beers. Every dish is worth the small fee, it is worth the
restaurant. We bought two extra beers from them for the anniversary party that we also attended and are spending right now that it didn't cost us.  Everyone is super enthusiastic and upbeat. 
I used to be a big fan of the Catch-22 situation. We saw all the times when the dog was getting tired of drinking all day, then it would start to show up. I've witnessed it happen here on a lot of occasions.  It's usually not one that we see the (-obviously) call of the franchise.  There's a lot of run-ins with staff, and if you've been in this town for a long time, there's always something you don't like.It's completely different in Chicago, but everyone is pretty familiar with how fast things can get.  We've had good trips to the chef's house a few times, but not to any of the places we're going there for reasons or just because they are bigger. 
restaurant.   My favorite was the dog w/cakes (found here), I felt like they were right in the heart of Gold Coast.  They've also taken more mainstream Mexican food and some of the stuff in their customer's car (you could try burritos) rather than all the traditional Mexican fare.  The other portion for my husband was huge.   That can make for good food but I was to die for.  Well, I did eat a slice and I really enjoyed it.  The bun was perfectly smothered in chips with mustard-y sauce.  I wouldn't recommend it though.  If you don't like bean sprouts, you will probably want to get your chocolate chip cookie.   The potato dip was a nice touch too.  I loved their butterpie icing, the smoked salmon and watermelon pancakes that were tender and delicious.  Overall, I'm looking forward to trying more Mexican food, but this place was well worth
restaurant and sushi bar, and the service wasn't out of the ordinary, but still delicious. Everything was actually prepared well, and the menu was even matched with the cuisine. Even though it was cooked here, their meat took very little seasoning. It was a fun look, and definitely had a deep dish of unique and wonderful flavors. My family and I love this place, and their fish were a little overcooked... they thought it was ok, but it was all overcooked and just...  I have to say I didn't notice the mixed drinks which it was hard to take. I did take the receipt, which said it came from 7:00 pm on Friday morning, so I didn't really mind taking pictures there.I had to wait on a server who told me a couple of things.First of all, they are completely well served, because there was ample volume and color on their food. Second, there was one thing I didn't like, when I arrived,

restaurant items from the area, courtesy of the owners. I personally only had chicken fried rice and I thought it was excellent. I also ordered the Chinese special since that was their name. Great service, fun and fresh and affordable. What can you say - the menu is always small, but the booths are plenty large enough for specialty items like the guitar rack as well as the piece of wood. Definitely will order from here again!
I live in San Diego, and I had the opportunity to sit down with Mimi last week (Sunday, August 9, at 5:00 pm). After the meal, my wife and I took our tips on the restaurant. We shared that we were not overly impressed by the interior decor, but that there was no such thing. Our take-home recommended wine list comprised of several wines that were very well known to the wine industry. Unfortunately, while making reservations, we were told that we were banned from this establishment because we were perceived as having alcohol
restaurant even though the amount of $$ he is getting here is amazing. We usually don't order anywhere else.  At least when we come to visit we have our food.  I will never go back to this place again.
I made my reservation for the Vietnamese restaurant the other day. It was right outside our hotel. After waiting in line in line for 2 hours, we noticed our dining area was covered in trash. The owner, Maras Garcia Santos, was pushing his own staff to change their seating. All the manager could think about was what to do with the trash we had. When we asked if we would like to have the dish brought, he told us that he would take it home when we checked in. We all gave a huge pass when the time came. It was a great experience.
The previous reviewer was a great guy. The whole menu was amazing. I would not consider returning.

restaurant In Eastern NY). This is a great place for family special events or you can buy yourself a room that's usually full of super sausages or a set of pancakes, as well as a food carne asada, pan fried pickles, or bread pudding with the pineapple yolks and mussels they use here in the city. The mojitos!
Had an amazing dinner! The place is cool and gets a lot of love. If you don't like it, come here!
Maybe you should go here while you've been there. Salsa japenos and breadsticks are a great addition to the brie, quail, ravioli, and delm cheese. It's good but expensive!
The best taco place in town. Well, if I lived in the west side and I needed a pretty good lunch on a Saturday afternoon (you're welcome there) it would be the Biergarten.  For my tastebuds
restaurant on the house and sweet treats will be sold, with their fresh homemade music played and excellent bread as well. And don't forget to enjoy this lovely summer breakfast spot when you go! And, this restaurant will surely be a favorite!
I love seafood and I love every bite and detail! The restaurant is delicious and so good! I also love to grab food at the table. Enjoy!
We've been coming here a lot and we LOVE it here!   The service is great.  It is friendly and knowledgeable.  And it has a number of menu items!  The Mac and Cheese is some of my favorite items and I really enjoy her Crab Bay pasta!  You can make it yourself or pay a bit for it (which you really should).  It has a Chicken Bourjos salad, Vegetarian fried chicken, and a Yogurt chip salad!
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!!!!!   Wish I did 5 stars when I
restaurant there. Service was superb, even though we started out with a vegetarian salad and that still took some explaining, but the food was outstanding, and my friend was able to chose any food she liked and the wine selection was impressive too! We were also impressed with all the creative and creative restaurants in the Bay Area, at least in my experience. We wanted to try something different here, and to take a different angle when we decided to try the Portland Chinese Cafe (Hush's). We ordered dessert (apple pecan cake) and had an assortment of smothered items. Needless to say, it was a delicious dinner.
Went to Burbank and learned from the sushi lady that they have 100% potato only and fried rice. What an incredible experience.  It was absolutely packed.  Check the chef out to see what he is doing!  You will not be disappointed!
As is often the case, this is my favorite diner in the city. Service was
restaurant: Fresh and delicious chicken, seafood, sausage and avocados.

My favorite restaurant. All the ingredients are good and I love the greasy crust. It's such a crowded restaurant, but I LOVE the wait. You have to pay for food.
This place is great. I can honestly say that the breakfast is my favorite, but I don't go into it trying to impress the girl who came with me.  She brought a basket of eggs and was just okay with that.  I think we went there when we were busing home, but it is still a great option if you're craving for a day off with your girlfriend, always coming back for lunch.
hi, i ordered some great coffee and their server made a special cake for me. i had the chocolate sunda and this was it! the counter  I'd say was kinda down but i'm really glad for this place. :) Great stuff and wonderful service.
On a whim
restaurant?  Thanks again for sharing the story.  Just to hit two additional points, the wait staff was good.  It was a long time waiting for everyone to arrive, and then I was seated outside.  They are ok for work, but about a half-hour later you're inside and by 5.30pm they're outside.  The reason I'm feeling so bad is the decor.  The waitresses and waitresses, who seem to get along as well, made me feel that I was interrupting their lives, or their family, or just giving them rude help.  My last 4 glasses of beer were mediocre and they seem to have a flavor on them that is completely off the beaten path.  Maybe people would come around and say hi?  Maybe.  We lived in Portland for 4 years, and it was a nice little stop for those of us who were new to Portland, but are not professionals in the business.  I really don't
restaurant is surprising, but not over priced. There's a knowledgeable staff who cooks everything from gingerbread desserts to peaches and crust. Every dish is beautiful and unique in style, and the best part is that there's a cash register available, so don't be rushed to fill it up.
Not sure what's special about this place, that's me. It's expensive though, and it doesn't disappoint.  I hate that the sushi bar on the main floor isn't crowded, but they have that great sushi in the back patio that is tasty. We're really disappointed if we've been here before, but they never seem to acknowledge us.  I got the pizza from last Tuesday night.  If you're into Giordano's and reading, check this place out.
Yum! I've read nearly everything here, and I'll probably make the Top Chef super try out again soon.  I was craving a different part of my flight on this trip.
restaurant). But it wasn't because the menu's kind and beautiful; it was simply the two or three items our waitress took. The most memorable aspect was that the atmosphere was friendly and the food had a smooth, yummy finish.As for the service: Alura wasn't bad at all. She was so eager that one of her waiting tables ordered a bottle of wine, and the other waitress proceeded to order the small-sized of rice and noodles. The sides of the dishes were not very generous, although the vegan wings were well served, and the dessert was not particularly tasty, but more of a simple, healthy, tasty dessert. Maybe they would even let Alura refill their drinks?Perhaps she was feeling some sort of fluke of bad mood, but other than that, she was an American. Which of course is why Alura was having such a great time.I could probably have had other reviews for her, but I figured it would only be for next time.
restaurant.
My husband and I had a little over a dozen different food options which will be different from the rest of the house.  Some of the best I've had.  I had potato flan that was particularly special and tasted so good.  The chicken and vegetables I tried all were absolutely amazing.  Their shrimp was very tender, and they also have a delicious deep dish that is highly filling.  The whole experience was amazing.  Just saying.
I have to say that this place is absolutely gorgeous.  If you are looking for a place to get some South Korean fried sirloin, this place could be a destination for you.  However, if you have children and are not a fan of fried foods, this isn't a place you should try.  You are far too long left at this place to sit in.  And even then, it was hard to go again because they have so many wonderful options and simply don't sell as good.
restaurant by King William the Lion, which was a giant letdown for me. Too many vegan entrees with good quality ingredients and very expensive prices. Our server was the jenkins and Graham Elliot, and if I had to guess, he would tell us that he thought maybe we would enjoy a beer but then actually paid $20 more, and the bartender kept telling us that our plates weren't supposed to be this good. Most importantly, a completely packed bar, and its lengthy for the entrees we ordered and a couple of beers made in hock.
Okay, this is the place I would rank in my overall review: on culinary and drinkery. The food is inventive and the atmosphere that they have just super weird and unique but great. The service is great, the place is friendly and the prices are high. You can buy drinks in the lounge area, table at the bar, a few right next to each other, and have their appetizer or pretzel when
restaurant Lorne was great. The service was attentive and always there to serve you along with the food. The outdoor patio was tasteful.    Please don't leave empty handed - the bar will always be a hit.
Very very cheap sushi! Hot curds were good. Would go again later in the day. Service was not terrible.
Quick late dinner (probably overpriced) and great experience. Beef broth on the side should be tasty. Pizza also great.
Really interesting place to eat! Everything I've eaten here is awesome. What is more popular than that? There's always a catch as to which one's been the better. They use applesauce and they're off par with my other favs!
just tasted great with chicken wings and we're back to try more!   I definitely recommend having a chicken parm enchiladas on the side.  Also, the place I went for the party was a Mexican place but everyone

Simply AVAILABLE! If there is an excellent dining experience, I am delighted to be serving you my breakfast food! Great air conditioning, big tables, massive fresh produce space, great ambiance, impeccable food and outdoor seating options. My favorite place to eat at is my former office, the only drawback is that its open only on weekends and is very noisy when you are coming in. Otherwise, the food selection is spectacular and highly sought after for such an excellent casual experience.
I do not recommend this place.  I mean seriously, please make the chili pickles.  My cousin won't recommend it.  I just know that if the price was about $16 and I ordered the sandwiches at $8 each, she would not recommend it...the grilled tofu and the guacamole were not appetizers!  My roommate and I live next to this place, he loves it, but he doesn't like to spend money on it.  We
restaurant in the best fashion and to be honest, I'm not really used to that but the meal was definitely delicious!
Pizza was excellent! I had a pre-emptive cut of beef pizza and it was stuffed with cheese. It came out perfect - the bread crust, the sliced tomatoes were tender and fresh. The bar was great. I had a napkin of orange juice in the salad bar, but was immediately swept off by the lemon juice, added to the wine. There were the impressive performances of Jon Cooper and Eric Avellanstead. They were so friendly, and I will be back
Definitely like your place!!!  The portions are huge and we have had some good selections - including our pasta dip - that came on a scone which you got for $25-50 per person.  If you're in the mood for pizza, these are good choices!If you're not into gluten, waffles, mozzarella, chocolate bars and hor
restaurant. We had several items in the salad bar section and all had excellent service.  The bbq buffet includes drinks (also extra), salad, appetizer, appetizer.  We were especially impressed with a selection of homemade sausage so we could have a bite, give us the options we wanted and move on.  Everyone was very attentive to the service, which made our meal really enjoyable.It's a walk in the park with a relaxing view.
Love, LOVE LOVE... Everyone there is amazing. I just received my first Indian food order and I ordered the mangoes, the spinach salad and the Lamb and Broccoli Spaghetti Burger. I had more than enough and we left impressed.  The tuna burger is so good I could not wait to eat it again!
I have lived here for years and love everything about it. The BBQ Chicken (or Pork Chop of choice) is like a good burrito with cornbread wrapped around it and the ingredients are amazing
restaurant. I like that it's open year-round, especially since there is always a smaller crowd when there are only 4 people. I'm not sure I ever want to be that guy who takes me out on the weekends, which is a lot to ask. You'd be more likely to see him with a cute child on the couch to make up for what he's got when you come out on the patio. But because my husband and I walked to some other spots that have lots of seating, we never felt like we were complaining. No ridiculous event planned on entering or leaving before our group arrived. The breakfast sandwich was light to medium-weigh. Oh, and the guacamole was in a straight line and they had great price. Seriously, check out the portions if you want the light food. Definitely recommend anyone who is afraid of going to a favorite restaurant or bars, but who enjoys the extra time spent on the patio, or the spectacular food.
Just
restaurant up here. The bacon-wrapped fries and the egg yolk-zucchini steak, the fresh duck bacon, and the homemade caramelised onion rings are all special treats.
Evan Capri, my friend and I stumbled across El Terrible while at the newspaper, and we went there and there really was no hype at all. But that was the shock. This place is in a disaster.  It had a FANTASTIC bad service and really wasn't worth stopping.  Now they return the next month, which was the worst they have ever had and they should be done.  I am going back soon.
This is all it takes to get a bad review here.  There are so many of them on my list, my friends and I get their stuff on a Tuesday, and the wait can be a bit long.  However, I have already tried a couple other places and got nowhere in between.  I will probably be coming back.
restaurant of choice on RTE, at a cost of one single meal per person, and a lunch reservation fee of $2.95! What kind of catering can you go in for when you could find a child table, with kids and other special needs of you?
I love the locations and the food and if your not on my list, you might not be able to find a home there. They make both reservations and take reservations to the following table:

Ristorante Place - 712 Gold Coast South and Green by Horacio.  Awesome service and unpretentious ambience for a nice night out. Best tortilla place in the city.
Great place to take a group of friends to! Our dining group is thrilled with the atmosphere and music. All of our guests rave about the dishes in the dishes! I enjoy waiting tables as well!
Absolutely love this place and they deserve their to go!  Its even more crowded when the place is
restaurant: La Barreleto Vieja is the best!! Arguably the most expensive sushi in the city and by far the best Brazilian sushi I've ever tasted. By far the best Vietnamese sushi I've ever eaten in Colorado Springs. Overpriced, over tender, over-ish. The customer service was superb, the food was consistently good, but the food itself never arrived prepared properly and right to the dish. When I ordered from Del Potro, my meat was held in wait for us for hours.  Even by the standards of the establishment, what a joke the food was cooked over and over in spaghetti sauce. They may have had the best goat cheese ever made, but I'm glad they brought it back because it is used in everything from our chicken salad to everything in your life. I've already gone back twice, both times for different types of local stuff...really special pieces that are the best thing about Chicago.


This place is truly awesome, the
restaurant is delicious! And the best part is how great it is!  If you are looking for the traditional maki-soba diet you may have problems, but this one is good for you.  Simply go to Edgewater right away and order a plate of Kobe beef and toss it over and enjoy the 3 courses.  We recommended this to cook at home - I had the pan fried white rice.  When you get home, go back to the airport for another time.  A must!We tried the beignets - YUM!  If you're craving fish for dinner (I recommend the full variety of the beignets), you will not find much, if any, difference between the beignets at Edgewater.  The rich and meaty flavors of the seared beignets are particularly appeal.
Yummy place with great service!! A couple weeks ago when we went out on a date at Chicago Steakhouse, we went with a
restaurant and server are extremely knowledgeable and knowledgeable.  This restaurant is one of the top in the city and one of the best in the region!  We were just served on Thursday, and we had our bread sandwich.  The parking area is perfect and always packed.  Every time we are served drinks we always love them!
I went here for my birthday a few years ago and was surprised to find the place absolutely full and attentive.  The food was fantastic, the service was great, and all of the place was stocked up on food.  The service is always good, and a lot of servers on any given day have been there for almost 2 years.  All of my friends that went to Greenblatt have never had a bad experience there.
Never miss my jamper party....It's great!  They have huge portions, salads, soups, desserts and even pizzas.  I'll definitely come back for more!!

Oscar Wilde will forever be remembered as the European/American's most famous song. Despite some crappy reviews from online reviewers, let's face it, Oscar Wilde was still singing the song on his balcony at the time of his death from a heart attack just months after it was first given out. What an amazing song, but it was extremely slow to get into with just as many hands and as much energy as the actual song.The chorus, "The Roses". is very romantic - it's as if it was written by someone running for President.I don't understand why the lyrics of this song are needed, it's obvious as it is that you should always find yourself singing at the end of your overall run for the White House. The individual who sang "The Roses" took the'real' wine list and paid a special attention to the entire menu. Each part of the speech that was put out was loaded with unique, artistic and personal touches. The whole thing is
restaurant may be the best i've had in Chicago, especially the fancy things that go with it. The food was excellent, but the staff was great, their little rice and beans were delicious. Highly recommend them if you are looking for Italian food.The parking lot is a little big for a place you don't mind a lot of parking lots in the shopping area.<|endoftext|>
restaurant: Milkshake (I can't recall the name)
Tastes like me: a musky bisque pastry dough with toasted chocolate rice to tingle my nerves like a perfect vanilla ice cream--simplistic steaks, delicious meats...and cleverly placed egg dishes on top. A great jazz-nerd atmosphere. Everything is nicely served here and beyond what anyone could've anticipated. Now that there's a meat bar, this place would be on the tip of the buck.The line makes sure there's plenty of time for a nice meal.
Sometimes I like to go deep fried and their burgers are too pretty, but the place is so darn great I only ate one last time to celebrate the occasion. My boyfriend and I were driving around of the mojito bowl yesterday at 6:30. We did not pick up on the exceptional taste of it before we left. It was nearly 30 degrees by the time we left. The vegetable pizza arrived
restaurant!The dinner was excellent and good quality.  We would highly recommend it to any chef.  The best service was that of many, many great appetizers as you enjoy great fried shrimp and another little joint.
I love restaurants that take the trendy to heart.The food is always good!   But the fries and desserts are absolutely exceptional.   Not only that, but they add variety to the menu and the prices have always been low.  I am never disappointed.
Best Hot Dog ever!  This place is still impressive and high above any other restaurant in Lincoln Park!
Solid food and plenty of room for extra. Had a table for 5 people and a beer and now I can't wait to try it!!
This place is some kind of hospital somewhere. A really good place to check out. The juice bar is huge. Great place for dessert (can do faves and everyone wants one)  The meat was mediocre. The portions are
restaurant, night ambiance, and outstanding service.
I love my wife and her tastes. After coming here for our wedding dinner we sat out the 9-5 for nearly an hour trying to figure out what else we could get.  We had two sets and ended up in a over sized table.  Our server took a weird smile on his face and kept it off.  Our waitress's patience and knowledge of our needs was excellent.  We would still leave most of the  drinks a little short, but the salad bar was awesome.  We had eggs, fries and a whole bunch of other food that wasn't quite what we had hoped to get.  The wait staff was friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.  It is in the neighborhood of what we have enjoyed at Opal's, but if we had to choose just one of their specialty bars in Hialeah County, this would be the one.
I had been a fan of the Cherry jerkie since its
restaurant dishes are always expensive. Even so, if you want to have dinner better than Gino's Gino's it is definitely worth going there.
Love the cafe and the open seating is great! Love love love the whiskey! Easy service and our waitress is friendly as always. Go early!
Spicy BBQ pizzas, all around great - there is not much the east coast pizzeria has not been to. The meatballs are gorgeous and the crust is amazing - you have to bring a salad so that the meatballs are fresh.Our server is fantastic and knows how to make a dish great for all those that like it or just want something a little different!Good place to bring a date.
Joliet Salmon Steak is a great option for date nights, Thursday/Friday Night or brunch.
This place is nice. Friendly, high quality sausage. Wonderful scallops!

We arrived at 9pm on Sunday 11/11 for dinner. Within 2 hours (ish) we had no business in our restaurant. The food was excellent, the wine list is on a tiny little website. and the staff is in a mad mood. After being there for 4 or 5 hours I went back and  saw the establishment changed. When I tried out the fish choices there weren't much. There were alot of fish in the entire meal. Two things about this restaurant: the owner is mad (lots of broken ribs). The customer is in disbelief that they can't make a fish pan fry with one pan and the waitress is clueless about their problems. At the end of the meal the waiter told us that everything was amazing. If we didn't give 5 stars to this restaurant, but one star to the fish brand, i would not recommend them again. They just don't make fish, that's all.  I would just take up
restaurant was nothing like the low-key metropolis you see in dining houses. Just where else could I find something more intimate than a table?
For the years, this place has been better than anything else on Tifo Chicago. Service is quick and smooth, particularly during the hot summer months.  The servers are friendly and attentive.  The food here is a happy medium between juicy and bland.  As with most amazing dining places on Tifo Chicago, it's not everyone's favorite, but you can usually't go wrong.  Just check with your table and always let them know they're not just fried.
This is one of the best places in the city.  Service is consistent and warm.  Not everything is fresh, but the food is always great and fresh.  Please bring as much as you wish for brunch, lunch and dinner.  I think everyone should try this place.
I'm a huge sucker for the Food+Service..this
restaurant.
It was good. We ate our beer at the bar with friends. I'd only come here once.I cannot express how much I wish I could go back.I wish we did more frequent if it means we could have a more relaxing dining experience.  This restaurant is on a busy Saturday night for sure.
For lovers of the old fashioned German Fries there are some great foods to try here. I went for a night out with friends on my aunt's place and they liked it.The sounds of the music and the people were good. Only 5 stars.
The focus for all the customers is on the service. Everything we eat, drink, and order has excellent service. The daily specials are packed with a great flavor that is often forgotten in Chicago. They really bring the best in Italy and here are some of the favorites. Our party came in 3rd Class after about 1 hour and three servings of free breadcrumbs, cheese and cooked potatoes.
restaurant, fire-grilled ravioli, smoked salmon, and salted potatoes. You should've taken yourself seriously here.I also recommend that you walk out the door to eat/go somewhere else if you want something new, drink/delish, etc. In addition, there are more movies going on at the Mercantile Room (35mm, a la Green Day's Treasure Island) than at any of the other places on the map. If you have the time to catch a bus to wherever you live, visit the Mercantile Room. Then come back there whenever the tourist turns up and watch the commercials for Jack (and my favorite place to catch a bite).  Be prepared to write that post on your Yelp.
Taste is awful! They're pretty good, the food is okay, and they're vegetarian but the hype is wrong (a bit high) and to mix all this up, I'm just one of those people that just eats everything but
restaurant. And that's just one of many reasons we are open-minded to serving their guests in new and intimate venues. We've expanded our ambiance to all our areas so you will feel safer when you take one of our rooms to get a meal. Not so on Second City.
1. Pork. A chili fondue-like style -ish red potatoes with crispy onions, fresh lime zest - both are one of our favorite flavors. This is usually a great alternative to anything salty, so we have one of those dishes in our menu. Simply fine, too!
Raspberry Sushi is delicious. Not many as here, but the prices are reasonable - probably worth it. This is another sushi place that you have to bring along on a regular basis. The French toast is incredible as well - always serving delicious food.
Really loves this place! The staff is very friendly, and the food is top notch. They have taken some of the nicest people I
restaurant(s) at pretty much every restaurant.   However,  they've had the best Chinese cuisine ever and once again,  the staff has been amazing.  We're really loving the atmosphere of the bar and the cocktails we've been given.  It's definitely a great place to go if you're a fan of deep dish and delicacy.  My first mistake was ordering the John pickle sandwich as i was nervous but it was delicious and very good.  Also, their Rice Krispies are a bit cold.  The service is great.  Go ahead and come to one of their sushi places. I'm a big fan of American sushi so I'd love to go there and try everything that is on the menu.
I've enjoyed both the mini and large size treats.  Everything else was about the same.  Our favorite was the the red cake.  The tofu sandwich was more than delicious.  The roasted tofu was better than any other
restaurant style) - quick service and no wait. - pictures here above from a near miss (they give out white tables with an orange hoe...so it was perfect to see them at). - if you were a restaurant owner or customer just make sure your staff needs some cleaning. - alot of food is hidden in they know their identity.  Personally, my poor riddle will not be solved by any modernist cooking alchemist with a mallet because the recipe is still wrong.  The spices on the red cheese....like this cheese with potato wedges...even though you are making them as basic as possible, it still smells good...go ahead and give it a try.
Bemro's was a fabulous chain of what could be a very affordable dine-in experience at the California Estates.  The food was flavorful, bold, and extremely fresh.  The owner came and seated the all-star pairing - he was very the kind of chef you're
restaurant. With our unique white roast steak (the steak was cold, and as if we had told someone, not nearly cold enough for us) we knew that our waiter was going to bring us something completely different in flavor. We opted for this salad to end up with the sort of consistency we have always enjoyed, the tartness added to the service and all of that, perfect. Our vietnamese curry (albeit w/chicken chutney, so serve it  again). the mint chutney is made with finely chopped chives and I personally love it very much - it's a bit of an orange color...and still, you get to taste it too - I will definitely be coming back for more!
I think their are very good lunch options.
Not sure if their Chiladones is the best... but the chips are good and pretty.
Very good food. The tempura and pizza are awesome too. Everything is good as well. This
restaurant for us at Shaw's Sunday night! The food was excellent.  We also had a friend who was missing his arm.
Good to go again today as they do such a good job putting people in the place they like to be and the tables are comfy.
I'm a big fan of Frontera and Alinea but get my regular bus fare here about $12-15 to get there in the afternoon. The food was good and they have authentic Mexican items at 2 different locations. Their most popular items are hispanos which is perfect for being super Mexican. The menu takes up lots of space and quality and they call some of the dishes they have come to like a lasagna. Highly recommended!
I've been here twice today and this past Saturday.  I've been just fine.  Everyone that came is friendly and informative and the food is delicious. I'd recommend going out with the family to get one of the different tacos or salads, or
restaurant is something unique about town.  The pace is so fast, but you're so damn hip to the process of food pairing up and making sure you have everything.  The menu is so huge, so deep, so much of the time you won't be able to use your phone to talk.  The quality of the food comes from just doing everything you can to make it as good as possible and to make the experience good for everyone.  Even on a Saturday night, it can be overwhelming and then you just turn to the menu and go and order more things.  It's hard not to enjoy, but it's nice to know you got what you pay for.<|endoftext|>
restaurant market in Seattle, CA. They do make it safe to drink with real fish but it is not so expensive. I remember back in 2010 they had 4,000 deep dish and corn course. The thing that makes me sick is they offer a table each day with seared fish and a 30 man tasting room.  Their list is always under 30, but they get a giant table with corn potatoes on a cordial hand. I wish they had full coupons for this place.  Don't want any frills here?  I must say that in terms of quality the food is good.
As a second waiter mentioned, my wife and I LOVE BYOB.  The atmosphere is very relaxed and when we arrive on time we don't have to deal with any noise.  We recommend going outside to enjoy the wait!
Went to Alinea on Friday and we received something delicious! It was the sherry made from fresh pistachio as we sat outside. This
restaurant. More than anything, the pastries are really tasty, the service is friendly and the atmosphere is fun. The server lives in an apartment across the street so it's really an awesome hangout to hang out with friends and the food is incredible!The weather was awful and we had to wait around 20 mins for food and parking.
Great food, all the usual positives...great dishes for as many as 12 people to get drunk and fight off at the table. I dont need to go back here, it's the best food I have ever had.
We have had delicious meal suggestions.  The best  part is, you don't have to order until it's cold.  As a family owned restaurant I would recommend going in early to avoid waiting in line for too long.  I highly recommend doing that first, but if you're afraid the wait will put you out of your ass, you can always get your order here and wait until it's closer to
restaurant. It was BYOB, and the diners were pleased. If you like "real fried chicken and sushi" then this place is a must get for you. The staff was friendly, friendly and there were numerous options to choose from. The woman who runs the restaurant thinks that's a nice lady; this place makes an excellent accompaniment to steak. It was also not a great walk away when we arrived.
Top Chef's list...in line with the trend for a top culinary restaurant. Overly expensive food, unnecessary service and poor management make this a shithole in the mid east, but it serves to suggest the corner on a busy street. Quality ingredients don't stand in the way. Always pay an eye to fresh fruit, with an omelette-shrimp soup for more than $30. My best friend wanted a red wine while he waited for his waiter. I've been dining here for a couple months and have decided to move. Atmosphere,
restaurant, start visiting pretty fast and cut prices so they stay affordable.When you don't feel comfortable with the food I recommend trying the pizza but there are a lot of little components you can get yourself in with, like the chocolate truffle braised in peanut butter, I think that's the best option I have had in much of the Chicago area and anything above that should be fine with you.
As a child who grew up on meat I could not believe how good I was going to eat. I remember that the first time my parents came to Chicago for the wedding I thought they would give me $20/person and that their food was great (can't wait to be old school) and I always felt like they were preparing me a safe pass and saved me from something that might have gone horribly wrong.  However, after a while, my godmother told me that if my husband ever went for the last minute I would walk by where she was making the selections - think
restaurant in Canton that also serves alcoholic beverages and dinner.  I have lived and worked in North Central for 17 years.  I'd say their food is good but very expensive.  I have had like a dozen shows at Sabino's in the early 90's for some reason and I cant really speak for one evening when that place closed.  Let's face it, they have excellent food and prices.  Come on!They keep hitting them up.  Go. 
The place has a great ambience that fits the dining options.  It's a little busy when I have dinner going so we can come back and watch shows.The service was great.  The falafel was very clean and well prepared.  The size of the bowl of peas we had was incredibly important to us as were the sauces and my sons were expecting their birthday.  The waitstaff was very helpful.  I did like to get my food prepped so I would be eating
restaurant: The half-dozen cut and twill dishes we ate were outstanding. During the lunch hour, I could have easily eaten more. The options are always free -- we both got to enjoy the options, both on the menu. The salad bar is very large and available to sit just as a serving. The table is very private and the foodie vibe is always there. Highly recommended.
Too hot.
I've had a lot of options. Theyve never treated me well. My brother was rude and treated me like he was already fed. He kept asking me what I needed to do instead of telling me he would try it next time we were in town. Now I'm loving their new maki parfait and their star sauce!
Definitely worth the wait! I have been eating here since 2011 and I've been extremely pleased with my experience.  Please follow the directions or leave if you cannot make it to work without getting a proper beer order. 
restaurant), and it's pretty popular for folks out there (as you probably already have to make reservations) when you get the usual fare. Try both bars. Lots of different varieties of coffee. Lava cup to dine for your own entree. Which probably makes you look like this in late November...we still have winter. The chef might change the dish, but not sure how to plan on when we get there. Also, we still have crappy ambience, so make sure you check out both of the restaurants. There's often no place to go. However, you can watch them over on Youtube for shows!
At the end of the day, my wife was going to be disappointed at what my wonderful, pretty little daughter would have to go through. I heard from a friend of mine about an elaborate pet tour, a place that had only been around for a few weeks, and the owner was very well known, although the staff was awesome. That would be no
restaurant and enviroment. By the looks of it, it could be reasonably priced but not that expensive. the service was better than I would have expected (hopefully) and was to blame for my grandmother's pick.
Halloween is worth it, there are kids there and a patio in the back! They have a run of good wine. It gets colder every time.The kid's pizzas are very tasty.The atmosphere is great and the atmosphere is good. The service is great as well.
Great small town cafe with some good people. The price is reasonable... 1 star.
I went here today for a long dinner and enjoyed this place very much.  I guess, the staff is knowledgeable but quite busy.  I would have appreciated as much as I would have been able to with the wine service.  I thought it was an establishment about five dollars and I'm not one to desert.  As it was, there were quite a few outside
restaurant to this story.  The meat tasted great and would have been good for a family night out or brunch.  Again, I will be back.
This is one of the best taco places in Chicago!!!  I have been to Chipotle many times.  This place is definitely worth the tourist money.  The hot dog is good but not for the $$ (and tasteless chicken and some sort of garbage).  I thought there were better places like Pico Para nearby but the food isn't cheap, the service isnt all that good, and the service is rude!
Another area I went for dinner was the Diamond Bar.  The original owners created it in honor of Eagle Day.  They were a nice and accommodating group and there were other tables that looked like they were going to pop up and they were packed.  After dinner they went out of their way to help us out and they weren't really that helpful or helpful to us at all. 
restaurant. They get kind of busy after a long day at a restaurant and so doesn't want to drag us to line up as often. If you come with a group of 7 and ask for large groups of people who have money on your credit card, this will not work. We had 2 orders with such a large group and everyone shared the large group of people. It's not that loud at the BDC, it's the same name with similar names.  We ordered some Pies, we each ordered 2 Pies for $9 each, which is around $5 over their past $7.5 on sale. The menu included appetizers, potato pancakes, fries and soda.   We also ordered the Porridge & Julienno Crisp and enjoyed it.  We also ordered 4 Eggs with such an average rating as to indicate good taste.  It was the oysters the butter crust had the best eggs I've ever eaten.  The portions were HUGE
restaurant : Sat'noodles  : fried rice,flurries on large plates : 2 medium croquettes,masaka,price : almost 19.00 each of which was an extra as well as the soup and I know it was a 2.75 min. Service I was not impressed with. On that day I went with a group of 3 people and came in between 20 and 30. Most of the meats were on the side-to-side. One of the groups was an absolutely horrible mess and no one actually took care of this. The other 9 people were in their 50's and we found ourselves seated at the end of the table. As we exited the room it was visibly loud but still. We heard a wave of laughter and ordered my coke which had whipped into a bowl. Everything else was horrible, i believe. I tried the hummus that was made with wheat rice, cubed shrimp, an olive oil and mixed fried rice, fish
restaurant, private lesson with all the great desserts, and a drinks menu on the menu to celebrate! The cafe is quite interesting and packed...the place is absolutely packed with foodie staff. The owner is a nice man who usually gets the realties, but makes sure the bartender makes sure the cookies are great.The place does seem to get crowded on weekends...sometimes it gets a bit crowded on Saturdays, which doesn't mean it can't work and the staff can help make sure things are ok.Unfortunately, the brewpub isn't as busy as the other bars in the neighborhood...all of the ice cold beer specials are pricey (and a little bit expensive), so it might take a while to catch up.
I love the waitstaff. My husband loves to make party food, I love the opportunity to get a refill at the bar.  Not even a wall of cheese and pizza would have made this review palatable for me.  I'll come back soon and make
restaurant and wine selection, especially for the low prices.  They are a long line and are extremely happy with their service, but they are a few miles away from Sertap and the guy who serves the beer drinks was my only co-worker.  While others were friendly and helpful, he did not understand why some people were having problems and ate the wrong thing.  I would do it again.
The menu is generally pretty good and the food is unique and tasty. I would not recommend the Vereen Bar.  There is a location in Bayview to place any reservations.  The Service is very bad, but the price is not bad either.  Bring your own drink by adding $30 on-site for 30 minutes. The raves. They aren't a busy place for a 5-11 restaurant, but they would spend way more on brunch, family dinner and brunch too.
i will always go back in my kitchen. absolutely LOVED this
restaurant
After a long day, my mam would accept me for any reservation they wanted. We had 3 servers and no wait. I had the valet which is nice and inexpensive. The plates were delivered in an hour and my dinner was slightly missing. You can see from this feast on the calendar that staff doesn't get time to do very many things on their own. We had quite a number of drinks on the list and dinner wasn't nearly as big as it could have been. You can order half of each (We had three) but they don't allow eating six. So that was more than enough to give us hope that we would return. And while they can say that we will return the next day, I found them to be very accommodating. They are always busy, but the food is great. It came with the steak side. They have specials and it really could have been our second slice. But really its the cheesecake!! So great!!There were two
restaurant does not make up for it, there is no right or wrong with it. Food is delicious and people at the table understand it's always in the menu. When I return I am greeted by a very sweet and welcoming waitress. She actually gets me what I am looking forward to eating so it makes me want to hurry down there!
I ordered a pumpkin pie because I had not gone to CTA before and didn't want to mess with the drink selection. My boyfriend and I were seated quickly after the appetizers were started, and there was nothing on the menu that was in the food. We were told by the waiters not to ask too many questions, but to move fast. Upon beginning our meal, the waitress delivered the food to us right away and promptly stood our table. The waitress threw all the food from one side of our table, which seemed odd considering that the food was average and made up for the side dishes we ordered. To this day, I have
restaurant. In addition to the pure delight of Mexican food it's a true destination for new Mexican restaurants. We enjoy every aspect of being part of a community with a great community involved.
I went to Santa Clarita College recently and there is something in the air about how the taste of the food and the atmosphere is going to look so great once it's there. This place hits the spot, well below Mexican food standards. Of course Mexican food should be available everywhere in the city. But even better than steakhouse or ceviche, not Texas and not any other place. I've experienced the biggest change in my life: I'm no longer here after a 30 day wait. I am so exhausted from the experience (I wish I would be). I have the most amazing meal I've had here in the past 10 years. You can't beat it! I still eat almost every meal, but I'm getting hungry all the time. The service has been great and the atmosphere
restaurant and travel bookers for the bill! You get plenty of advice from the person to be served!
I was very hungry!  Just called to ask if we could come for dinner and a great service.  Our server gave us a call to pay $2 for breakfast.  We had a wonderful breakfast and was very disappointed by it all.  But our server kept on looking at us to see how much of the food we wanted and that for something he could charge for it.  After about two hours of eating for $6 an hour, we managed to put the last $6 in all and had the meal delivered to our door by 10:30PM.  The sandwiches were very good.  They had a really nice plantain tortilla and a huge variety of different fruit and vegetables on the side.  I did a 30 minute salad here and you could eat the entire meal at once!  I would not recommend this place to a person that likes goat cheese
restaurant/bar/group/dinner at many different locations for each menu, different appetizers and salads with each eating order. We enjoyed dining with some of the guest, including our waiter and server.The prices of the breakfast and dinner items are extremely reasonable and reasonable. This restaurant was slightly jammed from mid-day through mid-night which made it a much safer dining destination. When entering the restaurant, we made reservations, with the waiter always waiting at the counter, when some of the tables were full, and even when the restaurant was on the back.It was very disappointing when we discovered that in addition to the unlimited dinner menu, they had prepared beer specials and enchiladas (beer only).There was a long line when we finally got our reservations and all prices were normal. The waitress assured us that everyone was okay, and then told us that we would go pay the check. The whole thing never came back. Had the reservation, we were immediately removed from the
restaurant. On first glance, their menu looks pretty decent - maybe it's been years but it still has the side dishes and I've been craving it. I'll be back, especially if I'm looking for a new place. As for the regular food selections, it has the same staples for everyone - everything from sausages to fried shrimp to blue cheese salsa. I like the garden salad and al pastor burritos, but you can get a regular or one of their 6x8's for $25, but the selection has been a bit tight on the meats so I think you'll just have to keep checking back for change. To top things off, they also have an awesome pub menu with options ranging from barbecue to great Mexican beers. Since they are closed all year round, it's worth checking in daily as it's a relaxing place.
THE BEST SINGLE BELL EVER! Great chocolate vielets, better dine in than the chocolate coma of fast
restaurant.  Also came with breakfast noodle soup.  They also brought some apple cider. I liked the date with the date tip and they all had mochi to takin everything in.  The place was nice and spacious and made a nice atmosphere.Overall, our trip was fantastic.  Will definitely be back again!
The food was delicious.  I really enjoyed the duck soup this past week.  It came with a fairly large corn tortilla (very good).  It was more than enough meat.  I love that the eggs were flavored a bit less spicy than normal.  Maybe it's because the server had to also say it was for an English cupcake.  The parmigiana was decent and not too sour, but I would give it 5 stars.
Puts me off rock bottom!  I always get an ounce of wine at 9, and good as I get my 5 star Wine Advocate rating.  I've tried numerous N
restaurant.For starters, they have the beet salad and the mustard...the mustard was yummy. This was the last time we had a table that I had the tartan salad and it was so good. I did not like the jam because it lacked flavors and quality at the best of times. Everything was so over the top, top too, that it simply sat out of my head. This entree has a cool egg sandwich and is full of flavors but not much else. For more feedback on the hostessess' or other top notch chefs, the good news is that it is not currently a take out place and I am not in the mood to eat here. It is just about the best beet salad I have ever had!
Made me spend over $40 bucks for one seat...Wow!!! OMG. SO ONGOING the BEST, cheapest drinks (which is almost ridiculous)!! With my $60.00 check, they don't know how much money I'm
restaurant. The servers did a good job. The food was good, and the ambience was good too.
This is my first attempt at a turkey burrito from a Texasan restaurant.  Not as tasty and not as large as the one from Chicago.  Our waitress was really rude and didn't even try to wash the dishes before we ordered them.  We were taken aback when she brought up the word beans so the waiter told us that he was just going to slurp off the chips.  Of course there are other orders on the menu as well.  The chicken was great too.  There was also a piece of chicken but it was really ok.  The next time we will make reservations I will just leave it at home.  This place is good, but not great.
Top 10 Greenwich/White Fried Rice! Absolutely must go there, great sushi with beautiful sunsets in the evening and excellent seafood from abroad. Great seafood everything is great.
restaurant, at the same time. The overall experience was pretty nice and the staff seemed very welcoming.The only thing that was disappointing was that this place was both going to be a bit slow for some reason and I had a hard time finding it (1am).But when you go there, you will definitely come back.
I went to this dining place several times during my little vacation time. First I did receive a $7 bill on my birthday that had not been charged. Then one night I called it gotcha the girl there. Apparently, there was actually an extra $1 bill on the night I called the kitchen when I called. The lady at the front desk had to tell the girl what to charge.  When the waitress came down to tell me what was a nice trick, I think she just laughed.Not the type of girl that does not like pretentious food. "Aftard" this place, nothing. 3 stars? They started by telling me that
restaurant.

All dishes are delicious.  I can't say enough good things about their food!  I will be back and I am not looking for anything over $10.
Went to Livery by ferry this past Monday night, and the waitress ordered some food and ordered it was so much worse than I would have ever imagined. A HUGE disappointment. I was able to eat so much because I tried so many different veggies that they seemed like they were overcooked to my liking. I left my sandwich the other day, which didn't really matter. I'd recommend it to someone who is in doubt.This is one of those things that I would order on my own, but a lot of time you need a group where everyone is about to get out before your seat is empty.
I wanted to say thanks, but it seems like this was not the best place for a meal or two.  I lived down the street from this place, I was going to
restaurant.
I had the venison tacos and steak tacos. Both were excellent. One of my favorite things to do in LA. We will definitely go back!
I came here after the South Chicago Mercantile Alliance was held by no small fee at best. They didn't have a drink selection. My friend was dishevelled, but I wouldn't order anything else. The service was bad, too. I had the bacon fries stuffed with a leg of shiitake mushrooms. They were better than any other restaurant I have gone to. And, I cannot thank them enough. You have to add $40 or so and you will make your plate get full.I would have loved to have been able to choose a seafood salad. But instead they opted for hard boiled pig, instead of white and crispy shrimp. The crunchy meat was marinated in crab sauce, while the dry ingredients seemed to have disappeared by the time I ordered. My friend's fiance also
restaurant, lobster, truffle shell. They have a good variety of types of choices.  Service was usually horrible.The food was delicious, and there was always a good amount of soup and drink that was available.  You had to try several items and spend about $8.50!
You have to like this place! From the right price point, its a great place to go. I've been to Love Food, Love Haus, Love Chicago, etc. for the past couple of years.  The service was great and the ambiance is so relaxing. Very comfortable, very cozy, and very convenient.
Chicago has always been my go-to big family place for duck tacos. I believe that it's worth mentioning this place (yes they do have many more pancakes, sandwiches, etc) after all it has a long list of dicks that will never be satisfied. The cheesecake has been a must, its cheese genius and every other  thing is just
restaurant and whiskeys from a different location. Delicious!
Now i'm not sure what the message is going to say about a game that lacks flavor! And a world where you cannot find a burger without paying so much. And I don't know what the difference is between a blueberry sauce and a beer? Sure, as a gamer, I love tight flavor combos - as much flavor as you want, the beer doesn't match what you like, and the food has no taste but what you get is interesting. But what does have taste? That warts up howls in the venue, and a bunch of people scurry around trying to 'dewel' their way into one another - thinking it is all cool, unpretentiousity, blah blah blah..to keep people from pouring their soda water over the tables.  Those people don't like crappy beverages - and if beer-drinking people want a beer, no beverage needs to be the same?  If
restaurant has opened its doors and it was awesome. My other favorites are the pizzas: pork belly sandwich and two blackened beef pork belly fries with chewy crusted cheese. I loved it the pappy zoodle which was so good. The way they prepare your dinner was great, and especially the low prices.I could not be happier. Thanks.
I have never been able to walk in to this place and all I can say is that I love the food. i wish the crust on the top had a bit more meat and some more sauce. the red lobster is just perfect the rest of the time in this city i believe.i do enjoy the red and blue nacho and cheese sandwiches in which i LOVE the flavors. however, i am never going to order or plan on eating in there for fear of being overindulgent. it really is not worth going there for at least $2.00.!!
The atmosphere here is beautiful - the seating is
restaurant is an amazing fusion of North and South Korean restaurants - including Cheezy Pickled Chicken, Sushi Grub, New Duck Duck, and Carnitas. We've also recently eaten at the Chocolate Factory and Suburban Luxe, and we've been blown away. Check it out now for a day trip to one of the unique Chicago dining places we're looking forward to visiting!
Great food, friendly staff, low expectations when it comes to pork chops. Great place to meet a friend and experience things we've been wanting for months now.
Simply amazing food! The pastries are so good that you cannot stop and will get hooked immediately. It's worth the time and the money to go there - get a great breakfast before it gets busy. However, there are a couple specialties that are going to be a delight for you and your family - Cheerios and Sea De Silva Panko! If you can eat them quickly and enjoy all the flavors of
restaurant of the day, I think a three times large pizzas were lost. It's probably too early to bring a dish back.
We used to come here for lunch a few months ago for a visit, when I was a customer.  We couldn't wait to get back after we started having our cake and fries with friendly staff!  Over the past few months I've gotten more requests for the specials/desserts than anything else.  The prices range from super-cheap (around $60) to cheap (around $35 - $35 per person).  We also took advantage of the fact that it's not always open in the middle of the night.  Overall we've enjoyed the food the best and no one deserves the standard of hygiene and service.  I'm looking forward to hearing from you guys!
Great little bar. I love it. Food is good but not the best. The only thing I like about it (which is my suggestion
restaurant!  And that's what they do for me! You always have one meal right in front of you, waiting for you to be served the next time you go and enjoy yourself.
Great food here but not as good as they used to have  Last year we went to Costa Rica and the food was really good!  We also had the stuffed chicken in black beans.  I had the ricotta pork and it was simply amazing.  The riscilla is a true love and we will always have to order this every time.
Grilled chicken and chicken bowl is ok. The meat is alright for small items like salads and soups but in some cases its fine for extra table for a sashimi dinner. Fried chicken is also ok as they say.
1 - Great selection of food! I ordered the big pitcher which was delicious.  No corn syrup and tap water, just salty and edibles.
Best Korean restaurant in town, really fast,
restaurant.
The Staff:   Friendly, helpful, attentive, and this place is just good. Service is perfect. They have lots of drinks on the menu, especially their beef.
Best lunch ever.  Nice atmosphere, is really busy from 4:30 til 7:30.  Good food.  Service is great.
This place is full of food, and the food is absolutely fantastic!  And if you have dinner reservations already in advance, you might have room to make reservations in advance.There are a few nice things going on in my place, however:1. Our server sent us a dress rehearsal 1-2 days ahead of time. It took less than an hour to show up, and the date, Eve, took less than an hour to arrive.  We finally got seated, and finally I could finish up my conversation on the way to my table.2. The food was good, I may not get that steak I've tasted before,
restaurant following the horrible nightmare that he experienced, served so poorly.  Yuppie Salmon eaters shouldn't be put off by this.  They went to Hell in a sealed container that smelled like soot.  Really, just awful.  Totally over the top.  Waitress really worked her way into this class by pretending that she had no customers.  In the end, how many students we had at the school during that day are going to pick up sushi?  That's to say nothing of the sort of stupid service we took at normal lunch breaks that were cooked to perfection.  The only thing that really surprised me about this experience is the food itself.  It's all incredibly over the top really.  I don't like garlic toast, but that wasn't their experience.  They were made to look so awful and poorly.  I also really love the black cat salad bar, which is awesome.  Service was generally great.  Unfortunately, this dog

The fettuccine is fresh, moist, fresh and flavorful. The sauce is fantastic. Our waiter is very knowledgeable and a pleasure to visit. They serve multiple sides which make our lunches more filling. The beef fettuccine is your go to if you want fresh beef!!
I am addicted to spicy foods...good stuff...except Savorati.What I love about their spicy sauce is the thick, rich flavor. It tastes as if you put the meat into the cold noodles and then heat it. It is not a bone-in, bone-out seasoning. It is basically a savory, spicy flavor. Their meat is a little soggy, which is a plus. They make their beef tamarind for us since the pho is hard and after several hours in the hot sun, the smell of it and the texture of the sauce turns me off. Nothing can compare!
Welp! My kids love yuca
restaurant. She will often point out the amazing wines of her day, even if they are not particularly fancy. We enjoyed their spicy dishes as well. A few of the more exotic dishes were the cheesy, if less appetizing, greasy and overly gazillionise (and the patty soft serve on the plate). However, the mostly foodless portions could fill up much more. The food was not as good as other Thai places that I went. Food aside, the options are really good. The food was very not average. The pork belly was very low quality but not not awesome. Fresh mojitos were a bit too expensive but not outrageous. The soup was out of character. I don't like spicy dishes, but if I could spend $200 on this dish, it would be the best soups in the city. It will be good enough to go home for dinner. Overall good things to come out of this place.
ok u can go to curry street
restaurant =
The food is delicious.  It is packed here if you need a bit of time.  Unfortunately, the pub bouncer (who has, to date, not written reviews to this blog) is not generally a big fan of my behavior and his rude, cliquish expression has never been worth it.  Overall, the food is good.  It's usually disappointing, but not worth the wait.
Nasula Creamy Rice Salad by Menard is one of the best dishes on veg. It's a beautiful little dish, you eat it, it says everything about what you want. A must try in a small restaurant. They also host Greek Bread Bread at ten dollars per person and three hours of prices on Friday. They have great lunch specials (including pizzas!) as well as small plates and in bowls all day long.
Oklahoma town! I have ordered all the awesome seafood at this restaurant. I've tried a lot of their seafood

I come from Laconia, a downtown Chicago neighborhood with a strong pre-census pizza and good music.  My boyfriend and I plan on going here next.  I had two reservations so while I waited, we were taken.  We were pretty deep inside in our food and we did not even know about the pizza.  Then we said, "why are we going to do this?".  My sister was in total shock and told me it was bad.  We stayed on a Thursday night for the pizza and we were met the next day by a friend, who suggested we try it out with their customers.  He was satisfied and we had to choose between two sides.  We called him and it was one of the worst things to come across in our lives and we made sure to call them as soon as possible.  They told
restaurant when I first moved to Milwaukee, I chose CheeseMan. He did everything right but you do not have to take out a reservation, or make an exception to a reservation because it would have been a bit overpriced. It wasnt. The shrimp torta was, as expected, half the price of a smaller item. Some steak and a few mole martini if you can find it in the garage. Service was great.
Budget is below expectations but the service was decent, food was generous and catered for. Plenty of meals (I had a couple w/yakisoba) and great service as well!Overall my entire visit went great.
Great breakfast food and a great atmosphere. I know that I have the job of making it, I can stand it but sometimes I get frustrated and have to work out the bill on the way in.  Other than that this is the best coffee shop in Milwaukee (I am crazy about 5th Ave from. The
restaurant I would recommend to anyone! I was told that a few nights ago at Lunch at the Pizza Bar was packed because of the moving crowds. I decided to stop and look at their food menu.  I was told that there was also a phone-in wait for the day's delivery, which was a fairly good sign.  I thought that maybe it was due to high demand, but it had to have been a phone call.  I went back and couldn't believe it!  I had the steak - Sausage and I was enraptured.  The caramelized onions were all amazing!  The crust was superb - light and tender, and laid flat just like a tater tots.  They call a hot dog latte and we ordered the fried, pork buns - I asked them, if you would like to order that, but they said, the hot dogs cannot be had on regular basis.  Then my Husband and I went to
restaurant, wine selection, and a bar.....I've only heard of the very cute house with purple flowers or one of those kal toppers outside of New York.  They are the best places I've been to lately, the better service and high quality food.Thank you WineRadar for that review, but if you're planning on taking me here again, I highly recommend not going to Nuremberg because the price can be a little steep. I will still be visiting there again.
I was really hungry and left hungry (and yes I ate it). While it's okay that there's definitely a grub and maybe a fried chicken or something along those lines, there's a definite under-price. There's also the mediocre wine pairing with the goat cheese desserts.If you're looking for high quality food I recommend:Side note: this restaurant is 6 feet high and comes with a long section at 8-10, which for me turns into a restaurant that's
restaurant was very nice and a bit pricey.  I'd definitely go back.
I've been going here for a long time and am extremely happy with the choices we have. The food was fantastic, the service was outstanding and the staff was very friendly. It was a little pricey though, but once you really enjoy what you are getting, you won't regret it.  I would recommend the Capistrano Grill, as the food is good.
Horrible atmosphere and AMAZING SERVICE!!
Gutted food, pretentious portions. Must at least try the "roast goslingos", after which I was told what salad room has food in it.  Clearly, it tastes like hipster seattle with bruschetta, mustard, creme brulee and more.  Some dessert combos in particular included this truffle bread with pineapple pudding mixed with sea salt and shaved pistachio topped with tiramisu.  Go to a steak
restaurant at the Port's.
My friend and I were excited to finally have dinner at this restaurant in Chicago. When asked by Chef Chris to share our confusion about bringing out the exotic falafel that the server claimed was so great, we would gladly order the large dinner entree to balance out the rest. At no time did we know that the servers or chefs didn't work, just that they were just fucking lame. All of this said, we actually came in to order and our name on the bill, and we gladly accepted it, and we was pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was! The chef even took our server on tour to drive us to our destination. The culinary specialty that I always used to be impressed by was getting a non-fermented liquors on the table (and the guy at my table sat right beside him in the booth). The same thing that made the week so much fun and special was getting a vegan-inspired option. Being vegan is far
restaurant is amazing, and very fun. It's impossible to find a sushi buffet in your neighborhood without going to Ramen.
Wonderful service by Captain Steve. I'm sure he heard about my reservation and then promptly decided to give me the place, which was quite slow, "or only minutes ago, I guess, since I hadn't been there last weekend," and then every single time I heard him say, "I'm sorry! This place is real hot! We are so sorry!"  He took out his camera and let the 15-25 people see how badly he wanted the place.  The service was poor and there was nothing to complain about.  But they forgot to tell me when we were bringing our plates.  We had to wait a minute and as soon as the food was ready we left the restaurant.  At first I felt guilty, but after waiting more than 20 minutes I felt much better, I'm just not even in a great mood anymore.
restaurant, taking guests in on two special meals.
Amazing.Amazing!OK, so yeah, this place was tough, not because we didn't love their desserts but because we both have always had waffles and them aren't ready to go yet so this has a very limited experience on the menu. One of the cooks brought us a cocktail after a long wait and it was amazing. This is a place to savor some outstanding Belgian/Style tequilas for your birthday or two. The place has a great pizza and a huge selection of meats and appetizers for you to enjoy with a cup of tea. You can also enjoy their signature baked goods such as Pepperseed or Scallops and Salad with fresh gourds and juices. The decor is even great since the service staff has a great attitude. The environment is warm and inviting. We come here to relax and enjoy a romantic evening and I love the time we spend with our families and friends.
I
restaurant he offered. I just love pancakes. The service is very average.
This place is ridiculously perfect. I always order the sirloin and wontons and got fantastic - even the White Duck is excellent. Very good beer and there is often a mixed crowd. The food is great, but the atmosphere has got to change. There are plans to open a little cafe next to the house next door but you should make sure to pick up a great burger and got the chicken, eggs, and bacon chicken.
Today I had a friend invite me to this birthday party for brunch and she was really taken aback by what we were doing. Being a family of 4 we live on another island and it seems like all sorts of things are getting done all the time. I am a Bay Area Granite Islander. I really enjoy eating there and I really enjoy the food.  My wife and I love Mexican food and everything from avocado and hemp burritos to me specifically a variety
restaurant(some call it a deli) with soft hollandaise, salted caramel, baked beans, candied dillnuts, jalapeno peppers and banana bread (some would say an imitation version of the rompedoodle salad). All that? If I was there the first time, I would have hung out with some of my favorite drinks. It's hard to pick just one or two, but I would have drunk one or two - so I definitely should give it a shot.   I have no reservations about the deli itself, but I am worried that it will not be kept clean (unlike others that have died).
Great Food!  They have a phenomenal variety of burgers, deli sandwiches and desserts.I went here for lunch at 2 o'clock on Sunday (this is My 21st day, having not been to San Jose yet).   I think the food is pretty good.  The meats are pretty good (
restaurant.  Our pasta included nothing but spinach, garlic, green onions, fresh basil, fresh cilantro, and the service was a little slow.  Probably the only review I would have could give otherwise is in terms of that I would have liked more pizza!
My birthday was on Friday, May 15 and I had the choice of eating just my own or some of my guests'.  My hunch was that everyone who was away was actually watching the movie.  They must have used their seats more or more after watching the movie to enjoy that awful shot of it, which I did not appreciate at all.  On the plus side, the wings were so tasty, it was well worth their price.I was also given a deli receipt for $10.  I couldnt believe what I was ordered for breakfast, this was not enough.  They also had a $15 gratuity that was worth $25.   So, I called them back and they
restaurant. Check out the shop after each bus and if you're really fancy, grab a drink in the lovely tasting bar area. Simply find the small part of the food you like (dinner places are overpriced and dry). If you're just starting out - find a family restaurant in downtown.
The place is terrible, the food sucks. Some suggestions: 1) go with another person. 2) Go in on a Saturday night in the summer or they are closed for good. They have so many seats, maybe just as many people, that they can split their items in a row to split the food. And if it's a Saturday night (on a Saturday night is usually at 9:30 for the hot breakfast food with a generous pour of water, but usually in between 5 and 6) there's even greater seating to make a lunch. They have slow moving tables but the service is excellent too. 3) Relax and take care of yourself. The staff is friendly,
restaurant, special selection of drinks, exclusive, good-looking, outstanding seating and good service.
I had the take out at La Geneve. I used to work here, along with several other friends. I hate to say it, but we had a great time. We also had plenty of food. We'll definitely return.
hiYves has a truly authentic steakhouse, which is better than going to their cheesy tacos with a very onion brisket.  The only downside is that the patio is very hard to get in to the beer garden and the bar is located only right next to a very large moustache.it will probably be another fine day but I will definitely try to return once I can afford the brunch section. I get the idea it would be hard to find a location when you are talking to a non-Jew but this place is good.
Blessed!  I met a group of similar group who were craving wings for dinner at 9
restaurant and great atmosphere was never abysmal and just overall great. Keep a reservation for during this huge day.
I'll be back! this place would definitely go back and I love what it's been through since the i 1/4 thru 6-1/2 weekend.  dont want to keep on haking this place all the time..this place is a slow paced environment, as if you didn't like the music...it's like you have got to get drunk with the entire crew...but keep on coming...
I'm a fairly regular joe. I'm always up for the cute girl in the suit. But today in my experience, that snobby I was had me on my toes before I could get a girl from Kinross. The hubby guy was extremely rude and rude.  And the sign on the door when he closed it looked like he needed someone to just figure it out.  He used a relative to stifle my conversation by using
restaurant. After signing up for my first meal I was like, What the heck was that! It was like having the same dining experience that my college friends had and then having a different dining experience. The food was AMAZING, the service was prompt, and the decor was amazing. I highly recommend trying the Bourbon Barrel Roll, some obscure new beer roll that is trying to steal the breakfast seat.  Unfortunately they must have done a super bad job if they didn't.
Quick Service! Everyone who visits here during weekends or evenings should have a hard time getting food to come out as soon as it's seated.  If you enjoy the dining experience, this place is going to come back to you!
Had 3 meals for the first time in my life. The menu reads fish tacos, chicken strips, chorizo, tacos, ribeyes, bacon ravioli. The service was average, the food was good. Everything was simple. Everything i would give it a
restaurant. We couldn't tell them we had tried a craft beer and thought about it more after finally ordering it. They delivered food & drinks around 7pm that we'd never have seen here in person before. I hope people like this restaurant make their honeymoon stops in elsewhere in the city.
I love Pilsner!  Absolutely amazing!  Their other dishes are really good.  The valet service is excellent too!  I will definitely be back!
This is my favorite place in town, I like the food.  My favorite spot on the block!
This is not your typical Organic Italian place but the Italian sushi is a hit.
This place is awesome. And when I hear people eat there, I guess I'm like "it was great!!!" They have so many good dishes. Make sure to check it out!I love it here at Bartender's when you go out for meals - they take it easy and want you to wait 45 minutes
restaurant, restaurant and bar area with about 20 people in attendance. Prices are reasonable; excellent service, an outstanding assortment of brews and specialty beer, and great food and drinks. There are 2 people making drinks in the door.
Visiting my 1st boyfriend, we spent over 2 hours in the space! I was pleasantly surprised and I would definitely go back. If you have never been here then one thing I would like to say is that it's not a typical steakhouse but one that I always visit. The meat, sauce, and everything else is sensational in every way! The French fries were simply one of the best I have had in Chicago. Staff was welcoming, we are all experienced and have been doing amazing things there the last couple years. We also enjoyed our cheap quality broths as well as a billiard course and drum china. The crab and crab pasta dishes were amazing and were excellent. Service was superb as well, with great entrees of french fries
restaurant is never taken seriously for an entree, ever.  It may be faster that way, but this place has to be a bit of an experiment -the girl next to me is kind of a weirdo, so she shouldn't be impressed.
Went here one time last week and after the first time that i had the chicken in cold water it was so awesome!  To put it simply, the service was always good, fast, and I believe will always be the #1 menu item on our sandwich.  I was hoping to try a few different ingredients, but since i was excited to try different tastes i wanted to experiment a bit with the steak.  i recommend the slight something called pork shoulder, which was very good.  If you're in the Chicago area, you should try this chicken dish.  Nothing beats a good asian stuffed chicken dish with the duck.
Chicago Anniversaries is a true Chicago gem and I am thrilled with its unique
restaurant with a great patio experience. These are my absolute favorite places in the neighborhood for lots of things.  Have you tried any of their fancy things?  Maybe they have a great one at their store and carry it as well... You can also park for the ambiance in this modern, natural setting.  From what I've experienced there, the dog seem to ignore every detail while you are walking in and out of their restaurant, taking our hopes of dining well.  When they finally do give you a little encouragement, I really don't understand what you are doing here.  Really, the manager can tell you something and explain it.   I think he knows so much about dogs and that they know what you want and really love dogs.  And he just don't seem to have any of the patron's pre-enrolled about what to expect.  We have some dogs and they haven't been doing this for long at all.  We like to go at
restaurant, salads and options..
Northeast: a lot more laid back and more affordable. Maybe the stuff you guys have recommended is not all there is, but it does count.  We have eaten at the bbq, i think we should have been dining at someplace that shared our Chinatown spot and the bbq was so fresh I had to wait and be surprised by how far we went.  The cocktails are just as good and the ice  is huge and fresh to boot.  Dessert options are also pretty good, too. And some restaurants have more wine sitting around and so are more affordable.
I live in Central Michigan and for sure it takes a special kind of person to work at the grocery store. I want to say the manager (Tom Sanborn) is someone who goes very well for themselves and will just listen to whatever I ask. Maybe when he comes in he will say something like, "I'm not going to write this review
restaurant will help me enjoy the food as much as possible. Being an avid fan of Italian restaurants and serving up homemade spaghetti, I'm sure this restaurant will get me in the mood.
The wait is insane. I was looking for my lunchtime meal so I couldn't give them any easier than the turkey sandwich. The Food was unbelievable and the service was well worth the wait.The atmosphere is very stylish, fun, clean and designed. No complaints at all.I'll be returning again for my next favorite deal.
they're working on an improvement to the sushi restaurant
Could not have been happier. This is the 1st place I went to.  It was incredible.  At first I thought I couldn't use Yelp, but once you do, you know you're going to get something better.  I have no problem ordering anything.  Everything tasted amazing and fresh.  The appetizers were also fine.  Yes, the sashimi is fresh, but
restaurant with Persian wings, salt, and butter for sure.
Great burgers.  Came with the same order of fries.  On the outside, the staff was rather slow.  Some of the bejesus were enough that it took over 15 minutes to empty our beer glasses.  There was a lot of space for the waitress/surfress employee to have light conversations and I wanted to ask what type of stew for you.
This was one of my best meals I have ever had. I ordered the Saput de New Madrid Brunch (or Medivac).  My wife was expecting a full plate of salad but they sent us to a small table with their 5-quart serving.  Delicious and insanely delicious and I think we will go back time and time again for the food that has a freshness and classic flavor and never gives away.  Definitely add some of their wine wine selections to your diet as well.
This was a reasonable but small place
restaurant is marvelous. Our manisert is totally exceeded! Our server-at-law was our backup for her visits. We came in a Sunday night (day only) that we remembered but were able to handle it. We needed to give back and we did. We were enjoying ourselves, but we didn't like what she said. She didn't seem to care about the waitress however. To this day they still give us free drinks so we still keep going back.Thank you Andrea for the Waffle Wings!
My wife and I enjoyed the dinner so much that we agreed to give it a try! Our hostess was awesome! We went in with several guests with me and it was great! The wait was an hour and 10 minutes! But it was not to last! The oysters were not bad either!
The food was awesome and had an interesting twist of humor. The meat was not as flavorful as most of the others I had tried. I would definitely
restaurant.
I'm a man of the neighborhood and if you just want a good beer (besides the obvious in the tasting menu), be prepared to wait outside to order anything.  Have fun...a cafe is always the best place to go when the crowds are getting here....stay at it!!!!
I've had the Sashimi in Chicago and the Pejito Zocci almost every time. Service was quick and so generous - if the salad bar serves you with a certain salad there's no need to worry. The Bratini was divine. The Pizza went well, warm and delicious, which is what we would like in a bratini place. I would have been hungry for more but was disappointed with a partial server. Check out the Dogs two or three times, the rice pieces were moist and as tender as day, but everything was really good. the food was fun and tasty. The moody quiet from past times is all done in elegant perfect.
restaurant / dairy friendly! Service is amazing but I'm not sure what it is good for. Now that I have told you this I must say that I definitely am not a meat eater.  But hey, I will have my full refund if they do anything good in terms of service.  But what the heck do I do after I leave?  Oh, don't tell them I have eaten beef and their menu isn't as good.  Go home with a reservation and make reservations.
The red velvet romantic satin chocolates are nothing short of unique.  So can't get enough of them...
The owner actually lived in the Village.  He's been there many times and he always adds good coffee.  With this big section of Market Square, that can always be better.I have been wanting to try a martinis and this is all about the time a martini bar comes to your table.  The breakfast is wonderful and is a must if you
restaurant plates at the Sunda dinner. Also, she should get the fried salmon churros to serve with the burgers, which is not going to cut it for me as I like to try every single dish in the book. So, I'll get them as I went to the Piermonts bar and found that they were totally worth the wait!
...this place is BYOB!  We were over there for a one hour wait when they brought over the food!  We were seated right outside (coffee table) at a table close to the diner and that only took the waitress 45 seconds to get us on our table.  We were soooo hungry we even had to wait a little while to get a table because the place seemed to have made us wail our hostess.
by the way, this place is fantastic - cozy, warm, and cozy.  Our waitress was super super nice and could not have asked for a better carter as a young
restaurant in the CaliExpress Line. My wife and I packed this place and went there by reservation.   Then again, we really did not want to go there.  I would make another reservation anyway. After waiting patiently, we were seated after a long wait when we were given their full menu.  Our table was completely empty.  The best part of the meal was the weather, after all. Our table was overflowing with people, so I had a good time and enjoyed the food. When we went to refill, we noticed there was still no sign of our table, which is annoying for us.  It took us about 30 seconds to refill our soda - mostly because of the dryness. In any case, I thought the food was terrific. As soon as we arrived, we were completely prepared.  We ordered two sandwiches, which we had to eat immediately after receipt - pretty delicious!  Needless to say, my wife and I didn't think we were going
restaurant: deep dish in middle of the night by upscale chef.
While serving some of the best meat this side of Keegan's I am craving to die for, this  amazing combo of beef ribs and beef mini nuggets were already filling my mouth.  I would give them 5 stars, but not the 5 that made me want to snooze.  It took 4 men to bring me there, and in total we brought 7 people.  Had to spend the rest of the day with the family but still I love the decor and experience! This is just an exciting place to visit.
I love my coffee  and always try to get them up there with me when I am in town for a nice beer or a yummy walk in.  And because the foods on tap are so good, the staff and I often bring our loved ones for extra sausages or cups.  Sometimes they seem to have a small place called Suwer that sits in the middle
restaurant was horrible and the server still so tries to order things like spice mixers and sauces for you to scoop. I really hated this place. To sum it up: if you have a very deep dish favorite, you should not order it! It is BYOB, but the food is much better than I expected. They also have a gift certificate for a sign that says where you want to eat next (take a bite, decorate the room with a peace sign) and prices start low. I will go again.
I highly recommend this place! I didn't find this as helpful, but it wasn't very long considering the crowd they were able to place a complete order of 70 people and was non conveniences like steaks etc and they opened at 8am, which was about 20 minutes ago. This place has great food and you will want to try it in the summer.  Even if you only like the salads and stuff like that. The menu is also very deep
restaurant cost under $20. If you like heartier cocktails, brunch, beer, cocktails, and much more than appetizers, then this is the place to go. My favorite place is on Main Street between City and Broadway. This is the most romantic, intimate, and yet classic dining experience you'll ever have.
Very good food, fantastic cocktails, dishes. Atmosphere was comfortable, comfortable, good drink specials. Parking is cheap. There was never a problem with people getting there early enough to eat a couple of pizzas in the parking area, though. Always attentive.
This is definitely worth a try.  The tacos are DELICIOUS & I always want to go again. The regular selection of burritos is always outstanding, but that isn't the only reason they're on Food Network.  I always find people who appreciate their product - some are into sauce and others like grilled cheese, meat and seafood.  I love every minute I spend in the
restaurant at the Wabash.
I love these guys. They have amazing homemade chips, sour cream and just as good's as the authentic food.  Just the atmosphere, service, and ambiance is better than the other options out there.
Delicious. I always try, as I do whenever a new thing i have, to try a place that I have only felt this took me a few years to find, and a few months ago they dropped it a notch and me and the waitress decided to try one.  Great tasting food, and  now  im getting home from work as i have to try it.  The whole staff is incredible.  This is my favorite Chicago night out!
It's amazing at Absinthe! In addition to its award winning pizzas, this meaty pizzas comes from my background.  Plus, I just love to get my fave dough and be so satisfied when I get home from work.  I love giving
restaurant)

The better part is that you get to see a real black woman, even if that means being forced to dance in a cheap 40-80 budget. Her husband and I each enjoyed her dancing in the kitchen area, but if you go the other way, you are disappointed. The food is mediocre, and without the crusty crust flavors that get even worse. Instead, they have a flavorless bbq-menu that is mediocre. Not everyone needs to like it and we are sure people will that they do. They use this job as an opportunity to rip us off and try to turn us back to the company that made our name. Really? It makes me happy to have to sit in line.
Who could have imagined here what would be possible. Both of the events were this memorable and enjoyable. They felt great when they both went, but since then everyone else has been a disappointment.We wanted a good dining experience for a Sunday night and I am
restaurant.... and truly incredible. The menu is excellent and the food was delicious and my girlfriend loves it.
Tired of the seemingly endless array of new restaurants trying to fill this space up. This place has definitely had the year.  The ambiance of one of the best bistro deli's in the state (2nd and 19th) adds unique experience to the neighborhood and overall experience. My boyfriend and I tend to avoid bistro deli's because it's a tough place to go, but  we all know what to expect from one.  I've actually gotten thrown out of the latest bistro when it arrived - overpriced and there weren't enough customers.  When they paid us, we knew we would get to spend more time at the kitchen.  We wouldn't have found this place with a pre-Ixican attitude if we didn't love this place, and appreciate what this place is about.  All at great service.
restaurant is overpriced and really only two hours earlier than last time! I would definitely try another location.
Went for lunch last week and loved the food there. With the chef's help i noticed that the beers were really high quality! No better suggestions at a gourmet restaurant. The meats were just sooo good. To sum it up: It is not uncommon for me to order two or three beers at once and the food is delicious and flavorful. Very good steak or lamb ribs. The food is also fairly affordable if you are looking for crafty and creative dishes. The service is very friendly. I know it is a bit noisy but i'm sure it is just a group of people because it's not like other places out there where you have to pay a small fee for service.
Simply sublime. Thank you.
My server brings me so many good things; just ask what it was like to have his finger grow in the work of Hal Fink during some
restaurant.
My server and I both enjoyed each meal. The staff was respectful, but the ingredients were fantastic. The salad was incredible. The meat was a lot more tender than I expected because it was juicy and cooked to perfection. However, not great because it didn't have any meat. Once I stopped by, I walked in and their servers kept saying 'Just a little jarradena. Come on, you can do better than that' for more food.  The wait staff helped to keep me entertained. They also gave me a complimentary vegetable salad, which was an awesome meal as well.
Food: Very good. Recommend this place for a variety of reasons and don't want to go back
When I first went here for dinner and saw a Chinese restaurant they absolutely pulled the ball and threw it in the air, just like I did. I have ever visited Burberry, and I always know what they are doing, but when I went for dinner I expected them
restaurant and having pizza after work (which was an absurd excuse for the waiter) had only one meaning. My first trip to work and always stayed at the Big Apple last.  Always glad to find a tasty, unique, incredible pizza. Nothing was as good as ordering the pizza that they carry in English. Everything tasted like they were filling my stomach with wholesome goodness.The deal was that I ordered the pizza by hand or  ported to an  Italian dish and it was good.  It was something to add to a meal but not especially good.  It was not a nice touch though.  I was a little annoyed at the price and service of the items.  Overall bad experience.
I know all the reviews were negative and I only checked my email just to hear from some customers that the server seemed lazy and unprofessional in a joke kind of way.  I guess I guess my just plain Italian experience must have been the case or maybe I was just wrong
restaurant. We tried the ceviche, halibut and sausage and everything was great. The menu is very condensed and pretty to read but the menu was very satisfying and we definitely recommend visiting the restaurant!
Disappointed not only was this place the worst bar I've ever been to. Probably because the wood seating is so awesome. The decor was very old and over-done, but the food was excellent and overall, very bland. Which makes me say that the most delicious food I've ever had. If it weren't for the food and the menu, we would rate this place very highly.
I enjoyed this place.  I first liked this place after purchasing a bottle of wine at the bar.  I have lived in Chicago since day one and this place is the place to go for coffee and alcohol.  The decor of the place made me feel very relaxed.  It was very retro and very contemporary with some of the interior pieces of this place.  
restaurant selection in the neighborhood. My favorite restaurant in the area. Keep checking the menu!!!
Glory Palace is on the rocks! Chicago's best appetizer is the Bayous ; no brunch menu has the run-of-the-mill abundance of options in which to experiment. The service on server is simply amazing. Their portions are in every possible order, and the prices are reasonable. I'm used to the undercooked pancakes and soups, but the mussels and lobster are filling my cravings. There are still great things there that I haven't tried. I'm hoping they can catch up.
This place gets me quite a lot.  They have a large entree dinner menu (as well as brunch) and I must say, it's good.  Service, food, atmosphere.  All great stuff.
I didn't even know there was such a place - though I love everyones restaurant in the area.  I don't think I have ever
restaurant. We went to see if the sushi joint was in the area so we decided to go. I enjoyed the fusion of the hot sushi rolls and the laid back style of the couple. The area is very comfortable with a great array of foods and drinks to enjoy. They're also well known for the numerous large outdoor terraces that they built. The only downside I have is that they sell prices. It's a bit pricey to get in, but once you get in and look out, you'll be happy you're in for a long night! Overall, I would definitely go back for any chance of a happier experience.
The place is super crowded and the service is average
Absolutely unbelievable! The reception area is awesome and the interior is superb! The menu selection is fun, the art and decor are outstanding, the staff is friendly and enthusiastic, and the food is incredible. Everything is perfectly cooked and loved! I even had the pie that was insanely creamy in color and great
restaurant- gastropub or just hoarding yourself a sandwich of sandwich delicacies! Super happy to host for dinner every occasion.  Recommended :-)  Wishing you more great memories!
I thought I would go here. I love the food. Great French toast, great avocado pancakes and great value for money. A little bit overpriced but really good! Not my first and second (if this is their last visit) but I love every minute. I am definitely going to go back.
Best Chinese lunch in Chicago.. Great atmosphere! The service was good, the place is great, the staff was attentive and friendly. I would go back again.I would be a fan again!
My French toast is so good, that you will go back a few times! Go back, find a table, watch the TV and go to Jon's Grill (my favorite restaurant!) and come back.
My friend and I ordered the challah bread to start and it was fantastic
restaurant restaurant that I can say I have always been a fan of. I love any thing that comes from the main menu.  The toppings have all the right flavors to bring you into the authentic sense of food you desire.  The fries are crispy and well seasoned.  And I LOVE the the chili! And the wines are THE BEST for creating a wine-spiked finish to the meal.It's all at worth it!
The decor is fun!  Lovely place to grab a bottle of wine.  I love reading comics and watching Doug Ross and Charlie Chaplin.  You will not be disappointed.  Make sure you wait a bit or your wine will be overpriced.
I am so fond of Chicago and to this day enjoy a quality beer.  My daughter and I have been to several stops and they really love it.  We have tried several of the great beers and will definitely be returning.  The food is great too and the line ups have
restaurant in the middle of an awful winter night (sunchalicious), that I had to finish the dinner, while drinking wine.  Yes, the place was confusingly inviting (lives open 24 hours a day).  The bar was a strange mix of sleek exteriors and the grandest ballrooms, so I figured I had to try it. I expected that they would be more reserved than this, but they were too messy for the new incarnation.  The atmosphere is packed with non-stop socializing. I waited 30 minutes, but when the hostess came in, she was giving me a star rating. Then, as she said to me, "I thought it was right. This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago." They apologized and gave me a glowing recommendation. They finally explained that if I wish, I could write a review on the following day and give them credit instead. At worst, their owner would blame me if I lost.  What a horrible
restaurant. They make the courses the perfect breakfast treat for two.  One person in line says. There is 1 of 2 in line in the garden that you sit next to and the others in line. The manager guy is working next to us who has a huge smile on his face. Since they are pretty busy but do not mind that I could see a chef with a really mean smile taking the first bite of his sandwich. He brought the chicken and the fries together. It was huge.  Great price!  I won't go back to the restaurant.  You will just be leaving with a very disappointed customer.  We went to Rick's two months ago.  It was great to go, but for a lot less money. I really had to get their free coffee since I only heard that on the Cuban version.If you have not tried the free coffee, I would highly recommend it.
This place gets very crowded, but they're great!  I personally found
restaurant and complimentary cocktail, a great wine pairing, and of course most importantly the special guest.  It took only 30 minutes, but the tea party was remarkable. They were very knowledgeable and helped them to bring us our drinks.  Since I am a gay man, I must say that my husband (not my partner) lives on their side.  It was a great romantic evening.  What's sad, however, is that we are not happy at this place.  I need to pay a price and come back!
I must say that everyone I've seen across the city was looking forward to the experience.  They have good fast food (washers, waiters, etc) and it was the nicest place I've ever been to.  They have a comfortable atmosphere to be held in and enjoy everyone taking advantage of their young friends.  It was not crowded but that's it.  My favorite part of the place was the patio seating.  My friend
restaurant/aged portions, choice of pork, wine, and delicious food. We have tried a variety of them, and they are all completely unique. Don't let the false picture fool you, ours is a steak house. We have not had any entrees that had to be from China which are great restaurants and really excellent. We have eaten there more times than I can remember since 2009. It is so incredibly unpretentious, nothing in it gets a pass. Our server stayed up all night delivering a perfect delivery with exquisite service. We highly recommend.
Best Korean Restaurant in San Francisco!  Very authentic, very fine dining & great food.
A few things about this place: the owner is rather busy, his dining room is 1/2 full (one hour - reasonably priced), and his place is served with quite the mac and cheese, which is an unusual thing to have at a Korean restaurant. The food is always fresh and fresh, and one can't beat the
restaurant.
My fiance moved to a small town a few years ago to order vegan Indian food with nothing fancy, and while I love the crepes and the burgers I try to get the veggie version as much as I can get away with, I really love the small menu sizes and the lamb, chicken and beef are so fatty that you just can't get enough. Overall the dining experience is the best in the city for my family and I am excited to continue working with them and becoming friends in order to get them off of this awful food chain. Thank you Adam.
I have been to many Greek spots, but never stop. For three days I have been out and about; just relax, and enjoy the fresh meat, and always happy to have something to eat.  It is a MUST for the whole family.
Very generous service, but I definitely order sushi. The sushi is phenomenal. Also, they have a nice name.
Best sushi in town. Food
restaurant of the year.  The cuisine is beautiful, and has some of the best sushi we have had in the city.  We plan on visiting Chicago soon after the plate is taken and going to Chicago if we can.
This place has been running in the late 90's when I was there and is best known for their homemade version of quesadillas for the chicken or cheese ball pancake (much popularly available in the same dish).  It's great value and I have enjoyed every bite since.  If you want high quality food, the chicken is definitely worth it.  We have a go-to spot for a weeknight flight, and my friend wants to go, just to enjoy the food.
This place is a great date spot in the summer. The server is awesome (kidding, he's wowed with his range of skill) and he reads all the available places and provides great advice. Service is very friendly and we are treated fairly.
restaurant. You get the food. Again, I cannot convey enough how much delicious they are. I started to cajole my friends who were standing around tables because they were concerned I might get a bad trip. Again, I let them go. All the restaurant enjoyed my warm feeling. The portions were wonderful, the people making the sandwiches were really nice. The salad bar was a piece of cake, cooked beautifully.  The wine list was pretty great too.I had ordered a couple of my favorite things and I couldn't decide which was better. Although the pork and mozzarella con meal was a bit oooopy, it was absolutely delicious.I had eaten all kinds of cheeses from my favorite, Arugula Brownie! All I can say is, this restaurant has really good breading.No other place here has that...if you don't like cheese, don't come here.
Best food anywhere in Chicago in the city. i have had the Chicken
restaurant and for years! Don't forget a book of Neagle's clothing, so you don't have to miss any thing.
Great steak food from far away. I also like hearing about the French toast berry w/ basil cobbleri. I go for gourmet breakfast and want to try something different...especially I had the spicy chicken soup from Tempura.
We love this restaurant!  Staff is always a blast and the food is worth every penny.  Highly recommended!
A must!  I've eaten here multiple times, and the service is flawless.  We haven't had a single order on the night, so we always wait until they're just finished.  The lounge area and tables are always very spacious!  Parking is difficult due to the busy time, but the food does come out quickly and all of our food arrives just before it's even delivered.  Their chocolate panna cotta is extremely delicious!  Soap & Tea brings
restaurant; wine, sausage and crab cakes.
A unique take on fresh seafood! We can't wait to go back. They can be pretty busy in the winter! 
This is a deep dish restaurant - but everyone has their own personal style.  Most of the dishes are what it takes to end up here, but you will not be disappointed, my friend.  Simply put, the crew is passionate about their own food.  So let me start by saying this place is BYOB... DON'T HEAR IT!  It has been a long time coming as I've been here with our daughter and her love of wild foods and try as hard as I can to enjoy every bite of it.  They never disappoint.  Not to mention it's also much cheaper than other Western ones.  I even went for a big entree with my oldest daughter!  Thanks Bronski for the great service and dining experience.  It's just another mainstay of
restaurant for only $12.95 but get a LIPASS PLASTIC on sampler t-shirt!  However, check out  the holiday specials here at Illucional!  The cantaloupe salad is king!  They have the burrito bar so you can make yourself a good dining experience!
Love this place, definitely getting a better tip each time I go!  and next time I just want to eat here ;) I am very excited to get to try this, I am lucky enough to have been there twice and both times I received the big plates I had and am happy with how they went.  It's very fast, your have very good service in my opinion.  I wish they would have apologized when I went back to bring my dinner to the reservation.  which would have been nice if they had actually given me the menu, it does have the same ridiculous terms as the idiotic whole 8-hour wait.  even though it
restaurant, The Queen Margherita is packed. A really good burger joint that does nice things for you and your family. If you want something fresh, you may want to give it a try. If you go for the Mediterranean style cheese (and then try the English version), I recommend trying something from the Chinatown Fish Market. There's a wide variety of seafood that was not always so tasty and prepared in Greek so perfectly and tangy. The owner, Matthew, wanted you to bring your own fish and veggies that were fresh and flavorful. I certainly didn't go hungry as we ate it. My favorite meat was the garlic ribeye. I like this one and one of the oysters are a bit salty to me. Our server, Michelle, was super helpful. The salad bar (where we order our own juices, fruits and veggies) looked fantastic! The wings were a great dessert dish. I am a big fan of healthy bars, but brunch looks more like a solid event
restaurant with divine citrus, fresh lime and a hint of pineapple. Definitely worth a visit.
Very good ambience. I always order what is left of the dinner bill, but once they leave I am happy with it, because it has come out to almost 100% of the way through the meal and the staff is attentive to make sure that the customers that come out to the table don't have to wait too long to arrive. I always feel happy when they will finally have something to order and still get a good thing. Even though their food takes hours to come out and close, the rest of the meal will be about the same and the drinks will go on! They are tasty and tasty, though I don't know if I will be stopping by every week if my plate is full or will make it that long if I ask that every time I'm serving at least one of my own. Overall, a great place to grab some great food.
I've always been one
restaurant staff). A short while later, we got hold of a request from the server to have dinner to celebrate the three or four sessions for which the chairs were attached. She did not bother to respond, nor do the other diners. Instead, she sent out no objection to the dates for which we had been seated in the restaurant. We were unimpressed by her class of appointments and we had nothing to apologize for. So we ended up going with the other, cheaper options and ended up with a terrific brunch in three or four seconds.
I love playing baseball and I especially enjoy playing. That said, I also love the fact that it's AT&T.  The Yelp reviews show that this place is a super serious business--it's fantastic, an entertaining mix of cat-and-rice sandwiches, chicken fillets, mole, coconut smoothies, and jellyrolls in various flavors.  When I ask where they have this--and they don't know!
restaurant at Perloto.  I asked my roommate to eat our martinis and that she would need to get a reservation.  She told me to turn around and get to that bar and get the waiter there.  he proceeded to take my night off.  He tried to push my table by opening his door and stopped me inside.  I ignored him and told him to get down.  Once he did, he sat down next to me and started to beat me up, telling me to stop talking to him.  He said he would never stop and we said that that had we done that he would never leave our party and we did not deserve to be called idiots, all of a sudden he was saying I would never eat at this place again and his behavior was a total snob's game.  Luckily, he gave me a pay cut and a raise to make up for what he had just done.  We walked to the back of the restaurant and got seated
restaurant: and hunch here as a good dinner dinner too.
People are asking me where am I on the food chain and I have to say, my mouth isn't watering.  I've had so many great experiences with Miles de Jonge on every menu.  I've been impressed, but as a seafood entree they are overpriced at $12 for a sushi (and you can't top that).  There are over 100 locations in the city, which makes me wonder if this place is the most unique.  A very well-crafted, secluded, elegant entree, and a nice look.
Why Spotted Fish doesn't bother me so much anymore is if it was BYOB!  When there's not a great sushi spot and their menus are so weak in quality that it could not be a BYOB experience (because there's only one vegetarian option), there's an opportunity to eat there that is so good the entire dish is missing.  There
restaurant. Best appetizer I have had. I ordered pork sausage with fried rice noodles and then the burgers with corn and salsa. Cheese, potato, butter and fat. Really great food, cozy, and reasonably priced. A must eat! Make sure to come during the peak tourist season. We will definitely come back.
Great White Spot!! Its wonderful to be able to get a table at the top of Windy City. Myself and many others and I hope this place goes back to some success.
great place!!!! go to ducktown if u want to stay in the city but want to get in like i said it's an inside the city has the second and third floor
I can't wait to get back to Chicago!!!! I will definitely be back.  My dog Love and Love is coming back.  Once again I have been a fan of that restaurant and really enjoyed the food.  We went from the owners and ladies and they truly gave us an amazing experience
restaurant location and a family atmosphere, could not say more about it.
This is the second time I have been to the Chicago Tops restaurant and I feel incredibly lucky to be able to come to this restaurant. It's not exactly a romantic pairing of two, but you can taste the good stuff. The food and service is perfect. Everything else is great. A good portion and a reasonable price.
Having a holiday gone wrong I cannot recommend the Mayan-inspired Mayan-inspired food enough. I normally do not consider Mayan to be worth the money but this experience was not any different. The food was always fast, fresh and unique. It's all so fine that we ordered the restaurant menu but had to add more items to meet our needs and orders. The cashier always blew us off but a small error can cost you many extra dollars and hours spent on beer, food, and desserts.
The food here is spectacular, all served with great service and an
restaurant. As the fish tacos. Great Service and the use of handmade flour tortillas, these should go the distance for the extra cash you have. They offer too much preparation, which is the reason why they call me the "Meat Master", along with Kim Tae Mi's. At a price on so many options, I would definitely return. But yeah, the make up and finish are just sooooooo good, to say the least.
Only 3 days at Rises in Chicago and I'm not complaining about anything here.The food was reasonably priced and well worth the wait.  The wines, beer and food here are just really good.  Highly recommended, if you want a more informal group experience.
I really appreciate all of the people who left right after the service was over and we were waiting so long for our table to be filled.
Was the apple pie hot? What were the implications?This place was lacking in a few key things, first and
restaurant will make a very pleasant experience.  If you like tasty dishes, great ambiance or both the staff is friendly. The spot also serves fresh fish, which are some of the best in the area and often come in simple!
Been here about a month and a half ago and my girlfriend and I decided to celebrate, celebrate and celebrate.  And yeah, I'm a professional chef but the owner was a little slow and willing to give me a quick look at what was on offer.We started with a the chef brought the wine list that I don't remember very much.  And to top it off they made us bring in an order for 5, it was almost the same as what they had.  Maybe 5 items they gave us that were a little more expensive but it was OK.  We eventually ordered two small cups and the first one was for 3 bottles and the second one was for 12.  It was about $40.
What are the best
restaurant needs to be better, so every time I can get my sandwich, I take it out and eat it. I had such a fantastic experience and am just glad the employees gave me a good refund.
I love that this place is so busy - especially by the early hours - and I wish it was on weekends.  The place is very quaint and cozy, which means you can sit in the chair and really be a bit cozy.  The food is delicious, and the staff is nice too.  My favorite part about the food is that it is mostly ketchup.  For an Italian style quesadilla, I think they'll make you pay.  I could totally eat a full pizzas here.
This is a GREAT place to live because it is the hub of Italian food in north of Napa...you have tons of food and great service! That's it for me!Also, the bread (homemade) is much better than the plain version
restaurant is good enough to serve me a world class fare as well as be the hostess/catering attendant of your meal. Overall, this place is very nice and my date decided to take her shotgun trip and get a premade entree. I ordered a cheese-sandwich combo with tomato asparagus. They made sure it was fresh and properly seasoned but would rather not remember that.  A tip to people who want to make a quick night out or such.  If you have a look at all that places offered, you'll see that the location can be a bit expensive. Prices are certainly reasonable.
Wanted a bite to eat here, I had the Mac & Cheese cheese relish on a bar lunch/dinner starter.  I would suggest simply removing the cheese before putting the rice in the bowl and you'll end up with a fantastic, more flavorful pizza.  Delightful.
Great beer selection at home, and great food.T
restaurant).  He had another wonderful breakfast; my favorite.  Much better than dining there, and more intimate than Kinkera like 'Crockpot'.
I made this a menu of entrees I would recommend everyone to try! I had the combo risotto with so many veggies, a side of salads, croquettes and french fries. I absolutely loved the meat and salad. The kids did not know that I was a vegetarian so it was quite satisfying. The fish and chips are wonderful and the salmon were really good. I felt the "vegetarian" component was missing from this meal (but the tamarind that came with the salad was great, too). We even enjoyed the steak margaritas, which were flavorful and refreshing. Service was also fantastic. After making that reservation and being seated by mistake (I can't recall my last one), I walked out with a big thank you to everyone. Was there a cooler or alternative-friendly environment (dr
restaurant at the same time? We thought it was good so we were excited to try the food we sampled there. This was a private place, so we were curious. The atmosphere was fantastic and the drinks were wonderful. The main courses were amazing and really tasty. When you taste it, you actually like it, you know it's there.
I was so impressed that I ordered the sassy almond bread. I have been going there on my birthday for years now, and it is delicious! I have only ordered one bite, and I am a frequent newbie. For me, it was so super hot the party came out of there. I had the lamb rib steak with scallops and all the flavor I could eat. I then ordered the miso soup which had mustard, hot cilantro, mushrooms and spinach. I never had the miso soup and would never go back for that. However, the miso soup was so flavorful and flavorful it actually didn't taste
restaurant over the thought of killing your baby or leaving you alone (unless you are traveling with four other vegans).  This is not the fault of the country.  The people of Colorado are prepared to offer some kind of compromise in the worst possible way to save the lives of your loved ones and others who would no doubt eat in an insane of place.  I personally think the French and the Italian countries have the worst dishes and have not been cared enough to care about the tastiness and livery of the food.  If it was up to me, I would get there today, but if I had time to eat a couple of rushers in five minutes and rest and eat a couple of their dark whiskey bowls as nothing more than hot coals then I would have done so in the most inconspicuous manner possible.
I LOVE FRENCH!!  The manager, Korean from Japan, is very humble. He lives in China with a group of cousins and from
restaurant? What have we done wrong? Third, what is the last time they went with a waitress with two kids on her third birthday when she asked if she was going to a different place? Oh, wait! I don't know, how am I going to explain what we did wrong to them with the meal....
If you need their sushi and burgers that are available at 8:00 am in cold weather, then go for it here. I love our 8:00am atmosphere, both in and out of town, and it's always a good chance for a dinner or a group of friends. After going to Ed Sullivan's and going to Cheez quesadilla and having breakfast at my grandparents' house at 5:00 pm last night, I don't have a problem with the service at this place.  The one thing that I wish I could say is how the food tastes with both the time and quality.  Everything was good, but they made reservations (
restaurant. Every time I get to the bar I immediately begin talking to these people on the phone. I am fortunate to meet so many people who share my disgust with food delivery for sure. However, I have yet to have anything disagreeable. Many times during my visit to Aizawa, my server has the feeling of being on the receiving end of rudeness from customers.
One of my favorite restaurants in New Orleans.  Like Langer Place, the food is exceptional, and if you are looking for a relaxing food experience, you will not be disappointed. If you want an authentic Italian feel to the style of the meat, then read this review.
My favorite restaurant in the city. They have large tables for the whole family.  I love their sides, they are mocha chic.  The cooking has always been great and the ambiance is friendly.  They also give you everything you need.  The front is cozy and cozy.  The ribs are
restaurant is slightly superior to the service as well. I say service because it's on the point so you want to hold it up to account. If you want an upscale meal at a reasonable price and you have an expectant host, you are going to have to come here.
this is definitely the best steakhouse in Chicago! the wine list includes amazing red card cutlets that I haven't had before and to my surprise the wine list was quite good. very small portions and service seems to be consistent throughout the entire meal. what a disappointment after all!! time from 1pm till 5pm, let alone 5pm till 5pm. once inside, there is a totally open order place with incredibly convenient service. bad wine selection. the server, Aaron Wolf could have been better, but he's been around for a long time. very rude. during a recent coffee/hot tea party, the female bartender made fun of her legs and felt bad for them. I mean, okay
restaurant on the Green Millside was delicious, the whole menu was not overly generous, but the food tasted great and exceeded expectations. I will never go back to the Green Millside again.
Had a party and were greeted by a girl who was at the door.  It was a nice, cute neighborhood place with nice chairs and beer.I've gone on several occasions with my boyfriend and there is nothing out of this world about it.  However, they are busy and the food is consistently great.Not my favorite Chicago restaurant but still fun enough to have guests.
I recently went here for the first time, after spending an evening of watching games and drinking their own tequila! The ingredients were exactly what I had been craving for! They have quite a few beers to choose from including calvados as well as a few new and amazing Grilled Pasagras (Greek-style margaritas).They will always be enjoyable to drink, just be careful!  We
restaurant, reheated lunch and dessert. They also have some of my favorite crab cakes and pineapple rolls, which were excellent.
Now, there are several reasons for reservations for this place, but the main reason it is there is that the best outdoor seating is on a hill overlooking the Mississippi. I want to say one thing about the food. I love BBQ because it's fast to prepare, vegan, and healthy. I also LOVE chicken wings which comes in the following styles: new cut, crispy, saucy or spicy, most also have a egg and honey crispy/crispy filling. I love that the place is open 24/7, the food was delicious, and the staff makes up for the fact that we're always filling our glass after having a good meal. The salmon dishes are great, but the fish, oysters, calamari and bruschetta might just be the tastiest you've ever had. I actually wish I had the better earrings
restaurant.  Overall, to get a better meal, I go here every time.
This was the best trip I've ever been to.  The wings were completely enthralled (most are inside the glass and the shrimp fried).  I didn't feel pressured to try anything special here, but here you get live music, romantic music, and food that comes packed with royalty and exotic flavors.  All in all, a great start to what we're all about.
While there is absolutely no need to go to an original Greek restaurant for a meal of all size (no pricy greasy vegan wings for sure!), one recommended Ethiopian chicken sandwich is absolutely fabulous.  A must try in any Ethiopian restaurant!  They have authentic Greek nameplates with authentic Greek locations.  I love this place.  I have been to this place for over 30 years, and will definitely be coming back.
I wasn't expecting a duck salad.  It was bland.  After
restaurant on Sheeran St, 3500 Grassy Mills Rd in North Adams. Yummy to me. I highly recommend!
Probably best sushi I've had in Chicago. It's so clean, open and had never before been service-y. The plate seems like a perfect refugium for an amazing space. Everyone is welcomed. If you'd like to have that place, definitely check it out!
Ok so I'm a college student. It's nice to go to a place that knows how to deliver exceptional food.  I had the French Fries at Monk's for lunch and they had amazing selections.  The parking is good though, so I'd stay away when I can.  But one thing that may be so frustrating is the front entrance.  The bar in front of me is actually pretty tiny.  It looks way uncomfortable, but that's what I mean when I say that!
If your in Chicago eat at this restaurant and you like to
restaurant. Must have cheese asap! Absolutely wonderful atmosphere and meat lovers
FREAKED OUT LOVE!!!!! Food was extremely good and I went with my 6th and decided to go ahead and check it out for myself. I had the Burger Cafe and Love it. It was a busy location at first, but the food was all yummy. Definitely worth checking out as much as you go for such a great place!
I have never had a ceviche dinner without being there.. Now I do!!  I love the view and the large sign to all the restaurants that offer it.... you just have to look out for yourself.  Fruity's is totally good......she doesn't seem to have a bad reputation around...
Hang out at Carla's for a quick brunch or a weekday brunch or anything! I would recommend Carla's for their excellent breakfast and lunch options.  The proprietor is very knowledgeable about ceviche so don't be
restaurant for it. I like to have it. Good meals are cheap! Very friendly staff. If you're looking for something one of the best in town to have in Mexico, you will love this place.
Wow! Wow! It's not like I have ever been to Brazil, but the food is damn good and is very tasty. It comes out of the house often and is much better than the other. Don't forget to order the pork burritos! And the beef, i will be ordering the buttercream.
Best coffee in Los Angeles!!!!!!!!! Thank you Chicago County for having me in the restaurant! You get everything you want in the best of Chicago. From scratch and fresh off the ground, yummy coffee, the perfection, amazing atmosphere and all around amazing atmosphere.  Plus I'm gonna be bringing my 2nd wife here for this special occasion!We went for dinner on the way out! You will find the menu for the wings, the risotto
restaurant is great, even though our sweet potato-free pizza is more than adequate. If you want a slightly more authentic low-key version of Hodge - the romaine, I mean, yes the secret sauce isn't that great, but it tastes like a mix of wine and potato juice. Make sure you order the salad here, and skip the fish, oysters, goat cheese, and pork dressing. This is what you get for the $12 per person. I would recommend this place if you're looking for something smaller than speckled eggrolls.  Eat at Hodge or pick it up.
Used to be the Lincoln Park on Third to The River, but then I think they started being fair and I'm not sure if that'll change. The alcohol is huge... especially considering the fancy dress you'll see there. All in all, not a bad place, but at least I should enjoy their food!
the weather was nice and clean... I
restaurant, that's what I use to describe their pastry service.I think I won't be going back to Kranja for a couple of reasons. First, I went and had this afternoon's delicious and original hot chocolate steaming frog cake.  On your hands. I believe they actually did better the following evening but it took them three hours to get the four burgers from the bakery I worked for.  And also it took them two full days to get the two chips from a coffee shop in small town because of a delay in delivery.That's pretty ridiculous.  Go back a week and the plate will still be decent. Also, this is part of the reason I'm not going back for a minute because I don't feel like I'm in.  Or else I'm just disappointed by their mediocre food at the bottom of my wallet.Lastly, if you're interested in vegan options, go there and order a hamburger and fries from their kitchen.
I'm
restaurant.  Did you see me eating?  What do you mean?"  And yet, my friend  went over and asked us, Is this still the dining menu, based on what I have read on Yelp?  All of us laughed.  I knew it was wrong because they were not building in any menu;  but the fact that it was part of the planning was just as it should be: they moved it from the dining line.  I wasn't even allowed to check out the menu until lunchtime; I just heard everything sounded good!
This was the one restaurant I wanted to go to.  Being 3rd year college student from New Orleans, this place rocks.  I had heard good things about Ramen in Chicago--it's my favorite place in America--but this is where the real show was--really it started, we finally got to a bowl of rice and it was DELICIOUS!  Both my parents (both must insec
restaurant.  Its soft, crispy and like no other in the area.  I will be back for more.
I had to wait on my flight there the next day to get off the plane.  So glad I did, its light and quiet, when I finally get there my birthday was on 5th!  I couldn't have asked for a better day.  The service was friendly, excellent and efficient, I am truly glad I went back.
The restaurant was exceptional. You get to experience the perfect sushi, to share delicious food, and to experience a different mood from the fajitas.  They have innovative plate choices of plates from anywhere on earth. Our special lunches were spectacular as well as the local delights. The Staff was truly charming and friendly, and I didn't have to worry about my seat being unoccupied during lunchtime when the reviews was written.Overall, this is a great place for a relaxed evening or date.
Gotta
restaurant, god help me, blah... I've tried every single one from the Chicago/Hancock area and Chicago experience was fantastic. The diner is owned and operated by Martin Dickey, but you can order there yourself! We ordered our entrees at 8 am, around 7:30. I was so hungry that I had to wait about 45 min, but thankfully they pulled it off the same day. The sandwich I ordered was obviously salted and very good. The food was not really very well delivered and didn't really live up to its high expectations. I also had to wait for the line before I could get to the place, but that was worth it, not overly lengthy. My best wish was to have another go to this place to get that place back on my list. The place is fairly close to the main course and the place is reasonably priced. Overall, not a lot to say about this place!
The second ingredient I thought about was the local cheese.
restaurant.
And if you aren't a waitstaff freak, this was your lucky day! I ordered the Cheese & Onion pizza which was savory with the flour. The crust and tortilla filling was excellent. I really enjoyed their sea salt shrimp with a basil pesto topping. I also really liked their beef joint, the entree and dessert. Everything else, they thought was pretty darn good.
I stopped in this restaurant just for the superb food. Unfortunately the salad bar did not actually bring you the shakes that people were paying for.  It did bring you a fair amount, but it didn't quite as big a share as what most people are paying for. I had the lobster bisque which was not good, and the margarita which I ordered in part had a little spinach in it, a difference between everything else, not enough.  It also came with a package of oatmeal soup.  It was horrible.  I was taken back into a super
restaurant mix. I love visiting the mamonita places to go, but it is hard to find a right spot on the counter where it can be crowded with waitstaff, waiters, and waitresses.
We waited 45 minutes and were not surprised to find that the veggie lasagna at The Picnic was super delicious and excellent, and the pretzel dish was also great.  In the words of one of the servers, "We expected a big disappointment." On the contrary, we were definitely pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed our trip.  The party of three or so followed the menu of their favorite restaurants, and even had a tapas parbo mocha.  By all accounts this was a great experience.The chips came fresh and ready for dessert, and even they did serve them.  Upon going to the bar at the moment it was literally empty, and the hostess was amazed, and took me back to her office hours after a long wait. 
restaurant with food & drinks. Love. If you plan on eating outside, ask for directions to the sushi restaurant in the back lot.
While our server requested that we take a flight, I think it's fair to say that neither tip limit nor manager was any good.
I love this place. Everything is awesome and fresh. My family and I took there every night. If we didn't get one of these go in, we would not be able to see the entire restaurant but the shrimp entrees were awesome. Good eggs, chicken risotto and polenta. I think the chicken was brought over pretty quickly, I can only imagine what they went with because I haven't had them since.
Cristian Rizzo got to me 2 weekends ago, dining in Chicago for lunch.  This was my first experience at Cristian.  He was the kind of guy who knows his stuff and makes suggestions.  I told him I wanted to take my sister, who
restaurant and street food was AMAZING. Our friends and I went with us and had a great time. The food is fresh, and the staff is AMAZING.  We ordered the daily special, Chicken Chicken, which we loved so much and loved everything. I had that 8 year old was sick and for the price it was (for the last 3/4 nights it was on a very expensive table), I was absolutely hooked!  Our server, Graham, and I got to know each other very well and would have looked out for each other, but we had talked to each other more times and understood each other's neediness for each other and were both very sweet!We arrived at 8:30 and had a great time!  We had a nice hot dog, and they had other chinese items for dessert for us (some of the steamed chiles were good), and the wait was short.  We ended up in the hot dog section and were seated
restaurant, sushi, and some coffee and table service. We would eat here during dinner and would definitely come back.
What a fantastic experience, and the decor is fine. If you are looking for to the group size, The Pub will be great for you.  This place is a little busy.  If you're getting it, expect a bad night's rest.  We went with our Group, and started by getting Sushi and Seafood, and since it was so crowded, we also went with other groups on the short list.  I would highly recommend asking yourself if you want a good group to split up.  It will definitely be crowded.  They offer more variety in fish options and meats.  I have yet to find a good restaurant in Chicago that offers Sushi and Seafood!
Superb food. SO GOOD!!!!! Surprised that 5 stars on Yelp was enough to get this restaurant back.  The worst service you will experience is going to
restaurant has a dish for the house. The yummy feel of that sauce alone is enough to justify paying $100 for one of the lucky customers. The price difference with this entree is huge and the side salad is pricier than expected. Maybe it was the quality of the ingredients, but it's certainly tasty.
I love this place!  I LOVE HUGE BOSS COUNTRY!!!  When we open our own place out there is always something amazing to see.
This place was kind enough to give a "Shari Bon Houser" one of their fav dishes.  After reading the reviews and the stars on Yelp it was hard to believe it.  My favorite was the shari sandwich.  The meat was really tender and flavorful.  The salad was absolutely incredible.  I could eat all day and nothing would eat my words.  It really isn't worth the money but I loved the dessert. The best part was that they wrapped it in parchment paper
restaurant.  While dining I realized there was much better steak in one of the dining rooms in the dining room than the real thing.  I don't recall why the area is all that crowded and cramped when moving in but if I am ever going to visit the venue I will not wait to get in.  My coworker gave me a thumbs up and said that by taking the stairs we were bringing her with us.  They said they are open all night and it is an authentic hamburger joint!  I recommend going to One Night Only at these restaurants for authentic ingredients and fantastic service and comfort.
This is my favorite Chicago place for dessert and I will be back! I love this place and I loved everything that they made here and I want to add something special to the menu!
I really love this place. It's beautiful. The food is amazing. I definitely would not recommend anyone to this place. I always have to ask for reservations when I go to this
restaurant."
It's a nice Sunday brunch and dining experience with wonderful food. With you guys it's extremely quiet but people are still enjoying themselves. the highlight of their day is the dedication that goes with it to bring a different type of menu. I will definitely be back!
Everything about the spot was outstanding. We used a recent coupon to pay $45.00 for 2 tapas plus free appetizers to try and complete our order for the summer. We also had the Giordano's chips so it was a great deal.
Ok I would like to be honest, it was not a great experience. The lady was NOT very helpful as she would only ask if we had eaten there before and never recommend anything else if we didn't want to spend a bit more time there. If you're going to be heading there to celebrate Family Night, I suggest you stop by here. When I heard about this restaurant they tell us how great the food is! However, it
restaurant...where you can finally eat and play. (If you want to be satisfied to eat everything...then the prices are...well..go for it.) And the decor is perfect. I am totally a fan of this place, think it's an awesome place!
I am basically a vegetarian here. In another way, I guess I'm normal here. I'd like to suggest this place for everyone who is foodie, but I always come to this place.  You have to try this place in your life! It's actually really simple to eat meat, seafood, or anything you want. Just follow the vegetarian sign down the street.  The soup seems to be great, and the beef is in excellent taste and quantity. The bartender is very nice. There's a very good chinese thingy behind the bar.  It's an extremely busy restaurant, and if you want to eat your veggies to finish off, stop in for some protein shakes that aren't so
restaurant is delicious. This is probably our only regret as it can be difficult to find the food, thanks to the large selection of ingredients. While its only steak house in the South, it seems cheap.
So many good Asian food places on the East Coast.  The menu is never so short on basic ingredients.  All-in-all I was expecting an okish-ish finish for $2.20 for service (including a $20 wine list)! Now, i gotta say, it's because we like what we eat.  They have cheap, small portions.  They do not allow full-priced appetizers, which i think are just plain incompetent.  I don't know how I got there, but I would say there are definitely better options.I have been going here for hours and on a regular basis.  To top it off, the sushi bar is great!  The $3 price tag makes the run count more if you've never visited and
restaurant on both sides of Lakeview and Burnt Up Chop. Simply delicious.
Been here twice now and my favorite in-town items were the spring rolls and the mac and cheese. The pepperoni burrito was fantastic too. What a sight to behold and just loved the fresh ginger ale on the side!This place is truly the deejay pizza joint. Go get your budget one ahead of time!
All I have heard about the La La Goes is how nice this place is! I love their Cuban style pizza and when they open their doors they always have a great selection of specials and takes on flavors like that. And once you eat, you feel like home! We both love their seafood ceviche rolls.
I'd never heard of the Alinea since it's near the River North parking lot, so I thought I'd go get it, I was certain I'd come pretty fast. It was so small and I was literally busily filling my plates
restaurant, has lived in Tysons for over 20 years and has helped many people. (http://instituteisfree.org/2010/08/30/municipal-to-public-connection/)    Their authentic Mexican food, high end Korean decor, modern exotic food and classy outdoor.
This place is awesome! I live in the area, so they have some great food here.  Their pizza takes up room in our lunch counter and not does it need to get crowded on weekends, which I think means it is more affordable.
This place is awesome. I thought everything about it was so completely great. Service is very fast. First of all there was only a four minute wait for my order. When I walked in I looked like I just got my sushi. When I walked in my customers were from different walks of life and howling from the other walls of their apartment. I had some of the worst sushi there I've ever been in
restaurant prices would be a reasonable reward for a good evening meal here.  Your entire family and co-workers would definitely support me as a vegetarian option.  Definitely visit.  Definitely.
My beef broth and beans have been consistently amazing! I would definitely try this place again with a group. My main complaint here is that I hate to have to wait 15 minutes for service, but the wait can be a real bummer, especially if your band arrives a few minutes early (I have been there from time to time).  I've also ordered drinks, which don't do much, but have never had the worst place to get a drink.
Worst dinner in Fayetteville in a long time. I've had good tacos on the black rib and habanero, and I've tried the strawberry burrito, chicken fin and whatever else I've tried in the past. For me, the new york-ish food tastes like it's coming out of McDonald's
restaurant) was great, but you'll find yourself drinking beer it's kinda full (which is the norm).
I attended a fantastic concert.  The table was warm and filled with laughter.  From outside seating I could see that everything had been planned.  I am one of the commenters which can be rude at times, but I love this place, really.....we all laughed.  I will definitely be back!
I had the falafel pancakes! Everything was awesome! I especially loved the bacon the french toast was big, as expected, and the seitan pudding was just amazing. This is a must for breakfast. I never left hungry and I feel super thankful and thankful that the meals come at the same time on the server. Also the food was not overpowering.  But if you do order a number of different items I would suggest they throw them all in together! The only reason I would give 5 stars is because of the nature of their sushi selection.
restaurant and restaurant. They had the best chicken I've ever had and their fries were to die for! Will not go back!!
I love Hot Steak (so much!!!!) with faves! The food is delicious, the service is really friendly, and the atmosphere is very fun! The service is quick and friendly! Everything I go to here is great, from the pizza to our wine and appetizers, a French toast, pastries to an appetizer, afternoons to a lunch. It's definitely worth the drive down and you'll be back soon!
love it..i like it more than anything and i am always glad i took a reservation or are my good server..because you know what i mean..they have the best prices the more i look they change out the less they charge!!the amazing and wonderful chef and their staff lives up to my expectations!! this place is what makes a Michelin-star!!!! great atmosphere (the energy is nice,
restaurant/whatever a law officer does at the restaurant, another as-yet-not-committal employee has almost automatically been made all smiles from here. As if I ever needed to say another word about California. When it comes to too-awesome food, it is on par with many of the other things we love here in Los Angeles. It's an easy (but important) mix of things, filled with lots of inexpensive and sophisticated local ingredients. Whether you order the spicy sesame tamari or the homemade kebab smoothie, we will gladly listen to your thoughts about Calan. This must be the last place we'll eat without waiting for a reservation.
Once upon a time I visited as many of the places of sadenwalden and walk through the busy street, but the food was out of order and the menu was very limited. Why should I come back? It's all about the whimsy, and the time spent staring at posters of classical Italian
restaurant in Dennaton, as well as a frequent dinner spot. We went with my friend for dinner on April 19 and their wine list included Atelier, Webster's, Crumpets, Great Pizza, Rooftop, and Ribeye Italy. The meals, with beef and veal, were fantastic and affordable at $15-$15.
Hands down #2, Italian steakhouse can't be beat.   Our first time at Blackface they offer another $20 per person table.  Their tartare is great, the wine list is impressive, but the decor and the experience is really the same.  They have a small but fun mixed menu that goes with our meals.  My favorite part about the steakhouses is they have frontera over them, they make me order a barbeque with spicy garbanzo tomatoes and fresh mozzarella bread.  Our love for Italian steak has expanded from there into other categories and specialty dishes
restaurant often in the Pits. Well not anymore...The Food. The food. The staff is real great and always smiley. I usually eat at 7 pm and I'm not sure if that's a sign or a sign that we're all in the process of moving to a different location. Sorry.
So good a steakhouse, cheap prices, affordable beer and family friendly atmosphere (maybe that's why the bartender LOVES it.) How can you not love a steakhouse with seating and plenty of people?!
Had a great meal there today, though the waitresses were pretty bad with their love of smoothie choices.I had the Seinfeld order, bread pudding, and fries.The burger was a mess. I don't like that its not even so seasoned as brisket (it is mediocre with good seasoned meat & cheese) so try it under a straight blizzard. The waitress was super rude and couldn't understand that my sous patron had asked for my
restaurant, a delightful dinner table at 438 N E. Shepherd St., the second of an overall four-star restaurant. With quality food, attentive staff, and friendly food, the menu is incredibly diverse and sometimes reads much like one gigantic, full-frontal, good-evening as it entreats and provides a unique experience.
3. Graham Elliot is a world-class hotel. For a staff of 20-30 people, it's great for trying different soups and entrees. I have never ordered salad in my life, but they offer amazing-looking selections, which come in all sizes and colors. They have an amazing salad bar which has all the good beef (cooked for 1 day), and fried calamari which is a real treat!
The original yelp, before Boar Restaurant (1934), would have become the old staple in the dining room, this time based on a very small catering job from 1973....The restaurant has survived
restaurant is designed to bring something new to this quiet street neighborhood where you can get great service, food and truly outstanding beer." - Bishamonath.


I just had the birthday dinner with the chef of Aleo and Michael. It's not the best dinner in Chicago or anywhere else. I've had dogs and chickens. The seating for our parties was uncomfortable at times but the atmosphere was awesome and the beers were amazing. Overall this is a great place to settle in. Stay classy but do not park on one of the more frequent street corners.
This place is good. The environment is inviting, comfortable and the service is professional. The reason this is your specialty is because there are some knowledgeable individuals working on a six-part series here, one of which will take place over the next few years. The staff is really lovely and this is not one of my least favorite places. The food is always fresh, flavorful and incredibly satisfying. They take orders not only for lunch
restaurant is made of soul food but it was overcooked so I had to watch to make sure I wasn't sharing my lunch. I don't eat meat, but so would have liked if it were cut. So what am I going to eat?  Plaque bread? Peanut butter. Bacon. Duck Eggs? It's the seafood buffet. Unmemorable! It has a ton of other ingredients I would be great to have here but it wouldn't have been the best end of the meal.  It was by far the worst meal I had.  Never try it again!
Huge rave after party!  It is awesome.  Most nights, everyone else is really happy.  But none of this is to say this is the best neighborhood restaurant in the city.   One of the people who was so upset about the wait was the owner.  He made us sign their orders (people have been waiting 30+ days for the front door, still waiting.)
restaurant House: $4.75 for local, $2.50 for national. Dineout gets you $6 each way for a meal so you'll be happy.
Ok, so hello yummy and good meal, but this place is noisy & loud, the service is weird, customer service is annoying and stupid...Plus, food & drinks aren't terribly good! Its usually reasonable to buy the very best.  How is the pricing? 10 bucks is the big deal at 2 italian per plate (over 5 people worth) if you don't know the menu....Nice place, but sorry...
Had the BEST Tea in Chicago - a crowd, amazing drinks and an awesome atmosphere.  The food was great, everything was so reasonably priced, it had just about anything I had brought home. The staff seemed to be very knowledgeable and even talk to us, not distracting us.  I think they sent a small note (long overdue) and asked if we would be

I live just down the street from this restaurant.  The salad bar I think of has better style.   Their lobster bisque is amazing.  Nice addition on a hot summer day.  No empty seats for 2 or 3.
The band comp(ly played their fan bases names - GROWERS, A GLORY!!!) for this awesome hot dog parlor was really hard to figure out.  A quaint little bar.  Other than that i don't think I have a fanb's.  If I were to go back, I'd use the "fire".  It gets cooler outside but they seem to have been doing it for a long time...
the sushi was fabulous. medium to thick, you just had to order
If you're feeling left out of the experience here would be good. If you don
restaurant delivery. I got the Rabbit Burger with 2 oz of buffalo sauce. I had the mozzarella and the fettuccine (LOL but tasty). If they try the pork side then I'll try and get the Porker steak instead.Also overall good for a buck. Great service, drinks, and a nice atmosphere. Next time I'll try out something fresh.
Food was ok, most people may remember the ridiculously boring specials but a few that do are delicious and i loved them as well.The only bit I'm going to say about the store is that there's never really much space right now.   When the time comes to order the pastries, there's little space left but for dessert  there is it is wonderful to be able to enjoy chocolate cake and cola. The outside area is cold and there is a constant grating problem.  I wish they had the water quality of shower.
It's OK it's a bummer,
restaurant crowd. In fact, whenever you go up to the Supreme selection, the interior is incredible. A lot of people will try your tapas and soups. It's good though, that if you don't like, you can bring a meat partner. If you're in of one of those groups, be prepared to find your food a bit expensive.
We haven't come to San Jose but didn't hesitate to come here if it was possible (and with great service and food). Our beer prices are a bit steep, so there's a good chance we'll be in the parking lot when we get there, although there are plenty of bars nearby that have a big, empty bar. However, as most of the reviews, you can't really blame the food when it comes to Spanish & Food.  My favorite is the spicy pork short ribs, which are excellent.  The oil-ins perch was just ok for my tastes.  The steaks were great and
restaurant menu. We will be back!
Salamanca's pretty bland and understocked. But this place is close.  Yes, it's remodeled with vintage names and the pastel red line is embroidered with crisp serrated garlic, but the service was so out of this world that you would spend $15 at Salamanca's  price. It still isn't cheap, and they're still trying to catch up to that.  Not enough money?  Try a dark chocolate dark-cured raspberry pie or light ice cream.  Try a generous half size flatbread.  All good options to enjoy.
Our food is mediocre, the service is just the mediocre. I know, he said not to mess with the guys, i guess. This could be us looking for a new place for brunch and i really wanna see something more unique. Lets hope its legit.
I just had dinner at a great Mexican place on Market Square near K aon
restaurant, the one serving the breakfast was delicious, I gave my server the floor and she promptly set it aside, the wings were crunchy and sweet, the pork was tender and juicy and delicious, with so much that I had to take out my buns with guacamole, which was a plus.  I was enthralled that the lady who picked them for me had helped me to entice some of my favorite dishes, and she was an amazing cook.  Highly recommended!
I have been going to this place for a while and at least once I have been there, I would like to see the interiors completely remodeled.  And the staff is very friendly.  Would not recommend it to anyone but those that have trouble dining here.
This place was very good and very very expensive for the same price.    The meals were tasty and affordable.  The front counter staff was a bit slow to answer the customers.  It was called
restaurant on a Friday night. It was generous and generous, a pleasant experience and plenty of laughter.  The food was fabulous and the wait was very slow. We had a weirdie sausage and sweet potato entree with meat and eggs to order but we got to sit over them instead and cheese was just a bit on the bland side. My favorite part was that the food was very different. The sausage was cooked, the eggs were sauced, and the crust was incredibly fresh. It was delightful.The last time I had this place was 12 years ago on my birthday when the wife gave me a final visit. I went to the salad bar with my family (all except a few for dessert). The salad bar, however, was quite empty. Everyone seemed to want to throw in a pie but all we could tell was that we would not eat it anyway. When the steak bisque came out, it was gorgeous. The greens could have been much better, but nothing spectacular.
restaurant, I can't decide. Most places take a seat, and yet I'm really satisfied with how good the staff has been, we have never had the feeling we are getting what we're paying for...I'm excited to be able to have a full bar and some awesome service...I love that... I've also seen the library enjoy rising coffee or sometimes just enjoying the life.
Oops, noise. We ordered 6 Fettuccineas and didn't see anything on the menu. One of the of the employees had a rather tough time ordering the 7th Egg (the standard 4 courses)! I have not personally experienced this type of quality over the last few months and i hope that the friend who handled this place will experience it!  I am to blame for not being able to get a reservation but that is a very kind part of having a restaurant that can live up to its reputation if not possibly to become the best I've ever been to.  Please
restaurant of choice. We got a 10/10 but they moved our food to their second floor and paid. They give a 20% gratuity.  Just love the food.
Oh, the most delicious food I've ever had! The food was insanely close to the menu so we forgot to bring our own tarts. They look just like you'd find on any other veggie menu, yet the specialty blend was sublime. Do you enjoy this place?
To start, I thought it was very bland. There is no Beef + Eggs, no Sausage, and nothing that compliments the Mexican food either. I was a fan of Fred's Mexican Grill so I got the amazing New Orleans Mexican food. It's great!
We've been to many of the bigger, better establishments in Chicago.  The looks they offer are close to what you would expect for your neighborhood and it doesn't feel cheap.  I would definitely go back for lunch or dinner at any of
restaurant at noon.
I was standing on the patio, talking to a young man we recognized as H. T. The manager insisted that we call back. I asked if I could go, which I did not want. "Oh, hello?" He said. I went. I took the phone off the table and found H. T. standing by the window. He hadn't been there when I called and there was no sign of him. He said they couldn't get him. I walked over to him and asked what had happened. He said, "You're doing this for someone else." I asked if I could have taken H. T.'s mug and went. He asked if I would take my phone. I asked if he had changed my mind, but he shrugged. I tried to ask him what he did with his story. He said he made a mistake and went away. I followed the man to an upstairs diner where he was speaking to H. T.'
restaurant location, a few booths and no other options for the price of two or three meals or dessert at one of the joints.
For everyone wanting a good lunch, I would recommend the palepirinhas bowl of Vegetarian Meals. They taste great and include ingredients such as soy milk and rice/olive oil which I don't have. Also, they have a lot of vegetarian specials and bread/eggs and vegetables are very good. They are also very cheap, due to the strict vegetarian menu. I recommend sticking with the selections listed below:
Cameras & Salsas
This is one of my favorite places on Thursdays at night and I do appreciate their lot in menus, but its always worth mentioning to people that I get home with an order and then a dish I have decided not to eat. But I usually go with food that is safe, and it does bring out the best in every detail. Some reviewers gave me credit for the server's
restaurant free. Free parking is available.
Wayne, CA would be next but place was so nice with the patio but got about six drinks & a couple table rentals to make that happen. Great place if your family is wanting to have their own drinks just to speak with friends while they party.  Awesome view of here from up above - great!
Glenn area has a lovely atmosphere and their bread is phenomenal! All the meatballs and veggies that I've had here have been quality and I can't wait to try some of the more adventurous options.
Just can't wait to try pizza here! I love it! Everytime I go to try it I am reminded of the wonders it can bring...I have been coming here for about 6 months now and yet every time I visit I get a pizza filled with real meats and not a red velvet note...but I am glad they can keep going...What an amazing place!
This is my go to for any occasion
restaurant is important to us. They've been working hard for the past four years to get this place ready for everyone. Their 4 people wait staff is very attentive, very knowledgeable, and very knowledgeable about what you're looking for. It's a really nice feel to sit back and listen to music, listen to some good old-fashioned Americana, and enjoy some fresh air for a little extra. If you're looking for a cool ambience, this is a great place to go!
My husband and I made a reservation at the Thalor. We went earlier this week and were told they had another event here the next week. The wine list we received was just what we needed, fresh from a beautiful bar. I can't really wait to eat in the bar and watch the rest of the crew. I think it was a good spot, not too crowded. The meats were thin, with no rice wine and no wine. We ended up giving the buffet a hearty 6
restaurant is busy at the weekend too, as well as ordering a quick bite at the bar and of course, pizza. (How small an hour, please, and I am not here to coddle fancy food unless I am in Chicago) It would be okay if I ordered only one or two decent (potatoes and cheese). The sushi rolls are beautiful. I don't have to fill my plates as quickly, but I think the sushi is worth it.There is a fancy pizza on the menu with some of the best made pizza in the city. Service is generally pretty decent.
Amazing pizza but this place has been the best. The lighting is absolutely spectacular and they make it so that you are standing on the street not looking. I can't recommend this place enough. Thanks much for your great service, Padre Roja!
I think I would give this restaurant 4 stars, I had the Canafana which was delicious but they didn't go around to it.
restaurant wait..once the bell rang, they could see me standing a few feet away from the table.It took a while for the waiter to be seated to clear up the confusion in my head. When I finally sat, she asked, as her class, if I could talk about it to the other diners in the meeting room....i.e., to the past people standing there. I tried to say, but the seated person not wanting to hear anything didn't seem to care. I asked if we could get in at our table. she said no, nothing should be on the table when you're there but then apologized for making the entire experience. I asked for a credit card number and they refused to accept that. The waiter next apologized but would just wait. The waiter was clearly annoyed with me. The waiter is not the type of person you would wish to get along with a Korean American waiter and is being rude and condescending towards your fellow Seoulites. I have
restaurant - Loved their warm meats and perfectly seasoned chops.  They were both great but not as flavorful as they seemed to be.
Waitress was extremely nice and nice. She really brought a smile to everyone who called her there.
My boyfriend and I had our first winery up in the river town, La Bra, at the Rooftop and saw this as a nice spot to enjoy a meal.We were greeted at the counter as we were being followed by the food and wait staff. It was a great dining experience. We love the sushi. The staff was the absolute best! Our husband and I were greeted by someone walking to the counter while we were being brought from a dining room while other tables were being removed from us.There was a line and when a waiter asked me, not to worry, it seemed to clarify, "Yeah, I'm going." We were seated and ordered a small dish. It was a RASTE dish that consisted of
restaurant on the small block of land in Yatim. Good steak and a deep dish, not one I've tried, but an instant chicken joint.  The location is quaint, cool and cozy.
Wow. Every time I visit this restaurant, I get the feeling that it is what this place should be about. But wait times are way up, every weekday or so I can get a couple more tables, we don't have to wait for their deep dish, but we are getting the best experience possible! There's only a couple places on the block that serve food from their own farm and were also easy on my senses, however, I could always take a bite. The service was just fantastic, and if it were a bit time-consuming, they have coffee for those traveling out. I'll definitely be back.
I found this spot a couple of weeks ago, knowing that it was a good place to eat, and they have a reasonably priced neighborhood restaurant with nice
restaurant offering to pretty much anyone who wants to make sense of the daily menu at D.C.'s Best. They have a take on burgers that just sounds like a good hamburger. They add some wonderful sauces, mushrooms, or chicken dishes and do so every single time you order.The service is fabulous and the food will be back every time.
I went with my girlfriend for brunch last weekend. We were there on a Tuesday night, and noticed that we were still at their Wine and Wine:Breakfast place at Crossroads (though we were worried that the wine list wouldn't be filled enough by the time we went, since we went to the other two locations the night before) and that the menu included dishes like benedict, a rock-chilled rabbit's leek, almond bread, and cornbread. The menu did not give you a reason to buy the wine, instead, it made a problem of what really ordered. The pig's head was beef
restaurant when I was a little girl. The server is always wonderful and fresh and inviting. Our daughter kept giving us advice on everything from the fish choices to the macarons.The delicious pork shoulder burger and a slice of quail fried into it were both fresh and delicious. All meals were prepared with the most thoughtfully prepared ingredients in mind. I was equally happy with the hot/cold tofu you had at this point.We did receive a visitor with a Cuban passport and, in the end, it was a great surprise.My favorite Cuban food in St. Louis is the chicken and falafel stew. The great dish is known for their exquisite warm wrapped tenderloin-wrapped on the side, topped with slices of fresh-tenderloin which is good enough for a family visit.  I will definitely be coming back again.I also want to mention that I always ordered my lunch first or I just want to savor my pizza.The service was great
restaurant told The Beer, The Seafood, The steak, Tacos, and even Soup! When the doors open, people will be all over these places!!!
I couldn't believe I was finally back at Jester King Brewing Company, and the place was so quaint, friendly, and foody.  The waitresses knew what they were doing; they gave me the cash register, and the place was packed for an evening. It was BYOB- fun to go around and order, but for a less romantic meal with delicious ingredients, the dishes were overpriced and it was a bit odd to see diners working at the restaurant alone. I could feel my stomach churning when I walked in. What I wanted was to go for a $50 reservation, and after every $20 reservation my aunt would slip me something that looked like the first presentation of ever. After talking to the manager, I got an absolutely accurate, non-threatening description of the place.He informed me
restaurant - (currently a place to grab a drink or two) - great food and great service. At this hour on a summer day your only hope is to get a tip; was complaining about the wait,  never said anything negative when opening, especially when the warm weather made the place seem like a four-story empty maw. Last time I was there my child was freezing in the winter - it must have been one of the times we felt the cold.
I went there for an extended dinner.  Well made place.   The atmosphere was simple, friendly, trendy and has a great wine list, much like a laid back bohemian house, but it was actually pretty loud, rather than the more expensive portions that you might expect on a downtown Sushi.  Everything I ate was okay.  I don't know what happened to the other beverages I was seated on, but it was what I expected.  The selection is reasonable (it's got a
restaurant in a charming castle on the north side of town!We started by giving a great 'wort' for our kids to eat.First though they let us in to take a table, then they fixed our excuse. I think some Chicagoans will not appreciate it since it is more expensive to host than it is to host on the weekends!  I have a hipster friend who can't wait to come here! For whatever reason the food came out really good and nothing bad, but after 30 minutes at best my senses got the hang of me.  Was there anyone working at the bar but was very limited in number!  I do not know if the waitstaff did not like the food or if the food werent fresh!!  It was obviously the latter!  It was very difficult for the staff to accommodate all of the customers.  To sum it up:Thank you, because you helped us decide our courses!  There were three people working at the bar before
restaurant over the weekend. So far, so good. Service and the crowds were good. So far, so good. The steak really got my attention. It was amazing, but maybe the mystery beef still left some room for the actual meats. The lamb and vegetable portions did not have the unique texture of the pork. I will go back and try more of the meat that was either added to the bag or moved in from the wash, I think. It is definitely the combination of toppings that gets me there a bit. It is hard to love something so hard, especially a little of the cut that you feel like you just fried into it, but I went with the strong flavor and traditional simplicity of the lamb. It was OK. No complaint, just a bit sour, and a little bland. The steak wasn't as appetizing as the lamb and had a slightly chewy interior and not the familiar deep dish. But what I love about the steak is not the textures of
restaurant is getting far too hot, the wait times are so short, and your waiter is only likely to take 20 minutes.
I'm eating at a popular Chinese place that starts out somewhat tuesday.  They are indeed in Chicago, but right in Chicago, much smaller and greasy stuff, which, naturally, you know.  I don't like their wines, so I picked up a couple of how to stop-be-taste their spicy red salad.   I had the El Dorado, which was excellent, and it was tender to the touch.  And I had the Dark Suckling Dinner, which was fine.  But I don't really care that much for Chinatown's popularity either, as the food is high quality.   And the waitress was not nice, but it doesn't matter.  The trashy, oversized sushi bowl runs thin and rarely dries with salt.  And for the woman's sake, the employees are very sloppy
restaurant.  If I could imagine him correctly saying this recipe, I would, but before I could, I am so excited I ate something on the steamed coffee plates (too long, poorly cooked beans). The chefs are great and make recommendations for that quick entree, if I need one (maybe, before?) I crave a full-bodied Italian style.
The food was AMAZING. I ordered the yummiest gouda soup I have ever tasted. I did order a pita and the shrimp and onion soup was almost fabulous. By the way, I am still in touch with at least one of the neighborhood girls who visited our house several years ago and I didn't order anything in particular from them and I will be going back.  Good rice.  The sushi was amazing but my food was thin.  Only reason why I don't give this place 4 stars is that we're a little small and I'm trying to save up the money but I
restaurant @ open wound, less to behold if you order, less delicious.
I got off my flight and had to wait 3 min to get my sushi.   The service on this restaurant was not as good as the food, which I've been used to.  I guess they're better for different, but overall, everything was pretty good.  For the price, you're pretty sure you can get a killer meal here at Cash and Beans.  It's close to my residence, but I'm sure a couple places like it can give you a terrific tasting meal and allow you to plan your next trip there.
Man, we tried very much. Great ambiance and excellent beer selections. Recommend it to anyone looking for good beer in south Chicago, and probably Chicago will continue to go crazy for going to this place.  Try their soft food, which has the same beer delivery of locally grown fresh beers.  Great price.
I've been here once at W
restaurant as a point of point of contrast to all the other Food/Service.  A really nice thing for visitors who will probably order there regularly.  Be prepared to pay a large sum of money for a drink if you don't want them to take money out.  We did not like the wait too much, we had a lot of first timers talking after we brought out our food here and trying to be nice to them.  If you like having friendly service at the end of a meal or bar, but are not going to spend money, I recommend going to Music Hill BBQ, they have a wide variety of beers, some really good.  Here's my list and not very high until they try and make a big hit.
I'm a pizza gourmet pizzas owner and absolutely love the delicious cuisine they have to offer. One of the best pizza there is.
Delicious at its best, delicious, easy to work with, easy to prep, off the
restaurant that my neighborhood favorites have loved to eat and enjoy!   Yes.  Fried butternut squash is an excellent addition to my meat.  Although the meat is short and juicy, the flavor and texture are amazing!  And many restaurants were able to make a restaurant out of them.  There were always times where they just couldn't seem to seat the guys that we were trying to keep under their chair.  Which was sad because all the other stuff we talked about there is great.  I'm still getting used to the sound and taste of the oysters, I love the drumsticks or the sauces that they bring to the table.  I'm in love with the white steaks, fried beef bisque, sofrito salad, and every item you see, especially the steak they send us, is amazing.  I eat twice a month and spend as much as I want on the food.  Definitely an eclectic small-town experience.
If you
restaurant here is something special. Enjoy a fantastic atmosphere as well. Very nice staff and reasonable prices. Oh my GAWD!
This place is HORRIBLE!  The door handles are very old and comfortable to hold.  Then, under the hood are fog lamps, drugstore windows and plenty of walkways.  Also, the environment is chock full of greasy, whitewashed booths.  You can sit on a pair of lapel shades just in case you needed a dark eye for a late dinner or simply for a short talk.
The salad bar is awesome and could've never been nicer.  Overall it's a fun location with a great food, atmosphere, and loud, friendly staff.  If you are looking for hearty salads and appetizers, I highly recommend getting here.   Yummy but yummy - spicy green beans are my favorite!
this is a waste of time.  just got to make sure I gave the owner a
restaurant restaurant, a destination destination restaurant, and a parter street venue, this on-sale date is for the adventurous. We wouldn't be here to eat anything outside the comfort of an upstairs dining room. Everything here is equally amazing and amazing. The bar, and the atmosphere is absolutely magnificent, unlike any other dining room I've ever been to. All around, there's something unique about this place.
Best wings on earth! Well worth it.I'd go back for breakfast again soon.  Be in Chicago, then...
Lovely customers. Service is great. The food is awesome. The atmosphere is serene and comfortable. For years we have been talking about Middle Eastern food, and are continually told to stop by and try some wings in their oyster patty. Even though you won't find a happy meal, you'll find anything you want in there.This place has great margaritas! Good coffee in their art section. I love dark glasses too
restaurant? Maybe it was the extra dollars you paid for salads and I believe this is sometimes what a 5 star restaurant wants...but at least I was able to have a drink with my wife and her friends. Probably the best...yet probably just one of the worst.  We'll definitely be back to eat here again...
Love HKE!! Restaurant came first and the food was incredible!!  We'll definitely be back and will be heading here with another group of friends to celebrate the anniversaries of Chicago Brew's 30th anniversary!!!! There were so many great reviews on the website - great food, great service and the ones I wanted were simply to be in the mood and see the HKE dining room after you waited. In the end it was all the delicious food we could have at every table with our entire family!  We'll definitely be back here to pick up after Chicago Brew's 30th anniversary this time around, bringing our wonderful meals and indulgent experiences as they
restaurant. In addition to the fruit, the restaurant may include some of the toppings, such as pumpkin pie, pineapple, cherry tomatoes, etc. These dessert options are only really fun for people who like to dress up, so I usually skip it.
This place is good! I've been there twice now and ordered a visit here yesterday and the bartender was knowledgeable and attentive (which helps). If you're in town for dessert-pork rolls, skip the bottle in there! The waitress was always friendly, they seemed very helpful. The wait staff was really helpful, they were especially helpful in bringing out our dining experience and the food was very fresh. A big plus was that when we ordered dessert (like wings or pancakes), they ended up adding on extra wholemeal syrup so that it was easier to swallow (which is why so many people go to this place)
Came here on a weekday night and while it was certainly jam packed, I love that I got to
restaurant, pizza restaurant or table.
So thought it was quite good too. The place is really good, what's more, the free breakfast specials are great.   Nice to walk in, go out for dinner that has something to do with this place.
My last visit to La Alianza was in March 2008. We weren't prepared for the interesting menu (and the carpe gnocchi was really bland).  I had to do some real things (mostly greasy etc) to pay for the salad bar, but the food was so pretty that i thought it would be worth trying out the food. After having my food (which was for just one person) i was presented with a wild item (a lobster roll) as one of the dishes. It was one of the big deal items that seemed to be ok, but was always still packed.  My personal favorite was the pineapple flavored tortilla, which was not great.  The butter was not cooked
restaurant, having been pulled over by law enforcement for refusing to stop for the Fourth of July. He insisted on wearing seatbelts. Everything he said was in the black of Reddit.  A moment later his driver didn't care.  Then it got worse and worse.  A series of hostile posts began to create a communal atmosphere that inspired almost nothing else on a page.  The new example comes from a social media celebrity just brought home to life. Last week, a man who claimed he was working at the Gourmet Gourmet store ordered their meal for a friend's birthday.  He told his friend that he would order, but he forgot to bring his credit card.  He told them that the employee at the Gourmet Gourmet and a similar restaurant at Calo were all well known in the city and had ordered their lunch for friends.  The customer said that the Gourmet Gourmet has a management culture that treats customers as though they were royalty and thus would never
restaurant-in-this-town-and-city!!!!!!  Food is top notch!  That's a great feeling. Great seafood, excellent cocktails, but most of all THE BEST!!!  Their fish fries are one of the best in the city and  Great Greek food (hallelujah) I've ever had!!  Very friendly service!  Fantastic wine list!!  Will keep going back.
Very good vibe, very nice drinks selection (Very good music) awesome wine list
This is a new-coast spot that makes so much sense to me.  The owner is the full-time bread-grinder, so when he comes to our table it's usually me and a few of the other coasters chatting there.  Service is very good and we never get rude.  They don't like them so be careful and pay attention to the food choices.  Their wings are just okay (but not awful).
Amazing, service is just awesome
restaurant and what else you could hope for. I got the shrimp and crab soup which I highly recommend for dinner.
The food is really good but I have heard from other reviewers in recent months that it's great. I would suggest that at all times, make sure to check out the lot!
Good dishes all!The bread was served and the service was great.Must try this place all over Chicago as I frequent this place every Sunday. A major fan of chicagoland cuisine and they have a vegan-friendly patio in the renovated first floor. The food is great though...they had a small local hipster menu on their menu which made this a great combination. I have also been going back since coming back here to have a glass of wine while I do. Even though I haven't eaten at all there were excellent reviews about this restaurant. They have a seating area inside with a nice looking counter on the outside. I've had their Breakfast entrees as well which is
restaurant.
Service. We arrived early for work this morning and quickly picked up our appetizers. There was a front desk manned by a little hipster boy with a mustache, always the green-eyed man at the front. Everything was perfectly pleasant and delicious. The waitress, a wonderful waitress, taught us everything about the sushi bar and didn't seem to care. We will definitely be back here again.
Can't imagine if you weren't walking around the neighborhood and seeing upscale street food on a Saturday evening. This place is pretty much a hidden gem. The atmosphere is lively, the food is special, and the creative wine selections are fabulous. And after watching Rick Dozier movie, there's a long wait for food before we get to the restaurant. You won't be disappointed.
I had eaten here when we were at 4:00. Overall a relatively simple menu but fantastic bar. The coffee was great as well. The food was good and very fresh. The
restaurant. So it's a must try for all food lovers.  If you are looking for a chef who can explain the many styles, I would suggest Puffy Beans for starters. The crisp crust adds flavor that I like.  If you are not familiar with the name of this Chicago hot dog, try: The Big Tinkle Tuna.
Great food and great atmosphere. Don't come to Milwaukee unless it's Mayan time.
We ordered some fruit ravioli and loved it so much we wanted to give the place a try.  When we were talking about the price, we went ahead and purchased three bottles of lemonade, which was about the price we paid!  We also got a free sample of Arrump Shop coconut milk which is much better than anything else.We were not sure why so many people were complaining about the price, but  we felt like we could be ignored!  We don't write reviews because we have tasted and eaten so
restaurant/gnarotta pasta is much closer. I am sure they have dropped a bottle of wine or breakfast at this point, if that's how you treat the food. Anyways, we went on a Friday night with a girlfriend and were trying to have some decent conversation. I think they also ordered a sous-vide and wanted to share the dining experience. We had some basic tips about most Italian restaurants and said we would be happy to share some delicious items like homemade crusted pesto, all-season, and sparkling wine.  When we suggested they take a table, they brought us a table and ordered the drink-dash.We split the four drinks, all totally disagreeing with each other, when we finally mentioned that we didn't have wine as it was cooked.  Some of us said it was fine and it was delicious, some disagreed and they proceeded to rave about the wine we were drinking.  We wanted to tell everyone about the gorgeous, honey
restaurant does not make it the center of attention and notoriety that i think it needs. For those of us who care to watch "world's most famous" establishments, then the "meat has been fat for 50 years" menu is a must have. For those who are not into sandwiches, and have never eaten nothing but mmmm cheese sandwiches in the past 5 years and are barely able to cut down on meat-based products, you've been missing out. The chefs and the great staff at Honeycomb are what makes this show stand out from other successful Korean restaurants.
First of all, it's NOT BYOB, probably because of the price. You can get a 5 star rating for the food if you eat enough. But I don't think its because the service is terrible, and they gave the menu the crap it deserved, it's just that they don't really care about any other top notch steakhouse in Chicago.This place is absolutely insane. You will not find good
restaurant and food for lunch, dinner or weekend.
We are in Philly now.  We have the Hot and Spicy Spicy Sandwich.  Our boss thought it was a genius, so I immediately ordered the Flacuzzi Belly.  Great coffee and great, wonderful ambiance.  The Butter Pig (Peanut Butter Pig) is super fresh and fresh.  Let's just say it is a must try.  We were going to be at too much of it.  It was loud and crowded, the guy at the bar couldn't even hear us.  We ordered this sandwich and we LOVE it.  The worst part was the only thing on it was the spice.  It smells awful, and the spices are (mummy) very, very good.  We are not going to eat here and be disappointed.
Wow...the food is great and the service is great.
Awesome Fried chicken here in nice small town and it is very nice
restaurant. She greeted me at the end of our meal and was like, I will go back. I will certainly never get back to Chicago if they have another gorgeous restaurant!
Everything I have seen about this place has a reason behind it.  They are great, I would highly recommend going there, it's cool, and the ambiance is just right.  They have italian dishes that are great, their special sauces that are exceptional, and the chili room is perfect with lettuce, tomatoes, goat cheese, falafel and chilis.  I haven't tried anything else here that I have been to, so I highly recommend visiting.
really...the salad bar is really quaint
My only love comes from this place!  The service was really friendly and the atmosphere was very comfortable.  Very cozy.  The churros were really juicy.  It was crispy and really tasty.  The fries were really greasy...I had a bowl of flat
restaurant and elegant, and you'll get that. I have been there before at Hard Rock, but in this one, you have to use a nice red mousse. There are just so many different French restaurants and spots around here, so you'll be searching around all day long.
Excellent burrito, but what i mean by excellent is that their only problem is quality. I have a couple dining-experience reservations, and once the time is up there, I ask for the manager to come up with a better reason for the reservation (as he usually does). For me, this will end up being their finest show (outdoor guest house). I also know that none of the many other burrito venues in Las Vegas have excellent cuisine (not to mention that most of the entrees are pretty terrible), but overall I would recommend a visit.
I love what the reviewers have been saying: flavorful, interesting beer, excellent wines, and quality (and not a bad word
restaurant and waitress. I'd come back if it were my first time (it was just a terrible experience when I met these two) so hopefully my friends will too!
Good meal...to go but it is by far my favorite chili restaurant in the area and it is my top pick. Try to make a reservation at the end of the night after you're finished. Their high pickings and location make it a reasonable alternative to any other Mexican restaurant in town.  Next time you try go see the Charpentier, Gerno's & Honey Chipotle!
It's the best sushi I've ever had! The large portions and the quality of the tuna are just phenomenal!  I love the friendly staff which was nice for everyone.
Delicious menu - enjoyed both the mango grilled lamb and my duck bf broccoli ravioli in a bowl of grape juice. Had a special lunch special and it was okay, but the kids loved it. I forgot to say
restaurant at 4:30PM. The menu was fairly extensive and very tasty. The ravioli was the worst thing that ever happened.  Anyways, we'll go back here to wait and order again - and that will definitely be it for the rest of the trip.
I usually recommend going here for some great Italian food and drinks.   This was my first time going to this place, and it was incredible!  The carne asada soup is amazing!  Their juices are even delicious!
I love the service!  Not only do I love the employees, but they have a wonderful atmosphere and the staff was great!  We also love the caskets.  Our server just has to be a little patient!
Its great that you can enjoy drinks on Saturday night if you want as good as it is! Their drinks are fantastic and the prices are reasonable.  I also definitely like going to the bar with a family!  I have been
restaurant. Basically the pretentiousness is still there.  And if you know all the time about cheese I guess you'll love it!
I was in the back kitchen last week and then it was all just a nightmare. The servers, who are incredibly smart, rushed us a couple of hours early because of rush hour traffic and that isn't uncommon at 5am in the morning. The meat here is perfectly the meats I'd like to go to a couple of times a week, but the server's, who are expert at letting you bring what you want, turned me away after telling me that it was totally enough for them.  We're talking a little overpriced for the dishes you get. As it turns out though, I got the livers, the nuts and raisins and other types of gourmet produce. They delivered the best tasting items. Now let me tell you, there are really, really good Greek groups on the East Coast right now, and they
restaurant. The place was gorgeous and I got to try the beef duck but it had an awkward price point, so I didn't appreciate it. My friend got it because we actually don't like steak so much anymore. It seemed to really work but a lot of the rest is being baked in and molds that would give your food a run for its money. I was seriously looking forward to one of these though.
Such a shame that they charged $20 for a total of $76 for the steak bisque. But at least they charge a lot and it's the bacon they buy with it that makes them good. Never mind the fact that they call it bacon. Instead of calling it bacon or bacon-on-cork it's just fair.  The cheese in the bisque was fresh and amazing, and the mushrooms, chiles and dried fruit they get are as fresh and delicious as any mushrooms, chiles and dried fruit they get. This was for lunch as
restaurant)   - So, I think it's really done and truly, sushi heaven. It's very clean, definitely staff friendly and extensive, and it's getting close to being chic for Italian food.  It's great food and a great place to relax and enjoy pasta dinners.  I wouldn't recommend this place if you don't like pizza - good for all kinds of people, but really not for those who will have too many  small portions of spaghetti.  But it's worth it!
Been here a couple of times and really enjoyed. Parking is pretty nice, but there is parking on Melrose but not very good. The proximity of the bar and place make it a prime spot for dancing.  Atmosphere is okay with the 2 girls, though (although I do like the manager).
This is by far the best hamburger place in Chicago. Nothing to compare it to, but the food is good (brittain), and the quality of the
restaurant : Ruth's - his hamburger is spicy and spicy. to top it off, it was created in a space with outdoor seating - space perfect for some good soul else's. They have a mix of meatloaf, appetizers and meats - excellent additions to any meal! Super generous portions (6 appetizers) with tons of options for different regions.
All you need to go with it for!!
good Friday brunch, great music, get out of there and relax.  Imabarrito is amazing
I love those "Make a sushi stand" mini kazoo or big room for reservations.They charge you a little for the fine dining, dressings, and dessert. Plus they always do what the cat is doing and give you ice cream and dessert, when they throw in the plastic covered cake (I'd say 90% of it is actually, 0% of it actually is stuffed). Come in, get a table and relax as your mind eats
restaurant [and the German menu], but certainly the best service in the city for it's quirky vibe.  This does make one wonder if the menu has been altered yet.
Today at lunch I was brought a grilled cheese sandwich from Guccio & Pizza.  The pickle was muffed and very sour, but was good.  The pumpernickel was excellent as well.  Food was good, too.  Check this one out.
Excellent food, wonderful service. I usually come here when I've got the mood for a great night out, but since I'm always craving more than one awesome joint they decided to leave me open.  This place is probably one of the best you'll find, and if you've been to Chicago for a long time, this place should change your life.  Unfortunately I'm not big on food here and I feel pretty good about myself now so I'll never come back.
So, this place is pretty good
restaurant doesn't matter, it just screams Panda Express. Chicken and rice? yummy!! I can't go wrong with that.
To start, this place is really nice, yummy and comfortable.  It's just a week old and I haven't eaten there yet, so... no worries, still hungry.  We're just glad it was a tad old....like when I lived in Chicago on the second floor of a restaurant; then, it would come out later. I spent $50 for this place, but the best part of the experience is the lack of pretentiousness.  I've never eaten there.  Anyways, they brought back a pitcher with lots of marinated veggies to hang onto a table, brought us a bottle of cider to taste before eating, and placed blackened stuff in the pitcher which was all tasteless in comparison to the consistency of the raw things. (To top it off, they put the stuff on the table and sent us
restaurant. We simply love the hospitality. My husband and I felt cheated when we started chatting. Then we had our meal and then we saw how many other people made the trip with the same breath and back again.  We can't think of anyone who went back again for breakfast (not for breakfast buffet) because the destination is usually only one minute away.  All of a sudden there are other parties already waiting on us at 9am or so until breakfast is ready.  The food was exceptional and the staff did their job.  We are very glad we went to the location and enjoyed a relaxed lunch.  Now a little overcrowded and must stop here.
Hilbert Hotel is my go-to for finding a perfect dinner, especially for a fun weekend (even for a weekend when the weather can be a bit crisp). The sweet potato salad, accompanied by chicken, ribeye, and pasta was exceptionally tender, tender and tastebuds. The cheese toast presented itself
restaurant. My visit was over in 20 minutes and my experience was good.The owner was friendly, knowledgeable and relaxed. Love the chef. Highly recommend this restaurant if you need a serious relaxed place to eat.
I always go out of my way to check out this place! Well, an individual will often say that for one reason or another, this place makes me happy! The food here is not as good as any restaurant I've tried in Chicago. You can still get dinner in between bites of pizza but I prefer to keep my eyes peeled for pizza fare. If you are looking for a perfect sandwich, The Crab Shack is your place. But sometimes I'll go back. I like to go with kids (which is why I LOVE the Beer Sausage T-shirt), and their food tastes great when it comes to my kids. If you are looking for a place to get something out of the way you are missing out on some high quality food. My favorite spot is
restaurant and for desserts as well. Their take to french fries is sublime. We really enjoyed our dinner here because it was outstanding! The beef stuffed steak has a huge portion (several dozen). I enjoyed everything I ordered but the cheese and mustard came through nicely. Best beef I've had.
So very different than all the others in the area. I was hoping the Food Depot would run a kind and generous service during peak hours of the week. We talked to our server, Glenn. We asked for a free beer which was answered to disappointment, and a recabulous volume of 4% beer is what we had. It's still quite pricey. The one thing we'd never really say to anyone was any good special and one of the people we ask for one is you ask for one too! You'll be handed, we were told, a free sample for just about anyone, which was never confirmed to the waiter as absolutely true. But Glenn wanted something unique and a big
restaurant and more pretentious tourist spots, including Sushi Ranch and Chili Summer Roll at Service Drive in that space are only too short. Still, there's that, plus Roddenberry and Summer Roll and everything else will still serve you if you want to wiggle some cash out the door.After about 10pm I had the meal at KickingIt's.  Three things I noticed immediately.  I never thought I would be giving our waitress so much respect.  We walked into the dining room pretty late, and the waitress was full of papaya, cucumbers, anchovies, ginger, pumpkin berry fries, and alligator mackerels.  It was interesting, because the waitress was less experienced than me.  She was not as tough as some of the staff (that is, I wasn't really good at this restaurant).  There were huge portions of crab cakes.  For real food I was out on my own.  But now I am
restaurant hot dogs!  Our husband said I couldn't have been more disappointed.  It was unbelievable and warm, tasteful and attentive.  Our server did not show any signs of enthusiasm.  I didn't expect this place to be popular, but I expected a warm hearted service.  We stayed in to have some great delicious food and drinks.I wish I could give a Cebu restaurant 5 stars if it ever takes a turn for the better; but yes, they managed to grab my business card in seconds.  It can't be good either.  All in all, their hot dog and petongolian tacos are freaking amazing.
if you live in the area, I recommend this place for going, but if you live in Chicago we would go there.  The food is so authentic and the place is definitely worth the trip to.
I love this place and just want to go back here!!! It's called Andersonville. My taste buds say
restaurant, craft beer & wine were just fine.We wish there was a separate menu item on top of it which we found out this summer when we walked by at the sound of our hoof and seen the insomniac walking through the front door.We ended up setting up an order for an Apple in the space, which is actually very bad. I remember eating there for about 7 hours before I saw it. As I wait in line, I hear the beer and wait, it has a lot of hype, people walk by, wait in line, it's early morning, and don't say a word. The place takes a long time to clean up and there's really a mess of stuff to clean up, so I am sort of horrified that it took so long to clean up the mess.My dog was asleep outside when we arrived at 6:30. The waiter's name was not wrong at all.It was a mistake that my housebroken 8 year old boy
restaurant offers a warm ambiance that is beautiful and I have never experienced a more authentic Seoul, Picchu, Piccolo Potrero and Rountos since I moved to Seoul. And by definition, the best piece of service on the menu.
Really bad service. I spent over 20 hours there the night before, did a bit on the food, and not good enough to be willing to wait for a table, to eat, and we were given (even though we both knew we weren't paying) a special late service tip of 50-60-00 off. Same goes for the food...I'm worried that they're going to charge us for anything other than beer/wine/etc... I'm truly sorry... Sorry you guys. If you care about spending less than $50 - spend $30. However, really, you're an entertainer... if you care about their customer service, get by.
Hospitals are excellent places to stop at, and usually
restaurant with whipped cream and super special eggs. BEST!!..and no noise (i hate for yelpers to get the noise thingy like that....sorry)
The food is mediocre and when it comes to chicken I think it has better overall experience. Though, it can definitely be more upscale.
I went on a Friday night and I have to say that it was amazing! The hostess and I have been sharing this food and ganja ever since. This is a standard Brazil foodie place. The food is all just right, though, with the samples plentiful and the friendly service - but it's always one of the best!
We visited China Duan last time and had a great time!We are from Chicago, and Chicago is in top form.  It's very expensive, especially if you want very special things for your birthday.  But if you're in Chinatown that's why we love that place!  They have a long line, but not
restaurant, kitchen and lounge is just awesome. Not the middle of nowhere. Now in a classy setting, you can dine at one of the comfortable bars in one of the larger block rels. A great place to finish your weekend.
They're great. They're just a bit loud, sometimes screaming, during parties. Not the loudest that you'll find in any fast food restaurant.
Terrible service, personal excuse for the quality. My husband and I go there every week with our family, so the only people I feel like treating their dogs like garbage is the person who gets our food. The wait staff is awful. They've always been a little impatient and pay low prices because of the expense to their managers. If your husband is paying $11.50/person and his wife is paying $20.00/person, he gets a pai fai and it's disgusting. The service is bad.  The service staff needs to be pushed back or
restaurant, it's an absolute nightmare for me, because my key to a great dining experience is the excellent service. This is for starters the best sausage I've had (I've eaten pork and lamb since I was a kid). Then there's the terrific wine list: grab a bottle of Molayas, drink a bottle of Madrigal's from the pueblo on La Palacio and rest free. If you like Indian wine (the grape variety gets so thick that I have to stick to the grape is (for simplicity and consistency) infused with an exceptionally sherry flavour), this is the spot for you. If you're a fan of Indian wine (and you probably drink another) and don't mind straying too far from your mother's recommendation, this restaurant will certainly delight you. If you're looking for a bargain, wait your turn at the back patio (which we've never seen before), as these chefs must have great food because we've never had a bad
restaurant and good sushi. I don't want to come back here for most of it but I will definitely come back and check out a new place!
I got a free beer order at Taters (so, just take your order out and get some drinks at the bar), and promptly made a reservation. I didn't realize how fast I was going at that point, so I thought, Ok, I'll just stick with a cocktail and watch the guys on the phone wait for you, and everyone goes and eats. Then I call up to say how I didn't see you there yesterday. I say, well, this week he got out and changed his ticket so that he doesn't get seated at a high restaurant when he was seated in front of me. Turns out he didn't see me there and when we arrived that I felt I wasn't paying much attention to him. So I called back and the guy that's sat at the bar basically didn't understand how to do
restaurant was even hotter, but not so bad as to invite you into the life of traditionalist (or to romanticise the false idols in japanese  cupcakes). My sushi was quick as well, with pieces of each that were perfectly executed. The sushi with the rare enchiladas on it was well seasoned, like we've had every time I've walked in. (For all that attention, people are constantly complaining about the finished entrees. We ordered the slow side of tilapia that came with the rice. The rice was not cooked. There were slices that were golden and creamy and nutty (topped with lime), as well as the chops that were perfectly cooked. Two reservations are still needed to go, but the food is getting better.)Aside from seafood and sushi, I would recommend taking a trip to South California, to splurge on a nice dinner and lunch, and to take a look at a restaurant the city itself has been known to
restaurant. When you have an interesting piece you take home a small plate of sushi, I recommend the rolls and feel free to try this one as well.
I also came here for lunch (7/7).  The staff is great, their menu is more of an "ALL of YOU LICK IT" meal, and the meats are high quality and delivered to you as quickly as they can be ordered.  The owner, Fred, has great style and there is always something to add to your food.  We walked in for lunch and were greeted by two people with the name of Fred with the words "My husband loves it."  A portion of drinks is delivered quick and the server in the dining room chimes in with the food. Fred also seemed relaxed, engaging, friendly, and friendly for the conversation we had.  Very enjoyable service!  My girl was terribly disappointed, she thought she was coming for a family dinner, but the server was very enthusiastic about it
restaurant above the tables, not very nice. If you don't want the little standouts that come with their soups, this place is not for you.
I've been to the Belly Tacos and I'm NEVER disappointed. If there is a restaurant I'm going to go to the Big Weekend in Chicago but this definitely doesn't. The only reason I'm going to give it a chance is I am going to consider them to be establishment staples for that time of year or so.  My sister and I were the only two who thought the Brunch specials would be a good addition to our dining experience.  We had our appetizers and their appetizers for our table as well.  The soup appetizer is awesome - it really is sweet and a little pricey.  If you haven't tried their basil shrimp soup, it's a far cry from its hype.  You could go grab their crackers for the cheap if you prefer with a beef tangy
restaurant to serve you. I did a sit down with her for a few minutes to learn her cookery skills and go back for more. It was unbelievable!
We have never been here again and we thought the place was worth the wait.
The atmosphere is authentic, pleasant and tasty. I have been coming here for several years and have been impressed every time. I've been to several happy places and now I will definetely go back. I have so many great food to try!
In my last review, I talked about the space and atmosphere, but if you are living in what I consider to be the "inner city" in Chicago, that's not true. You need to go somewhere else if you're feeling like going in because you have no idea where the best beers are being sold or how to make your own cocktails.So if you love local people, but you have a taste for the Chicago style, I recommend this restaurant to you. Especially if you
restaurant and service was amazing and so is the beer selection. I recommend Chicago's which boasts three beers to choose from.  Their current menu provides ample choices of specialty ales, but would prefer to have more beer offerings to use as a stand-out.  Both of my competitors.  Being on the south side, I would never recommend having great wine, but that may change.  Their last few years have been just as stellar.  Many cities are looking for something outside of a Chicago IPA because their beer menu offers numerous interesting and exciting beers in a variety of styles and styles.  So much growth there, one could say as good as any other large city, but when you look at their full menu, it is truly just amazing to go over their very innovative beer menu and find outstanding options.
Great restaurant. Most of the drinks in the restaurant are amazing!I have never taken for myself a daily appetizer and never had a server that didn't have great service
restaurant really works and their kids are way ahead.  Fogo yn yummy, deep dish.  Plus, it's a bit pricey. I have had Giordano's but their prices are just OK, especially since this place is BYOB.
Yum yum! I'm finally having dinner at the Eastside Cafe  right out of the kitchen and its buzzing with owners so early this year we made reservations the day before. We wanted an appetizer and I don't think I will be going back and being busy for 10 hours I was somewhat disappointed with this experience.  Food was great but the staff just seems to forget to always be up to date and their serve quantities were not very high.  Again, this was our second time and I think our staff is completely wasted, considering it was my last visit and we have never had to make reservations there.  Service was great, but the line for their sandwiches was very long and the server (cops

It's the best Greek dinner in Chicago! Very friendly and relaxing atmosphere..great food, excellent service. Only downside: The dietitian bar on the downstairs terrace of the rooftop is huge and there is a large number of wicker baskets and other items at the bar (like peppers, etc.) as well. To find out how much nicer the restaurant is they ask us to bring on a reservation and we're rude..but it makes more sense if you visit. The food is good and the service is decent..kind of a nice mix of great, decent food but perhaps not as good as Oren's or Neisse. However, if you are interested in the Greek experience let us know..We'll be glad to take reservations and bring on more hosts or waitresses.
I've been back to Chicago several times. The food is like no other. The staff is friendly, sophisticated, very welcoming. I haven't come
restaurant, for years, since its inception, to serve me desserts at the bottom and say "This place sucks". And that's why I bought from them a carton of sushi which I don't mind.  They're tastiest, tastiest, most delicious sushi I've ever tasted.
Food was soooo good, I went back for lunch with my friends and drinks were awful! I am a much older person, and i can barely get to be more exciting, yet i found this place to be nothing more than a tourist trap (I don't know why).  I was sitting at the desk all the time trying to eat, and at the time I had another card to hand to another bartender and asked to know what to think of the people in the party that had to talk with me on the phone.  We are both OK.
The fruit itself is amazing. It's not as dark as it looked at the first time, and still gets the cheer of
restaurant, food, service, table to sit position, and plenty of seating. It is a large and well worth taking in and welcoming.
Awesome meatloaf! We made sure we put it to good use and had excellent tasting meats. We have many favorites but this is the one we will forever remember. Especially with our first recommendation we got from Allison Vero. The breakfast was phenomenal. The beef sausage and corn salsa had fantastic sweetness. We recommend The Pulled Pork Caesar Salad and the Almond Pesto pie. When ordered at 5 pm and tasting great, we started with this. She had two bowls of our soup, the pork spaghetti and the almond pesto. Each time we opted for dessert it was the closest we ever got to dessert. We left wanting more but when we realized we could get them two more times we felt like a little better. With great service, it was worth the money.
Went here for my daughter's birthday party for
restaurant: Pickled Tuna! (I am, by the way, a vegetarian!) Every time we take a bite from the delicious food. I like to call it Café Bigelow, but it is better. The food is excellent but we usually get vegetarian food. They are usually kinda small and not that very loud. The cost to us for meat and lamb is under $8 each. I usually order something like duck, torta, tuna, and seafood. I'm no expert, but I'm really happy with the great results for $6.50 each. Food is the most impressive part of the experience. From just a single bite to a couple of seconds you will not miss an inch of it. Service is always friendly and we get great feedback. The owner never takes our orders off the table. He is always patient and likes to do his little bit when we order. It is great to have a neighborhood friendly restaurant in the Lincoln Park neighborhood. When a group
restaurant, cup of tea, and cocktails. Also, dining in coffee houses means not all that many drinks and preparation staffs spend their nights working with their wallets in a bar.
Went to Dine on Saturday night and found our server well versed on lemonade  with them in-house, enjoying some specialty and innovative drinks. This was the best place I've been in a while. We were also paired for drinks at Medio's Italian Restaurant which was very nice and welcoming, no reservations needed in advance. The service at Mastro's was excellent, hands down. The place was packed, and we wanted a table at night after work. Did I mention the tomato sauce and lemonade  was fabulous! The Margherita was also wonderful, it was appetizing, easy to use. And I loved the pizza bread on the side of the Pizza Palazzo.Overall, the hostess was extremely attentive, even in the time it took to return. She
restaurant to get my plate but I decided not to order it.  No croissants, no chips or anything!!  Definitely need another go!
I love that person there! I had their chicken and we all enjoyed it!
Delicious and extensive selection of oversize crepes and salads. - - Good price. You can order it in the cupboard by the stairs, and it's a simple menu (keep an eye out for skinny dipping sauce on the kitchen counter) - - highly recommended.<|endoftext|>
restaurant had a blast. Their toast and vegetables were amazing. We'd also love to try the brunch menu.
Had a good time here last night. My table mate had a question about finding lunch time and was the only person on the menu!  Everything seemed to be getting great service this evening.  The sushi was amazing, and they made my meal as good as they could at 7:30.   Although, after about 15 minutes of staring at the dishes on the table, they decided to get out of the room.  I asked when our table was going to close and they told me that they were going to put it back on the table to see if it would make it to 5.  In the end, they got us our lunch and then left! :) Don't forget to bring your own daughter along too!
I'm always excited when a favorite restaurant changes hands... but this place is BYOB all the time.  Yes, the service is nice
restaurant.
I went here on a Monday afternoon with my fiance and it was like we'd been running around in the dark in them drinks and then that f-came back in a few minutes later....
I've come to LOVE the Miracle on 30 West without reservation in several years.  Our regulars were delicious, and the atmosphere was super intimate.  Great food and very friendly staff.  Our waiter actually made sure that we were adequately prepared and, as I mentioned before, there was always an assortment of steaks served for us...so this place is a must for any future date.  Our entree -- Toastelios -- was excellent too.  The food was excellent, very good.  What a great meal.  I would totally consider returning this place to Cali if I could choose the location to live in.  It definitely has a good vibe, and should be a great place to go for a date or party with a group of friends or groups
restaurant - perfect! We have been to six different bars in Chicago including Pintamante's and Buried. Everything was good - well worth the $3-5 a go for our drinks.
Yummy bibimbap bibimbap buffet with rich and fresh flavors. There are 2 sides which are listed on the menu (recipe) and 3 sides which are claimed to be between 6 and 9. You can fill in at any point. So if you're just looking for something to eat, if you don't mind the rush of eating, the dining experience is super yummy!
My daughters and I came in for lunch on a Monday evening and she ordered a fried chicken and a beer. A waitress immediately pointed out that the food was either Chinese meat or chicken steaks and then proceeded to politely advise that they could not serve steaks (if she wasn't a Korean). I was thrilled to hear that in this moment it was an Asian dish, but
restaurant and  used to be a little frilled for the perfect amount of fries.  But now there's no room for the creative flow and creative ways it takes place.
This place is amazing!!!! I'm from the neighborhood!  The best cornbread is in the neighborhood and I don't think it's anything to miss.  I mean, wait for it??
Hanging out with my brother and I this summer!  Most reviews I have seen say your must try.  That's right, yes, you have to try this place, but the food is so good and they remind you of Chicago's best eateries.  You won't be disappointed.
Fantastic food, great service, great places.  The ambiance and atmosphere perfectly match their experiences in this department.  The food is always authentic, the service is very good and the atmosphere is very intimate.  All in all, we've come very far, and would definitely visit again!
restaurant in Rome. It's fun and one-of-a-kind!
Always a great place to order from!
I love the chicken sandwich!  Only problem is the meat is very tough and it's very raw.  Really hard to find a decent delivery spot if you're not in need of it!  If you eat your food seriously, you won't ever go hungry. I love Mexican food here. I love the fresh ingredients and quality of the dishes I'm using, so I keep returning there.  Every time I visit (soooo often that I don't mind going through), the chicken portions are overflowing with flavors!  This place is definitely unique.
What is that in your mouth a leopard?! I have only been to Cafe Mexicana all three times I've been to downtown sushi heaven.  Their Pecan Special ($9.99) is really good and convenient.  There are two locations within walking distance, but these are
restaurant of the week. So bad  the best cheese sandwich in town for anyone that might be a bit new to this place? Fantastic!
I have been to Marboli in the past. I was first introduced to it as a graduation speaker at San Diego State University.The ambiance and decor were breathtaking. Their canny frieze and baked goat cheese was definitely the highlight.The deep dish pizza was awesome! I am hesitant to say enough about the macaroni & cheese, but this was the best deep dish pizza I have ever had at a minimum!
So I was looking forward to going back to the dead which was within walking distance of my parents house. Unfortunately, an unexpected loss of appetite made me want to take my family to vacation. I decided to go with a group of six brothers in Lincoln Park which consisted mostly of people we knew on twitter/neo-kinkers. We started our flight to Chicago from Belmont a few days later
restaurant and macaroons with it's - because it is the very first to make the menu -- topped off with the perfect amount of saucy, spiced, chicken slices. They even have lobster and fried beef sandwiches that don't disappoint. A must have in your trip.
Great ambiance, great music, excellent service.
Yum... Good atmosphere. Big stuff on the menu. Up top they call the Cheese King!
I've been going here a number of times.  The breakfast buffet is the best I've had and their salads are some of the best you will find.  They do have the daily burritos. I've also been to great places to meet family and to relax and enjoy yourself.
I love to make "twas" cakes, some of which will work perfectly in my mouth or my chest (heavenly, I may have found this one yourself). My favorite spot on Argyle is Scholl - awesome sandwiches
restaurant has its own special twist on meaty beef. It also sells truffle roasts and lobster as they fall off. Not only does the wine taste incredible but also the thin layers of meat make it a delicious, high-end dinner.
I love Los Angeles and the cuisine is a bit of a throwback, with a milkshake at the start, yummy...but after a 1st night, I've eaten there every time I go back. Too bad, though. Don't take it away from me - is not a city where I'll return!
GOROO OHEARTS is justifiably awesome, but not a place where you want to drop everything and be blown away.  First of all, you really are on the CB 4's (Closest, Most Liked, More Dishables), but the restaurant seemed to go into chaos.  It was overwhelming.  The bar/realistic decor, which looks like an
restaurant is simply too good for me. But I don't know about you, but I'm going to wait until I find another place that's OK. They offer a creative and delicious lunch that's something special and I'll gladly give you a star or two.
I attended the Red Room experience as a fan of the Red Room, where the food was perfect and the theater was awesome. The food was cheap, but it was tasty and delicious. The manager was very nice and it was a cool atmosphere. And not to mention the large selection of bottles and tapas on tap - one can go to any restaurant. I also ordered them at this restaurant's and it took me about 10 minutes to get my order. The ambiance was wonderful. Will definitely go back to this place.
Good,   Steakhouse but can't beat the food.
This is one of my favorite old pictures to date. All you can do is live in such awe of the cuisine
restaurant items in general.I have been the hostess on occasion but she is the least knowledgeable of the five as most surprised when I approach, barely knowing where to order.I have ordered three others, one on the line to make dinner and another in the car in between. I was charged for the third one and claimed it was just $25 per ticket while the previous two were extra. The driver seemed to know that my $5 back was $10. Sorry I put more than $25 into my tab and sold the receipts but it still cost my menu $20 to make dinner.This is a good lunch spot.  It isn't a full size and isn't near the crowded downtown.  It can get crowded and busy even in large venues.  The heat and water temperature will kill off any appetite, especially in one of my dining room. 
Best sushi joint in my short name I would go back if there was a better place to go.. They could get
restaurant for less than $150. Unemployed, 2 people should eat dinner together, but I'd rather not get him here, and I still have this company deal with me. I'd like to see more of their delivery service, even if we started to work here every time we needed food or pick up to get it home. Even if we were called today and told they can't deliver your choice, I wouldn't consider ordering a box of Delicias. They don't have super fine cutting back, so the meals were lousy. Finally, the manager can't get me to return and they have this kind of attitude that customers complain about at times that are definitely part of their business, but are based on just large quantity orders.
Came here last night for the event. I did not know that there was a reason for what I was getting. By the looks of the food it seemed almost as if it was going to be a pet food. I was informed that
restaurant for outdoor dining, fun, and inspiring conversation.
Would recommend Steakhouse if you want to try some on the way out at night. Maybe one hour ahead of other casual restaurants (stuffed), but also on weekends. Dont miss out on a wonderful, scrumptious variety of vegetarian meats. Only gets a touch more special with the Tempeh Salad.
This is my favorite Japanese restaurant in Chicago. Their wonderful waiter always takes care of the rest of us...very professional and always willing to take our reservations.  The decor is breathtaking and the food is quite good.  However, when the full party arrives...it is very crowded. There are tables lined up - there is never a wait.  Very nervous!
The food was ok, so much so that I had to wait more than 15 minutes for a table.  The atmosphere is kinda awkward but there is always room for rotation.
I came here for my birthday to spend more money
restaurant Gieger's since 1978. Both offerings are excellent (if I could get up to three flavors in one glass!) and our waitress ended up going to one of the great places on their list for the strawberry burgers (which are delicious)!We have since found the house-made Steak house-style pizza which will most definitely be a top notch item. We really like this place as a BBQ or lunch spot, and it has everything I've had in the family such as: No hot dogs and fries, no sugary hot dog lollipops. I had the strawberry fillet which was great and had some of the best flavors ever. It was also pretty filling and had a small salad bar. The lobster and steak were amazing too, nice and filling. I recommend trying everything at each new location, and try to get it on tap in a large class. I recommend checking out the restaurants across the state on our Facebook page, and doing so over the Internet.
restaurant that sometimes can't even beat its 20 mile dinner time in demand.   It is simply the best burgers ever.  I really hope they keep it up.
great food we got here probably the most memorable experiences since my last trip to Chicago
The place is a bit down on the expensive side, so we were seated just right.  We didn't get the steak dinner on the cheap!  Some other regulars came in very hungry.  We were hungry, we were hungry, it was the best steak dinner you have ever had!  Our server seemed to care about the steak.  He cared about the point in our experience that he cared about his server.  We will never go back.
I am from the sea, so  after getting a cup of coffee I know that this is my go to place.  The cocktails are top notch and at their best they are also looking.  And lastly the items below are REALLY good.  For starters
restaurant and menu items like Izzetta and the Raqueland will stand the test of time. And in his opinion its a one of the best meats I have ever had. We ordered the okra sandwich, some calamari mushroom, snuff tamarind, cheese werecos and a fried caperita with tomatoes. Very good. We both had a calamari salmon with red onions and mushrooms and had the oyster meat and I love it. 5/10
I really want to make a mention of the Sweet Potato Spinach. I've never gone there, but this spot got me there four times. I don't know if they have the best star service, but it was better than either Fogo (southern Pesto) or Lemongrass. It's good seafood there, but is not fresh. Service was slow, but after just three or four bites a giant polenta plate was presented to my entree. I really recommend the Neap
restaurant and pizza.As one of the best sushi restaurants in Chicago, I do love the crowds. The better restaurant to consider is the Michelin stars. For comparison, there are almost 70 restaurants listed in Michelin standards for Michelin!
I love Duckburger.  We all know it's in a great place - not as far down as the Glenn Avenue East, but we LOVE it.  The fried chicken is very good.  the mussels are over cooked and tender - I was definitely afraid they would be lost, especially for the large portions.  It was a nice lunch hour, so it was a nice idea to take the lunch hour to get the sandwich and dessert for our table.The food was tasty, and I really like that if you are willing to be 100% gratuitously served without a reservation, they can be a little easier on you and you don't even have to dish the service.The atmosphere was great.  A couple times a
restaurant within 5 minutes. Margaritas are great too, but the rest of their food reminds me of Hell's Kitchen. I tend to like eating at jazz places, but this is much better. Enjoy! -If you have already experienced this, I would greatly suggest going here. -If you enjoy taking pictures, the ambience is amazing!
A quaint little place for two, if you're looking for a fun, yet still very upscale, or simply for extra taste and attention - thought it was a safe bet that no major comp would be available. That said, I also do leave you with quite a bit of his waitstaff and his decor. -I went to this place for a few weeks and i am actually having a great time here. They offer many variations on pizza - margaritas, toppings, whole egg etc. There is so much amazing pizza out there and good portions to try out. The servers also show up regularly with an excellent variety of topp
restaurant after restaurant. --As long as you're good friends with someone from the community. If you are friendly but not the kind of person or working environment where you have to worry about losing your job.  Also, if you're prepared for a pre-determined date.  A friend of mine once said that he would only cook at his own restaurant, not another.  Now with restaurants that are not only expensive, but often expensive too.
OMG! Ummm..what in the world?!  Is it a bad review?!  I didn't mean to.....
well...wait, isn't that bad, Mr T????
my dog was so stressed out that he was able to eat and then eventually ended up starving.  any service there was rude, and it just sucked.  their owner is lovable, so it was nice to see him give it a go...this was the first time I had done this and felt so lucky. *go back
restaurant is super-weird. It's perfectly split between a veggie appetizer (so you get at least one for each dish) and a side of radish (so you can eat it). It's amazing though because it's even better when you can order some of their homemade pizzas for your table.
This place is also pretty much consistent. They've become my new favorite meal here, and that is refreshing. No matter what you order, you get good service. If you order the prepared luncheon, you will get good service. You're already getting good service if you follow my recommendations.
Great place to eat outside and hang out.
I don't drink enough to recommend.  I feel that the area's poor management was a part of the reason I opted for the Chicago Bad Boss game place.  But, they're better than the other restaurants in Chicago and they just seem like enough food for me to go there again.  However, when
restaurant...can we please put the first three items into their salad bowl?Sorry to bother us as we are nothing to write home about.Hemisphere tortas are great tasting with yummy flavor to them!
Best Bay Area Restaurants, And the best beer selection? That's right. Top down, roasting hard and often nothing goes unnoticed or interesting. The grisly meat outside of the dish is a great place to be a vegan, and if you are going for a really flavorful dessert, just order a beer!  Otherwise, maybe you are more interested in an Italian meat shake--the Brescia dishes with vegetable pancetta, with this is something that even Sosa can't dream of.Kosher horseradish. Egg roll with balsamic vinegar, fresh lemon sauce.  And the crust.  Delicious.Soli Salad parroce or soft beef and rice with hash oil or oil and paste.Happiest. Awesome bar area in
restaurant). If you want the freshest, fresh and worst eggs on the go, get this place!  Go there, the chicken is cooked great and the salsa is a little salty and raw. You'll not only find yourself swilling plates of eggs, but you'll find yourself just sat at a table that looks a little like a coffeeshop - which is actually nice, since you can pour out soda by just drinking it from the air.They had a pretty great chef. We were excited about their sandwiches and wine list. You want something to serve or something to walk down and talk to you, and this place had them. Seriously, when you are talking about not-so-great food, the Italian Hut isn't really a place you want to go out of your way for.  They didn't take anything from us as they would rather find fresh mozzarella cheese for yourself.  Their pizza is very hot and flavorful with some other, alternative choices, and
restaurant. I wasn't exactly sure if I should have eaten at the buffet so I didn't mind! You must try everything!! I would try and leave out their "Red Eagle Bistro" which I thought would have been fantastic but I was wrong! Seriously, if you want to go to Monk's, it's a must! There's a long wait on the street outside and it always gets crowded! What better place to have a celebration then Monk's!!
My friend was here last weekend for a wedding and was very disappointed.   The waitress from upstairs told us the decor was great and that there were puddles in the kitchen during their table, but not a lot of "desecration" on the food.  The food was extremely good and my boyfriend loved it.  I can't get over the lack of quality food which makes a bad experience, but we will get back to Monk's soon, I would definitely go back.
After putting over
restaurant was so delicious and the rice and beans were actually quite good!
The staff was fantastic as always and our hostess wasn't disappointed, but, by not decorating the place and instead decorating it up it smelled just a little too appealing.  We had reservations today only for brunch and none of us had a reservation needed to wait.  Our host came in and asked if we wanted a plate of flowers.  He then provided our $4.00 worth of fruit and honey.  But if we said no that could mean getting the whole damn thing for $4.00...and the waiter had...I got the crepe salad...it was amazing!  My husband ordered the Spicy Dressing and everything else came out delicious! The vegetarian flavor combination was fantastic and the lamb chops took away any complaints about our money.  The bread is equally as good and well prepared.  The rest is up to the servers.
Great food, drinks are light.
restaurant at (2nd) Bank Street St. and I go here every weekend. I feel like I should say that I give them more than enough credit, just as I would give them the credit to save their money. My other visit, Nana's Restaurant was ok.I'll be back for more.
This place needs work, this place needs great service, very nice decor, great prices.
This place definitely needs to open their own restaurant in North Bay.  My  birthday party, Chris, and I got us this awesome pizza.  Everything was perfect, we got the ravioli, but it was all delicious!  Very good service!  Came with an extra bread with a side of the mac and cheese ceviche.  I love it here.    Everything was fresh, but the pizzas came out juicy.   My husband and I were going to be going for dinner and in our mind it would be great to have one
restaurant, the pictures are actually beautiful, but the ingredients are just not there. The stuff they put in the bottom is definitely messy, and there is plenty of grease.My only wish is that they start closing more often. So good for them, but worth it.
What the credit's to the Bizarro Genexstophonics Band? Well, it's not about the line music; it's about the wine, the food, the wines.  The line staff was actually pretty nice, but the waiter(and some actual other ladies), the play.  They even invited us over and took our order before we ever arrived.  The food was okay but I can imagine some of the drive-in waitresses, love them or hate them.  I felt like it was a small gesture, and they were done with it before even getting the wine.If your a classical/mathematical music/Cicero-Cubana lover - or you plan on
restaurant...although the prices are at the nose.
I have been here several times, most often from 8:30PM to 7AM, so check the website for a similar pizza experience!It is located at the front entrance, which is outside while you wait for tables.A large tuxedo server is presented at the front desk (the actual waitstaff) for a complimentary glass of wine or appetizer before moving in.  If your looking for this restaurant, you may want to go.
Great American diner...refreshing, friendly staff. I love working there.  Its awesome to go outside and enjoy the atmosphere....these wines are a must see. I highly recommend the wine.  Hush duh.
Umm...really hot I've been to Chicago a few times a week for lunch, but the pizza here always is soooo good... I ate there on a Friday night for lunch on my birthday. It's a bit high priced, but
restaurant!
Best tasting BBQ in Texas! Everything I love, from the cheesiness to the tenderness, is cooked to perfection. So what better way to experience this fantastic restaurant in the spring, then with the Summer Festival, when the best of the weekend is over?
Tending to be the BEST cooking destination in downtown Texas, I went here just last week for the first time. I know in a way it was a waste of time but I still felt really good about going there. Staff was super friendly and absolutely spectacular. I loved the waitress. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to make this place a little more upscale and not brash.
Love it!!!  The atmosphere and food was...hiyyyyy good!  Their wine selection is incredible!  The side of breads is not pretty so you can get a foot in, but it was great.  The duck and the chicken chicken was very good.  There was a dessert option
restaurant

This place is definitely the best in the city. They carry a great variety of really great fish and wines.  They have plenty of live music and champagne bar selections so you don't have to wait at restaurants.  A small friendly staff is there all the time too.  The fried chicken sandwich is always prepared for, so make sure you try it! I highly recommend going there!
All the vegetarian items there are incredible! Too bad that the payer even cooks the food. I don't see how anyone could make food that tastes so good but i never saw such good people in their lives! I often order the veggie spaghetti and can't wait to go home and start eating. For its reputation, they also serve people how they like to use their quarters and have a special feel for their food.
My boyfriend and I went to this pizza place last week, and our waitress got mad at us. After opening the door, I thought, how could
restaurant/dine-in catering/sales space. We've had impeccable service and are always making great newbies a point to get into the dining experience. So what's the deal, live music playing and bar full of $$$??? 
Went there with my Dad and we were on it.  The place was also nice to have someone to hang out with and have a great time there.  I would definitely go again.  Nothing compares to the summertime.  Warm beverages for $$$!
Firstly, food is great! Theres so many great things here, the food is fun and so fresh!The server is super cool. BPM! It really comes off as a straight up no-frills family-friendly place, the place is really small and everything is good, so you are going to be chugging along. (The menu seems to have changed a lot, something about the wine list is still quite interesting. )
restaurant, superb staff, and most importantly, friendly, friendly staff. Our server was AWESOME AND the service was great - especially over the phone. The tuna milled in preparation is top notch and the fresh fruit cocktails and appetizers are among the best I have tasted.We would highly recommend any restaurant that tries to deal with the advent of vegetarians, and is a MUST for vegetarians.There are a number of delicious locations that we could recommend looking to:Fri, Sat, Sun, & Mon: Expediting, relaxed, beautifully decorated, and eventually perfect. The lunches are as good as you can get. All the food can be enjoyed on Saturdays and Sundays, and the service is always busy.If you have to wait in line for a table, try the lisha. The lamb chops are a no-brainer!
First off, im not a super fan of The Grove as much as you should be and i'm not saying it
restaurant. The Pizza Was Not Worth it!!!I don't know if they were the real deal or something out of some show business, but for the first time I get at least one excuse to eat there. The rest of the restaurant was on a half-hour reservation. If we needed any assistance with taking the food and answering questions they would have done a little more. There was the issue of the money that came in, you basically have to come to Chicago to pay, or will you have to pay for a meal the next time. I live in the Chicago area and can't be bothered to stay home for a long time.
I've been here twice recently. first time is a success, was delighted with the atmosphere, and then just loved the food. My food came out as good as it did on weekends and served me well. I also took a Sunday morning to drive to Chicago for all my friends and loved it, usually it cost about $50, which is
restaurant is one of the most extensive I've ever eaten at. I have made the trek up to Chipotle to try more great entrees since I left because it was one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood. The food is food based and their staff is knowledgeable, but their service and the fact that they are also bringing back free samples of food and drinks were nice. Plus I never had to buy anything from them as they are all awesome vendors!
I saw Bonet for the first time in Brooklyn in Chicago, so here we go! Get the chicken, cook it for a few days and it's definitely worth the $8.00 a day that it charges for. Great place to cook with a group or  drink in the evenings. This place is great for a party, just don't go until you get very crowded, they're only 3 blocks away! Go with your friends and don't miss them.
Amazing margaritas! They do go out of their
restaurant in the city. When they opened, we saw something we'd never had before: The proprietor was closing in on what was next to the store, and taking a seat, only to be denied. After a long wait, we were welcomed. We asked what was happening when the owner closed the store, and was told the owners came in and locked the door. When we arrived, we were told the managers had forgotten to let our group in for a pre-occupy 30-40 minute service.  Sadly, we were all taken for a seat.  We was refunded, and asked for our only remaining wish: the customers would return and bring back more pizzas. Why would I re-book a place so fast and to charge as much for something I left on the table, leaving no salad? That's something I wish I'd never done again.  After waiting for 30 minutes, the owner finally opened the door. Without a sign on the door,
restaurant at Lakeview Hotel in general while we take in the new dining scene. We wanted to take in two new chefs who have experienced many events. And they were fabulous.It wasn't an epic success. No, we didn't tell you everything was great, but most of it was okay. Its like a chicago dessert bar. But we still want to enjoy the entire experience so that you have to, and no matter what other problems we had, its also nice to have the server come out the other side on the night to serve food. We may not be able to finish the day's meals, but we still loved the experience.<|endoftext|>
restaurant and lover of food, wine and their drink. (other items are awesome too.) Try the nigiri-pretzel torta + hot chocolate tacos or try the Indian egg salad, which makes a super special dish!
Tried this from Lawrence, 4/10/10 (except for the achilles) There is nothing worse than ordering from the locals when it is possible. All are nice - all great, but there is a back bar that gives you three choices of niqab and a beef stew - they all feel like separate places where they belong. The service is good - very friendly and friendly.
A place where you can serve your own family (and also some) of them - that is impossible in the Northwest.  The prices are ridiculously reasonable!  Very little food to go but almost all serviceable for people who have lost their friends on the way to Chicago.
Came here on vacation and was treated with somewhat mild disappointment as the food
restaurant is always nice to come by and chat up with us as soon as possible. Their burgers are great, and they have a fish stand for some of my favorites. I have tried a few dishes as well, and can't think of anything that has been better. The Thai empanadas are scrumptious and flavorful, with a little spicy. I'm very picky about my usual seafood, so make sure you get plenty of it. The drinks are nice too, and the rice is also great. I guess the best reason to go here is if they have a romantic side. They have 3 beautiful tapas, and bring you a bottle of water.  Also, keep checking back here if you haven't had a bottle of water.
I love the noise of this restaurant and I love its culture!      I've been there twice and they are a heck of a place!!     I've never been so sick they literally make
restaurant, system, and patio dining options and a few other non-traditional busses. I am finally making my way back to the neighborhood for a visit but it has never been my style. My French Toast has always been a little salty and this is the exception.
This place is a bargain at a great price. I love it so much because it has lots of hotdogs and a wonderful beer selection. My wife & I have stayed here several times so far and she's always been happy with the service.  It's okay I have been away too many times but only after having heard the concerns of customers.
This neighborhood has a pretty diverse range of food choices, the atmosphere is well-organized and the food is interesting. We used to never had to wait for the park to open, which was annoying and went for a less cramped place. We have had sit down(or other outdoor seating) and to eat here not the most popular options that people have,
restaurant not by our mouth but by our mouth! Both made good choices of meats, which were seasoned with oil, including the sliced bacon. The BEST. and by far, the best hot dog in town. Crispy and tasty, as well. Definitely worth the return visit and can really hear where another great restaurant is coming from as well. Great BBQ joint.
The best diner anywhere in Chicago is served in this city, as it is in Texas and Italy. It's BYOB and doesn't take much time to get seated. It's super nice with the salad bar because everyone gets what's great. The seating on a par, the service and atmosphere seems very comfortable but you're not there to eat real steak when they do it. Don't stop there. The best part is they have so many amazing tapas options. This place is your favorite diner. Keep up the good work.
My brother loves eating here. I had the shaved cheeseburger there and will
restaurant! And it was awesome. At least with previous reviews.   And especially for breakfast dishes or lunch.   Their food just gets better and better each time.  I'm not sure if I'd eat at most of the other restaurants that I'm into.  However, at PriceMe would do my homework on why they're so poor, which would not deter me.  The Chicken Spaghetti, for example, was significantly superior to the other dishes at the table.  What they put in here is a really good pasta.  But  they have no taste test.  The chicken dumplings are just dry -- very low on flavor.  The standard Chachi Pho, with your favorite rice filling, is just a little bland.  The dark salmon dish is similar to the dish at PriceMe, only with garlic (but with less garlic).
good meat and an upbeat atmosphere-- great service, but really pricey and a bit of a comfort food
restaurant&about. They love it! I love to come in and take my boyfriend to the place, but if it's a food court, it isn't the worst of them. -Sandwiches are ok, but when they are run low on ingredients, the idea of changing a couple of eggs and pop-flavours of meat is the end of the kitchen equation. Otherwise, I recommend if you will take our wedding bride to a wine bar for glasses of wine, but don't order whatever others make, but be prepared to shell out a considerable sum for a real worth of free wine. And yes, order from Lou's salad bar that does not have running water, onions, nor mustard on top. They will do a *little* job of you ordering 3 kinds of their product, of which only one garnishes off and one adds nothing. When I went for my wedding, I thought the surprise specials in the wine glasses were fantastic, and I loved the cand
restaurant spots).
My favorite restaurants in Chicago! I used to only eat here once or twice a year, but my mom used to go to Himex!
Now they open up really fast! Everyone can order and order at their convenience! Many, many b/c this is the best place to go when you are in downtown Chicago! The menu has the best raspberry crepe crusts ever! Gotta try them.If you are lucky, something's going on or can't find the right one, let them know!
This place was outstanding at times.   The food was different than others, their tomatoes and onions were incredible and the sauce was excellent.  I think I did eat the falafel at least once as well.  Delicious to talk to.  Last but not least, the server was very good.  I will definitely be back.
One of my favorite eats at this establishment.  A lot of fun - dining like no other
restaurant restaurant of all places. Gatsby topped my list by daintily pig-chewing and steady hand-tapping my Oysters.
I really like this place. It's a little pricey but they get the business. I'm hooked! 1st and last time I was there was the french toast and franks. Got a table too soon. This was way better than the standard French toast sandwich. This was our dinner tonight. Best meal I've had yet!  The server made us feel welcomed because she was in a mood to get someone a table. Wasn't too rude at all and informed us everything was about to go off schedule. We'll go back, but if you want to eat here, don't come unless you are really hungry.
Noh-Moh! Eat you as big or as little as you want. It isnt BYOB. The food is fantastic!! The restaurant is awesome and cheap to get your salad right
restaurant and 4 others. Silly customer service and potential hectic nights in between and the sub sandwich feels like an effort by Notter since then. For now Go casual again.
There are really several great options, including the casual and the nice atmosphere. My husband tried on a pad. The food is amazing too. My husband loves traditionalist fare like stuffed squash, stews, and beet salad, and the portions are amazing. The number one reason to come here is for those with sensitive skin.
We went with our family back in May but were just able to wait after our a-go order of food. As a server, we were able to taste our drinks and the hostess who was very attentive (through the years) was very helpful. I thought we would come back as soon as we came home and was told by the restaurant that they needed to issue a refund, but I believe there is plenty of affordable food to choose from as well! Can't wait
restaurant of all time, received the most service-like reviews. The waitress used to work at the restaurant when it was first opened (when Eugene came over to the table as a check) and in good of course had the most incredible conversation about the food during the dinner. I think that she takes very little notice to the food that you put on the table to leave no doubt whatsoever in your mind; I was there on the anniversary of the event, we went as an early family- and therefore were quite surprised by everything she did. The wait staff came out of the diner shower next to the men to be greeted, just as Eugene had done the previous evening. They showed us what the menu is about! So far, we haven't had any negative reviews for this restaurant.
The food is good. We've tried Vietnamese places. We've also tried Vietnamese food at Mayo. They have the seaport hickory and duck. I don't want to go out of
restaurant, to which we will never be back, but with the interest that we have gained over the years, I am looking forward to traveling the world for that wonderful restaurant.Thanks again!
One of the most amazing sushi places in the city!!Our lady Sachi now eats there - great service, great food and delicious atmosphere! The food is good but the service - knowledgeable, genuine, and authentic - is exceptional. Definitely make sure you come here after watching the
Come on out because it's quite crowded at this time of the year! And lastly - how about our cocktail menu! Very convenient so we could take it all on once, my friends said!Best margaritas!Probably probably won't come again as it looks like we will always have the liqueur and wine I crave!
EVERYONE can say the first time I went to Pinout I was unsure what to expect. This is a great spot for a weekend lunch - although the dish
restaurant and cold shoulder.  Yum, there was stuff in the front porch with feta cheese!  The waitress was quite attentive as well.  I've never had something like this before, so that's nice for a warm-up in the summer.  Overall, I would definitely recommend the townhuckey and the warm pasta.  I usually wear a tight white sandals, the warm sauce was understated and pretty good, but I think the chandelier and the sparkling wine/wine pairing should easily have won over me.
this is my second favorite burger joint and I love this place   this should be in my top 5
roast shrimp rolls are perfection!
Nice service and great food.  I usually go to this place on weekends and they serve a lot of Southern pork rolls.  My friend and I both wanted our ribs/chicken to be tender but not mushy.  But all of a sudden they pulled out and the
restaurant' — thought about trying them out for a bit for dinner.  The server walked out immediately and laid out the plates with a perfect attitude and no scruples.  After the fact she may not even remember what those food was, but apparently he (who came here with wife and child) was thinking about them.  My wife thought she knew they were from Michigan, but it's still clear that she was talking about weird and filthy dishes.  He also asked about the linguine, which he didn't understand, but didn't tell us because he doesn't want people to come here with names like Mr. Mrs Corey or Anthony on their plates!  The food was fantastic.  I really hope there are better ways for you to eat/drink at a restaurant than the one I helped so far.
Wonderful  great food i love this place.  All service, great service with alot of snacks and beers will go down your line as well. 
restaurant, etc., all top notch! Do your own thing and just take the time to get to know me, and you'll be amazed at what I do. The staffs are friendly and if you're looking for something unique and special don't go looking for bad Korean food. There's always a chance that something special won't make you feel like you've got an entire day to eat at New America. The dining room is actually very spacious and clean, i think it's ridiculous that Korean food sucks. However, if you've been there a few times the service has been pretty decent (some of the waitresses are wonderful), even though it's not. The weirdest thing is that I really don't feel like anyone who goes in to their restaurant needs to be called a proper chef. Despite the rudeness of other Korean dining places on Chicago's popular tourist-fee-driven South Side, my wife and I will try everything in our power to help New Orleans fix our
restaurant with amazing service, it's just a small restaurant that doesn't have great food. I get the beans after eating. It was our first experience in here and it was packed. We were there after waiting around 6 or 7 hours, however, the food was decent and the wait times were long enough for the staff to comfortably accommodate us as a group. Finally, we were seated. From the wait time we experienced, the food was great and we never had to wait around the corner for our meals. However, the service was awful, and the lack of service was beyond disappointing. It was to be expected. And for a small cost of around $2 per person, that's a lot of money for just ONE employee. The poor quality of the food is the cause of this report.
Huge selection! Will definitely be coming back here more and much more.
I finally came across HES on Yelp and had a go at this place last week, and a sweet
restaurant. These top notch santa staff is knowledgeable and accommodating, extremely friendly and knowledgeable. What a treat! I am grateful you had such a great meal.
I have been here 11 times before and none of them will make me feel rushed.  My friends (probably most), have been to such incredible restaurants over the years and this place reminds me of some of the best that took place. I cannot wait to go there again!
We waited 30 minutes for the pizza and pizza here from our friend.  The service was incredible.  We were walking by the building and chuffed for you as you all dined at the restaurant.  Don't get us wrong, the pizza is very good but while it certainly wasn't the best the food definitely tasted like nothing really was on the menu.  From the pizza to the calamari, the waiter was perfectly prepared to make you feel like you were in town.  That said, if you are looking to impress the waitress
restaurant : Ditto with soups, salads and appetizers. The menu has changed over the years and the food was always a mess, but I have to say, this place has become familiar to many friends over the years. My friend and I spent several years here.  If you are looking for a nice lunch place, this is the place for you.
My roommate and I were down for this vegetarian based feast. We had a corkage party (yes, we have dinner there and not have dinner there) and the food was decent, but their hostess seemed a little hesitant as well as a little sour.  The only negative thing I had was the soup was poor quality, but they sold only red beans.  If I could see anywhere else they would have priced better.If you really wanted something that sounded like its authentic, then the corkage  served very high quality and creamy soup tasted very stale. They also had to take the random amount of
restaurant

The menu is great, and everything that we had was tasty. My friends and I loved the seitan and the avocado bowl, and our entire group of five decided to dine here.
I never would have ordered this place without the high quality of staff and great atmosphere. the fish has never disappointed! You are welcome to serve anywhere in Chicago, and the atmosphere is not to shabby. If you're craving decent seafood with authentic seafood selection and the best fry and fry is just around the corner, this is the place for you.
This is one of my favorite sushi places in Chicago.  You can't go wrong.  Make sure you have the correct (20%) of pastel pizza or savory horchata, and there will be no complaints from the chef.  If you like deep dishes and might not like dipping sauces, this is the place to go.  Sushi fries and feta are also excellent.
Food is good and
restaurant and home-cooking. The beer is pretty good, I love it too. A bit of flavor and a little whiskey. Overall, a nice and cozy place.
This is pretty much a tourist hot spot.  Lots of food on offer, a little hidden.  The downside is there to a strong downtown vibe, so don't expect an intense view of Chicago.  But it's worth visiting at least once a year as the air temperature will just melt your skin and make you feel like you belong in the firepit.
good space, good atmosphere, nice beer selection, well priced
There are really no flaws in this restaurant here, which are totally out of this world. The food was a bit over priced.  The service was decent, but it was completely terrible overall.  The cost of doing business here is really steep.
Always the best out of town steakhouses, i have never looked back.  I also pay only $2 more
restaurant at De La Jaranha? I do not know. Yes, there are two nice spots and all this is supposed to be interesting but what are they for?
I was expecting to really enjoy this place from beginning to end... I don't know about what that is really saying...but OMG!!Budget : we ordered a cup of coffee and they have a selection of sauces.... We ordered it without questions!Our server from SE is very apologetic while she treats us well at all times!! The staff took us seriously by the hour and both suggested we enjoy our meal and to order them the next day. It was everything i expected...baby food, romantic drinks, and a good dinner. They were excellent,the food was decent and the beer selection was decent. My only complaint is that sometimes they have a line to avoid due to crowded line.Overall, I would give 5 stars and go back here!!
Wonderful food, authentic atmosphere, and unique and
restaurant: Chipperci that was great, but the fajitas are sooo bloody you can't stop tasting it for hours on end. So I recommend the soup on the side. Yum.
The place I went on Maple Street when I was there was the original Waterhouse, which is excellent, and a fantastic place to take a vacation in Michigan! The water is excellent, and they have a great patio, so I think there is always a good chance of a visit. This place has people that look a little different from you when you get there, so enjoy the challenge and try some tasty appetizers.
This is one of my favorites! I wanted to try this place on this Sunday night. The waitstaff is fantastic, and the pizza was amazing. My boyfriend and I had the shrimp dough pizza, and they both loved it!I will definitely be back.
I had the mac & cheese joint and will be back next time I'm at the desert
restaurant and The House on Hand, both of which are equally awesome.
I was able to stop by tonight and was a bit late.  The place is BYOB, so maybe that will not bother me too much.  It is a little pricey, but I got the floor plan (meat, drink, wine, and everything else) which is as close to the real deal as you can get.  The prices are reasonable for both dishes (sauce), which is worth it.  Bring a friend.
I had the delicious crab sandwiches.  The beef, which was well seasoned, had a good texture.  Good!  Their trout and my personal favorites are usually leftovers.  Service was great as well!
I've been looking for a fast and affordable "gentle" vegetarian restaurant in the city for a long time. I visited the Reuben Club on 11/9/12. The food was nice, but not quite as good as I
restaurant and restaurant - there is no place to turn down, our chicken was done in 1 hour time. We tried the Fried Tofu fried rice, Chicken Dinner, and Steak Sandwich - the two were perfectly ok, the second one was amazing as well. We had the pastries for a glass, I was kind of disappointed and sad to go back after this experience.  I would definitely visit again next time!
This place is good. I've been here a few times now and once I finished the rice I have a decent feeling about it. The service was awful, to the point where I am outside of Chicago wearing red but the service was messed up because we just didn't have a server as friendly as someone should and now have to ask for a refill in both the bathroom and in the cash register. The food was better, but there were still tons of really good things we could have gotten a better deal and always return for drinks or appetizers. Maybe a
restaurant is mostly vegetarian, but an entree can be ordered which is vegetarian too. All I can say about the food is it is great in its good organic form. It's OK to go small, but have fun with you, there are other venues out there, you need to get to know them.
I've been to about half the restaurants in Chicago and have been to a ton of they.  I'm sure they are packed in the food bar.   There is often room for more food than you'll find on a fast food restaurant.   I've been to more than one show, which was super packed, including the guys who sat down with us, take our orders and gift us some rings.  After that there were times when my girlfriend and I watched in horror as they patiently waited for each other to get our plates, but waited patiently for that special one that never came.  It was awesome!  But, I still can't believe how
restaurant, the was my first move on the block. In addition to bringing together friends with the Mexican experience and pairing myself with some of the knowledgeable restaurant professionals of the city, the dining experience was outstanding, I immediately wanted to enjoy the atmosphere of this big club.We had a place with plates, chairs, tables, several beer selections and food, all bringing back the old mark of Mexican food that I was familiar with, but now we want to get back there again. Great food, super service, full service bar. We were disappointed with the (a great) Bumpback Pale Ale. I had two frites, 2 draft beers and a side of pizza and the same thing came out. While I was waiting, the waiter walked right up and gave me a three star rating for the beer and didn't leave a tip. In addition, the manager talked to me twice during the meal. He never followed us and never even spoke to us for a few minutes. Some others
restaurant for the Indian food is phenomenal. The chef reads my website, gives me the complete menu to try, and makes excellent suggestions.We love it! One of the best ambiance in DC. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and knowledgeable.I would highly recommend visiting the place for our next dinner!
Came here for my dad's wedding.  He is a high school graduate, he has worked in the area.  Great energy and good food.  Will definitely go back to Chicago.
Causada del Consejo is awesome!  The casada del consejo is around $12 for lunch -  it's that expensive!!  The staff is friendly & efficient!  Always fun to try some dishes.
I've lived across the street from F.L.I. food carts (100 kids inside and outside each month) for the past 25 years and I've always been impressed. This place is consistently amazing! I haven't eaten since
restaurant food. Good sides, good atmosphere. Pizza is small (around 8 lbs). Eggplant is good for breakfast. Appetizers are not great (lunch food but anyway). Soup, skewer and cheese bar are great. Baking for breakfast can be difficult and painful. Stuffed chicken can be a bit pricey.
Best dog brunch in the city!
I have been going here for a while, every time I make a reservation. Their pizza is better than its homemade out of this world pasta. I could go on and on, but I do for Chicago Pizza Association, it is another 5 star restaurant (I don't think I've ever been more impressed). The service is amazing. Would definitely return.
I took my wife and our 4 yr old daughter on the 5th of March with us from Phoenix. This is my first trip out of Chicago and so I would have been hard pressed to decide the best.  This is the perfect place to go for
restaurant. We also had dumplings! The meat was exceptionally flavorful. Most omelets were seasoned fairly well and the sea  seafood were not particularly slow to me. Oh, you won't believe the chocolate of the tofu I went with.
Love this place. Really want a part 1 meal without the fear of the weather, here it is. It's packed early in the morning, with reasonably priced food, a sweet atmosphere, and a cute wall above. Don't go for dinner out of your house!
This place is simply wonderful! I have not eaten there since I started talking to and organizing previous sushi dives. Their desserts have an exclamation point in the middle that has ruined any fondue I could use. I highly recommend using the carasne & soul margarita; sweet&spicy and with ice on the table. Everything you order at this spot IS a real no-brainer (complete with breakfast drinks and ample wine selections). I've tried
restaurant, Saturday's (around 10pm) and Sunday's (around 12pm). The food is great and nothing to write home about. We really enjoyed talking with Tony and giving his compliments about every part of the food. The experience is a long way away and we will probably wait another week or so until we can get a table as his of course would choose.
Great food, very friendly staff. Most excellent food there, I guess. We had a few beers we didn't like, and the new music was kinda cool but no one else did as the inside was pretty bland. Our main complaint though was the menu (sorry to make you wait), and the samples, sweet mac and cheese and the meatballs were maybe a little too heavy for most of us, but this was nothing to sneeze at. I will keep looking for fresh things at Dargan's for even more amazing quality meatballs, if you're in the area, at least do try to
restaurant for two or three days, we found ourselves sat right in front of the table serving incredibly dry, wonderful meals. I hope to have more awesome tasting meal there in the future!I would be a new Napoli resident and would like to go back to Chicago for lunch.
AMAZING!!! The music is authentic. The ambiance is light.The service is always great.THE BOWL is a lot of fun to sit in at.As an experienced Napoli chef, I would recommend my new Pork Chop, from the creative chef's sense of humor to the alluring du jour.  For a great authentic meat bite, I can't wait to try another Chicago roll!
Ok, so my review of both The Excitina' and '11 Man's Lava is about how great we were both at Gucci and received this second review the other day, but both were wonderful. First off, I was excited to try the Crepe aka Puc
restaurant, along with tastebuds, as well as top dishes. In contrast to what many we had at mid-town, this is a very old Italian restaurant on the north side of Chicago. They've got a great ambiance, so we stopped by and waited in line. Once we were seated, we had three bad things to say about the restaurant.We ordered the tortilla with entree and croutons. The crispy, dark stuff tasted like nothing I've ever had. We ordered the pizza. But we weren't disappointed at all. The pizza itself was just incredible. Each egg was a little pricey, but they had a half and a half (with tortilla and onion sausage), while the tortilla and myriads of other crusts were... both exquisite and DELICIOUS. The taste of each crust perfectly complimented the texture and perfectly melted the pretzel cookies that were perfect accompaniments to my pizza. Overall, I really enjoyed my first dinner
restaurant a bit expensive, but on top of that, good food, great service, full service and not bad looking bathrooms.  We went here in the spring for a family night (now it's summer!) and the service was very friendly and was only a little disappointing.  There are several other groups that try to deal with the situation, but this can certainly be our favorites.  It's an awesome restaurant, and it's a great place for live music and family time.  If you're looking for a dining experience, don't go if you live in Chicago and you want the high service. You're more likely to go to Denver anyways!
The BEST restaurant in Chicago.  Their takeout menu changes and they offer the best value they could for the person who goes with them to be happy.  Their service is superior.  There's nothing like being given a great birthday meal, feeling welcome, or savory portion.  If you don't have to worry
restaurant,I had the steak which was good but was left feeling sorry for the diner that I went to. There were parking spots on the lot, and I thought it was okay to pick up some tables, which I agree with most other reviews, they took care to prevent people from going in unless they were close to the food.  However, if you have children, they were out of the city for dinner.  This was horrible.  The service was mediocre.  The server was rude and verbally abusive.  If I went there again (to be on the evening of May 9th to be our date/party/attendance), I would have tried to have been pleasant, accommodating to the night.  Staff was inoffensive and completely bossy and rude.  Even more disturbing was that they refused to let me go because I am a Chicagoan with more qualms with women  than with men.  Luckily, I got a table and half a bowl of
restaurant for decent priced drinks and entertaining live entertainment. Their chocolate marmalade with duck fat is one of my favorites in Chicago.
The party of over 40 people didn't know about this place, they were just waiting to try everything I had to say.  The wait staff was just always friendly with us.  The place is unbelievable!
Everything was alright, it was fresh and interesting!  I always had breakfast at the bar.  The two good friends eating good food got together and had a good time.   One of the server's daughters was really nice and took care of us all.  I think that was her last night in Chicago.  I have to thank the Pizza Hut for the staff.
I was at Fox Theater to watch the premiere of the new movie.  My friend & I got in early which made for an amazing evening.  The place is great, the seating was really good, the food was fresh and delightful, and the service
restaurant's famous Wicker Park location. At 12:00 pm Saturday nights, this is a place that usually gets two people, but with around 30 people to one per concert on this week, it will almost certainly not be long.  Take a seat at a table next to the corner bar.  Get a bar reservation and make a reservation.  Even if it was a star, this place would definitely make you feel like a flapper!
Turtle Wine Bar is a tiny jazz lounge in the middle of nowhere located in Chicago.  The food is ok, and the wine selection is nice.  It is like you are walking in to a jazz club and you just don't feel like you need to go all the way to get the famous glass of tea.  I would recommend the beer selections at Turtle Wine Bar to anyone who can drink plenty of Belgian-style beers.
I'll be back and I will definitely be going again!  Great spot to grab a
restaurant The Fajitas are spicy to the point of no taste, but that's not their style and very basic. We went there early because they used to be called something more like something like Nuevo Leon in fact. It took the salad bar people half an hour to come up with the perfect entree they wanted. All because they brought so much salt into the kitchen.  And this is where the Fajitas really hit it big, and there was a frisson between the entrees (one was good, but was much to much) that ruined it for me.  Then I had the guacamole, which was pretty good.It's all mixed up because one line says Guacamole x2 (15 minutes or less).  Then at the end, for whatever reason, the entrees were WAY too creamy to make a difference for me.  Luckily, this salad bar is right next to them (I will call this location Neater).
restaurant, food, and venue. And after years of having been forced to leave that sushi scene (you could call it "Summer"), I finally tried one of the best sushi places in the whole country. The oysters are simply amazing. Will give the pickles 4 stars.I am still a big die-hard Entrance for sushi, but I have noticed it is a bit quieter on Fridays. It's hard to spot. Well, because it's right across the street from the existing restaurant.  I think it's definitely a mystery, but so far as I can tell it's definitely my favorite sushi spot in Chicago. Highly recommended. But this place has so many other great things going on. Who doesn't want to check it out?
I've been coming here on a weekly basis since my boyfriend came here around Christmas.  It's a fast paced restaurant and the food is everything you need.  I love their all Asian food such as brown rice noodle and
restaurant was marvelous. I love the cornbread that is crunchy and creamy with delicious fresh mozzarella. I can't say enough about the service when they have tons of excellent food!
Coming into their grow house, it was always a bit rushed, especially since everyone you go to gets a Christmas treat. The food was good, so I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a quick time away.
My husband and I stopped in this cute little area this morning.  It was a nice welcoming neighborhood with a warm atmosphere and cozy.The service was excellent, but not to the same level as if you'd spend a night with a friend and go by yourself.This place is good, but not worth the time, attention and dollars wasted.
Their beer menu is full of beef that is served both ways and's made from sweet potatoes, honey, and lemon. The crispy skillet wicker basket with brown onion rings is the best I've had. The beer selection
restaurant, followed by the Pizza on Route 2 (chicken sandwich only.) It took just a few minutes for them to come out with some fantastic food.  My friend and I were hooked. 
Decided to try my own brunch after walking back home after eating there for a week. Took a few shots at some off the menu for the rest of the night...never got good service and poor quality.  Wow, we said it would be cool to try some of their favorite breakfast products, but the delivery guy went ahead and sent us home and took the orders and placed them in the freezer.  Very disappointing.
This was my first experience at local soup kitchen for the third time in about a month. After a long wait for my server and restaurant manager, I was going to order and get my soup at a later date. I finally made it out, and they immediately started handing out water bottles and telling me to bring them in order to wash dishes. 
restaurant, we were pleased to be welcomed back by the local Chipotle! It was our first time in and we were extremely satisfied with the food and service. The location, prices, and service were top notch and very well communicated. We will definitely be back, but I do know that it is a very private place, not a traditional midtown restaurant.
Although there's much more to love in Chinatown than a couple of years ago, I had to wait nearly one year in line for that old school vibe at Will Fink's (which was named the "Hank" restaurant).  The wait staff are unique and helpful.  There were so many other choices, but we each had one of the world's top seafood bar options.  So be careful if you order at this restaurant!  We're at Caprice and it's a no-brainer.  Come visit and experience it all without a second thought!
They used to offer lobster rolls and another two kinds
restaurant 7 stars!! i don't know how all this ends. usgmail is open 10% discount to all!!!!! now with fresh cut and spicy chicken, this is a unique place we had here on monday night.
We thought we had better food at Churrattas -- the specialty plates for sure were impressive. The beef was hot, delicious and definitely on par with our everyday butcher food.Our most recent visit was a very long time coming after going for the i had a fabulous meal with beef at a cozy place called Prada or Panjindo in Chicago.  We will be back.
Like most terrible stores in the area, but about the only reason to go and be pleased is because the manager here was super weird.  Check out the Caring restaurant that we visited and you will see the legendary stuffed beef there! I don't know what the hell the long beef gets in there....BUT I have to say this place makes the worst feeling
restaurant is really fun and memorable.
We took the bus from Westside north across the street from parking lots to Three Mile. Got there with the party and it was VERY crowded and ordered what I ordered and it was over $30 bucks in fine service. Food and prices were great and were VERY good for a sunday brunch.
This is really good, but not great. I went to the huge Panini Square on January 20th, at 17:00. The food was DELICIOUS.  It looked like they are waiting to take our order before moving to a second location.  Was polite and not loud at all.  Was so worried about the wait staff though.  It was fine but I doubt it will make up for it in a month. I do not eat here though but am hoping that somebody from staff there decides to cater me their customer service needs.  I live in a small town with great history so I am definitely going to return.
restaurant.  Great combination of wine selections, and excellent service!
This is one of the worst restaurants in the city!!  I had a terrible experience here but  I'll be back!
This place was THE WORST for me.  Very sick for me and my family.  I had no care about family.  I felt like someone was purposely walking around with a glass of wine and telling people to drink it.  It was the dumbest thing I have ever experienced.  The waitress and waiter dawdled in service while I was putting my wine down.  If anyone could really spend 15 bucks for a professional meal which would be awesome, this place would sell, advertise and sell itself.  The lady trying to talk to my friend was rude and extremely interested in all this stupid shit, I cant even deal with this shit.  I saw a lot of bad people coming through this restaurant and by the end of the meal she was running us over...
restaurant. As soon as the plates arrived, they were very generous and very generous and delicious. We will definitely be coming back to this restaurant!
This is a hidden gem.  A much older, more upscale yet romantic spot that is serving an eclectic mix of Italian and vegan dishes with flavors unique to each occasion.  The atmosphere is interesting, as well as welcoming and attentive to everyone.The plan is always to check it out for your next visit.
Always good food, definitely the best place for a quick meal
I have been here a few times (there are just two other locations).  I actually ate at Mango's one time and loved it!  There is so much going on there and it's often packed...We've both been there one time and absolutely loved it!They have great sushi dishes, both good and awful.  I must say that despite having a really good variety of dishes, the and the drinks are not quality wines...I would give
restaurant, cheap, $16 margaritas

I don't get a lot of reviews. I would go for the intimate, excellent fare though, not based in the U.S., which is not a fault of the restaurant, nor of the waitstaff.  That said, if you can get in, you could try their pizza and the excellent atmosphere of the Piercings and Salad Bar.  It would be a pleasure to be able to enjoy with my friends, but if you have to come in, let me know.
Went to Obelen, last night.The menu is basically the same. Service is just slightly different. Service was fantastic and of course the staff is definitely a pleasant change from the old life and tried every item we tried. If you like to get a sense of class and seriousness I would definitely go back. Staff is friendly, all food is good and clean, and prices are reasonable. I ordered a bottle of wine but I
restaurant but during my visit to Dabwaschenbach I was met by a waitress who even refused to mention the Greek place. She was telling me that in addition to the wings (which, surprisingly, are quite often served elsewhere) they have a special jalapeno pepper dish... which means, unfortunately, that this place is still open... it's the only place I have seen in Dabwaschenbach. Anyway, we decided to hang out and I was pleasantly surprised that everything about the Dabwaschenbach place is great. First of all, our waitress clearly decided that we needed to just do a little research to make sure there weren't really any dishes that I really like, so we ordered a few sauces that could have easily been found in other Asian places. Also, the tempura has five ingredients (enoki tempura, mushroom mushrooms) that could easily have been found in two other Asian restaurants in Japan, and yet to our satisfaction they

Note from the chef, I usually give food and dinner-to-its to of one time after their work days (i.e., Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday). If that means I went to Calo on vacation as the restaurant opened on Sunday, for example... I didn't consider this to be fair. My manager will ask me a few questions, then I'll give him the final taste of it and his staff will even ask for details that were not in my review.  My manager would like to explain what's in his stomach and how this has changed.  My waitress would like to explain more things to us about what is the key ingredient (potato, roasted elmo, and almonds).  I'd take 5-10 more minutes, for example, than she wants to come.  She is uncomfortable with my belated b-day appreciation for an "eye for an eye" review (which I am not.
restaurant - good food and great service - almost as good as the surrounding area.
love this place
Drinks great but need more.
If you're coming from a privileged family, you're going to enjoy this place quite a bit.  It's extremely busy, a really loud place, but my only complaint is the food and service and the prices.  The server (who is dressed like a normal person) has to do all of the  amazing things that they are trained to do, but he tends to get too close to the other diners and gets irritated at every lecture from one of the other guys to end up peeling off his blingy red bottle of wine.  My friend, Jon, we took the bus to Bonner Park, where they served Chinese food, and our waitress also had some really good wine (I love My Peking Duck, soooo good!)
My name is Marie and I'm a fan of calamari, that's
restaurant on Manhattan Avenue, located near Chicago. I sat in line and observed a customer leave before arriving. As you can see the pilsner sandwich filled my stomach. I've read Yelp reviews about the American sandwich, a concoction of various hot peppers, gooey mouth-watering sauces and others. And waitresses greeted us politely. It seemed like each waitress was pro-active and could recognize me as a curious and loyal customer. I felt ready to give them a call, as I have not made much effort in this restaurant since.There is a special pork button dough that I remember being introduced to when I was a kid. I remember from watching CSI and a conversation I had there at the local pizza joint. When we arrived, my sister and I, each of whom was wearing glasses and paying attention, sat down and ate their vegetables at each other's table. The eggplant was moist and flavorful. For an appetizer, I bet we shared the oregan
restaurant, margaritas, pizza, nachos, sautéed chinese hamburger with spinach salad).  Please excuse the useless faces there!  They were nowhere near authentic and the drinks, in the winter, were too low quality and contained nothing but exotic ingredients.  You would have to eat at one of those many dining rooms to understand it was just a fancy surprise or to enjoy the restaurant's fine dining menu.  As for the food, we all loved it.  All that was missing was the deliciously delicious soft-crust torta with apple oil, spicy candied butter, shaved sprigs, crunchy mushrooms and dusted black beans.  Our waitress agreed to get some fresh fruit juices for our entrees.  When we visited the restaurant later in the day, we were thoroughly surprised and happy that our table was able to satisfy even the most well-attended entrees.  All in all, we will definitely be back!
restaurant a great afternoon of eating, dancing and parties!    Great place to party, they make it a point to go down to B.C. for a drink.
We have been here three times and both times the food was just OK, but we never expected it to be that great! I love the red beet salad, mashed potatoes, and shrimp, but the entree was poorly prepared - we were pleasantly surprised to see that there were no garbanzos on the salad - it just wasn't what we thought it would be.
I came here yesterday and I didn't really understand how to sit there and make myself happy. It was loud, cramped, and disgusting. My friends and I had heard the Chef talk about how he had so many wonderful restaurants that he didn't deserve it. We must go there again.
Never a bad place in Lakeview if you dont mind chaos.  I'm from Chicago, so I figured if we moved here from
restaurant.
Most pizzas are ok. We have to say that I am not that into that stuff anymore. I have not had the slow pizza one time but I am not going to go back in the future.
Don't get me wrong. This place is definitely a Top Pick if you like something good about pizzas.  Not to mention, you get good pizza from the people in that same restaurant that you frequent the whole time. The one that is disappointing is the chain, and it wasn't because I know better than to go there.
Best Italian Cafe in the City!! I had to try their Black Padpoles a couple times because I found the whole experience to be too much like a vacation.  And not overbearing at all.  Luckily there is some fine dining here and my husband's for sure will be enjoying a brunch.The food was good, really hot.  We ordered the dip which had yummy flavors, much like everything else we
restaurant group offered "good options in food" with a single word to add: "service. We weren't impressed. We were at home preparing food for the tourists, leaving us with no doubt about what we were eating. "Gentlemen would be interested in our Gasserwa selections." The server even managed to tell us that he was impressed with the offerings at the club and liked what he saw on the floor. I also witnessed the waitresses wasting the last ten minutes of service while opening up a new restaurant that didn't have the chic linen look of the hotel. "Well, I was by myself. We opened a new restaurant, called Melrose Duckster." Really? They've had a success and I was waiting in line and had to sit on a card. The waitresses drove right into the restaurant's operating window and it was open, but didn't have priority, which was an annoying day.
Not as many fancy green cafes as they're used to,

This place just went up for sale just yesterday in the middle of Chicago.  One guy ran over the box and the waiting area was completely overheated and gutted.  It was so bad, that I had to put myself through another cheese pan while waiting on our table.  Still, it was great to have a place like this.  That's why I tried McDonald's!!!!  Honestly, I had the complimentary Honey Ribeye Nachos, which were amazing.  I love them!
I don't like pizza as much as some who do but for me the green pizza is a terrific experience. They don't let you try too many things but the crispy chicken parm is a bit crunchy, so I often order my chicken dish which is clearly from the concept menu. I want the same thing I ordered as early on the restaurant..maybe sooner.  Great food but sometimes..what I would recommend is a high priced one here so you
restaurant: it is a fried chicken. The broth is high quality and they had 4 of them! Their bbq rice food was also great. It is a simple clay meat soup, most of the meat was ground down.  Some rice dishes were very light, very bland, with a strong head of fat. I love rice desserts! This place was great to have or maybe a couple places to grab a snack with your friends. Overall: Yelp is to die for!! -
Just wonderful. Their goat cheese is absolutely excellent, topped with fresh veggies, the reason is great to try The Catering is great too, they have
A must for anyone that likes chicken. This is one of my favorite places to watch Chris for sure. If you like action packed dishes, with fast turnaround service, you will love this place. The food is great and the atmosphere is pleasant.The place is extremely clean, it has great seating. The food is a bit on the pricey side
restaurant Service. Main course from what i thought it would be. Just ask.
Great service and very delicious as usual, "because not only are you looking for a great sushi place to sit around the bar to sample some healthy foods you are going to miss out on. Mmm look at the menu you might not have eaten so much yet. I would not repeat myself but I would recommend it to people who do not have the budget to bring in sushi friends or family just to enjoy for dinner. And if you come to want to order a small portion of sushi, i would order the full portion to be very reasonable. The pork fat salad was such a wonderful experience, food was just a waste of money and the lotta amount of sushi you need to have over the $40 plate but it was a good sized deal and was well worth it. I will go back and order again, but let me say that i think there are more options. Overall, a great place for

My name is Joel Gonzales and I'm a long time resident of Bartolo's at that lovely setting.  I wanted to like the restaurant by the look and feel of it.  Once you do go there, however, after a good meal, you will not look back.  What I love about it, however, is that I love decor.  I also love the chain-solo atmosphere.  It's not hard to identify a charm, especially the walk down the aisle where the dining room was waiting for you.  At first, I thought of it as a five star place, but once you get
restaurant and water was as promised. But it is BYOB! The atmosphere was cold, the food was lacking in flavor and my husband and I had to order a little lamb dish. If you are a fan of spicy food, this may be a way to enjoy it. I will not be returning.
This place is awsome! I love every food I can find on dine, but I just love the two other employees.  Their soup is superb (especially in winter!).  They've even offered me a five dollar menu item for an appetizer! I'd order two to see what they do with it.  Definitely give the veggie dish a try!
Love great sushi here!!!   Great slow eating, but really friendly servers!
I loved the Milk Chocolate House but I love the Waynes and Superficiosa when I go to Tortas!
I wanted to say that since my fiance and I moved to Napa from Michigan the place
restaurant, more than anything else.A great lunch and we will definitely be returning soon!
Love the food.  Their chili is awesome, I think I'll be back here.  I've heard great things about this place, but I don't recommend going here if you're under 30.  Food is always good and friendly and very inexpensive. I know I should be there too, but also know this is a joint that they offer.  The last stop for check up (the regular menu runs $50 - $60 depending on what you eat) and tip is $30.  Unfortunately, the atmosphere on the block has been pretty "busy", there is a lot of sound in there which could have been used better.If you want to take some rest, there is plenty of beer and wine. Good music, great to have because the service and atmosphere are great too.The biggest disappointment is that the cocktails in this location are $50. But that's almost
restaurant first — nice, I don't mind if you try. The waiter had a huge assortment of your favorite items. But I had a deal that had less than half the ingredients. The waiter asked for a refund, as we were going over their menu, but was nonplussed and told us to get over the hype, but didn't want to give his employees. The restaurant doesn't get all they want. I'm considering going back because I wasn't going to bring anything for free. I'm honestly not sure if they won't be doing more on the back or not, but if it was for a 30-minute reservation and we had said yes we would be spending about $50. (so all we had was chicken, garlic, onions and mussels!)This was NOT the place that I'd been expecting!I recommend the Burp House menu.  It's pretty good and it is crispy.  I loved the lemon zest, the dill and the
restaurant...the first time I came here, it was really good! If you have the money, you can always go to the bargain bin. It's $4.00, and you get a slice of the sushi.  I can't seem to justify taking a dollar from their menu. Be on the lookout for the Crispy green pepper fried chicken.  That's what you'll get if you can get the tofu asparagus over the top, or whatever the score is on the house fried chicken.  All good things. Enjoy!
I don't know what it's about! I have been there on 9,000+ occasions for breakfast and for a fairly long time I have been impressed, pleased and excited.  I've even had a moment of fear (of having a gorilla in my room).  I've always seen him smile and shake hands with one other.  I asked for a note while seated, not to mention call my boyfriend to let him know
restaurant to the table -- for $15 per person at Imodium -- I would have deflated by now.
Our place was wonderful but the food was underwhelming. I didn't feel right with this place -- everything was new, delicious, everything was as fresh as its ever had, all the reviewers saying that we were underwhelmed. I would still recommend this place for an eclectic group of people. Even though we went there alone, we would ask the menu managers if they would like our desserts. We would give the customers a try and we would not go back. The owners' staff could not be as nice as I was -- they seemed to fall for whatever the owner was doing. And when this place opened, they said that they would take me down some stairs to get back to the servers. Was this a bad thing? Probably not. I will definitely go back again.
Good sushi, good service, appetizers. I highly recommend this place, but I can

I have been to this restaurant several times since I saw it first opened.  Everyone knows what it's about.  Seriously it is fast!  We also both have Pho other than the Vietnamese based bowl of pork leftovers from the hot pot the first time, and they are small slices of pork made on a small piece of rice.  If you go to Pho instead you will find the Korean BBQ plate below (they also bring out a pan of white vinegar in the batter), but this version is the best.  Even if you are not a fan of Chinese BBQ, keep up the good work!

We couldn't have come here for dessert, and went back to Sam's because my favorite dessert is churros... great.  We enjoyed this restaurant a little bit too much.  We have a dinner reservation now, and will probably go back.
THANK YOU DOUBLE ZERO! I waited on them at every turn and everything. Being from the neighborhood, it's a bit small and we didn't need a reservation. BUT, YOU GET TO ORDER ONLY TICKETS AND YOUR STAY IN ORDER! You could ask everyone to leave at any time and wait for you outside the first line for... 12 hours??? that would be really rude!  Here's my question! do you pay the reservation fee? Are you the most naive person I know? If you don't then why do you still walk in with your place installed
restaurant) are becoming less and less profitable. When you know which service you choose the couple pays less and now they are prepared to dish and serve anyone who doesn't. However if you ask your waitress to play every detail of every interaction she makes with you make it seem like nothing happens. After waiting more than 20 minutes for your order there is still most definitely a line that is waiting for you and probably even less food as you talk to it. When one woman is waiting you are treated with absolutely no respect. Oh well get the popcorn a moron please don't blame us. The next time a restaurant touches you it is like they want to make a joke and they will stick to it and if you say something, it will fall flat with nobody else. Just by showing no respect to them the restaurant will be without any real respect. No matter what you tell them they will not be bothered. And we live in a weird and isolated desert, which is to say one which has

I have to say this place can give a little pause. What you pay for is not bread but rather meat. The sandwich, sandwich, sandwich, and ribs are okay but they are not as tender as the meat they serve in. The meat can be burned, peeled off, and diced to the point where it becomes mush. This is only a very short walk from my neighborhood. The alcohol selection here is exceptional and one of my absolute favorite places I have ever been in Chicago.
This is one of the best restaurants in the city!  Fantastic food and excellent atmosphere.  We always come back here after seeing our kids on an afternoon vacation.
We waited an hour and 10 minutes for dinner. I think it was one of our least favorite meals in the city.  As a result, my wife's delivery room was

The place is worth the money and they have extensive ingredients. The staff are very patient and try to make sure that everything is done well. The dessert is very good. My wife will go for brunch with the same pair.
It is fun to come here every evening with friends. It has all the sushi, brisket and seafood that is not on the menu and they also offer a tour of the area.  This is a must for any romantic night out.
This place is BYOB so don't expect to go back for a regular table of friends if you do go here.  Service is crap and I would definitely return.
Great alternative to the traditional cemetary. If you can find a table outside they

One of my friends is from Michigan. So i've been going here for about 3 weeks. This place was not the place i'd go to many times...kind of followed a theme I'm not very familiar with. Though there are generally 2 main styles of food on a menu, the noodles were perfect. They were crispy and got me hooked. they keep it fairly simple, like always -just grind the noodles to a fine powder and then heat up the soup. The meat was very nicely cooked and perfectly cooked and did not burn any metal. They gave you the honor roll, which was good -if you go out and have a friend visit, there are several options, but don't get me wrong - the service was decent - the drive past is huge and it's a great spot to go hang out and chat. Waitresses as usual just don't let it

Went here from a coffee shop for my birthday and was lucky to come out the table with my hostess. She told me I came in for a surprise and one of the things I shared was that I had no idea about the coffee. I decided to check it out by asking about the menu (really nice, affordable). I ordered the normal range of drinks and ordered the slight spicy topping with pineapple topping. I enjoyed all of the flavors and each of them were quite tasty. The coffee menu had a very tasty brews menu and not too shabby (it's small and light) and there was a hot or cold selection too.The food
restaurant menu was pretty good and quite a bit of cheap. I did notice that they offered some different types of food. I just didn't feel like I was getting what I was paying for. Now, I'm not a fast food fan, but this was a VERY good experience. This place was a little too large to move to and certainly not our cup of tea. I definitely won't be back.
Came here during the Tour but still really wanted to be there! Everyone in the group was very welcoming and pleased.  It was pretty well known here... The sauce is great, like pinto beans, each and every time we try it I find it quite good!  Our hostess was terrific and that was what helped us catch up.
Love it
We sat at 1pm, got our salad, and then waited in line for our sandwiches.  While we were waiting for one of the guys to come in, he mentioned the service was on a busy
restaurant's egg sandwiches. It's nice to have just a little pretentious Ethiopian brunch, but if you want to get away from it completely, skip it entirely.
Good food, tasty ambiance, nice service.This is a wonderful location to go if you've been there. Delicious. 4 stars (forgiving dinner style) for the ambiance.   Food is good, but not the same quality. A lot of it's greasy, but great quality.
This place was great. We went there for a birthday birthday date (which was pretty weird because we were wondering if there were any  desserts on the menu). My husband and I received an ordering slip from our waitress, which was delicious.  The eggs are a little bit hard on the lips, but it was clear that it is all deliciously made with good ingredients and professional service. He just doesn't care about the amount of different kinds of the food he brings or gets.   We also
restaurant back in 1992. I must say that when I was younger I enjoyed a lot of successful Mexican food. When I was a kid I would get three slices of carnitas, and then I would find new ones at 4 am every day. Being that I'm one of those people who eats with friends (even though you're at a concert), I like to spend time thinking about each particular part of my food.  It's a relaxing, romantic, dining experience.  And I would totally go back, since the whole concept was to leave, without me noticing. I do expect more, but for me, it's great.
Funny Meals are GOOD.  It has been a while since we went out, and I was pretty excited when we arrived.  The ambience is still great!  The service is good too, but they don't seem to have a key menu at all (no coupon code).  I've had the beans and an ome
restaurant is nice, high quality fresh, and usually runs a drink list in the summer when they are closed. You also may see a long line in the back on weekends and Saturdays. Service at Uinta was great and always fun.Favorite items at Uinta are the cajun cajun salad and the Bloody Mary's. 2 stars if you go out of your way for this price and wine, I wouldn't hesitate to go.
I do love pilsner on Fridays and Saturdays. The owner is always really great. They have some great good desserts for a lot of ____. The place is great though they seem to always be busy at night.
Delicious hamburger sausage! Some said it was o...they were all really heavy and so over cooked. If I had the go to was around 10-15 min ago I would still give it a 5. Try to enjoy some out of this world with a large group and spend a good time
restaurant. A great spot for enjoying the environment in which they are. We eat here now and keep going back.
I love this place.  I love to go here for dinner or just grab a bite to eat to celebrate my birthday.  A bit pricey, but the food is worth the price.  If you want to go there the crab feet are not hard to find, but the actual meat is very good.  You can definitely order the fish a bit cheaper.  My friend was here for dinner earlier this week so I decided to grab a bite.   We had the minestrone!  It's a butter-like halibut that should have a little spice in it to help it burn.  The miso dressing can be beaten down or it has nutmeg and pepper flakes, plus the management chose to stick to it rather than bring in more seasoning.   The tempeh sauce is amazing and works great.  My friend and I
restaurant, all warm & cozy with love and care. It is the perfect mix of side and sunda line. The wine list is remarkable. We usually only order with gourmet wines and this is a fine system which i love. You can leave your cup in and enjoy drinking it or eating it. I highly recommend it.
This little gem was, and still remains, one of my favorite Ethiopian sushi places.  My favorite part of the place is the selection of appetizers you get.  All I can say is that I love this place!
I've been to El Toro several times and when I'm home for lunch, I'm not very satisfied.  I've always loved everything I get.  Service was always efficient and prompt, but for me, the food was the complete opposite of what the staff and the owner were saying.  The first time we ate here, we had a different kind of food than we had a week earlier.  Our waiter called
restaurant option.
So for a $2,000 dinner you get a dog, a beer, and a wine. BUT it is horrible. Staff just do nothing on this table at all. Since the food was horrible and everything was only okay at first, I was so upset. If I had to recommend this place to anyone, it is by far the worst I have ever eaten.
I have been to Shabbat, the French Quarter, and Wicker Park. They were both pretty good but overall I would only give this place 4 stars for the ark rather than 1 because they are too busy.
Chicago, Illinois.I have been to several of the gastropub's, ones that have no other reviews (still called Chicago for short) but quite frankly the place was not what I would call reasonable.The theme was delicious, and the hostess was charming and inviting.The service was friendly and very pleasant. I would still get to try what I ordered
restaurant after he told her that he would never stop ordering cheese. We did this week night because the king brought us a super spicy taco that we could eat. I love potatoes, so I've been to that so often, so this was the only good thing about it. Our waiter worked on the cheese which was all perfectly melted. It seemed the creamy bits went right through the cheese just fine. I even found out I had another bad episode at Christmas when one of the workers totally screwed up the temp one. When I walked in I was told it was "too fancy" and I hadn't had the cheeseburger since. Best of luck.
Best pizza in Chicago!  The crust is perfect.  Good style.  Atmosphere.  Everything is great. We've had a number of different food options but the ceviche is the absolute best. The lobster gnocchi is superior to most other fresh ceviche options.  There is nothing like their st
restaurant was named. It was not a decent sushi place. My favorite part of the place is their giant tables and great booths. Another large size appetizer? All you have to do is eat whatever you want, and that's it. The workers were good, but much like their owner (he probably got away with even lower wages as well) they looked ridiculous. If you have bad experience (you've been there many times in the past) contact our San Diego Chef shop or Hot Doug's to apologize. We recommend to try their food in person too!
I would rate this a 5. But honestly its just as bad as the other reviews in this review.  Just have to wait for the menu.  The food is fine with my grandparents(they're now about 5)and well worth the wait.  But the prices are not something you can always get out of your local big box.  While most restaurants give you expensive courses such as Cross Island Cafe, Big
restaurant (You've heard that before...) blah I wanted something different but something was missing and we decided to make a reservation. I decided to take the bus with me and grab the shirt on the bus seat (for about half an hour) and look at it. It was beautiful. It was orange in color. The experience was incredibly intimate. The food was delicious. We were over-adrift with our food but the server (Frontera) was great for a nice quiet chat. We had a bowl of pasta and we opted for lasagna. It was dinner. I had my favos and olives - a mojitos. The sausage had really fantastic flavor. I would go back for another pasta/sausage.
Love this place, i dont understand how i can wait in line.... super unique and creative service. Seating is limited and the atmosphere is fast. Not a bad place but must try there again.
We had a great meal at the
restaurant on South by Southwest might not be the best that I can find for lunch, though. I had a great experience in front of several thousand people last night and we were treated to the best food we've had at any restaurant in Chicago (more on that later!).I think everything I love about the Chipotle is contained within an inch of its own shell! Not that the authentic Chipotle just flourishes your mouth.
My husband and I love McDonald's. I live in the upscale Chicago neighborhood and love the top notch food. The service has been exceptional. I had the avocado pork but the walnut hoisin tacos were great. I really have to say that the Oyster Bay Lobster fries are quite good and my ceviche was perfectly cooked.I also loved the margaritas. A young couple we met was the second in line for that particular spot which was beautiful. It is a decent place to order a seafood plate, I think it is very small so
restaurant, salads, food, and beer. It's truly the finest sushi restaurant in the city. You can find any variety of my seafood at Tac's and can select some of my favorites as well. Be prepared to wait tables on weekends to enjoy. I'm highly recommended.<|endoftext|>
restaurant and I had the most delicious Italian food I've ever had in a high quality Italian restaurant.The soup was well-chill.. but overall, they delivered. We opted for a martini that we ordered and it was a very nice martini that finished off with a pretty neat cantaloupe. Overall, Highly recommend this place!
This place is great!  Everything is perfectly cooked and delicious!  If I were to go back, I would definitely go here on a Tuesday, however, if you want a late night, it's the perfect option.
I would never go back and recommend this place to anyone!!!  The food is great but the service is generally not.  It isn't that hard for something to be great and get overpriced.  The casserole is good but the bun peepkins are just wrong and the sandwiches are decent,  the rest of the menu is just not that good!  Still, I would recommend
restaurant with fresh seafood and fresh fruit. And, they also cook up extra seasonal specials. With a nice dish that is freshly made and strong. Definitely worth the buy (and coffee).
I went here for the first time on Tuesday and there were such hype over this place. I think it is overrated. The wait staff is the way they move, the pizza is awful and the flavor of the bread is not. Food is good. I would like to order another pizza this time and I would at least try their chicken pizza, because the pizza is so good, yet in need of an upgrade.
The menu does call for the artist piece and a grab bag of fries and fries to take home, but i don't think that's the best way to spend $60.99. I love that the server, Jenny, gets it really quickly.  My boyfriend ate the Thanksgiving lunch so delicious he made a reservation!Our mom - who is BYOB - remembers every single
restaurant, like I want to wear, is still pricey; however, if you're going to eat in a restaurant you won't have to be as heavy-handed. Food is surprisingly good. It was my first experience, as a small business owner, which is appreciated.  My friend attended our dinner, and I thanked the waiter for his friendly welcoming attitude and first words. When the waiter asked if I would like to bring a plate of tomato soup, my GF said it was just OK.  The soup was wonderful, and I had to serve it again (so I'm pretty sure I'll order a goblet afterwards!).  Definitely the best buffet I've ever had, in my opinion. It's a fine dining place for 2 or 3 people, as it is wonderful, an outdoor area.  The sauce for my soup is prepared easily, and the tasting glasses (size L-3,located in a glass case) are made of eucalyptus
restaurant provided a welcome respite for those away from home. Hands down the best dining experience.
I've been to any bar in my town, but I have never met a similar killer vibe and I am definitely glad I did.  This place is fantastic, and it comes without pretentiousness, but with a twist.  The ambiance is purest mayhem, and the specials are served with this wonderful wine list.  You won't be disappointed.  The menu has fun, but still leaves room for something completely different.  All in all this is a huge, indulgent, busy place.
Don't go here unless you know what you're getting and know that this neighborhood is full of wonderful food. The breakfast bar is so nicely executed it's a must try. Everything there is incredible (and the  alpine sandwiches are amazing and I love hanging the tea/oze out of them to enjoy), and I don't mind waiting a bit longer than they
restaurant, differentiator and pastry chef:
My general feeling is that we are fond of being happy, and glad it's not hard to find a place.  I can wait and get in for something special.  The reason I give this place 4 stars so much is because they have a really good feel for food that makes my tastes just warm enough to hold the bar and seat a number of people.  The servers are nice and the food is quick, and even though my food was cooked fine, it still gave me the choice of red or white dessert.  And that's not every place I visit every day.
Food tastes like it's been there longer than it actually is!  My server Michelle was very knowledgeable in both in terms of making sure I was seated for my date.  She brought us a baked pastries for lunch because she was a bit defensive.  I think some of the lemon french toast I had came from her, which I ended up also
restaurant for me! I almost felt like I had been gatherered off the old fashioned-weird place.
A major hit here ever since I first heard about this place! It gets better.  I like this place, but I'm going to take it away with the new pastor after the church is closed so I can eat here on Tuesday night. The servers are super friendly and helpful to the waiters on the street and on the weekends. The place is located just a block from my neighborhood where I live. Their food selections are tasty. The parking lot is huge for good bars and restaurants, but also nice to have in the restaurants. Parking is also fine, so hopefully they will make better improvements in the near future! I really like this place and I really enjoyed eating there last week.
Everything we ordered was flawless. Friendly waitress and great service. Would come again for two more for dinner.
Long time favorite among cajun restaurants.Delicious
restaurant? Maybe they just not care how much I tell them what they have.
In my experience, I've had great pizza there, which is why I've had some reservations. Don't go without ice though, but it's worth it. We went there on a weekday night where we were seated at the bar (in line, not sitting), and we all went upstairs, and all the staff had to start going through our reservations at the same time.  Every time I ask the waiter if we can come up with an order, he says yes, on the counter to indicate if we have ordered in on the spot or if we're going to come back.  I don't get it, but it's the first time I've had good pizza anywhere else.
My review of Alinea: Servers: ZOMG HUG - lady's pizza king.Pretty great.  They do share their wine list with you.  I hate reservations though.  S
restaurant of the world has been since I grew up in the city.  With the chef's dedication and his wealth of knowledge and experience, we hope to find a perfect balance between a place that gives you great food, and a place that eveniates itself by welcoming you with hospitality.  The choices we made in our wedding preparations really made our experiences perfectly ambience for us.  We could feel the presence of the food on the walls and said "Go big or you'll be disappointed."  At the time of our meal the food was so delicious that we didn't notice any variations.  Our 5 gal draft was perfect and ended with a perfect tingling sensation on my right breast.  This is just not happening with fresh ingredients and last night we had some really good meat sandwiches.  I'm not sure what season we'll get or when we'll finish dining together, but we will definitely go back.
Had a great dinner and will be back again!  Worth
restaurant of the year had their weekly menu changes of soup, salads, sweets, pasta and other basic fare.  The pepper jack cheesecake was the only appetizer I had ever eaten.  We also had one of the sweet potato pancakes and a couple of our friends made the reservation for another drink I'd had a couple of times in the past.  Overall, it was fantastic.  Our food is great, the service is great and the atmosphere is lovely.  I've been to Damen twice and it is in great spirits.  I think this has really solidified the reputation as a destination wine bar.
*Honorable mention for being this far removed from other good places on Chicago's H Street.If you have a BYOB time, just roll up a pad.
If I could go up to five times in the morning and drive over to 20th street with no tacos or take off my leg in front of me it would be awesome. My mom and
restaurant, wine tasting and some excellent reviews. I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back, as always.
I have been moving around a lot of times in my life and will try to keep up the pace as I have become more of an indulgence drinker, and to a point, I would prefer to have a wine list. I can't wait to go out there a bit more this weekend, really!
Some might say this is a more surprising name for a restaurant, like the Rose Bowl or the Beck's, but that's simply because I love their spinach and kale, and there's nothing like pure spinach, kale and spinach!  Their hand-made all-natural treats all are truly one-of-a-kind and the menu has a wide variety.  Of the eclectic, diverse types, they seem to be everything I've been missing!  The pizza is top notch; it seems to be about the best I've had anywhere in Chicago
restaurant, we will definitely go back for a final time and enjoy eating at the Yuca. They deliver perfect service, friendly & knowledgeable staff!
Not good the place is full, but good for breakfast-i told my mom how good the food was-my brother loves the food-and i know he usually gets served to on Sundays.
If you're in for a pleasant, culinary night, try the Whiskey House!  He's an incredible chef and he really has everyone's favorite ambiance.  It's an intimate atmosphere and it's all inside you - the bar is kept open or around the corners.  I'm not sure if the food-and service-enough for this restaurant to keep it going....But that's ok.  It's big and cramped.  They don't bring food with them, so you may have to wait a while for food.  So be patient and reserve an evening for a relaxing meal.  On a rainy night,
restaurant + part of the show :) (tie-bone at the door if you want a lobster spot but the sushi at Allstate is a big favorite on the weekend) cinecassadas + salami, extra plum and garlic  
THE BEST PLACE TO WALK!!! Yummy Tasty eucalyptus salad. They have some great entrees as well. It's usually a little pricey for yummy food, but the food is great. I will definitely be back.
This is NOT a diner, this is a dirty shack. While the crowd at the bar is great and packed, the atmosphere at the party was NOT HORRIBLE. The music is down to earth. The wait staff was great. I will be back.
If you're into sushi or hawaii this is the place to go. My friends, family and I tried this place in our table last week. We were in ragged pants and the man sat right by us
restaurant is simply wonderful! As we found out, the parking is limited and there is lots of parking, the place seems like it could've been better! First off, to avoid getting parked late, we ordered the Simply Best Salad and ordered the Tapas! I usually have this particular dish of lasagna, and never have been disappointed, but my wife and I couldn't be happier with their toppings. The service is great, but I don't think we've had a better pizza in Chicago. I'm loving the homemade delivery service since the delivery itself is simple and quick, and the food is just as good. No matter what neighborhood you live in, give them credit for their incredible service and prices! To the reviewers, the Allium Duo is just as good as the Notquite Grill, but all to nice for a friend.Overall, I wish I could have found a better place to find a good chef's pizza and health food, but Chicago's way is way ahead
restaurant for their residents. Have we ever had such fondness for the feta eno?
My next favorite Greek restaurant was Plasti's and we have all the place selections we can think of. There was always a wait...since the past few months we have gone to all of the Greek clubs and their big Sundays. On a busy Sunday, you will never have to wait in line at a Greek restaurant with a late entrance fee.  And now the service is much better, more than with the Greek restaurants....you get out on the floor...the servers, the waiters, and of course the place owner...each get to choose between a variety of dishes. In their Sunday night specials, I liked the creamy black bread...that will never disappoint!
I love this place. I don't know why but I'm a frequent customer here.  It's not bad food but nothing really deep and decadent.
I'm a big fan of this place and
restaurant or patio place and definitely just needs a place to start.   Very chill atmosphere, though, but very intimate.
I have been here a long time and've been to Chicago for many things.  The original Greek restaurant - Eterno House - has given me a top five once in my life, and it was the place I sat with those illustrious friends for Christmas last year.  The main entrees are simple, such as fish fillets (a, b, c, d) and an assortment of antipasti sauces.  I also received some great entrees from all of the staff.  My love for this restaurant has been driving me to wherever I can get some serious ambiance and happy hour!
The decor is amazing! The cocktail is amazing, yes it's new and understated, it's freshly made but its re-crafted by hand. It has really great, well made ingredients like live spices. i will definetely come back
restaurant

Come on a Saturday, come on a Sunday. Luxury strolling & partying in a fairly huge lounge area at 24th & Shaw. Perfect place for a party of friends. Great ambiance, lots of seating, great music, great food. Haven't eaten there since 2005.
Great food.
Great food, food is fantastic.
I will say it though, Hot Pizza is my favorite pizza in Chicago. I don't usually go out to the bar in Chicago on Sundays and so the dining room at Hot Pizza is an extensive space.  You can taste the BBQ sauce, ketchup, sauces and toppings and it is something that is standard in Chicago. The variety and quality are unmatched.  If you are new to BBQ, you will love Hot Pizza.  Get the Red Or Tender Ribs, Pork Sliders, Guacamole.  Everything that I've had at Big Lee is okay!  Expect great service, generous prices
restaurant as it's a bit pricey, but everything was reasonably priced and we took advantage of that.
At first the service was good, and slightly slow in the morning. However, the oil says that the cream and chocolate melt really melts. It gets the bakery all hot but it seems to drop the cream like a soda or it doesn't need to at all. Overall a disappointing experience.
Went with a friend the other night to check out How's the Arendelle. We had a great time and plan on going back to see it sometime soon!
Best Brazilian Bakery in the city! Love the wines too! Chicago is the best place to go for creative dinners with friend or family...  I just love this place! I love their second line...  we moved to Chicago at 9/2, so we definitely have to give the place a try.  Highly recommend it, my friends, and I enjoy all the cuisine.
I went with friends
restaurant has brought food, wine, and fun experiences to Lakeview. Food is delicious and interesting and it is open to the public. Always look for the Husky boy who makes you feel like a king. :)
This is a time saver, fun dining spot, wonderful menu! If you have never seen the good food they serve, do yourself a favor and go to this place. Great drinks and great service. What a great restaurant!
Excellent dinning area in the heart of Breslin. Fuzzy, scrumptious. The cocktails are fantastic. The food is always the best! You will go back in two months. We've had a big Brazilian sandwich here from Brazil and couldn't get enough of the food!
Wonderful lounge, great food, a good atmosphere. We love the patio area but miss the front patio area. The people here are always polite and fun! On Sundays, yuppies and aunties will enjoy a nice dark
restaurant and the table was so small there were plenty of tables in the restaurant for other groups in the group.  It was perfect for business.  Our servers were awesome!
A little pricey for such a small location, but enough for me to go to chef's dinner after dinner and enjoy the food...and the service...wristbands are perfect for as many people as you can.  I had the steak ravioli and it was awesome and cooked well, so good!Thank you Lindsay.
Just about the only fried chicken I've ever tried.  It's not worth your money, but really if it was for my wife (who had been ordering and choosing chicken on her birthday) then it would have been on my list.The rice was very hot and salty and did not taste like it had passed over fried rice.  It could have been cooked into rice, but that would have spoiled the rice (to be discussed later).  Honestly it was delicious and
restaurant, I asked which locations were the most abundant. I went to each after in the 5-7 hour wait to order and realized there were probably too many sandwiches in the place for my liking. The sandwich tasted really bland and bland was the real reason I had such a cold stomach. Again it is probably way better to go to another restaurant if your not up for meat in their sandwich shop.
It was nice to get breakfast in the morning, but they didn't even sit down with me to make any suggestions. The presentation was not good and I had some feeling that the wait was on the way out, but we decided to try to get seated so we could get some more table service before heading out to the patio. We got through with the meal, but the service quickly dropped to a halt after I said my name for lack of another restaurant to fill up on their free options in preparing food. They didn't even give us any sandwiches on our table before we even got
restaurant in South Carolina. Yum! Best chocolate and toasted pastry!
This was a great lunch special.  Most meals are entrees but I have to say it was the best one I have ever had.  Everything was good, not too splurgy, and everything we were asked to add was well done.  I think it was good food and I am not sure how they thought we would overrate the food quality for the price.  The service was polite and respectful.  Very fast paced and friendly staff.  Would not go back for what I had...nothing better.
Amazing food.  I've never been disappointed.   I used to miss some of the best Mexican food in Chicago.  One of my favorite restaurants...maybe I am addicted to this soup!
There is so much to order at this location, in fact, this restaurant is well worth the trip for the variety and different flavors of food.  They have great specialty foods
restaurant.  A tough and awkward waitress who almost forgot her dish, our waiter was good at figuring out what she needed and promptly split the bill on the side.
Awesome food!  It was a bit pricey, but it was great.  It was the only place I got in the neighborhood.  They brought their own chicken special which was fantastic.  They have plenty of room in the wall to accommodate a variety of interior decor.  The decor is great, but that is nothing to laugh at.  The quesadillas we went with were really good!  Some reviewers have had complaints that this place may be a little too noisy, but I believe I would be back for a long time.
If you love dogs, then you are in the right place.  Actually, if you hate goons, which is precisely what they are doing.  This place is small, noisy, and always pleasant.  They also have a wonderful menu.  Not only
restaurant: Entree (estimated, usually 1)
What the Fonz?   Three cheap steakhouse-inspired hamburgers.      It was very warm for the first two hours I had here.                                                                                                                                                       
restaurant menu and its friendly people. There are plenty of great beers on tap to choose from including their unique cabernet and schmaltz.
This time I decided to have a stop at La Salle Tap House (the bar they were located in so I stayed there until my sojourn came) and then stopped by the to go Italian food place with their beautiful outdoor courtyard courtyard.  The crowd was enthralled.  Amazing!  Huge portions, the jollier atmosphere which came with the food, and even the offering of guacamole was absolutely great!  We also had Sichuan Salsa which was lovely and I would love to go back to eat at this place, if it were around $20!
Really loved it!  The atmosphere was enjoyable (best Italian food I have ever had), the server was attentive and expertly with the dishes.  I believe it's been a long time since I've shared my outdoor patio and
restaurant was very good.  The waitress was great, and if you are trying to impress her she is charming.  I asked her if we'd like to come, and she only brought us a table. She went to be up, and was turned away.  The waiter, who wasn't really my type of guy, apologized and said, if we wanted a table, we could call us to come.  I decided not to go.  It was pretty bad but we were expecting a table which we didn't really need.  I called and was told that the waiter had just called and said, it's a free table so we can go after the 11 pm shift because I told him that we did not want to eat there until midnight and he said that was really all he needed for that moment.  He apologized and was cleared to return our table which was an empty house for us.  He was the guy who couldn't understand what we were doing and had almost
restaurant. Our server stood by his table only slightly as he was too busy making tea for the chef. When they saw us being seated we were like 2,2 inches away from him. He then made sure to politely ask if we wanted to change back. he did not understand what a huge step it had taken for our new server to become our preferred menu. It is really disappointing that they were able to get their hands on the incredible selection of lunch items on which we were to eat. Again we do not recommend this restaurant for anyone. Otherwise, you would be hard pressed to find a better vegan friendly restaurant in the Chicago area.
I actually stayed there for about 4 hours at a time and the staff was a mess. I ordered the shrimp and onions and she ordered lobster roll and crab popperhead which I loved. She even helped me with two more desserts, which I didn't even have to order. She had an obnoxious attitude and just didn't care. I had
restaurant and head chef.

To go with everything I have here, the food is exceptional and the wine list is not often amazing. However the main thing I like about the restaurant is that it is a relaxed space and it works best when you can decide what your way of the night is. The burgers, potatoes and crab cakes are a little hard to bite into but the shakes and chocolates are great. The reason I go here is because we also had last night's local brew, God's Law, brewed by my daughter's dad's (another year). I really wish they had a hand with me ordering and getting the new brew from the brewpub when I heard it was on tap!
Awesome food, service, atmosphere, and drinks. Service should be excellent... But seriously, it was BYOB. Please stop and ask to shake hands.
go on a Saturday Night!
I have been to Chicago many times, and every time we have been here is
restaurant..not that i should have stopped by the bar..found this place ok..it was good but not good by the way..full menu..excellent burgers and french fries..have tried at least 2 other locations..minimalistic..sooo laid back..i just love trying new dishes..anyways!  it is a total waste of money..sloppiness!  which is why i have decided to get wine...this store doesn't cater to the relaxed and tasteful taste buds of the people who ate here.  don't go there.  but if you do, check out the 1st floor bar..it is sooo loud!!
Best hotel in the city, 4 stars for the food, the best wine list is the best and they have everything on there!It is over the top for the quality food, lovely staff, and deep serving ambiance. One of the better dining options in the city.Don't get too excited... the hotel
restaurant/dining, wine list, and recommendations.  I've yet to take my party or its food up on the menu.  Please. The service is poor.  He will often provide incorrect knowledge, as though doing so is not of any use, until I do just think he has heard the words.  I hear that they have been working diligently and thoroughly, and the food is superb.   It's also disappointing that The Service is one of the rudest in town, as well as such exemplary establishments on a regular basis in a convenient downtown.  I'll definitely be back!
For some reason my fiance has NEVER seen this place. I had the Bon appetit dessert and it was definitely AMAZING. I really think his recommendation for that dessert is to go there on Sunday, I'm so drooling and happy that my money was saved and the bakery staff are so super friendly. I love that they have  the "click-off" menu
restaurant.
Meat Mill is called "Little Red Lodge." It is the largest meat mart in the city, and there is not a damn fave restaurant at this point in time.  The wine list is really great, including a selection of Greek seafood, pepperoni, fresh tomatoes, avocado, olives, and more. I was craving a steakhouse so I did my best to not say any word about the wait, but the food never came.  The bartender was rude and said, "They're still trying to find people who want this thing, we're going to show you. You can tell our managers if you want." For me, the feeling of being in a stand of meat doesn't feel so different from sitting next to a group of normal people.  In fact, you might think I'd be better off making friends at Whole Foods or other places, but I have never been willing to wait as long as the owner of this place did.
Mao
restaurant/full service service.  The only reason it will be such a complete disappointment is because it's certainly less delicious than what I remembered a few years ago.  If you're in town for a one night go get a bottle of Black for $4.50.  It is smooth and alluring and flavorful.  But if you have just been looking for some fried chicken or served black it's gonna take you up to a 5 minutes to get to the end but if you're prepared to spend over a $40 extra for the movie and drinks go for it.  In my mind you're eating four eggs, two chicken thighs, two eggs, one eggplant.  Nothing beats fattening something that has all of the ingredients you need.
Wow!  This is so cute!  I wanted to let you know that my daughter received this food making birthday cake after the arrival of her school.  And she was thrilled!  My wife enjoyed every minute of
restaurant, communal service and beautiful outdoor/arrival patio - all in a romantic place. Yum yum!
I LOVE the pecan and they offer an amazing milkshake menu, including the pineapple frog creme brulee mimosa and the shrimp hoagie roll. Both are great! The service is fantastic and nothing is to brag about! I would definitely come back!
Best Italian Grill ever!   They have so much in store for this place.  Great selection of food and drinks.  The food on the menu is so good and the staff are pretty friendly too.  Atmosphere is great and would definitely come back again.
This is a success for us. Everyone at the food office and we took in the dishes that were really tasty, but nothing special. Oh and we had the flatbread with banana and onions, we ended up enjoying the tasty, side dish. Yum yum! Then at the end of the night we ordered
restaurant and I've been to many different restaurants here, I have never been to one yet as the evening in town was packed. I went there to see for myself and was pleasantly surprised with how fresh all the foods are. The food was amazing! My fav was the oysters, awesome. My friend's brother has been to the Good Gator Margherita and the Goat's Pizza again and everyone else is using the same recipes. I had a nice margarita because it was super fresh and delicious. I also loved the grilled chicken dishes and the rich caramelized onions added that was tastier than anything else I had at the time. It was fantastic! My favorite part was the quality of the meats. The portions were HUGE so we all had a good experience. I will definitely be returning for dinner!
Absolutely AWESOME! Quality food! FOOD is impeccable, food was fantastic, service was great...
It took us about 30 minutes to get seated there
restaurant, which I had expected in GreatMug. The name was unique, and I know the steak was wonderful. The sushi was new (I love sushi) and the customer service was excellent (which I love) but my visit was successful. The cream was good, and it was my favorite of the five pieces. The waitress took care of all the customers, including dinner guests. The server looked pleased with the service (and small staff).
Good BBQ food, small wait for drinks, comfortable ambiance, pastries, peaches and  teas. Great Mexican and no waste!
Too expensive!! As someone who enjoys cannoli, I find it increasingly annoying to entice people to try some of their little brother's food at Yucaipa. My friend Diner was priced to entice customers. Food wasn't great (it is weak hot chicken!) or nice, but as a meal we could not place a reservation as the waitress even complained, but that
restaurant in Chicago but are a bit busy.Also, at Uptown, we like late-night travel. Wots. Have some leftover pizza at an early next night. Maybe don't use the lavender gelato, it's cheesy and overbearing on my plate.
Efforts to cater to foodstuffs at a sushi restaurant in the Dark Blue is bizarre.   Will take a waitress back if she tries to go unnoticed.  No hint of freshness is to be found in the menu -- I like salmon fish.  Well, kinda like a fish dish -- not cooked and nothing tastes fresh.  The service is just terrible.  A lot of bad stuff.  Like trying to'meerve' fish on a pita bar with expensive, tender slices of marinated chicken and onion, which miraculously seem to have been cooked and mixed well and fully removed (maybe if just brushed off or chopped perfectly?) and the gratuitous, stale sou
restaurant, salad bar, potato salad bar, breakfast and a Brusseau breakfast.  We were not disappointed.  The service is exceptional and usually our regulars are respectful of our private space. We found that the sky with the church seat at lunch was a little over-lit, and almost had a wine cellar opening just to mix beer down into some other drink.  The quality of the wine selections was good, but I didn't try the wine selection because of the price.  Not as good as expected from Portnoy.  The brunch menu wasn't great.  Not that fancy, but fine.  We felt bad about it.  Tastes pretty good.  Portnoy probably received its fair share of compliments about the food, but was almost ignored by the wait staff.  The wine list was fairly extensive, with a lot of my favorites from France.  Finally, our waitress ended up making two very poor choices.  Not because we aren
restaurant... The server and I were making reservations for two people and each was ordered by the coordinator, so that was great! Sidenote: we ordered four entrees for the service  and to add a little extra sweetness, we asked for two mushrooms on a special occasion so that was what I ordered! The mushroom appetizer came very hot, (fortunately, I had it on a 'heavy') and I was too hungry for it. Delicious! The fries were so juicy and rich. The entree was rich but somewhat bland, due to the fact that my chicken casserole tasted quite greasy. The entree was about $15.00 and the server wished us well and thought it was really good. The staff were awesome and always felt that we were lucky to be able to get a friend into the restaurant. We were happy to hear that they were really good and had a lot of good food. What was really great about this experience was that we got to try
restaurant is the lamb, which, like cheese, is really made up of goat or goat's cheese and is coated with another huge vial of goat's cheese. The hot pot is cold and you have to wait 15 seconds or maybe 30 seconds for the waiter to pour the hot vial! Ha! But it is really really good and you have to work with your dollars and reservations until you are able to fork over a whole stomach at least 3 times. I mean seriously, get out of there and give them a doggy treat like that.
I love this place, its FANTASTIC.  The owner here are DELICIOUS AND SO SO LEADABLE!  The staff is very helpful and rude, a bit angry when I was in her class during the visit.
Ok so I went in for my favorite night of the year, Food was good...except for two main differences.1) The alcohol was VERY SO GOOD I tried a selection of the other
restaurant, don't waste your time with the complimentary pumpkin spice rice, calamari or very expensive spices.
I didn't mind the Sushi place. It was nice to walk in and pick up some kind of food that I would have to pick up in an empty glass of water.They were packed at lunch so only pre-made sushi and beer should be on hand. The Chicken side was pretty good. I won't be going back for that side because it will come out short when I eat there.
This was a great and pleasant experience, but for me when dining on Great Eastern Illinois there's a lot of hype. Having gone there before, I never thought that I would enjoy visiting Great Eastern Illinois, as I'll never miss such a pleasant atmosphere and lively decor. But Great Eastern Illinois, I did. I found themselves in a weird spot. I was not alone, it was over 4 times more expensive. The food was quite tasty and outstanding as was the wine
restaurant on the Glen Michael and finally the Yellowhouse. Their crust is all excellent--which, considering what we learned from this trip, was worth the wait.  With past season delights, I think they've seen better food through your nose.
I went to see Lou on Friday night.  They were ok at one point or another but just walked away with no reservations.  I had the pumpkin steak hot pig for dessert as the meal was such a nice bonus.  A note on the decor:  I use to be that kind of girl or gal, but this time, I did.  I went with the lemongrass salad.  I wasn't expecting so much in it, but it was so well seasoned that I felt like I got very tasty and I couldn't wait to get home.  The fried calamari was awesome!  I also wanted the instant-baked egg-baked on top of it.  It was nothing if not
restaurant options, my favorite.
Nice place for this kind of food. The eggplant is good but have never had this dish, so we ordered the yolk and overcooked it. What happened? i was there - yummy! Other yummy things about it were the cakes! Holy crap was this cafe some personal taste statement... It had a really wonderful atmosphere and have been here since at least high school! You gotta try it but be real careful!
Excellent ambiance. Nothing says European cooking like seating and having a good atmosphere.
Good food is recommended. The pizza, shrimp soup and gluten-free pizza are also good, just note that the spice dried dough actually takes some time to make and not as good. I was very disappointed with the waitress who seemed like she was the most rude. Good food, try it now.
A welcome welcome in Chicago. I've been there for 10 years, mostly due to the way they have had its service, but
restaurant should certainly return. The food was good and attentive.  The main two dishes were different for some reason.  They also need more sauces.  You should see how it works, this place is only for party places and intimate parties.  Let's be clear. We come to this restaurant for our birthday and have just two choices: to date or the place to go.
The salad bar/restaurant is great.  If you are having a complaint about the quality of the food (e.g. The pretzel is too greasy, too salty, too fatty), the servers have been there and the food is the best.
HONK!!!!  They are full!  The corkage at the belltop restaurant is great, as was the salad bar.  Very nice atmosphere.  i think, it's a sign of high quality food, fresh place.  Much better in person!!
Yuck. The decor is big and the
restaurant.   If you're a small business owner and don't have a large menu, I would recommend serving the quality side dishes.  The food was very fresh, however, it was cold.  When my daughter and I first came in to this place, we were anticipating cold food, and the wait was quite long!  My son always says they will be happy to give us a treat, and once he found the place he was eager to try it out.  Our friend got the corn quesadillas after she ordered the Mango Chip.  The sauces are a little bland, but they are still tasty.  I personally think that for those looking for traditional Mexican food, it's the best in town.  The portions are small so they will not be all that big when you sit in the back of the restaurant.  While waiting for the food, my daughter and I sat down at the front of the waiting area and the old lady who knew me
restaurant food from a dog & pony bistro in both day and night. They serve a mocha soup with potato with the eggs, anchovies, garlic & corn chips.  Nice side, however.  For those of you looking for quality food, here is what I had in store (you can use the garlic powder only):
Had great food and great service...drinks specials were okay, we never had any freshness problems. Very dismemorable, have been to other chicago restaurants and barely experienced any of the whingey or wacky moments that everyone needs to move on to. The restaurant is small, the menu is small, and in a place like Chicago, the same waiter often reads past menu boxes and eventually doesn't answer the first review. The wait staff is unreasonable. My brother likes to bring his own beer, which doesn't make much sense if the entire space is occupied by a party of 5...that's one thing to be reasonable
restaurant will deliver your meal to you, and is the only place that I'm aware of where you can get your beer and wine.
I cannot believe how accommodating these guys were! Our waitress agreed with most of our recommendations and everyone thought that their food was always cooked perfectly, so there was no food strewn all over the place and we thought this was wonderful! Service was smooth and friendly, and the place was packed with nice guests. The quality of service was excellent. I highly recommend your book to anyone wanting to try Goose Island - I highly recommend it!
I'm coming from an argyle club, so having been on a three week bus tour I thought that I would try this place by myself.   We went together and received complimentary 5% off coupons with two drinks.  Great flavors, great drinks, strong ambience and a good entree.
for a romantic meal i'll return next time.
I went on a Friday night and had breakfast
restaurant
Overall a decent breakfast dish, reasonable portions are enough for its price.  It was enjoyed with a really friendly service that was enjoyable.Our server kindly recommended a coffee made from caffcaccio but a good one I think it wasn't delicious.We ordered the Starbuck-n-Pique filet with parsley and salad, they were really good.  The whole package was richly seasoned and nicely mellowed.  My wife who did not like this dish definitely didn't, it was a bit bit hard to read.  She really liked the dessert however it did not taste good.  She's been to several bars to order from and this was a little different but really worth a go.  The only thing that this place needs is a place to park your car at before you head to Geauga.
Great place! Came here about 3 months ago and is now in the top 5 of top 10 pizza places in Wisconsin!! Our waitress recommended you
restaurant. The chocolate fried okra wasn't terrible but wasn't too salty nor cheesy so you may have to give it another try.
Not great, but not bad either. I prefer the congas, as for me it's about the best it's ever been. Big leftovers, to top it off. Prices were $30.00 for starters - once you're laid back in the bar you can eat a bunch of them without the hassle, being adventurous and sharing the hot chocolate's.
MY LATEST DELTA! Both the former in their own ways. Service is excellent, customer service is good, and coffee is not even heavy or expensive. The acchiette tastes fresher.
Having kept this in mind, here are three more Great English to Eat places for my Sunday brunch group dinner on 10/25/2017: You'll love the north wing and the scramble which was also very good, but turned out to be atrocious.  And now
restaurant/food/where to find it [for a city burger, french fries or onion rings (or coleslaw)...they usually don't have specials...if they did they would probably be outside at 4pm on their own - you know, an hour early!) In fact, if I was living here for lunch, I would have to wait until about 5 PM for my date to bring me the Burritos with the steak.  It's pretty ridiculous.A Little bit of what I have over the years means enough to me to still see it on restaurants.
Hmmm...what a bizarre place to take a family vacation...as long as you do it well! Very creative drinks and unique local cheeses are perfect for a weekend night out, this place is a must for anyone!
Have got to try the tacos! And the chicken side! Those tacos are nothing short of amazing! The service was outstanding and they have really priced the drinks for the drinks and place
restaurant in the city, to save them time. I would say not bad food, decent service, and good home decor. However, I would feel cheated if you ordered a martini, a salad with shrimp, and pickled lettuce.
Had this horrible experience at Dragon's Restaurant.   We only ordered one special and it was SO good.   We went with two of our guests who requested breakfast for dinner.   I wasn't disappointed because they were staying there all night (or worse).  The server was extremely rude as he constantly complains about us working longer hours and even taking our order (we did eat the counter portion for a refund).   Although we were seated quickly I could only handle my dinner.   I went with my two closest friends.  I love the atmosphere, the food, and the people who make this restaurant famous.  Service is always good and ready to go, and I can't say enough about this place.
I
restaurant. My biggest complaint about Michelin was the massive portion and the quality of everything. The truffle soup was hard to come by in this area. The pastas were bad, the bacon crepes tasted horrible and of course we could hardly afford anything else. Also I LOVE eating to-go vegetarian. Sushi and sandwiches are excellent. Let's all enjoy the new Cheez Mill for just a few hours before we go back to try the Baku and Jucan Cuisine Chicken Wings that are packed with delicious Italian ingredients, flavors and vegetables. The chicken wings were far from the best, and they were not only unappetizing but bad. They also were definitely slightly thin. I would probably go back just for the healthy options and we would be very satisfied.
I really love their pizza.   And the steak/fries...the milk stout is outstanding.  Also, they have all sorts of cheesy sauces on the menu.  You could even include
restaurant was...... it was pretty ridiculous and an out of place place place, considering it was called st. But it is pretty good.The buffet was VERY reasonable.
I love one of the best Lanchos in Chicago. It is like second hand molei and they are not overly processed.  If you go to a location they bring a pair of Lou's pie tins for $30 or you can get them in a deli or 2 at the restaurant. It's a little pricey but my entrees are mostly crab, fish, guacamole and quail.
yummy cheese rolls!!
If you're a nudist with great taste and good customer service, this is the place to go! The food was very good, but it's still a shame when I have to cut back to eat here.  Every time we have had a steak, we just spend money. The place itself does turn into a great environment to have conversations with people and
restaurant de la Marne, and toasted in a wig and sangria. We were the first and only pig from their lunch menu, which was diverse from pig sandwiches to duck rolls.  We paid about $7 at the time of the service, which was about $2 after dinner.  We were great at waiting. I went in on my birthday, and I have never been back. I would not recommend it, because the party it the most highly encouraged, particularly kids. If you are into fancy dessert, go to La Del Mar, or Burghain.  Try the bohemian alphazetas, the ramen soup, the shelled egg crinkle egg roll, etc.  Great wines are for those young, too.
We were very impressed with the restaurants. The service and food exceeded expectations. I have been to Lincoln Park, but always had an appreciation for the best food and amazing service.  The service itself is exceptional,
restaurant and mealstryer.
Lamborghini Coupe is a couple pounds more than I normally get, and that is basically it. My wife and I just got our daughter (she, also came in Monday) and it is easy. We can order the restaurant food and everything else, but can't decide which food comes closest to our place. I came here because the food was ok, but this place seemed like it might not meet their billing. However, we waited for the restaurant to open before we ordered the "eggnog sauce" as the waiter's wife said they were going to try. After they finished their salad they told us the other side was with grease and I said I would call the police. But when they didn't immediately call me they said they would come and take our daughter out to get the first bite and a piece of steak and then we would have to wait a little over an hour and a half if we wanted to go to the
restaurant says the chef picked the whole thing off the table, brought it with them from Mexico, and put it to the duck that had been stewed in it.
First, it was just another horrible cheese; combined with the melted cheese, our hands were worse. Second, the other guests were hungry.  My husband told me that we asked for a reservation at 7pm when we moved there, but was told we needed a seat.  He was rude, tauntingly obnoxious and possibly incompetent.  He was so bland and questionable about his description of everything.I waited a couple of hours at the restaurant for several more hours before getting home.  I'm not sure that every other restaurant here really does that.
My husband and I went with the recommendation of his wife to go there for dinner on April 17th. It was amazing to discover that here you can always have a big plate of seafood and you can always have dessert as well. The server was great but
restaurant, cheese sauce and beer bar. It was great the chicken wings were great but the service was slow and was noisy. The menu and wine list were just over the top. I tried a little more wines but never got a bill of my own. Also, I wouldn't hesitate to return again and again. Service is great, our last visit was after dinner (9-11), but because we went up to the bar a little later, we were still being taken off course. Overall I'd say 4 stars.
Went to Cheers for the first time, absolutely loved it. The service was exceptional and the chef was friendly and attentive.
Most pizza joints you're likely to see here for good or even recommended, have their ketchup, salami and alpine wine list here (which is to say, a great deal) -- this is amazing!I have a really big heart about the closed restaurant -- which, considering its incredible size, is definitely worth the
restaurant, etc, etc. (that is $80 and under) and so on. They're conveniently located right away at the edge of the city. I must add that in comparison to Ibrick's, with their crab cakes, mac & cheese sandwiches, etc. because it was a wall of land where all of them were within walking distance and nothing personal.  But because of the size of their staff, many of whom were escorted by four of my friends from a party, my one disappointment was that the steak wasn't my last meal. The cakes, sandwiches, etc are baked, but at $150, you get 15 dinnertime to wait.
Sometimes, a while back I was in town. Since the food was good, I decided to go back to the Indian restaurant.  It was about 1 mile off Agincourt, near Cesar Chavez.  And it was pretty easy.  Food was excellent.  Warm beer, nice service. 
restaurant is always AMAZING - whenever I go to Chicago or another lunch spot, i'd go there!! The great selection of  desserts and meatballs is second to none and the veggies are a rock solid combo!  I hope my favorite restaurant in town wins! :)
Simply delicious Food + Atmosphere.  Over $50 worth of craft beer (except Quesadilla) worth of cuisine + food + wine/drinks!  All in all, a gem.  (Yuck)
Just wow enough for me to let go of the sandwich bar and settle down to relax at Fox Park.  Everything was awesome. I think it's the best pizza I've had in Chicago!  Everything was served in stunning style and everything tasted so good!  I highly recommend you go!
Forgot to add $6 more to any meal, huh? Maybe they will keep it up.
A solid pick-me-up restaurant and great food.  Service
restaurant "direly disappointed" but the pork baklava sandwiches were mediocre.  Wrong!  And that's the funny thing here.  This is a town where if you want to eat one of those unbelievably absurd hamburgers, you have to try 2 things - an onion roll and an avocado.  You can't find these two, but that's fine, and you can't really use a taco as the dish without substituting whatever you eat in it, and probably you'll end up just eating some food and then go back and eat more and eat less. So yes - I can only hope.  Don't eat this when you eat sandwiches.  If you want to eat their spaghetti noodles, I'll share that with you.  When I read that they will stop me from writing my food reviews on the Yelp, I was perfectly impressed.I'm not saying that it is terrible, I'm just stating that people have better reviews if they read my
restaurant for it's own sake.
Went to the party last week and had to get out of there for dessert. We will keep it up because it has the best section. The service is excellent. I felt like we were always getting delivered on time. For me the place is a no-brainer.For a place to go on Friday night where you will get limited edition posters and be able to do a restaurant/social event all around then a drinks bar! WOW!
GOING BACK for my 10th anniversary I stumbled upon this place in Tamburah yesterday night.  I wasn't a fan of the Mexican food at first but what I loved about it was that it served as a family meal and dinner table.  The wonderful ambience made it so unique to me.  Very favorite place in its class!!!
1!  Look at what went down inside.  GREAT food & service...and very pricey!  I didn't like what I
restaurant may be tolled up, that seems to be an obvious preference. The counter is really good, especially when you can get it on the night before you eat. And if you don't have the appetite and will likely want to pay more, go home instead, as most restaurant places have a non-menu.
We were there for a Saturday night and it was already busy.  We had complimentary pizza and margaritas, but unfortunately the waiter failed to give us the proper pizzas.  We actually ordered the "wallpaper" pizza but it was bland and fell apart.  I guess I was a first year student there that forgot their birthday so we went to Lincoln Park so we could try it out.  We got there about 2:30 p.m. and I came out very late, because there was probably no one around, but by the time the waitress and I arrived we were missing at least 7 items, so we got even after being jammed into
restaurant.  And yummy.  Their service is excellent, however, it was unprofessional and rude in that they charged the server to deliver drinks when the food is not actually delivered.  I called several times to get a refund and the "deliver-able" drink didn't come.  They have good customer service but not knowledgeable enough to have informed me about their policy for alcohol and delivery.
Went here on Saturday for a bottle of wine. For what it's worth, the selection is impeccable. The owner is really knowledgeable about the wine that's being served (a French Pale Ale). Just as I would for a "forgettable" menu with unlimited selections of wine, he is knowledgeable about the sauce and the sauce and the alcohol content which must be received for such a unique dish. The food here is excellent, tender, juicy and well-balanced.There was a lovely Italian waitress and owner who talked me out of the wait with a well reasoned approach
restaurant.They also have the best food the Latham and Wrobleshire folks have to offer. I mean, can we just point it out? It's what it is and why it's here. I've been here twice and again, and still not give enough thought to it, except to say that this place knows how to win over a crowd.If you haven't tried their Delight, it's easy to forget. Get there early!
I went for a meal here last month and had a great time. We ate both sandwiches and sandwiches for $6 each. The bread was fantastic. I ate chicken with my boyfriend and my friend had the coconut sauce, calamari and diced tomatoes on the side. Both of these were my favorites. We have to give this place a 4.3/5. Very service friendly.
GOofy. I can't remember why I finally was here. I don't know what kind of place I want to go back
restaurant and place here? I'm standing at the bar all day every day and would say the coffee was excellent.  I think of it as at least having one bar at one of our events (anytime they open, almost always with over 30 table area) and the kids are left hanging in the seat.  Not good for anything, but really for fun (I've had dessert).
If there's one place a top half of Chicago for BBQ restaurants that misses the tourist calendar every two years it is Saba Ranch....good food, a full service team to cater the single dishes etc. The small pizza pizza I get is usually the best I've had. Oh, my goodness! is there not an Italian section in Saba Ranch...more like, someone with a wife. Food served just OK...clear.
These days, I tell the waitresses to not bring anybody over when I arrive at 10pm, and they don't know what to say. If you
restaurant is reasonable, but less than they are here.  The red velvet I used to come with everything that I ordered was out of this world.  Not even close.   I will go back!  A few other spots that are very nice in their own right but very small.  Oh and a few other people on the street are nice.  Definitely worth the wait.
I've been here a few times, in the past four years. At first, it was crowded. But after a couple of doors our server and I would start planning out our plans. It was our little weekend, and our waitress would be there waiting for our table. We just got a message that we will be seated shortly after 11 pm, and the first time we would have a chance to eat we found an entree at the bar in our list. We called the server and said if we are going to try it again then we would need to wait and wait it out. He
restaurant to $19 and recommended the fluke rice and the gin with what you wanted.  That said, I wanted to be very vague about my recommendation.  The 10 person burrito I will not be sharing with you in this review is sooooooooo awful.  My dog swooned when we met him at the bar.  When he told me he was going to drop us off, I was just blowing it.  He was so upset I stopped eating after he talked about it.  When I was done, I was very, very disgusted.   Most ganja bowls are truly horrible.  Never let your dog into an owner's paradise, but only request that you bring it.  It must make you feel bad to bring it in from the outside.  And I can only imagine what you would want to eat if you were to walk down to the diner and eat it there. 
Good thing Chicago is actually a city that likes its beer at
restaurant."But how can you even get around a giant tooth that is larger than you need to? I think I asked just one waitress about the nose. The cook talked to the server and she took me over to a larger one, made me eat and groom myself in the hours it takes to finish a plate of cheese.I felt like I had to duck in to figure out what was going on. Also, the employees were mad about being rude and it irritated me the more I walked into the food store. So maybe just sitting in line outside of the register with some friends would help to smooth things out for me.Maybe I'm just an internet dork. Maybe this lady will make me suffer and eat for her sake if she doesn't make me sit back and enjoy my food. Maybe she doesn't care about me at all. My question is: what's a pizza place to do?I can't imagine this place being run by restaurant owners. Maybe it's because they
restaurant left over from the dinner. She was really prompt to check on me for any information she could get.  I had never tried her before, however, and she commented that she wouldn't let me order anywhere else in our city or that this might not be for all the world.  And just after the star of the dining table told us not to order this was on the way.  I would not be very pleased if they would leave without the fireable tent.
This place is so good you will not be hungry for lunch or dinner but still a tasty  spot. The service is attentive.  Sometimes it's a little difficult to spot until you are in the area. This place always needs to be picked up on the spot. If you are looking for something big or tall it could be a very good place.
This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Manhattan, and I think it's one of the best. The food is delicious and you will feel
restaurant to celebrate the winner of our contest. On the second night, each of us is standing in line in the desert to share a drink or two, when one of us says it best - "what a night out!!". My order was to be prepared to spend the next two hours sitting in this restaurant without feeling rushed. Our server, Omar D'Entungere, takes us through the kitchen while he blinks at every single plate we order, and we'll not be forgotten. I wanted to cry. My name is Ozzie, and I wanted to be thanked for my experience, because I was ready to love Ozzie.
I was so impressed with every detail we used. There is no doubt I'll be visiting Chicago for the rest of my life (guess it depends on where you live). While my review didn't have a lot of attention-the food was great. I found them perfect for my needs at home and I will always go
restaurant on Oct. 15, the food came out hot and fresh. Shrimp, ham, salad and oysters were drenched in savory juices and others were soaked in whatever greens and sauces they could find. Everything I've ever eaten in Milwaukee has been loved by my family.The fresh, unrefined ingredients aside, here are the food groups I actually enjoy when I'm in the mood for a good combination of tart, hearty, spicy and funky dishes.Arrive early and get some real variety!
I loved Cazzaretto and the portions were huge. The three courses were good, they arrived at around the 45-minute mark. The braised lamb meat was delish and refreshing, and the deep fried eggs were light, satisfying and just right. The fish oil was wonderful and it seemed to be prepared exactly as it was cooked. All in all, the food was a great value for this kind of style of pizza. It's hard to describe the taste
restaurant in the heart of Chicago," he says. "We love this place. One of the owners of this restaurant is Doug Efrat himself. The food is perfect. Not one ingredient is overly overpowering, and none are nearly as bad as actual meat products. You have amazing textures and flavors. The only problem is that every time I go I have to wait a little while before getting ready to bring my favorite meal over."
This review is based on the individual reviews. In addition I wanted to say thank you to uuuuuge customer service, and to fellow burger lovers in the community!
The food was great, and the service was spot on! I must say that we were all very happy. The steak was AMAZING. It was awesome for sure. It's not until you order the main course, that you start looking at each bite and the taste. Then I stopped and we had an excellent time as well. Other than that, it was good
restaurant Friday afternoon.
I will keep taking this tourist away from York while I'm at lunch, because it has lived up to what the brand has gone through.  The salad bar, salads and veggie smoothie dishes always make me happy.  I have always been a fan of my favorite greasy superfood in Chicago, and this would not disappoint.  I was sated, but still wasn't satisfied with the food.  Is it fair to lambinate a regional specialty by giving it to their superior frites and quesadillas?  Maybe, but at least they weren't too aggressive with pretzel dressing.  Maybe the owner messed up something a little.  I'll give the other end of the spectrum a pass, which would be a major plus.
The atmosphere is yummy.  Really wonderful coffee.  I love love love it.
Definitely a must for a vegetarian/vegan crowd to get into, or for that matter d
restaurant's restaurants. Their salt is their only drawback. Food is of course extremely cheap. However, they do add some extra class to their food which makes this restaurant even more special. With such a popular menu it is sometimes hard to believe that they only sell a few short items such as a couple of mushrooms or honey biscuits and sometimes small items like pita bread that are NOT one big basket of chips. To put that into perspective, a normal cookie can be made to 10 PB's worth of sandwiches. Only 2.5 were I hesitant as I normally would not give a drink and order a beer. When I ordered a salad with the greasy bacon and salt after about 2 minutes I was all out of the mood. The chef usually dutifully tasted it and then proceeded to comment on the type of bread we would make. The quality of their food and service is just amazing. I would definitely buy another bite of their porcini at least once.
Great food,
restaurant here. I had the biggest meal of my life (since moving back into our area), breakfast was really good, and the last couple bites were pretty awesome. My least favorite part was the fried chicken dish. I love fried chicken; they have done it really well on food in the past. Besides the killer fried chicken, the pork sandwich was a huge success.  I love it, and they had even gotten the body down with their calamari. I think it's amazing that I can eat these things all day and eat them at lunch and dinner. Needless to say, there were a lot of people there to enjoy this dish. Please note that I am not a vegetarian, but you must be on one of the vegetarian lists on our website. However, I am definitely not a fan of the meat. We had the steak entree that was the best I had, and for a little extra veggie crunch they added a huge tomato sauce and, next to that, which
restaurant at Burrable Pizza Bar and Grill. The service was always excellent. It was a fun experience too. The Italian salad bar was top notch. The patio area was extremely warm with warm empanadas, and of course, the coffee table area was perfect for serving our new customers. We were surprised to discover that they serve everything and everything is made from scratch, so I'm sure they'll do that with every decision we make. It would be hard to return to this area because they're not really that good.
Excellent pizza and service, and amazing atmosphere. I went here on a Sunday night. This place was special. The pizzas came out to me as you ordered. The meat was really delicious. The servers were always there and brought dishes and the food were never our fault. I would definitely return.
It must be terrible to live in the neighborhood, especially when you have kids. Always asked a group and it wasn't answered. Good food, great
restaurant was vegan for the sake of being organic. I had the second of several meals but the third was quite mediocre. My fiance had the best steak I've ever had and it's really a shame he's not a better steak maker. I'm glad he took home what he has taken away from this place.
Had the appetizer for lunch with our friends. The price was reasonable, but my high school girlfriend was impressed. I enjoyed their fantastic wine list and the ice cold, freshly smoked ribs on the side. The service was also good. Had a snack when we got there and we appreciated the group of attentive. Come visit us!
Really authentic. No cheeses. Just perfect aged bakes, decent food, and fresh produce. Wish I was off my own tail, because I'm sure they'd get a cut of my  meat pie. Service was also outstanding. Our waitress offered us a rice pudding that was the best I've ever had. I asked
restaurant. I gave the waiter a Gold star because he had not given me any positive feedback regarding its flavor! I'm a big advocate of organic food, but this one is totally different. I am not sure how much it's good, but a single bite of good food is a good idea. It is not greasy or light enough, so take a leaf out of it and try it yourself!
Best Mexican food.  My husband and I went there last week for dinner. I was told that the menu might have changed based on my culinary background and my desire for service.  I really liked this restaurant and will go back for anything!
This place is exceptional.  The atmosphere is unreal.  You walk in expecting me to be there for hours every night.  I had a great experience here.  And I will come back again.
It's fun to catch up with friends at 8pm and it's always good to have the happy hour when I'm
restaurant is awesome and I recommend it to others. The food is quite good, as is the service.  The portions are tiny.  I asked for a table number that nobody else had filled up and they said, "Well, not even half of our original order, order will be out around 7pm." And, who were you kidding?  Two people crowded into an 8x8 space.  I would recommend that anyone who is stuck eating if they don't want to wait.  When will they finally find another place?  I love this place and want to go again.  Again, don't forget this place!
I loved the twist on a wafers. It was super fresh.  The service was great - always great.  I like to get chicago style steak.  For an appetizer, try this baby duck w/ black bean grits - they are FANTASTIC!<|endoftext|>
restaurant will be given!  Not so much, the staff and knowledgeable black-haired chefs were helpful, great service, nothing to write home about.I found it difficult to deal with the low quality dishes we ordered, but it was a great time to try a steak-wrapped corkage.  Everything is simple to serve, not overly sweet or flavor.  Although we might have ordered a little different a few weeks ago, the smoothies and juices were as fine as the ingredients.   Very good in a great setting!
AMAZING.  I have been coming here for a while.  They serve a range of toppings to try on this burger.  My favorite was a bunch of roast duck, which served like a salad with cherries and cheese and was delicious.  My husband and I also ordered a beef entree, which was great, but also yummy and refreshing.  Also, we ordered our dog's duck stew which came out
restaurant in Brooklyn, Pa., on Thursday. Their menu: salad, salads, appetizers, alphabets (sometimes called compchiques), sandwiches, desserts, etc. And for dessert, they try non-alcoholic apple (every other morning is now a surprise), one or two cakes in both (mashed eggs and dessert), and a cookie cake and plastic duck eggs. Aside from service, the tasting menu is much larger than that of Bell's.
Rick and I wanted to try a few things. For starters, we just wanted to see what our waitress looked like. She was very casual, but there were a few at a great price. We also went to lunch for lunch at the same time. We can't wait to get there!
I'm so happy I stumbled on this website on my birthday and it took less than a second.  I had the wonderful orange latin sushi and fresh squeezed lemon, potato, & crab rolls.  I really
restaurant of convenience,  our authentic little burrito was the highlight. We ordered a shrimp burrito with rice ($4 per 1:1 portion) and I had to give it the boot. Here's a bunch of other great meal choices here too.  Honestly, I am proud of the little tab that you got on the entree.
Beautiful food. This place is perfect for many reasons.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  Most times we are seated at the counter.  The food is great!  Try it if you are in a hurry!
This place is fun, but beware the 'perverse' offer.This is not just a place to eat - this is a place to meet up with friends and make plans. If you can get a reservation from a friend, this is the place to go. I often give strangers tips in advance for the best way to move forward in a new career or industry.  Let's face it, I
restaurant? I know it's got to have a great menu, which is why the place was quiet. And a decent quality of drinks?
Good. Very attentive staff. Our servers were very helpful and friendly. They came out to our table quickly and gave us the excellent service that we needed. We should try his a la carte version.
Food is superb (4 Stars since steak is especially fresh) but quality beef shoulder and burgers are also pretty tasty. The service is fast and attentive. I've had reservations on many occasions, but I have never been disappointed. Love the concept (very simple, warm design).
I stopped in the Woodland Hills last week. I came on my way to dinner and there were some other tables around, but they were crowded. I ordered a beer with a side of scrumptious seafood and was immediately hooked! Now, as a regular outdoor eater, I have no problem with pruning our teeth, but this restaurant is focused
restaurant is provided at VEGAS; JETPA-PERRY and STEAK SLOTHES are available as recommended and don't waste your time on that. Upon receipt of the return receipt, you will pay for your meal and should bring a cash back receipt. Once you arrive, the inside of the restaurant is clean and chock full. The menu includes some major condiments. Sausages, falafel and other kinds of salad include these. The server's owner and a friend have cooked food for us on the night we took home and with that we will serve you great food and service. Make sure you bring with you these wonderful desserts, because you'll give them a chance to shine!Thanks for visiting us again...
Super rad restaurant with delicious food!   We started the night with a salad bar...first of all we were great, it was great,  the salad bar was great and I ordered the 9 slices, which came out were 16 slices
restaurant two pieces of grilled chicken; and to be sure, you will NOT be eating there for lunch. On its own it is enjoyable and fun and has a great location. The chicken with pickled beans is a great appetizer for this and does contain a large number of tomatoes. More of an appetizer. Do yourself a favor and order an appetizer of your choice. You won't regret it.
Great food (great wait) but feel the need to order other things for their special occasion.
Went with my girlfriend and were awesome. Can't even describe the fit of the server but we felt rushed and the wait and ambiance is ridiculous (unless you live in the Chicago area). The service was slow (let me explain here) but they made it really easy to talk to friends. Friendly staff however, were an odd number. So instead of a stop and ask if we want a quick bite of your food, we found a table that only helped us figure
restaurant  is huge.  They have some excellent cheese of any kind and steaks are always fresh and served as well.
After going to the late 90s about 10 years ago, an experience I will never forget. My grandpa (who was such an ass), will never forget how hard it was to beat Barrons Chicken to beat the chicken parmesan. What I will never forget was the service and the food that was average. The falafel was awesome and came with an entree of sesame vinaigrette instead of a plate of marinated bakers rice. Sadly, the decor for the building didn't match the dining room style, which probably gives them the most reason to try their own new art of cooking. However, most of them were delicious (Love).  If I am going to spend $100 per person, I will definitely go back to those places once I go back!
We started with just one thing. We ordered the chicken
restaurant
We have been wanting a really unique restaurant that you can get if you love traditional Italian food! I've been here for almost 3 years and have had great deals. The only thing is that their service is terrible. I've never been in this area but they do try everything but it has been a bit too busy. Another reviewer says it is worth the wait, just think what the shit they have in the menu... *WOW!*This place is awesome!! I've always wanted to go back. Definitely you will enjoy every part of this place.
My boyfriend and I always get there early and return for a date.  We often go here if we need to eat or take a walk or relax.  We really appreciate everything they offer here and I can't wait to try the salsa bar next door and let everyone know what is to come!
If you are looking for a relaxed, personal space, I'd go back.  I don't recommend it
restaurant and an amazing collection of pastries and salads. With enough food to last you a long time, this is a must for any fan of beer in California!
We were feeling a little underwhelmed with our visit to the Adirondacks.  We were immediately stunned by the food and service and I was surprised at how well made the food was.  We had the new Lobster Roasted Chicken and Crock Pot and the Morton Rib soup with mushrooms and had the carrot salad and they also had greek yogurt.  We ordered the steak salad and the lamb chops which were left as I expected, but they seemed to have only slightly watery pokery cuts.  I did not like the lamb chop, which turned out not to be so bad, but it was in a creamy red sauce that was very overcooked.  And finally, when I ordered the chicken for the king, I was only eating one piece of beef.  Our waitress felt more
restaurant that had risen up to the top. Dressed up for such an adventure with this ribeye lamb sandwich was solid quality, food prepared with the best...but would find the experience better overpriced.
The place was totally crowded and loud but the food was great.  The service was great.  Friendly staff and helpful food.
After a terrible winter the Chicano Pizza was a bargain.  Go here if you have a big appetite for some crust, hamburger or great flatbread with some shredded coconut or maki sauce. The crust itself was darn okay.  The rest of it looked ok.
It is a bit hard to tell apart the room where these adventures were made.  That being said, they don't scream before their restaurants are opened.  Let me sum it up, it's a real dining experience!  Some patrons were there at the bar earlier to attend a special-event dinner that took place right after being seated.  This did not
restaurant and I love their grilled chicken noodle dish. They serve a variety of fresh seafood to order, including options like sea bass and shrimp, rabbit eggs, carnitas and green salad.
I had a great time here and am always looking to do something else for my trips so I must say that although a few of the places in the Bay Area in Lisle arent cheap or reasonably priced I have to say that the basic fare is fantastic and worth the drive. At first I only ate most of the food (that pretty much lines up with what I'm about to eat for dinner) but after they raved about the service (especially the soup) i fell in love. They have something for all diners and are small (10-15) and you can eat anything just about anything. From dim sum appetizers to appetizers for dessert, there is nothing about them that is cheap or service friendly (as opposed to the example above) they make every effort to create
restaurant of the year (less than $10), makes our meal a relaxing experience. The food is fresh and chewy, sweet and salty as expected. For lunch, we opted for desserts like strawberry, raspberry, avocados, berries and basil. The server was super nice to us. Make sure to order it for later on!
Great restaurant for working people, craft beer, wine and a good night out. I lived in the neighborhood and had to stop by for a while to talk to somebody who works there and enjoy the atmosphere. You can also ask if there's too much food here, don't be afraid. Don't forget that all the courses are cold right now and toasters can come up even longer. You won't be disappointed.
The actual portion of the food is limited to 25 slices for $12.95 which is too generous.  Their single reason for ordering is because they want to try to be safe in this, very busy neighborhood. 
restaurant was excellent, but the seafood cocktail and tab was strange and bad. I was in the restaurant for my birthday, so I called ahead to pick my table, but the server told me that you cannot choose which fish you order. My friend and I walked up to the booth and found it an empty space so I asked the waiter to bring us our dinner. I thought that if I could, I would go out with my family, but that the service was amazing and polite. He told me I was able to get into the tasting room just fine, but I have no doubt that if you want a sushi roll at a reasonable price you will be treated differently. I hope to go back in the future and serve as many Asahi sushi rolls as possible, and will try to try more.
Best place in the city to visit in the summer when you are willing to take out a birthday or anniversary party for the rest of the week.  The sushi is better than other places
restaurant at 3PM will be bringing in the extended menu of flavored and flavorful food. Then, we'll begin to wait in line until we can enjoy them all.
I went to the Shawarma restaurant on Valentine's Day and was not disappointed, the quality was perfect, the service was always top notch, and the food was very affordable. We were giving away old Gold Tippet meal tickets because we felt like we had to, since only $2 for a bowl of good eating was enough to pay for the rest. I took advantage of the age-old Gold Tippet system that encouraged seating at children's tables at the library, where the place is open with parent and their children. The patrons are always excellent, and these tables were not occupied by their peers at that point. I would not recommend Shawarma over the next 4+ years, unless they are trying to make a profit from their skills.
I think it is very unlikely there is a Chinese restaurant where
restaurant prices, the service, and the space is great! And it's romantic!
Been here twice and again and it's always busy. The wine list is ridiculously limited. I know, it's fairly standard for good wine in the South Bay, but in Chicago and Texas for instance, an assortment of special wines have been used in some of the most exquisite, classic cocktails in the world. The Brûlée system, the mezzanine and the Arro Bonita are perfect examples of the old thinking about beignets and chevaliers - a system that is sooooooo cool! You have a good pitcher room for a lot of the brews you're about to enjoy, especially on the rainy and cold winter nights. It's so scrumptious and wonderfully subtle you'd almost believe. Just a word. If you're a little over the top, you can't go wrong with this bar.
Always great place to enjoy breakfast, lunch
restaurant." The manager said she thinks the hostess was the only person in her neighborhood.
Since she lost her job as a waitress, she's offered to pay her fee and you can only get a reservation at the establishment with an advance notice. When did she decide to make reservations? I've heard great things about others and it really resonated with me that she would rather have dinner with those who loved her and the atmosphere was great. She was always the type of waitress I recommend.
Kissed me once.Went to Puyallup. It was great, great food, but nothing that I would have put at the place. Too many choices in  the food, the place was pretty filthy, and the salad bar wasn't full of anything other than what they had at their restaurants. I will never go back to any other Chicago pizzeria.
China's has been a regular favorite for a couple years now (I'm 20-something and still
restaurant was great. I can't say enough about the wait.
I am from South Bend/Briarcliff County and was recently on a date with family.  I went to Chicken.  The restaurant was almost devoid of any breadcrumbs, although, well..the sizzling quality came in quickly (after 5 minutes or so).  The atmosphere is nice and it's fun to sit across the table from the line for hours.  But the menu was relatively limited at the beginning of the meal.  After  waiting three or four hours, everyone would have already eaten.
So having the concept up and running, I've been hungry ever since.  I don't expect to be disappointed with anything, but we managed to take a bus to Miami this past weekend for a couple days.  The venue was small, so we got a little over $50 a seat, which will be fixed very soon.
I'm extremely happy with the restaurant.
restaurant, plus the glass you can buy at the bar, music and theater, which is like a wedding. Well worth the price. All of the options are superb. The boy, a 17-year-old rising up through the ranks, seems to have a mixed-up, southern charm and humor. We have tried the place all over the world and it seems to be living up to its name. Food is hearty and tasty, the regulars eat everything and especially the dessert menu. The fried eggs of life is my favorite dish of the day. Specialty fruit dishes are exceptional and all be from the bright bright blue waters! Thank you GoDork.
My favorite European diner! If you are looking for good Italian food, feel free to come to the Crab Day that is.  I've made a variety of steaks, burritos, beef, eggs & sourdough bread to go along with the specials.  The salmon sandwich is also my favorite! 
restaurant: Husband asked him if there was anything else he could recommend. Basically if you need a 5 star meal get a 6 star meal!  Check out my meal from 20 mins ago and what a wonderful experience it was to visit where most of the staff, including my husband, and I were seated... The only downside was the Italian food.. to explain to you what Greek sushi is. The risotto I was going to tell you about was overpriced and looked just ok... I've had many of the Greek but it was something I've only been to once. You can have delicious Greek beef by non-Greek fare but I think it's overpriced.  Or, if you have Turkish or Asian beef, you'll find much better quality and much better cheddar cheese.For example, try the lamb lamb dish here, black and white lamb breast to order on the spot. The big difference between black and white is that they're all kept in the fridge for the last
restaurant when you go. We had the Foxy Pizza and the Dominos and had excellent service.Their service was great and the price you pay was right for quality pizza.
I am going to go back for dinner sometime this coming weekend.  The food is good and it's not hot so you can eat your pasta with some sauce before you eat.  I love all the great things they offer.
Great food with an addictive flavor and very good service.
Great party place, one of my favorite places in the city. Best authentic Mexican restaurant in the city!
Went to Brazil and love everything. Ever wanted to get deep into the Brazilian cuisine and from the first sip to the last bite it was my absolute favorite dish.  I will definitely go back.  The food is outstanding.  I have never had a dish that tasted like cheese...Reece con noire, plus its thin and juicy!!! The service at Mexy are awesome and in my
restaurant. It also is simply worth the time and the money.One other plus: the staff is friendly. Everything about this place is authentic, without a doubt. As one of my favorite restaurants in the world, I feel privileged to have worked here.
Today I went to LODMASTIC on purpose and had a great time. It was the perfect date and brunch spot. The staff is all well-researched, the food is amazing, the server is pleasant.   The atmosphere was not bad but the restaurant is under pressure.  Would not recommend to anyone.
I live in Chicago, so I'm going to go here for brunch at 7 pm today. It's good, but not enough to compare it to Good Nite or Simply Awesome. Still Great for a small or date party, which might give some reservations if they want their wine list. Get the Brunch here right away and only wait. -Thumbs Up
My thoughts?
restaurant.
Tastes like they are brewed in New York. I think there is a difference in our food, but can't compare that.Our waitress was very friendly and took our questions and suggested most of the items was fresh but we found that only a certain portion was of our order. Overall i felt like we were getting a good meal for the price.<|endoftext|>
restaurant of choice for those who love their meal, this place takes your meal to the next level by offering attentive service to every minute of every service. As anyone who lives nearby, I definitely recommend going here and taking a few bite to savor, as this place is fantastic and not only good, but really informative.
The food was very good and service was friendly - almost so and I wanted to say a million dollars a head with the chip and chocolate amoebas...love the damn place.
I have gone to Chipotle numerous times and so many times that I feel the need to describe everything. However, this is the one time they made me feel lucky to get my entree.  The portions were generous, the cocktails excellent, and the most innovative dishes of the evening.  By contrast, the service was phenomenal, this place is rather loud, and the regular clients were on skype that reminded me of a fantasy-like music duo.  It was
restaurant. It's so wonderful! - James Wijster (join our friends @ jakersanduel and hangover hours) - Yields a rich & nuanced menu of appetizers, seafood & desserts. Sweet mussels, donuts & swiss cheese pasta dishes. All the while the staff is attentive.What else can be said? Everyone has come here to enjoy unique and unique dinners. We have yet to have the most forgotten in our family history! - TonyTrey (live crew and special day) - Flight! - Francesca by Joel (new brunch)we would highly suggest going there for this meal!
I love this place.  What they have for dessert is outstanding.  Also the service is outstanding (thank you bookkeeper Eliza Fish!)  My girlfriend and I love this place.  We went with a group of friends (most of them if they live in the neighborhood) and we had very good service, but the restaurant itself was
restaurant, that is our reservation from our kitchen the others! And the art is actually the best! I'm sure there are plenty of other places to find art and food, but this place seems really cozy for a restaurant that just won't do anything that demands attention.
So, today I was thrilled to experience a special meal at Bui Cui at their busy Pier 36 (which overlooks Pier 5).My wife ordered the kfchicken/dunwhel po and she liked the chicken which wasn't so bad. The recipe was ahead of schedule and with this combination of ingredients they made for the appetizer. Then I didn't eat but it was so awesome for me! My old friend recommended that he order the chicken and he was really satisfied with the taste of the pad thai salad on it! Another Great portion was the hollandaise which I actually loved!  Overall it was a great and refreshing meal with good ingredients and great service.
Just
restaurant level is there. The bar has a different vibe than anything else that I've tried.
4 stars!  The tortilla torti is good too. It is crisp.  Amazingly, quality french fries.  The serving is unlike anything I have ever had.  The Vietnamese Gorgonzola Noodles are ok, but not spicy. I was there for several days and will be back for more
First of all, and least 2 stars for dining there at Lincoln.  They are generally best known for their affordable prices and excellent service!  I love the atmosphere and they treat you nice.  They have no limit to what you can eat, make and receive in there (in return, drink plenty of their desserts).  The place is not crowded and you can relax on the sidewalk, and take advantage of the bakery's fast service and homemade fresh products.  YUM!  Worth the trip!  I will definitely be back if I go with
restaurant and salad bar. They never disappoint.  The menu is big enough for people to find something to eat at once, but so far I have yet to do anything, so ask for the menu change before you eat!
Nice lounge atmosphere and a good quality of food. There is also a tapas bar for serving, so you can always go back and try it. The beef at the entrance has some of the best beef I have ever had...Bones has great prices, but I found there really wasn't that great for their own products, although they offer a small selection which seems like it will last for much longer. Try the pork belly to see how much you pay. Everyone should try their steakhouse and they have plenty to choose from.
Have been going to CuiDou to take advantage of Saturday's weather.    Unfortunately, this is not a regular deal with The BBQ Sandwich Shop - if you want you can pay it at the first table.
restaurant staff was up-to-date about what would happen.  He even asked if I was a wine-crazed joe guy.
A great lunch experience.  We went with two brothers and had a fantastic tasting menu.  The menu had some great American steaks and black beans - they are delish.  Some of the dishes were pricey.  Lots of salads, rolls, even salad greens.  Love the Fried Duck.  It's incredible.  We had oysters too.  The dogs were pretty nasty and "dirty" but luckily the dogs are well-fed.We returned and have to say we were lucky enough to order some of the foods we ordered - the duck itself was the best i've had the pleasure of eating and it really did taste fresh.  The soup was good.  I had the duck breast in a fried egg pan and the butter piece of my house finger-tapped the coconut flakes in a plate of melted
restaurant portions and cozy patio seating. The brussels sprout and macaroon stew are definitely not for the casual chic.
Great food, reasonable prices, and great vibe. No, not some glitzy, and sweet, hip brussel sprouts (a quesadilla looks like it came out of a burger but it was truly so good) and enough fish to keep any rainy nights in mind. An inexpensive lunch restaurant that serves pizzas for dinner for $10 with 30 items to choose from.
We just love coming here in summer and have already left. Amazing authentic Italian with delicious and affordable food. Thank you so much Carol. We really wouldnt go back to this place, but I would leave Yelp and GO ON HISTORY.  As far as the 4 star review goes, it's cool that they write it, but the travel aspect of this place has been ruined.  Last night, it was chilly outside. Which was fine. But
restaurant(who is not the owner), Bar Sues! Stop by again and again in the evening and you will discover nothing is ever "cheap" and carry around much-needed items for yourself.  Recommend coffee. Come find out where we live in the area for a great experience.
What an experience, u can't wait to get back to Evanston!!
It took us about an hour for our table to open, so we were very busy, but of course, we did get a awesome drink (absolutely delicious) at the bar. Overall, it was all worth it...it was definitely worth the wait.  It was great if you have no friends to keep you busy, however we can't wait to see how many people have come over for a full evening of laughter!   Although we may be staying on the street for a while, it's probably still a bit too soon to check on Chicago's culinary scene, which is clearly a novelty.

restaurant, service, and community. First, we decided to have a fair little dinner at Regent's since the pace wasn't particularly fast. Second, we decided to have a friendly sit down conversation with Gail. Overall, it was a fabulous brunch. Food and service were fine.  Service was great, and everything came with a smile, although the service for us was small. In a word: cleanliness. Everything was good, even the server was very nice. Overall I would definitely rate this a 5.5/5.
I've been to Mookie's for over a year now.  So.   I can't recommend the food enough.  They have not only amazing dishes, but incredible food.  The food is always delicious, but honestly, it's worth the journey they are taking to get there.  That being said, if you've been to anywhere else, I'd give the Mookie's this 2 stars because of the food.
restaurant's from Michigan and I think he probably won't be returning anytime soon. We ended up going with a couple of fish tacos here and the rest were delicious.
Nice neighborhood eateries! I would definetely visit them again! After reading the review on Yelp, i decided to try this place. Here it is....the very best sushi place I've ever had.  Its crispy and seasoned for authentic sushi.  The service at many places is smooth and friendly.  The sushi is a must try.  The air is fresh and warm.  The atmosphere is very nice.  The food is a must try.  You can order anything as good as the sushi, but make sure it doesn't come on a BOTH items.
I always ordered an autographed written letter from my friend to say I would be coming back...Even though we probably shouldn't, our chicken curry was awesome and both were not lost for good reason. But I think the service was
restaurant service in the park!
Fiesta de Barcelona.  A little crowded (over the years), but I just loved it.  I know it is right in downtown...but everything is from the vita area.  Even the decor looks really nice!
Perhaps I may have missed the music!  From early on my dog was enraptured by this breakfast place.  My wife ordered a small and tender sausage with pork, sausage and seafood from the bar, after which she poured the sausage and grilled shrimp over the seaweed for a dab.  It was very nice to know that, upon passing the dishes were all beautifully crafted.  Now with all of that, as a friend went there, she still had no clue what the fuss was about.  With one of the girls looking at us, she immediately noticed the matter and then commented on it.  After the girl had finished talking to the attendant, we started by placing our dishes on the table and
restaurant menu is fantastic, and I have had the Seafood Especial and are glad to have it. It is served almost like a salad bar with what you get every time you go and how you come out is always great, and the food is incredibly fresh and different. Parking is pretty scarce and you can only find around 50 vehicles at this point, so be prepared to pay extra to park for less than 90 minutes. Service for the waiters for lunch & dinner (it is only about 20-30 minutes) is also ok, they treat you with respect and respect. They are friendly and attentive, and they also follow a very solid list of what to order.
I was visiting Northwestern to go back to my mother's wedding and the decor was an eclectic mix of 18's, 80's, as well as the making of some of my favorite Duesignes.I'm usually into black dressy dining but I thought we were spending a lot of time at the
restaurant :) but there were other amazing cheeses....kinda weird u would guess.... :(
I'm a fan of the Honey Day...i love your wings which are VERY tasty
very good breakfast buffet with some of the best meat around, with a splash of salt and a huge bite to taste.  The soup is fantastic, they charge multiple bucks for their pre-made noodles (which are fantastic) while it is good to try the bacon padaka in the bar because the bacon is yummy. The portions are small (2-3 and the menu does not open until 5), and they charge you for the extra veggies to try, something we ate about 2 of us at table.  Don't get the 4 of us on a date, but to talk people out of expecting too much for 5 bucks you better be prepared.
THE PLACE IS DONE!  The staff was super friendly and took their money.  You'll definitely be back
I want
restaurant on a Wednesday night (per the complaints it was written) so I couldn't keep up with it.  Then when I finally got there, my stomach took a long time to get used to the menu.  We all got a couple hours for one meal but my server & co decided not to make any changes.  Our waitress just added some texture in the dishes with the added spicy, salty, white & butter.  If there is anything she adds to the menu, it would be basil, and the food is.  I don't know the food in the room (not even close to being half cooked) but I am glad we found our food to be one of our favorites in the area.  It was well worth it!
After being impressed and disappointed with the Ethiopian food, this is the place to go to for brunch.  Save up some money for this entree, a great value for the price.  The food is fresh, flavorful, the
restaurant costs. After filling it, our waitress asked if we wanted it to be topped off with cheesy chorizo. All our money went to the goxican restaurant.  Our waiter asked us what we wanted, and we told him we were going to have the serving portion of cheese and basil filled with sauces.  He said: "You're kidding."  Our waiter was loud, strong-arming us.We were surprised to see the response of the wait staff and so were the waitresses and waitresses at the bar on the side of the restaurant.We had no idea what was going on and ended up getting just a tad frustrated.The reason I went with this restaurant was that it was difficult to find a restaurant like this in the city, despite having a stellar reputation.The blue milkshake is great, but the whole thing tastes a little overpriced (about $10 a piece at the liquor store). I prefer the drink, it's really well-
restaurant. Too young to make a healthy food order, I must have rushed over to try it. And the sugar fries were not great - though I would suggest trying them since they were too yummy. Also, the coke was not very good. Considering this was my birthday gift from my first boyfriend (she said she ordered from her husband and then changed the date a few days later), I cannot recall what she was saying before she paid me for my birthday gift. No need to go all the way back to town!
You should have tried a sausage--the sausage itself made me sick. They have huge varieties of cheese and they just didn't look like they had the flavors to match. Let me tell you, this place IS chunky and yes, they run down the right side of the restaurant. So, don't go here--they can get pretty pricey here.
Beer is good too! I couldn't be happier with the food, service, and atmosphere.
restaurant and otherwise great food.  And everything was perfect...out of this world!
Safari is REALLY good. Great tamarind chicken, fresh mojitos, fresh fresh vegetables.  The burgers are always kind of much better than the ones we had earlier in the evening (it was cold so I couldn't possibly warm them up) and the BEWARE IS that there is so much fat in them.   You are going to have to place a 30 dollar order to eat those burgers at this point and get sat in with your food.  The best part about Safari is that they offer a good one.
In the course of what was my three nights eating there, I did order my favorite cheese pizza, Big E, and opted to try the pumpkin pie recipe.  To say I was happy with my original experience would be an understatement.  I went home drunk and I'm not saying the pizza was nice or the pie was bland, but
restaurant" instead. When I finished the tab at the Endo TGI Friday my fiance had been sitting next to us at the table. I think my fiance thought it was "heaven forbid". He tried to explain that at his restaurant he is operating under the amony potty rating. When I asked what the amony potty rating is he answered in a really friendly manner. Now after having seen the grilled cheese this on the menu and how cool it is it might even be better! I was told that the dining room does not have that which was considered my favorite item at an end of the night dinner table. You can order them in any given date from the server so we can decide on a night to go to a restaurant where the wait can be up to 10 minutes.I don't really give this place 5 stars for its outstanding service but it probably needs a few more stars on the menu.
This place is great!  I have been there 5 times.
restaurant -- premium wines and dishes -- are a must.
Gone am I had forgotten...now. I really enjoyed the wait time and I am certain this is NOT a one size fits all bill.
Honeybee is one of the best and the staff and food were always top notch.  I was often going with friends over lunch at a recent bbq run.  The bbq food, on the other hand, is limited.  I may make my own special treat that my little brother wont be able to find.  The weather was much better last week, but for some reason the Texas Cafe may just blow us away and move away.   The doors on the first floor are to be hung from the ceiling by wall and foot--these bars need to be finally opened.  For my needs here at idbls, I ordered the Crab Ravioli sandwich and their whole breakfast special.  They had an ok draft of tuna on top of
restaurant, cuz this place has a lot to say about.
The fast food was really good.  It was big and juicy, and it was a great place to watch A&M and see all your friends catch up in their sophomore year at La Trobe for a chance to go back.  These two things were things that literally reminded me of THE SINGLE ONE!  The waiter gave me an enjoyable, great recommendation, followed by his sweet-shaky recommendation, which has since been so insistent on me recommending him up the chain.  The waitstaff was often friendly and knowledgeable.  The food was amazing and priced well, and the service was outstanding.  We are a real family-as-family, just couple people working a small job and making ends meet in our small town.  The seafood was cheap, cooked to perfection, and so I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a fancy fried seafood appetizer.
I was so happy to
restaurant! I think they added another flavor and didn't have too much meat on their food and veggies. Also there is a fried sausage here too. It is a bit sour, but will fit me right in.We got a mushroom dish and can't wait to try it!
This place really gets the skin on this place.I've been a patron of these restaurants for over 10 years now and if it doesn't carry on, I am probably never going to go back.
I used to frequent this place and loved it immensely, even though it was quickly going downhill. But it has been as bad as the industry tries to blame it. Despite having three pizza establishments in the last year and counting. I went to these pizzas (Italian/Red) for 3 reviews. The first was out of town while I had a reservation and was expecting a beer and I delivered. Not a bad meal. This place is not for everyone however, but they cater for a certain '
restaurant group with good portions and decent wine pairing. I believe the outdoor outdoor beer place was introduced in my favorite restaurant to the summer. As is, our waiter came by and not just grabbed our table- in order to introduce himself, but laid a great hand on us, so that we couldn't speak to him. Being from a family oriented environment in which dessert is always great in-between dates, the intermission got too loud to hear our guests' favorite moments, so our waiter settled in and brought our waiter along, and the good waiter stood there proudly and took his seat.  He went over the different menus, made adjustments, left and went back.  He asked how the food was, and how we could taste each dish, and indicated that one dish would be enough to fill one person's stomach and the other would just be inferior.  When our waiter looked over the dishes, he brought up another special dish, served again, and seemed overwhelmed.  That time
restaurant is located at Broadway and Deepwater Gulch, and this restaurant served a busy menu of popular dishes. All the people dining there were enthusiastic about serving the food! I am definitely a huge fan of each of their dishes and could easily reorder the entire menu of appetizers and different meats, so everytime I eat here I will check it out. I also highly recommend choosing an appetizer that has a spicy theme such as onion salad (or Greek salad) or a white or mild (or spicy) chili seasoning on the side.
Oh my god, its like a dirty store, oh my god. I mean, come on that guy. Stop nah, buy yourself a lemonade and half a slice of pizza - enjoy.
Vapiden is what my girlfriend and I call our own: awesome community and amazing staff.  We go to the catacombs so many times over the years, and we go to this one every time.  It is a
restaurant - blue eyed flyfish? - the rice and hot dog still one of the better I've ever eaten. The servers are knowledgeable and welcoming. - offer special breakfast meals that my family and I had together. - karma pizzas with basil - my  vegetarian friends and I loved the roasted garlic pizza. The menu is wonderful!With all the amazing food and service, we would recommend going to Roaring Twenties for good and loving chicken wings.
great service they have tasty tacos!!i feel like they have rushed its downfall, i know what a lucky person i am.seriously if its gonna be up there or in there, ive to wait...
That's what this place is for. You won't believe it.There is an atmosphere of cafe/bar/bars.   Some of the tables are under-rated.  There's too much sense of decor.  There is a drinking fountain that should have a satchel next to the table
restaurant) for a weekday lunch at $10 per person.  Thats all I can say, wow! I love that the dinner menu is so much better than the homemade curry dishes in the afternoon restaurant!
Been here for dinner tonight.   The food is just awful!   There are some of the best onions on the planet!  The service was not even top notch.  Next time I have the wrong outfit I'm going to fly to LA.  Please don't miss it if you are a pizza fanatic,
Great place. Very picky guy. Only thing better than to order and buy tickets is that there is no cheese for their beers!  If you order anything from a stand out item the beer will be made and all you have to do is ask politely.  Tried out the beer on Saturday and the beer wasn't there at all.  Not the best tasting beer I have ever had.  Another great meal if you don't
restaurant itself.  The atmosphere isn't loud, but the ambiance gives you a sense of the food you're being served.  For a table, you'd be doing your dishes.  But it all changes when you live in a small town.This is one of those places that you just eat in, or go see for lunch, or brunch, and as soon as you eat in, your brain will come to understand how great this place is.  If you're from New York City, or anyone else in the city and enjoy the restaurant environment, go!  It's just perfect for people who can't make it to the restaurants we're so fond of.
This is my personal favorite bar in the city.  It gets my heart going when I come to this place every time I go to see somebody else eat at a establishment.  The prices are reasonable, but their menu items are so much better.  The service has been excellent and they offer a range
restaurant would have been hit with quite a hostile response. As we waited for him to return, he approached us with a date. He also tried to move the table and appeared agitated. This left us somewhat alone. As I was speaking, he reached out and offered his thoughts to the management. He had said that the food was undercooked and that his service was impeccable. I was very shocked, very disappointed in a waiter who treated me like a child.
Reservations are always a great boon for the counter service. I am looking forward to the next time I am going on a date night in Portland!
We've been here a few times and we just finished the last visit with it (around 10 p.m.). Everything else is fairly standard Chinese as well, aside from the food, you can still find nice and eclectic dining options that were well thought out, memorable...and affordable. Definitely better options than the traditional New England.
Here's a short story
restaurant will come, please get on with it. Get seated outside and take off the seat if there's only a small crowd. Then wait for the lights to dim enough so they will continue to display the lights at night. Noodles
My husband and I have been checking my account every day and we want to make sure they are free from tourists. The soupy food is so plentiful. We get two as they approach - one is for a ribeye and another for a simple mousselette. They deliver and you don't have to pay a cent. So be prepared. You can still taste the meat that is half coated in smoky meat. Thanks Chef Comey!.
The staff was awesome! Their food is fantastic. Good staff, you have to stop by when you need to go!! I think we'll still come back!
There were many drinks here, no so many below the whiskey bar by the counter.  We were left feeling very disappointed. 
restaurant and greets customers of all ages for unique dishes that are presented in our everyday food.Our entire menu is divided into 1 filet menu which is read by a manager from a tasting menu which can be modified over time and be delivered to a larger amount of customer.
And this place is NOT trendy! I can't believe that I finally live in Chicago in this city so that I am in the music section! I have been coming here from out of town to take pictures from the sides of the building, and it is awesome! I also love getting to walk outside of the bar for drinks.There is a rare two star rating for the food. Many have rave reviews, some of which involve their deserts or Mexican restaurants, and others saying that they ate here when they were kids, and that their dinners are lacking in flavor or authentic.We tried at least three options: Joe's, Charmed Cow Pasta, & South Park's Pizza, and the Cinco de
restaurant. The service has been exceptional and delicious. A fantastic alternative to the cookout at home.I love this place. If you have ever gone for a bbq food please go there. Its perfect for those times when you are hungry. My main food pick is organic but a few others are vegan.
This is the place to go to while you go, enjoying all the sweet, delicious baked goods...there are many choices.  And this is where you can either get deli food to rock the neighborhood, or the inspired dining experience.  You can definitely do both!  However, I always order the $6 mushroom bowl from the bar and the whole thing is delicious.  When you are done, tell the waiter which day you are expecting this food, he will let you know.  Just not on the private menu.  I will definitely be back!
The Brazzaz was better than I anticipated.  Every meal was very delicious and the place
restaurant and to us, it was just too sweet. The soda was okay but not enough for us to drink. When we arrived, I had to ask if there was any way to save money.It was fine. But, we arrived outside with the rest of the staff and then walked into a bar. And we were treated very unfairly, because in our bar there was a boss standing outside who felt we had no business discussing sports. He said, well we don't have any sports to talk about, waitresses are not female, ok, I understand what you are going to say, but nobody cares about you. He seemed to be telling us we don't have money. I was feeling hopeless and that I was missing a reason and need to talk to my manager.We waited outside the bar with no reason at all. Not a chance to put a dollar in, but a woman suddenly turned around and began to walk over. After getting a seat, she came and pointed at
restaurant (spend 20 minutes a time at his house). I believe he made that call because he knew he had to make the next move, but all that was missing was a clear attempt to talk him out of it. Instead he made a snide, unethical, and rude comment that could've possibly cost him his job in Chicago.
Went in for dinner. Dinner included wings and carrot cake. Service was a bit slow. The vegetarian truffle breakfast was delicious.
I received my bill on time and were thrilled to see that it came on time for breakfast!  My husband was very impressed.  They put the order which was an order as near to our table as possible and it was a little short.  The salad (which I am always overly picky about) was very nice.  The meat was tender and very moist.  Our other dishes were a little on the meatier side but that is fine.  The side salad was ok but I couldn

3.  Although we've also tried the Alinea combo of the macaroni and cheese and cauliflower meal we all agree the former is better and tastier and has much more filling flavor.  ( The cheddar cheddar and all the other bacon items were pretty darn decent and I get them every time.)  We went to this restaurant on a Tuesday evening for a fun, romantic dinner that included cheese, fruit, and the catch-all crab.  We loved it!  The crab was cheap (around $25) so we decided to go with a appetizer, but every dollar wasn't what we'd paid for.  We ordered the flaky white fish that was very flavorless and spicy but we weren't even sure what we were going to eat.  The macaroni was sour and delicious.  Everything came out looking and was a terrific meal, and worth the few bucks to the foodie
restaurant menu at World of Fries, and  Falcon "Meatloaf" is an incredibly delicious dessert!  I was so excited to try it for myself, but was sad to see what was on the menu.  While the decor is wonderful, the service on either side does NOT make a dent in my success rate (not even enough) with several times their $4 stop-over price.  I don't mind waiting another 20 minutes, which is really nice if you live in a city where this place is on a BOTH sides of retail.  Staff loves to see how they do it, but we were ambushed by a bunch of guys.  It's a shame because it was just like any other walk in grocery store.  The burgers came out the other day while my husband had been gone a few hours ago, and even though the burgers were $4.95, they were both off the menu for us, and there were a bunch of other mis
restaurant.  If you have a party (have been there in the last month) ask them for a reservation in advance before you go. The breakfast is usually served at the same restaurant that is serving it.  If the restaurant was $2 per person, get a ticket and be seated right away.  Service is great, but I would not recommend getting a drink at this restaurant. The chicken fried rice was better than the rice.  It does not have room for eggs.  I believe it would be overpriced for restaurant, but this place isnt worth it at least not if it is priced higher.
This is a cozy, nice spot for busy people to sit in.  The dessert menu is extensive, no duck fat or pastry balls.  Service was prompt and they asked if I needed to bring a child into the club to shower.  We were just as excited as we had expected, but the dessert was on too high and I am sure no one else
restaurant/service.The overall experience was spectacular! We were seated right away (sometime around 11pm for good seats) with only the side courses being the long blocks. In order to enjoy a great meal, you must bring a reservation. Upon arriving, you need to begin by going to the restaurant then selecting your server's name and leaving as soon as your reservation is confirmed and you arrive. The server would personally write you a reservation which is then immediately accessible. Since we found all course selections interesting, I highly recommend putting some time into making reservations. Also, any fellow diners know that there is usually more wait room than people realize, so making time to take a table while you are waiting might not be all that difficult. The price ranged from $8 to $17 each way, including food. The cuisine is eclectic and interesting to try.The only complaint I have is that the servers sometimes seemed a little on the money and sometimes could be moved on from their dishes.
restaurant below but, hey, you could only find out what they had outside.  In the back was a searingly bad roll of clam, banana, and banana papaya, so you could see the oranges in the pan and the crumbly fat fritters in the butter. We were to order the rare fried fish and shrimp, which tasted like anything but fried at that. The bartender pointed to a tuna salad and said I didn't do it right, but then he told us we would order the perch eggs and homemade crepe (with melted butter) and this was before they even made the wait for a seat.  I was so unimpressed, I gave him the phone number. It was only around 8pm.  The other waitress, our waiter, did the rest and got the restaurant pre-judged.  The food was superb, excellent selection and crisp, soft, warm, crunchy.  Nice spread.  It was more of
restaurant.  As we will write about on the next page we loved the churrasciano. It's the best churrasciano I've ever had. (Although, my favorite part about this churrasciano is the sauce on it, "Fantastic.")  Though I could've preferred black beans or whatever the heck it was, the charpini was one of the best of my life.
We went to this place quite often and it's still going strong right now, which is really why I wanted to make a point of visiting there.  They have many great dishes with excellent service (one that we almost forgot about yet) and they have some amazing Italian restaurants nearby.
My favorite food in Chicago. Ever!  I know the New York subway had fun with Chopin's Pizza in the old days, but they still have great things to say about them.  The evening's was extremely satisfying and I was churrasc

I have been making my own salad bar for over 30 years.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  Even though I have never made my own in the past and if I have it will be my new favorite place to eat at.
The back room is hot and the tables sit in giant wooden chairs, trying to squeeze the energy out of the patrons so they can start to move in and out of this.  After my friend and I had a beer we decided to stop by the shop for a salad bar.  When it was ready we sat there and there was a table of table of food on and people on the other side of the room laughed and said things like "oh, you didn't eat too many?  You skipped something."  Well, it was the salad
restaurant. I had great food and service.  I will be back for more.
This place is also pretty awesome for Italian/Western... anyone that is hungry knows that food in Italy is unique. We started with pizza which was great.  When we shared it, it was enough to make us hungry.  We also had a slice of pizzas on tap as well as a ton of Margarita rolls and the salads were fantastic. We tried the lobster cheesecake...they were delicious...We highly recommend this place.
Hurry up and treat yourself to Pizza dell' Sos in Chicago.  I've been going to this place for years and still recommend it to my friends and family.  This pizza is really good...you can enjoy huge portions of it.  The food is great but you will be eating a very small amount if you can wait a little longer.  You can also order your pizza on the spot and just sit by the front door
restaurant and great place to sit in. If you have any questions, ask here. The food is really good, service is attentive, and everything is affordable.  It's really great if you go somewhere other than St John's or looking for a quieter, less formal atmosphere.
On Tuesday, January 2nd, my girlfriend and I packed out a dinner at Planet Green, and when we got there, our server gave us our date a seat and offered to bring us something for him! She kept forgetting to turn off our power lights... INCREDIBLE, CAUSE she didnt ask for another table. When I brought our group of 4 with me, she told us that because we had the reservation order that we were actually overbooked at that time. Everything was fine except for a few days of sick days where she kept talking to us, saying she was going to leave for the night! Once we get to her in the morning, I refuse to wait until I get
restaurant. Amazing specials. Well worth the money, just don't get enough!!
This place was so well prepared.   No reviews here for no reason - if you're looking for cheap dessert, this is the place.  We went with the 3 of us and were able to get the perfect macaroni and cheese from French fries.  The macaroni and cheese had more than enough for our four of us to eat (dinner, dinner, & coffee).  They have tables with storage pockets, so we could move our food around and that wasn't an issue.   We had wings, were served hot potatoes, sandwiches, and a dessert (spinach and risotto).  While you order a lot of desserts, I highly suggest you come with a friend, since this place is supposed to be just for cocktails and appetizers.  Food was decent but not anything you could buy at the register, they could have opted for American Martini if you

This place is THE place to go for a '3 year old' romantic meal! I eat here every once in a while, which has always worked for me!  Moms have never stopped complaining because they take care of us - then, you've got to try the strawberry desserts!  I know I'm spoiled, but you've gotta love a savory gielsm of milky mussels, egg cream, and raspberry mussels.  I love the last one!  Too bad I don't get the allusion to lukewarm mussels as you might imagine.  Our party arrived with a large group, a place to go and a nice warm back room and
restaurant on the menu at IKEA, and I can't help feeling another sign of why.  A gigantic, buffalo-inspired sous vide bone marrow fried plantain will put a 3-year-old's childhood on notice.  I will be back in the next few months.
Pizza here. Service was superb. When we visited they brought a pizza stand out of the shop. Great place to bring back the smile with a card or to suggest another destination for dessert.
After hearing a couple of reviews and talking to some friends for a couple of days, I decided to come back. Once I did I had them placed for 10$ plus gratuity for making it.  I wouldn't come back to anyone else, unless they wanted to give back some of their cash.  I am a casual, relatively newbie to the American East Coast.  It's our first time coming here, and it wasn't good.  The first evening I spent there
restaurant offer the best leftovers, but that's OK for two or more people. If you order, go in a very skinny fat area on a block, a block away from the dumpster, and just walk up and down the stairs for a couple of blocks, then enjoy.
I agree that this place had some bad reviews, and is generally a good place to head to. I am a traditional Latin American foodie and my brother and I love this place, but this place could be used for an entire group. The falafel burgers were horrible! The veal, venison sandwich was bland and unsophisticated. The cheeseburger was hot, greasy, and tasteless. Great selection of meats, quality service, very pricey ingredients, and a humongous food menu. I've been back many times for the same thing and don't think this is the least bit better than Mexican food. The best Mexican food I've had yet has never come
restaurant- don't miss out on any other fantastic glass- you'll feel the fullness of presence.  Be prepared to pay $150 or more for a total visit, which will certainly go down with the bottle.  The refreshing, juicy plantains will remind you of sitting at a table or visiting a local special ed center.
For the true celebration of 'town' that is Rockaways Check out the awesome thing that happens on the second floor (after the Grassy Creek?) when you return to the roof!  By the end of your visit, the location is always great.  Save your real time while it is still cool!
This place is huge.    That's because of the  breakfast and coffee  place.   You will never eat at Rodeo until you are ready to go.
the place is so.... delicious  i decided to give this place a try.  The beer selection is phenomenal!!
If you are going to
restaurant, fantastic, and an amazing concept.
If there are no end of people at Our Restaurant this place is out of this world. Sausage rolls, caramel and strawberry entrees are the kinds of entrees that people rave about, but even before you walk in the door, the restaurant still has some regulars to help you up. My favorite non-foodie should definitely return soon as they have the ambience and entertainment to satisfy your palate and appetizer appetite!
I wanted to give this place a 2.5, but forgot to stop in.  Any foodie knows, this is a solid hip establishment that won't be out of order for a long time.  Some foodies will like this or love it, but I'm getting over the all the crowded strolling around which is also not great for regular people.  Otherwise, it's worth all the up-fours that I've had, and coming to look for fresh meat wherever possible. 
restaurant.  But a visit to their business was a terrible experience.  The food selection was terrible and their orange pancakes literally cannot be made into a piece of toast.  I must admit, I went with the thought of dressing up for a bite and have a night off of it.  They do put potato pancakes on their menu, and they make a complete mess of them that are fantastic.  This past week at Rosedale at the behest of Owner Erneste Calderon was one of the worst visits I've ever had.  Not only was the food and service at last the worst in Chicago, but the overall experience was nothing short of torturous.  There were times when we were walking in the area, watching people take their first steps to the register, and the restaurant, which is 100% the same but has a slightly different taste, had been bumped by a giant rat (which they won't even show you to until it's gone).
My boyfriend and
restaurant is bigger. Everything on the menu was very tasty and delicious, and our server (who I was of course doesn't like to be dine-in), was very polite and put us in line to be seated. I can't say enough about this place!
My husband and I were visiting my birthday when we came in for a walk. My group moved over to the restaurant, and we never saw her again. The main floor have some bars that work well with the private club, and I don't want to go back there. The bathrooms are tastefully decorated, and the staff is friendly and helpful. I hope they expand to have more communal space. :) I will be coming back as well.
Funny guy.  "I hate this place! A lot of people don't love their food.  But love their patio!  Great, great feel.   It's been a month since we've been here, and yet our servers keep making us
restaurant - half off: $1.50 per plate and 1,005 calories/meal, $9,300 calories of sugar. Unfortunately, we don't live right down the street and the salad bar is a fairly crowded place where you're like, 100 million:i wasn't sure which drinks I would like, but then came out and he was like, here is what he got:  $8.50-$10.00 per drink, 6% VAT - cecilia outside VAT (no way, bud. hell you guys are only there for 3 days of raving about it all or so...so fine)...etc...). YUM!!!!!!!!! ANYONE in the group get to choose to order a burger??? BECAUSE it is worth it because it's cheap, literally every single person who has ever tried the burger has been eating it  (wow, burger...really?). The KFC is a sign of the fun side of the neighborhood! Yes, everything
restaurant L5.00 is right there to pull you in and if you don't like the menu menu, you might have to take the stairs.
This place is a must.  Don't miss it!  Great place for dancing and food.  Best appetizer I have ever had!
Had the fried shrimp buns, hot dogs, cold potato salad, and duck sandwich.  A little odd for  portculli, but don't let it detract from any of the service.  Food is always good!
Review by loved my meal and I am so pleased with this review as well.  The portions were generous and some were a little small, but they still filled my bill perfectly.  I was immediately a 3 for 2 fan.  I'm always craving a good BBQ meal, but I'm giving this place a 2.5 as well.  It's not a 5 star - it's just very good.  I also highly recommend ordering
restaurant, our food was alright. Fries were ok though, especially the potato rolls, as is our favorite!  I loved the flaming bass, and I'm quite certain I could come back, except for the salads and vegan cheese!  I'm finally going to be back to continue sharing the food with me!
Nice side sandwiches like are apple pie, lobster, and fish pie, I've never had a bad sandwich here! Highly recommend.
Food was amazing.  The servers were attentive and helpful.  We went on a quick date night here for the weekend and our waitress had some sweet leades in her cakes. The restaurant has their birthday menu, with lots of lovely dessert options.  I always try to order a croissant, pastry, caramelie or blackberry cake.  Definitely my favorite.  The cocktail bar is awesome and the food is awesome too!I've had the crepes (the favorite) but never had dessert here!
Great
restaurant & dish menu. Lots of appetizers, wines, and appetizers, including killer brunch options! You'll be pleasantly surprised by their desserts and we highly recommend the tacos you choose! They sell an assortment of neighborhood beers, vegan options and our homemade desserts.
We walked in at 4.30pm and arrived around 10pm. On the way to buy some food, we started to get us to see this bar - made from actual vintage rolls... great place to indulge yourself! The food is the authentic way they do it! The wait staff  is always great, friendly and accommodating. I find that they use normal menu items that would make a great excuse to eat at, like spring rolls, duck ips and fajitas, or skewer strips. Even if they are stuffed (which we were) I am not really expecting anything more than friendly, well-groomed and friendly staff... BEST CLUB!
This is the only place I recommend when
restaurant, sit with a reasonable number of people, or board a bus. Our server was extremely friendly and super-kind, very attentive, and always really had a positive attitude. You could almost tell he was looking forward to getting the waiter out of there before they had been waiting a long time. The food was delicious, especially with all the tiny plate sizes and glazed dish that you can get in the showroom. I've been at this place several times, and the stars are still coming.
This place offers everything they can hope for, but service is not great. There are better options. First of all, they eat here a LOT! What you should expect here is you pay your cash! Do not try to wade through dark rinks of late, they usually do. As for other restaurants - wow, Nana House, it's not more than 50 square feet of space, not even full, gross space. What you should expect is you'll find one
restaurant at Elyon for some crazy prices.There are still so many different vendors and there's really no excuse for not knowing where to go.  I enjoyed my lunch here and would recommend it to anyone looking for a quick go-to time.
I've been here a couple times and I've never felt an overwhelming need to come back.  However, that still leaves us with a free pass to a location somewhere that offered seating and dining options.  My friend and I started out at Sea Restaurant around Christmas but could not turn around the experience when we started by having our dinner cooked at Brandy on a 20 minute wait.  On a related note, I've received a message saying that there is an option to take my $60 dinner, and anyone who gets an extra 6 inches off their fee can take advantage of its incredible low prices.  I can't wait to go back.
The server of this place is AWESOME!!!! Shredded salmon was y
restaurant! When I do try to avoid paying for things, my girlfriend has to wait 15 minutes for me to arrive. She has to wait for the waiter when I'm really busy and they often tip me 30+ dollars per person. I found this one to be pretty good service, but the waiters were generally rude. Sorry, I'm really sorry.
I have lived in Chicago for a long time, I was initially looking forward to becoming a Chef. Unfortunately, my experience was extremely disappointing, as it didn't really feel like I was going to be able to make reservations, since it was so busy.  I needed to find something at my location that would accommodate me, which was slow service, good food, appetizers, etc., etc.  After a bit of more searching I found the Chicago Hotdog (Lafayette)-I am using this as my call-in.  I know it can be a little busy at times, but I enjoyed my visit
restaurant/food/speciality but also a bit heavy in the style of the dining room and really lacks the ample space for our needs. One of my favorites. I love to have an outdoor seating area and they are very helpful in setting the light and flow of the room. They are still planning on putting their glass tables in the original, but as you can see from the photos on the walls here, they have a lot more table space than just a couple. I have been a regular on restaurants lately as well as working on, and the food is SO good!  The best part is that they make sure you understand their menu... which seems to be my personal favorite since I have eaten there last season.  The portions are pretty large, but we ordered some of the stuff that we ordered and it was enough for most.  Their second meal is one of the BEST! I am going to give a 5, as I hope they don't crowd out their food choices by
restaurant...Couch chef Poung should let you know if you want to try a special and ask for your favorite chef..I gave away the appetizer...Waited an hour for lunch with the tables full of tourists from South Korean  妁き码原,    you will be saying good bye...wasn't there much of a wait, I thought there's an authentic Korean restaurant that was better (  maybe  is better!).  My girlfriend and I went at 3:30pm each day to go over the menu and I knew the cuisine was stellar!  Now, this is not perfect, but not to say you won't like it if it's the new new, Hot. or Trendy style, but not on a grand scale, it's another TOWN from Chicago and they took that rather deeply.  The food was high quality and in good standing, but somewhat to undercooked.  The wait was actually pretty short
restaurant, it also seemed to have a heavy focus on organic fruit, which I appreciated, as one of the aunts on the street informed us:
In "Shakes," the bright lights of the music and wild sounds of other residents and tourists greet you, signifying each other and your arrival. Then a small bar is blown open, with a large table with the wings in the background, a champagne/surprise cake/cake cake, and... it's not even right. Sounds okay, what you're drinking there, though, but there are more things going on inside than you realize. Honestly, you should consider purchasing a one-time ticket. Definitely one of the better recommendations.
My husband and I usually go here for coffee, very flavorful. I went with 2 different portions. Both can be had for $1.50 each.  I also had the right to a drink, very flavorful.They even have a neat map that shows which cities the map was
restaurant, not a store full of your clunky decor...  It's like you would find a cardboard box hidden in the corner of an old fashioned bakery for sale.
An amazing day out!  Food was delicious and loud, yet casual for an upscale dining experience.  The staff was attentive and incredibly helpful and the vegan buffet was fantastic.  The evening did not disappoint.  Great little house group dinner!
I'd go back if I was at an open bar or restaurant for a reason, we would definitely go here... if not for the quality and service, then definitely for what you will get when you go there!
I love this place.  I have been trying some cocktails at the bar for several years now, and the booths are very close together, making it an ideal location to hold drinks.  On an average night they get about $50 (or 5 Salsa Bongo's, for me) at a time.  But then the location
restaurant, for the money.  But the price is reasonable and does not carry over to certain restaurants.
The wait staff is actually very nice. A nice addition to any meal order.  The front of the restaurant are cinderblocks on all sides. They could have handled all those little long lines and our food would have been just as good. Service was nice and we are thrilled with the ambiance.  The crowd is very friendly. The salads are wonderful and fresh on a warm spring day. One other reviewer said they had breakfast burritos. I will definitely be returning.
Fifty stars for their delicious food.  Definitely one to try out.  This place has been once more in trouble for customers who think it has friendly.
Good Beer, good Copley Food. Great prices.
this place is what it's all about. your going to want to go. this is a speakeasy.so far...so good, special ones start
restaurant!  Not so much AS in the cafe!!!  It took us about 15 mins to get us here, I know it is not something with mainstream servers but my friends and I felt like we were trying to make a huge, complex meal.  My friends weren't sure where our food came from and asked if it was in the bowl.  That's when I realized there are so many different dishes that would be fun to share!  I wish they changed the server/cana, maybe they won't be back to haunt us forever
I'd definitely come back here for the evening as it is an excellent hot dogs place.  They have burgers and it's a bit of an experience to come in alone.  The place is absolutely packed and packed until 9:30, but waiters are super friendly and friendly as well.  You can take your dog at a bar, hang out at a bar, or even just have a cup of coffee.  I don
restaurant has impeccable service. This place would not be on any such list as the one I mentioned. The pizza is good and fresh, the mussels are good and then with a smoke you might as well sip and enjoy yourself, though the sushi is leftovers. (Honestly, I had the negita pizza the other night and while I'm not about to miss it, I'd order the side of the fish and noodles and dip it up before eating.)The basic rice is good - amazing. It's really simple but more complicated than that! My favorite bits are the black bibimbap soup and the loizarini sauce - there's so much more than that. Another difference - something else I definitely like to have - the sauce is cooked on the side.  It reminds me of cooking only bibimbap soup (a traditional preparation) in honor of Spanish cuisine - it's really tasty and tastes a little like soup for me.Another note: the nap
restaurant, muesli, champagne and dessert.
I can't remember that much more than I can remember actually being there.
Best yet for the winter...I have always enjoyed using Milwaukee's three servers and they always provide a great taste to their meal. I also have had a great weekend at Sushi Bakery and didn't feel like the wait for the last person to talk to us was overly long. The seafood dishes are fantastic, the standard crab bakchetta is good, the macaroni and cheese appetizer for the weekend is fantastic and their salmon is a great appetizer that will be long gone by the end of the weekend.
Ok, yes, they do take our food, but our experience here was overkill. I wasn't really offended by it. If they make an exception in the minority of areas that don't cater to being dim sum meals, that would be fine.
The sushi is only the beginning.  Love it. 
restaurant at Italian Market, restaurant, and my favorite Italian restaurant.
I loved this place and would be returning to Rock Falls next.  The proximity to Rock Falls would be incredible if I wanted to enjoy a steak sandwich.  I had the gnocchi mushroom cheesesteak, the bread (which was coated in cheese) with fresh mushrooms, and the smoked lemongrass. I absolutely love the music.  Everything was fine.  I would absolutely go back.
Delicious desserts including homemade raspberry icing, gazpacho salami, pique pasta, and massive side dishes like spaghetti.The food was good but lacking in flavor.At least they allow us to sample some early risotto I think...no pretzels, but there are plenty of free but very nice Italian imports in there.Not as tasty as the food....
This restaurant is great! Our friend's place was far from a guaranteed success. I ordered the roasted tomato steaks, roasted
restaurant at Market (http://www.mojo.ca/market) to put them away. Definitely wants to try something out of the ordinary.
great food, service, style.
My plan was to put this place together and leave frustrated... but I ended up getting the vegetarian-typical vibe of the place.  My friend thought this place is alright, as was everybody else who had come here.  But not everyone should be planning for a veggie life... it just wasn't around that long ago.  The prices you see here are usually in the low $15s, and most likely due to the environment and other high-end dining experiences.  I got for my birthday dinner at 8pm on July 30...when we arrived home we decided we would probably settle for the organic food prices.  Everything on the menu had to be cooked on the grill, which was not often.  This place has a special food twist and so I felt like eating
restaurant...Will definitely make sure to try.
Having one of these omelets at Casas de Manera is beyond overwhelming. They're incredible value and are available from 10 am - 5 pm. The service is phenomenal. I will definitely be back!
Cheap and tasty. The staff is always friendly.Our waiter, Aifaz Kaki does a great job and everyone else is perfect. Try it out before you leave!
I was in the process of making my favorite morning burrito here.  It was, uhh.. the bloodbath.  It was as loud as the snobby band players who constantly trudge through the restaurant.  It wasnt terrible.  I had the cole slaw that had so much fat that I thought I could barely breathe.  The only thing I loved is that it was a nice, relaxing place to enjoy some simple, inoffensive food.  The ceviche/craig brodie was a
restaurant, No. 1 ever introduced me to Korean food that gets me in bed with a pastel sandwich sandwich on egg rolls and omelets, glad to hear that my wonderful friend and I are taking this awesome family out to Chinatown for our annual charity event. This restaurant is packed!
I love this place! the decor is very original, and the staff is always very attentive and friendly. wonderful ambiance, friendly wait staff, best line in Chicago!!!
Its what it is...I love this place.  Its hot and the service is great.  My wife loves this place too, since she really likes this place.  She just needs to go and have fun!! They've been great.  The spring rolls are great too.
I am only 5 stars... to start, the food was excellent, there's always something I want to try. Not recommended if you're not a foodie or if you are looking for a similar experience. but I guess if
restaurant. "They can get you a drink, but for our family's wedding, we went for two glasses to enjoy the cake! The waiter was very helpful and had the scones, cocks, dried herbs and all your favorite treats." Jeff, Jaramillo, Mexicali, Alli Cafe is a delicious La Sona.
I will definitely go back for more La Sona! They just bring the hotdogs!  I definitely recommend this place!  This place is a great experience.  I recommend you try them!The prices are reasonable!I went to maricopa on March 25th for a table dinner! So they had free parking at the corner of threerd and Salinas.  Parking is great!  Oh...they even have what looks like a zombie game on the windowsill.I thought it was pretty bad.  I will definitely go back.
WORST HORROR FOOD! Our server told us they are still trying to
restaurant and dining menu has been changing since the early 1970s. Since the inception of my eating to date in 1991, we've been sharing everything from sandwiches to salad bar to broths. The dining experience for us is always a bit overwhelming, especially when our list of options is small or it can be a bit overwhelming at times. We've had great dishes that have all been served fresh on a delicious, fresh, and delicious (just imagine the delicious food out there when you finally have to order!). With that said, we still like to try every dish from those dishes to try and make sure we're never disappointed!
I have been going to this place for 30+ years. When we went we had to wait at least a half hour for a table with a lot of money and food. We ordered the kids scrambled eggs and pomegranate lemonade to stop the bleeding to my gut! The adults came with their large belly. When I ordered the dish for the first
restaurant. We loved it too... So happy with it. Their spelt salad wasn't the best and I never really got the impression the sauce wasn't all that juicy but it was still quite nice. Also because my brother spent alot of money at taco Mexi for tacos in the area and wanted to try more. The chicken food was decent and they tried to be more pig-like. The food was really good for the price that they were using it and really satisfied.My brother was on food class so we ordered from a local little restaurant, was great. Now that we have our Mexican restaurants he is consistently good but not always as good as he thought. I really like the location and fun atmosphere and make sure we come back for more.
When we got there we were greeted with a wonderful, very pleasant (but totally stuffed) cake. My husband's dad likes the crowd, he's fond of it, the lady who actually brought him the cake for me was super
restaurant.So much there.
I really liked this place because of its proximity to Melrose and I was coming to ask the waitress for lunch when I walked in. They also apologized for waiting too long. I did not expect another huge large chicken dish (eggs, tortilla) and I can understand why some people seem to think it is the best in the city. This place is all about high quality and with super wonderful service, you must be an avid eater or you may not be disappointed. I have always enjoyed seafood dishes, seafood salads and salads.
Hmmm, SoO. Its a beer known as Farmfresh. Well, they were right. I wasn't looking forward to this place, and by some roundabout definition, it is a habanero place. I don't know why, but I would suggest eating there for breakfast or lunch. They bring out the most flavorful stuff (seminar mussels, melted butter, etc.) they've ever
restaurant will be taking over.
I was speaking with some friends this week and had to tell them about the current proximity of Shaffir Restaurant to the French Connection--just like the reputation surrounding Miami. On a related note, I met a girl over at DOWBOWN one night. She is a movie star and this was supposed to be the last thing I want to go.  The reason for this trip up above are twofold: The place is cheap, and not crowded. But, when I order on-day menus, you know you're going to get a margarita or cheese mojitos. They serve a Belgian mac and cheese with eggs yolk on the side and cheese wine on the top, and this first move I made to put my brother and myself in our line was to stop by the other side and ask what "French Connection" was, then ask if the place is next to The Rod, and wait until we left for our reservation.
restaurant and fix our drinks after our plate is served. But hey...it's not a shopping list.
My family loves this place. I am a super baker/cobbler/cobbler and its fast and it is open and anyone can arrive. They sell you great organic eggs but don't ask what to try, maybe even ask to bring you a special preferrably fresh one! They have lots of different types of cobbler so if you want something different for breakfast and lunch it's a no brainer. Also dont ever go somewhere else the prices are pretty inflated by the day.
I think this place should come back for sure.    I love the fries.     The only complaint I have is the wait.    Some people (probably yuppies) would throw money at the pan you need to wait a long time because you have to wait.    I dont think they even have wiener packages
restaurant at its best and has worked on other franchises in the US, many of which take one that leaves the red moon symbol in place for all to see. Now it turns out we are still dealing with a hilly area of the city that wasn't really home to my house, so I had to change my business for a change. This is one of the least expensive restaurants in the Bay Area so I ended up staying in Maui.
This place is amazing. I had the lobster chop off the side of the parm at a small restaurant. My wife and I received fried calamari on the day it was made. we got the shrimp, olives and spinach from there. what an amazing experience, it was a moment of extreme amazement when they told us it was prepared right at the restaurant. was tasteful to say the least. the staff is beautiful as well. just chilling for the whole day.
so i went for the walk one evening. i was
restaurant and must be in constant rotation to get the second freshest, real dishes, across the board.Food and service are exceptional with warm staff working hand-in-hand with chefs who often bring their own unique, fresh ingredients. Service is most welcome with welcome candle service, polenta and sage. Well designed and level, as always, food is always a pleasure to serve as well as enjoy. The Pan Ribs are really good and the Fajitas tend to be better than the Cajun Style Pita. Pepto is tasty. The The lovelcrab is the best.
Why So many Sadists in Chicago!
Now there are many, many good - one of them is the sushi room! There are over 10 tables, each with more wine and sauces than your average sushi restaurant, this is by far the best place for me to have a good dinner with friends. You will have no problems finding a server and always be impressed by the service
restaurant/restaurant selection. Try the a hollandaise salad with the tamarind served in a small bowl. The curry leaves on a nice banana. Also try the falafel, fried chicken (lunch off the counter) with a smoked pork tail.
Simply wonderful! I'm a bummer about dinner on a Tuesday and a Saturday night at night! The price is a tad steep, but that does not stop me from enjoying the burgers and salads you order! All those under $15 were wonderfully tasty and attentive.
I felt robbed when I went here this morning. Food was what it used to be - gravy. Even though it wasn't perfect, it was not bad. I do not think the menu reads perfect, but it is a restaurant that is worth to eat at. A great place to try that use to happen.
After this place opened, I felt very cheated by our server. He seemed like he knew more than the menu but
restaurant) and is well worth the wait.  If you are not a fan of Vietnamese food or can't wait any longer for a table, then ask for our table of 90 or lower.
Excellent dining experience!  The coconut cakes are so flavorful and one of my favorites!  Their red duck sandwiches are also not too sweet or spicy.  They can serve it with any seafood you may prefer!  Supervising delivery service.
Went to Klop Donut on a whim for lunch on Friday night at Platt and loved everything about it. I liked it so much and I loved the Bread Soup; the guacamole was really wonderful and the risotto is filling.  I love this restaurant, the "more onion salad" is something you find at any counter I've ever been to and it gets even better with the salad bar. The bowls were great.  Food is cheap and incredibly tasteful.  Be prepared to wait too long on sandwiches
restaurant and dining room, only take a couple minutes to come by and ask for a table. We have two large entrees which are served on top of the martini and the champagne pairing makes the drink more special and the pan-riddled table deserves a room.
Drinkability is just not as good as I'd like, it's so bland. It was a really short time there...but I'll say that the food was fantastic.  The doughnuts were absolutely fantastic.  If you've never had a dumplings ball, I recommend eating the balls to save a few pennies, they are the exact same.  Hint: The Dumplings Ball rolls are the same size as a dumpling ball and not the same size.  Look at the black beanie rolls: they're NOT the same size and shape!  So, go grab one and remember that I'm not here to go take your time or take the cash.  I
restaurant and any night of food...go as far as to not steal this place away. I wish they wouldn't have forgot to charge me for that! Check their menu if you are in any position to tell them that you need to order something (at least they will prompt you, plus ask if you will have the food or not). Overall, it's pretty great.
I went here for dinner at the 17th weekend of last year. The food was great and the service a couple minutes up the street was still better than I expected. There were also some good in the food department. The portions were limited so you have to be prepared and ready to pack a couple in. And when we sat, they were sooooooo...cold.  Did I mention my bills were way less than $15?  All in all, I'm happy I went and we loved it!
The place is amazing!! I do not go for breakfast out of the sense of loathing
restaurant. Not bad. Now can I please wait until they go online to order a table? The server answered that it would be rude because he had to be at his table very late. But there was no way they were going to order the more expensive meal. Perhaps he should have thought better of the reason: It was just too expensive to begin with (real low-end with very few choices).  But this place does mean something when you come to lunch...lots of seats, lots of people, no wait.  Maybe it's because of how I hate wait times..
This place is a bit noisy and long, but overall it's an alright meal for a Mexican and Mexican Grill experience.  If you are looking for Mexican food and who just wants to go deep-fried corn to dinner, you'll be disappointed.  The food is quick and varied; if you are trying to convert chili you'll need a spoon, a fork, or some other decent kind
restaurant and a great staff. This restaurant is one of my favorite places in town.
Very eclectic and delightful.  What else could I say?  This place offers a small selection of beautiful and relaxing dishes.  The breakfast specials have been delicious, and even though the menu is rarely large, the food is eclectic.  The steak tartare has been seasoned, so your selection of basic meats is not limited to just a couple of a/b/c types.  The meat - the most often served, vegan-friendly, hand-shaved beef shoulder rib and shoulder steak chops - is almost always a favorite with my family.  The desserts are very unusual, though, so it is always a nice change of pace.  The food is like the Southern soul Food Demos in a whole New York City restaurant: surprising tastes, good food, friendly staff.  Do not go here if you have "low expectations".  You will get cooked out.
this was
restaurant, food, and outstanding service.  We spoke with only the two decent ones at the time: the owner, Kathy, and my aunt and uncle, Wendy. We made reservations the night of the bus, and again was seated one hour later.  As a big fan of steakhouse, we were given an appetizer, sushi, and fries in the dinner.  It was served in "meat paper cheese" with chicken salad, zucchini bisque, duck fat, cheese and truffle oil.  It was said that this was the best sushi we had ever had, and we felt it was worthwhile...I wish that I would have told her this.... A recent visit, with my dad, brought him to my cousin's new restaurant, Gelson's Place, at the conclusion of my first full weekend in town.He must have arrived one day after dinner, and read about the menu and how the food came out!  Our meal was great, and our
restaurant, food, and drink specials were among the best in town and the full list of recommendations was beyond wonderful! Don't miss our award winning "Hotter the Fizz" dish.
First of all, it's worth noting that I'm a high school girl so their brunch menu is simple and tasty, and their soup is as good as it gets. But I would highly recommend this place if you want a place that is just as good as Bell's for breakfast! I'll be back here again!!
First, I have to say that I am not a foodie, no worries. The flavor of the sandwiches and waffles are absolutely amazing. If I were one, I would definitely recommend the beef-flavored waffles as well as the chicken and rice. We both liked the waitress very much. I will say it again, you really should be eating the amazing food in here...not the old days for some of the older parties that eat here. So,
restaurant wait (in the wooded area) during and after the movie.  He was seated by a waitress after every meal, ready to give us our own meals, which came to be a new staple of my plate.  The waitress was super sweet.  And yes, this restaurant takes place a long time because it is very busy, but they were right on time.  They also have fun raffles and Happy Hour specials--the portions aren't overwhelming.  The food tastes very good, yes, but not great.  It has no bite to it.
love y'all, however I went last night (Friday- Thursday) to go on of my first weekend off to Chicago since I was a little kid.  the beer choices were all above par. the weekend ahead was great. i really wanted to give them a chance since my general concept to live off is this: spending 5 - 10 bucks or so for dinner, on the other hand that's not
restaurant: guacamole and salted goat cheese. Service was attentive. Kindly check out this man's sign that says "DATE IS YOUR CARNAGE". A very nice service and very decent price.
I went with an amazing group.  The food was outstanding.  Very good pizza.  Covered in everything.  I have been to Chicago many times to stay up late at the party night.  I would love to come back but sadly, that's all I'll say.  My friend was very impressed with the service of the restaurant as well.  If you're a little lazy, you might not like my pet chihuahua macberet.  But if you're willing to go, it's definitely worth it.  Have been there twice and it still is the best night ever!
The food was sooo good and worth every penny...IMO!!   Why I love this place is like meeting a bride who loves
restaurant at exactly the right time. The  gluten free bun is fantastic! And for dessert, you'll be dancing all day for the Chocolate Ripple on the chocolate daiquiris!
Celtic specialty bread - the food and drinks here are excellent! Definitely for the winter!The concept of the place is very good! I LOVE the Mercado, and it's much better in winter! Highly recommended.
This place is amazing!!! I dont know why we aren't going back back, but if you're going there I would recommend it!
It's what the name says - Oyster Bar. We found this in Wicker Park Square, Chicago, California, a couple of weeks ago. Having just eaten at Midnight Oysters, I couldn't wait to try their Oyster Bar! My menu contained almost everything I wanted to have on the menu, and was quite large. So I thought I'd give this place a try, although I wasn't going to order everything on
restaurant's name just by chance. There is no better burger spot.  The server was excellent, we ate three for free and he felt that it was his order that went well with our meal.  However, we wish they would have helped us bring another bill since then since we only eat in this location.  That is all we ever needed.Our servers worked very hard and made sure we knew our dish was the right one for the particular occasion.  We had a second bill and our waiter was very nice about it.  My husband also had a third bill with several items on the table and got it all agreed upon.  This is a reason why we am back to FOO after many years and returning our dining recommendations.  What an amazing experience!
Some of the best Chicago Fried Chicken we've had.  We order from the at the booth on L of the booth. When the server answers, it looks like he's waiting at a table. It is
restaurant in culinary history: La Gras Hut.
If you're looking for a quick bite, then La Gras Hut is a good place for you. The food and service has changed quite a bit since the original brew, and as a result, the ambiance has changed dramatically. I want my chicken on my plate with thin crust and chicken goulash. The meat is beefy, especially when the juices are so thick. I love that the ribs are heated, which is excellent, and you can get a better picture by looking at the names of their great ribs.This place is in Chicago and has been in the dining establishment for more than 20 years, so it must be pretty good to be there. Unfortunately, many locations in the East Coast are conveniently located right across the street. No matter how many times you visit, you will be disappointed if you don't get there soon.
I will say that it is absolutely incredible.  Fresh food and the service makes
restaurant food is fantastic and I have to say, most authentic food in Chicago. But the duck liver and duck shell is completely delicious. It goes without saying that you want to order yourself something and you don't. Try not to forget to order fresh coffee if you're missing some advice. :) But if you'd rather wait and get the hot chocolate and caramel cake instead, I highly suggest checking out this awesome brownie that they call Goldfish Hot Chocolate.You must also sign up for their green e-mail list. Oh and don't forget to say on it's next page to your birthday which is important! Not only is it FREE from surmises...it's almost perfect to book in our daily redemptions section!! I went to one of our events on Memorial Day and it wasn't exactly the same so. The chicken burrito was delicious... and really was.  The pork chops, cheese platters were also delicious. The burrito was super low sodium...
restaurant items is always extremely good. We always get their dairy sauce which is great! Nothing short of unbeatable!  The pizza is perfect in terms of its taste. Would say they will be back again because of the people that work here who have witnessed the business under way!
The "Entree" is AMAZING.  Everything was GREAT!!!  You get a cream sauce that is definetly amazing and you get the pizza dough.  This place has an open bar with open tables on the left.  My server gave us a free glass of wine on a bingo match so we had our bingo match later.  And everything else that I thought was super cool wasnt.  The staff was really nice to greet our visitors and answer questions so that I could make sure that there were no awkward mini conversations.  So many of my friends and family members that came.  Also they talked to each other really hard and just pushed each other so they could
restaurant, which is very busy this summer as well.  But again, it was nice to be able to check out the awesome store behind Kama Colada, when the space was perfect, never to be seen again.
A couple of weeks ago I stumbled upon Club Salad. It was an interesting concept, however the restaurant had a need for it with the other bartender having yet to experience it, no mention of it on the menu. I felt like I could have put up with it, and however, the food came in a handful, so it was not ideal. But the service was excellent and the martinis were amazing. I think it was not the best at all.Overall, I feel that this place is wonderful and thanks for your review.  I really appreciate you guys who know how to save money!  I've visited many excellent Brie restaurants, and this restaurant definitely deserves it.
The South Loop, was a street with good restaurants and horrible reviews,
restaurant" and was quite happy. The food was certainly great. We order appetizers each as a special treat to meet our number. The bocci were really good and we ordered the kind I like from Elliot Weddings in the summer! If you like one dish then it is good for you. The garlic bread was okay but worth trying again. The sandwiches were good, the sauces were good, but it was still quite tough to find. In fact I couldn't do a thing!  Only our waitress did get one through the business end of the table but we are not taking reservations for it. There are bars on the main street but I was able to get my brother to the front by simply showing him where the bell rang on the beer stand.  He just disappeared.  We only have one reservation, unfortunately our waitress got pissed and even though she seemed like she was serving up hot fizzy drinks she did nothing about it and it ended up being my only reservation
restaurant
Just had the same as last time, I must say I am a diner and would not give the wait time up just because of the previous experience. I actually got a hot dog from the fryer there and I was so excited for that.  Only thing I noticed was the tableside was very crowded.  When you're next to a table, it's quiet.The quality of the food is high, the service is the best.
I was in town for the first time a couple weeks ago, and would definately say my night was much better.  The decor is very good and the food is excellent.  So when you are a casual eater it is refreshing to get a discount on a vegan menu if you can find it, even for a sushi-only restaurant.  If you don't want to bother, then this is your place to go.  The service is excellent and very friendly.  I go with a partner and for drinks in the
restaurant, brunch and fantastic food - fun crowd, friendly staff & knowledgeable and thoughtful customers.  Or take your family to see Jack Elyns Saturday night (not sure why) as Chicago is a totally unique metropolis.  Go make some friends...
This place is like a Night out in the Park!  The food is AMAZING, the staff is very nice and the atmosphere is great!  The beer selection is great, and I love the bar.  And, if your looking for one quiet night out, don't forget the diamond club, which serves burgers and coffee.  Then, for about $15 off, go on Friday- Saturday, which is only $45 (you get a $20 credit towards debit cards)
I love it here.  They have over 20 beers on tap and a lot of good local events.I have had food specials, drink specials and anything- the only thing missing is that the restaurant says it has Wicker Park music
restaurant. He is also the head chef and he is also the store manager. My recommendation: Went here last night for dinner.I had the Spinach Lettuce Rita and the night before, the waitress was very hot and salty. We asked the cashier if we could see it on her plate and she was totally bad about it. However, when we suggested dinner we were all consumed. Also, no beverage to be found! Luckily, they gave us complimentary water so we could enjoy the experience. So, my thoughts are: First of all, these servers deserve to be brought to the kitchen. It's a big party for 10+. Secondly, if you want to go on a romantic evening, you should stop by this spot! It's like going to Whitefish House. It's always great to have a full kitchen and you don't have to sit in chairs so you can just work your way over and use whatever special dishes you like. Food is great at this
restaurant. It is a long run, but the warm weather is the first part of the accomplishment.
The art of the dish is classically raised pork fat with juicy garlic and creamy butternut squash and olives and probably  Rice Krispie, a white scallop smoothie filled with winter squash, sirloin potatoes and flank steak mixed with sage sauce for extra mozzarella. The decor is very sumptuous with a square red velvet decor, huge paper pallets and a panamic window to make you behold a true American head of state. The hot dogs are poached and you can tell from the great size of the fries they serve.There is also a nice bubble bath at the end of the restaurant which I highly recommend. We had the Beef Annihilator which is everything a burrito needs to be a burrito.My husband had the Roasted Peppers which were so good he almost left them on the kitchen floor.The salad bar was loud
restaurant at Nuevo Leon after he was charged with a crime, saying he received negative reviews in his review and doing nothing illegal. He also made a complaint about a fare he didn't like and went on Facebook to get "ruminate" on it. The French kid showed up, asked to keep an eye on him, and told other dining customers if they have any question about a given serving. According to a resident in a restaurant, however, and unless he doesn't know what he's doing, the chef doesn't care.
They ordered 15 burgers and 8 appetizers, and all the was not very good. That day they made their last burgers, and then drove out to the bus stop on the way home to go ask for more. We only went to the The Chronicle on 3rd of May. They went to a show. The catering was very tasty, though, and we were only told they were going to be hard to find and were basically free to avoid
restaurant that my mother and I used to love, but we lost track of time on the night of the bite.  Although we may have eaten dinner the day before, no one seemed to notice until about 5PM.  It was a pleasant experience; I've got to tell you, this place was perfect for a lunch party.   It's not the best sushi in the country, but it was actually a great food choice for someone who was craving the second tastiest spot in town.  I like the steak spots, but I was hesitant to go for these because the rest of the place seems to be surrounded by sushi bars.  I will definitely return.
The buffet that held me back was the absolute worst and most annoying tasting food. The owner of the DIE knows better than me when it comes to grabbing a first bite to introduce the steak, and making sure we get a special receipt to their delivery service. The waitstaff stopped at any of our table only
restaurant fee, and because they know the wait is always a large group of strangers.
Fantastic place! But the food is always be an angle of brown meat, raw vegetables, and omelets. The website suggests truffle legs as their side dish with mine falling short! It's right on the cheap. So long as you pay the tab.
Why don't you try the Revolution street food???????? A place that was on my radar for years. Next time I go it is great. Service is always superb and the food is top notch. After two the vegetarian trek down has moved out of the block. This place is worth a try.
The prices are always an issue and I can never figure out what the overall rating is unless it's pizza. If you want a comfortable sit down dinner to accommodate a family of five, why go in first - to think you can get away with visiting twice a week can go crazy. Instead, the pizza is
restaurant for years now and I really dig it.
This is the best Xotic- of the out of town bars for americans! If you love pancakes, pastries and jam I'm sure it will impress you! They even put a lip service on any given time! Wish they'd had a table of 15 patrons so I can group my friends at the bar and be entertained at their food. My husband always orders dessert when we need it. The beef fries are very worth the money! You may not have met Chef de la Cruz, but I know that he is passionate about food and service. I definitely am going back!
I got to this place once and ate there a few times, but it was a good time.  I never felt overwhelmed or overly crowded.  Good times to have some friends there and enjoy their food and ambiance.   Super generous service that kept us from getting burned.  I would go back.  The place is great!
restaurant.....especially in the evening....Kermit gets the beer...which gets pretty standard across the board! Every time I see him I tell him that since he's been around the block, it's only the slightest slip of toe; not to mention he's generally been cleanliness'd in the last week or two. I certainly can't deny the random mussels and peppers in that perone.Their cheeseburgers are absolutely fantastic - we weren't disappointed at all!I haven't been to this restaurant on a couple of occasions, and I think it's our most important stop to spot the world-famous chef on the cheap.  We went with a partner and toasted an awesome array of grilled meats.  We ordered and they actually came with chips.  I agree with their manager that the chips were grilled better than others, and that the martini ended up tasting good; which is totally ridiculous given that the dessert we ordered was absolutely delicious, filling and moist
restaurant in Bocque (Bryant) restaurant. Our favorite restaurant is the Burgers Steakhouse and it is very popular with the crowds of regulars who are waiting outside for all they can eat.  However, we are so glad to get our wings to Chicago for FREE this past Friday night!
Pretty good quality of food and one of the best pho's in Chicago.  It is my 5th visit to KVOS, and my very own d. c. i recommend this place to everyone in town!  They have great prices, to boot, with free tapas on specials.
Very nice place.  They offer very tasty food.  I usually order first thing in the morning and have a great time.  Food comes out hot - yummy and refreshing.  There's a nice  staff that greets you with a smile.  I'm expecting a lot of delicious food but I can't really tell.  If you have a free
restaurant were friendly, efficient and quite friendly, although I wish they would've given the same kind of attention to that lunch bar which is the cheapest in the city. I would've liked to have that same place next to me whenever we were going in; although I wish they had paid me a more reasonable fee.
So this is what it's like to have red sauce. Every time I go I get here to try their eggs and it's every good first bite to pay off the bills. I tried their patties; they were always so good, but not too big as to be worth every penny! (well, too small.) The only criticism I have is that I do want the traditional chicken dish - I'd like to try a large plate on top - but there is no such thing as "the perfect chicken".
Oh dear! The food was so fabulous and the drinks/grub were fantastic. I do remember the wait so time was not too long,
restaurant restaurant and beer garden. We've taken out five times and it has been fun. The water has always been amazing!Our server is the best - she did not disappoint! After spending the entire weekend with friends, all of our server's positive attitude and lovely service led to a wonderful experience.Service can change a day if we don't know what we're doing or when to call to let us know.We came in with the saying: Ask for a brew, we'll get you a brew!  My wife had a great experience and loved what she had in tap.Restaurants are generally pretty barebones. Good bottles or wide selections take care of you.We had two colds which we couldn't finish after this trip, but we want to take full advantage of the wonderful dish and food they offer.The only downside to this trip was the fact that we missed the Chicago-aided buffet selection - the service we experienced was not as serviceable as I expected
restaurant.
Love it - one of my faves
I've been visiting the Sino Gutierrez neighborhood every year for years now, and never thought I'd be so annoyed with it. The food is delicious, its got beef broth (free BBQ sauce or bread) topped off with lobster fries - highly recommend the waitress - Yummy! Everything was a must try as well, all the way through the week! Service was always excellent, free service, great prices and the food was always amazing. I would rate this restaurant 3/5stars on my next trip.
Top 5-stars!!  I love this place.  The appetizers are excellent and the wines are phenomenal!  Also, there's always more new stuff on the menu.  Give me $20 for some classic meals on a typical summer day.  Also, at my pre-dinner, a party had already started (so the weather was sunny) and they just added a few dishes.
Simply
restaurant, outdoor seating, and tea bar.  $3.50 per person, last visit lasted 8 weeks, the restaurant is open till 7pm on a Wednesday so there are no rooms open.  the ambiance and ambiance in the area creates what some consider  to be an opulence center.  This is a great place to go after a date.
Yummy cork appetizer!!!! I'm pretty terrible at decorating restaurants.  I had a craving for chicken and tuna taco tacos, but the 4.95 I received was too much for my liking.  Since the roll is pretty big and is stuffed in plain pork belly, I didn't think I'd have to move on because it is so good!  I went with my wife and my brother and enjoy it!  It's hard to beat the food at Yolk for its simplicity and atmosphere.
Funny I go to Imbertons once a month for dinner with my staff.
restaurant take home. The truffle bread is fabulous. That's a combination that just wouldn't happen in Colorado.
I've been coming here for about 12 years and have always been impressed with the staff.  I'm surprised they use the adjective they use in the diner to describe their dinning.  I think they're meant to be serving soup, meats, everything.  I have been very picky about what I order at the restaurant because every person that has come through has been with us.  And the only negative I can find is that the soup doesn't come out the entire winter.  I've also had the Salad Salad this past week and hope that I'll be returning in a day or two.
awesome. OMG my friends and I have lived here forever. amazing value for money. cannot beat the service. great food, I highly recommend this place. fast and amazing prices. so give me one of those nice little places that is a little gre
restaurant/cheese joint, and without being overly strict I would have closed this restaurant. There are a few places around the neighborhood where I prefer to eat some pizza but it's a great option if you're looking to get your pizza to the plates for at least 10 minutes. Not the ideal pizza location. So, what I would go is to Boystown and enjoy dining at nothing but pizza. What I would do is go to St. Andrew's Pizza and make a reservation there. We will go back.
This is my 4th visit here and i like to eat here, try fried chicken wings, I love a dessert the staff gives you (love all the homemade vanilla hazelnut candy cakes, here)!  The food is excellent though.
Just a plus, if you're new to the SLOWA staff the service can be very fast, fast, and this can be great for fast food.  This is my favorite french fry spot!
They have really
restaurant menu and I'll be back here.
This place is an absolute gem.  I love the ribs!  My friend and I decided to go here for some extra comfort and a quiet time while we waited for lunch.  They also have a great beer selection.
Ok, so I recently saw this location go up there and not even try to eat at it twice. So this was my first time around here. Not sure what I was doing with my food.First of all I did a review of this place for that reviewer. This reviewer is talking about a recommendation for Riverview Bakery and I live just a block from this location. I had actually been to this location for brunch twice a year, and this place has been pretty good.  We had seated on the perfect row, and the experience at this place was almost impossible to choose from.  The atmosphere was lively and warm, and the staff was very friendly. We were also able to get quite a
restaurant, private and unsupervised. I will tell you that on my last trip in L.A. and downtown, we both got accustomed to being offered plates with dessert on the fly. Our waitress came in saying we had made some changes to our menu which she took on the sole purpose of figuring out how we'd celebrate. This restaurant has some good old fashioned East Coast chips, and can serve a variety of food in both South and West Coast, if need be. This place deserves credit for the skimpier portions of their chips, which make up an incredible dessert pairing. There is a reason they are so popular with Napolitan tourists. Plus, it doesn't hurt that their margaritas come with good side dishes, like the Miglo Platter, which is to die for.
After a disappointing 7/10 for beer, tasting our new maki from Pizza Hut, we have to admit, I felt rushed to purchase a beer from Pizza Hut.  I
restaurant. It's cute and cozy. We were seated early on a Tuesday night. Two of us went with food and dessert! BOOOGA. Yum. Excellent. The very dine in. $7-9, including the wine list and prepared appetizers (like kudos, gooseberries, and sea salt), was the entire experience. Quite frankly, considering it's their first out of town location and well worth the cost and time, I would not go back!
I love Hals and they do a really good job there.  This place is well worth a visit if you are a chef, but the menu needs a little bigger tip.  For my next time I would probably eat there.
First, obviously this place has cheap prices.  That is OK, they have less salt, lower chips, and you get to experience much lower prices for pretty much anything you can bring.  Now go to Arise if you're ever in town for
restaurant and fondue to be served, tastes the same as any other street bar, and I would get this place out of nowhere. The folks at Tacana should hang out on El Capitan.
I was not disappointed with any of the food, service and atmosphere. The beer menu was amazing - brilliant mix of styles with the freshest beers. I would still be going there after trying several more, and there are other places in the area. The food was delicious. The portions are smaller than a typical cafe, but don't forget, the amount of parking is generous so you can try out your meal at a restaurant if you want!
This is the first great space! Great music and atmosphere! Ive been to two Chicago establishments on home, and were greeted at the bar with enthusiastic but positive feedback.We sampled some Wild Iced Tea and La Plata, and had our Saujaki and Sushi with Four Horsemen. Our serveress was very helpful,
restaurant in places like Clary and the cute and very large parking lot on the Trolley. I wish they had turned away at least one white tourist from watching a dogfight. Also, everything was good. Nothing great in the store, but they went with great art. Only thing that was missing from the menu were the cardinals - instead of a paper list they kept a memorized list of all cards. The deep dish could have been stopped, but it was still good enough to enjoy the sushi here. If they'd done an extensive library search they could've scoured the menus for something that wasn't to beat down in quality, and just paired whatever on the menu. This place was all full of that stuff. - Summerboy
Great dining place. I went for the night of May 1st from Frisk, and it was close to the back entrance. Ordered the wings for dinner and the mac & cheese sandwich was on a par with my brain. What more
restaurant.
Is that cool?!?? What? Ok so yeah there are the two other options for the lunch menu. The first one is where you order the pork lasagna. I had my mother order mine and it was AMAZING. We got 3 of us and the meat that was served was simply incredible. We got the slice of lobster sauce and my mom always tells me that she doesn't like it because the tomato sauce is so good. She made my fingers spread and it was served with the lobster sauce, fries and breadcrumbs that are so very sweet. Everything in the meal was amazing. I am very anxious to try it this summer.
I have been sitting here all my life and dining here. I go every single time I go to Miami with my husband or sister because they order stuff off the menu and enjoy it in a very small space. When it's time for us to pack up the trash it is nice if you just take your buddies away to
restaurant at Mayion Laing and Brueche plucks 2 of the tuna sliders out of the left side to give you an extra bite.  Go to Mayion and find all kinds of spots so you can share!  You'll find a menu from sushi, from quality Chinese food to elegant Italian cocktails to eccentric cocktails.
Service: Good, everyone was pleased, very attentive, friendly, upbeat, attentive, and very much friendly.  Every single person that saw us walk out of the building was extremely fond of us and was very pleased with their response. My first trip to French Bakery in Chicago was quite a bit more crowded. It was busy, but I enjoyed the service and knowledgeable staff.  I am a burrito fan and would like to continue to use the French bakery as a local joint.
Seriously, am I going to eat here for dinner?  They do very well for meat, people tend to like mushrooms, but how about mushrooms and bacon
restaurant had two slices of sour cream, $6 for 7) and two appetizers with their crisp crust sauce. Try them together. I'm going to steal your heart.
The room was an improvement on the ambiance that goes with the remodeled Mozzarella factory. What you had while there was actually a good variety. The main dish that was missing in the weekend- yes it's still a lot as is on a more than one occasion.  The decor is great, the service was decent, the food was good.  The place was fresh and relaxing, the setting was nice and natural.  I also had to say that although there is a lobster roll that definitely gets it on the taste buds, it's not the best of the bunch.The atmosphere was a little cold, the service was poor and not as fun to go to than at our smaller wedding dining area. And honestly, as a bohemian bride, the job of making good wine selection depends
restaurant, kids come in to eat, and kids go out to eat. That's no big deal. This place is great and highly recommended!
My husband and I have been coming here since high school.  We all ordered pizza here and the pizza was killer.  After that, we ordered pizza and pizza was wonderful.  It was 2 cups of tortas and our server was very helpful and made sure we received the meat.  Overall, they made this place really great and the service was great.  I am sure many other people would try it.
This place is definitely on the edges of the IWAP/Spokeshop Strip. The dining experience was excellent.  The food was different from the rest of the place, but the wines were tasty.  Service was excellent, as always.  Your order was above and beyond what a quick table looks like, and we ordered the main course.  The cheese pudding pasta was excellent, as was the
restaurant. "     I came in the hotdog for lunch when my husband and I were leaving off wearing diapers. The food seemed over cooked and overall it had just left a bit empty.   We have recommended a few different burger places, but it is interesting to walk in for all of our sandwiches at this point, and not necessarily look for one.     In terms of service we would definitely recommend bringing a friend to get the entire menu before arriving.
I must admit that I've been to a brunch brunch place several times this year. I've tried it and found it, and always love it!  Very full, crowded place with pretty tables and chairs.  The rucksack fruit bowls are awesome and are full of filling!  Order a cheese scallion latte for dessert and a giant 8oz. Of course, the kids had the standard Chinese platter which is fabulous as well.  The staff is so friendly, and the
restaurant, food and drink.
I had the other night my boyfriend wanted a pizza because he didn't know a girl (she was boyfriend!) on Yelp and when we said hi, he told us that he was from toa fat person.
Our food at Maury is fantastic but they seem out of place on the menu. The sauce they served is incredible and the salt and pepper seasoning in the sauce (very sweet) was amazing. Although this restaurant has been near a 5 star Yelp, the staff needs to know that for more perfect service, better service to the food is still very important. The theme park is charming, the decor is great, the entertainment is awesome, and the food gets to the point where I felt like I was going to die. And by saving my wife the time and effort we spent getting there. Thanks!
Amazing Pizza! The service is great, the wait is a bit uncomfortable, and the pizza gets the higher grade and higher price because it
restaurant, food and drinks to keep the customers happy and upbeat and keep your order to within two business days. It's super-beaten up!
While most of the treats are great, the wait is very long. Everything on tables is packed. The great food is very varied (some can be difficult to find in the area) and most require preparation by a caterer for balance. After dinner, we wanted to know how to avoid this.  It didn't seem to be worth the wait.  I certainly would not go back here again.
Excellent food, decent service and service. I ordered a couple drinks, ceviche and fried chicken before having the boar mine. Really enjoyed the boar and brought them home.I will come back if anyone is interested in the steakhouse..tried everything but had no luck. I was very disappointed, because as I looked around my room I noticed a huge cat.  Its love n's house.

restaurant; food alone is not enough to put it on the list of goodness."Although Price may be creative (both her and Tom's) to write cookbooks, she lacks a written appreciation of culinary and culinary arts. She consistently attempts to lecture us to fix it by explaining everything in recipes in chunks (less than 10 lines), providing some detail on the food (for example, what's the "golden times" of Grilled Peas) but also engaging us in a discussion about that stuff at a minute or two in advance (especially with a green certificate for "compliments"). She is efficient in looking after customers (lo and behold! How in the world did Tom do his thing!) and then refuting herself completely in great detail, all while being totally dismissive of our tips. She's constantly patronizing customers with her red-white tiles and painting them to imitate them. She absolutely has no attention to detail on what she has given, and is in complete ignorance of the
restaurant and service.  I love the extensive menu that is enrapturing.  We love the homemade toast that you order, the toppings you buy and the fruit you taste.  It's a must try!
I have been going to Arruda in the neighborhood for about 6 years now.  The atmosphere and general atmosphere is always fresh and clean.  Also, the menu offers a wide variety of different dishes and is very generous.  The outdoor patio offers a pleasant atmosphere and a great atmosphere for dining out.  I am also not overly picky about my friends or family.  Great appetizers and wine.
I had the Egg rolls as a birthday gift last Sunday and loved it, but not now that I am vegan.  When they brought us that little crusty bread, and the egg roll devoured our supper, we did NOT order it!  What was the beef and the chicken stuffed with the white cheese?  But I kept thinking
restaurant has become a seasonal gem in my neighborhood.  Our chefs and servers are knowledgeable and friendly!
I just came back from a private dinner with a friend. After asking the waitress for table number, she responded and wanted to give us a handle on what the bill was. I didn't feel like giving it to her and came away feeling stupid when I had a different bill for $15 than I did for the waitress. Although I felt she had apologized or thought I was crazy, she answered by saying she was very helpful. The last waitress called, and she pointed out that we were speaking out about the restaurant and not the service. We weren't so much annoyed with the waitress being overly complimentary about our experience, as we were annoyed by the behavior of the person who called.  I'm sure I would come back to this restaurant in a heartbeat if there were any real changes to the behavior of the whole business that did not appear to bother the waitress.
Simply Whoppers
restaurant in a nice location for a treat. I recommend going.
Good food and not too-atmosphere..The food was ok...maybe too good..but the pizza was mediocre....they must have taken advantage of the waitstaff.I'll be back
High quality food, great atmosphere with exceptional service.  Good place for any party.
Went here on a Valentine's Day to celebrate his birthday.. Went back and just for a gift!! I love it so much!Very casual, not crowded, friendly staff.Gardens and outlets to get ready for many trips....we all sat out the restaurant!!! For a place that is quiet and friendly......I recommend playing a game of pretend like nothing has ever happened before!!!
GREATEST PLACE EVER!!!!!!!! On Monday night, I went with my great grandparents, friends and fiance.  Will be going back to my grandparents soon.  This place was much better than I imagined it was. All
restaurant. A friend came over to the place and immediately came with her and asked if I had dinner ready. She promptly declined. She said it was a small town restaurant and that she had heard nothing of the restaurant, until her hostess (who told her her I was so eager for her service) arrived and apologized. I asked if we could speak with her on a phone. She did it so quickly that we were left with almost no other option. Upon closer inspection we could tell that she was all about catering, asking all the time and paying. We thought we'd be had in a Mexican restaurant, and agreed that she was absolutely correct. The business was booming. We felt lucky to have a friendly hostess in town to keep us from being let down by the waitstaff. In any event we decided to wait by line and waited for the same establishment until they open. So we waited by line for more than 5 hours, feeling not too bad. While waiting for their
restaurant minimum for small plates, salsas, and bread. We have often been disappointed by their lack of waiter service or quality service during some portions, but rather than trying to make reservations for small plates and aftery gnarly were we supposed to order a line on our own the line between two different tables was miles away. The food was too for the large portions and their otherwise fabulous service, which for once exceeded expectations.The ROV worked great, and although there was not another wait at the bus stop in Chicago, there were very few downtown spots that could have made us a couple of minutes better without the lunch specials.
Great in its own way, overall a great place for a beer or a bill. The job doesn't feel so bad, and the wines are all exactly as expected. If you have at least 4 people with you then you've come to the right place. Also I'd definetely not recommend going here if they do better.
Great
restaurant.  This is a deejay.I agree that it could be better, but  there is no way I would be recommending this place to any kind of client. You really want that, but it takes a lot to know what you need to order at this restaurant.  I'm not sure about the service, but I would only give it 3 stars.  For pizza, we would highly suggest throwing an order of pizza over the bar, or plunk down a few bucks to open the kitchen window.
This place is like missing out on something here. It is really nice and authentic food. Fresh place to dine, learn and go. Yummmmm. So, if you know anyone with a girlfriend or family member or is asking for something fresh and delicious, what better place to have a girlfriend night out than Pad Thai Restaurant.   Those egg dishes are always great. Try it out. 
The food at Parkland isn't my favorite
restaurant... Another great place for dessert and a must for those looking for a nice place to eat and hang out.
If you're looking to feel inside in a weird, intimate little tower, give this place a try. I guess it's one of my favorite places to eat with the entire party. For what it's worth, the food is fantastic, there are so many ways to taste their food, and the atmosphere is inviting.
We've been here a lot, and we had the amazing wine list.  The wines were fantastic.  They were at insane prices.  All of our first drinks were double finished and quite tasty.  I usually wait 45 minutes to get my order, and our server is a real nice guy.  He comes out with a great wine list he shared with us!  One thing to note: the wine list doesn't have tables that stand at all.  We had the Tidal juice/juice combo.  It was ok
restaurant Sushi I paid $100 for and I can't find a better place to eat than it!  Much better than Sushi.
This place reminds me of the real Korean like Cirozza, such as it was before it opened. Especially when you're dining out and seeing so many so beautiful Korean cooks on demand. Come down and dine here for authentic food.
Ok the staff was always very nice, but when I wanted to review they were always cool. Not the most helpful man. Why?  Despite being the best sushi in Chicago I could make reservations at the main menu. Not everyone has access to sushi, so if you want to order reservations I would only recommend ordering from the comfort zone where you can say...it is Korean sushi/chickin, not Asian sushi.  Actually this review wouldn't be necessary, but enough for everyone to enjoy!
The food was bland. Normally, a delish place but on Chicago street they have been
restaurant). My guinea pig was probably because I had to ask for it twice; however, his parents and I kept talking and asked for food. He told us to get a side of sour cream on the side with a slight sauce and a mousse of cedar vinegar. It was too bitter, so we came away with a polite refund. The Mexican restaurant was very neat and secluded. I liked the warm atmosphere. There was a freshness that was extremely refreshing, for sure.
I have been coming here for over 5 years now, and really enjoyed it. The service was great, and the whole restaurant was put together to impress your birthday. This restaurant was always a pleasure, and it would go down as one of my favorite places. (Also, check out the mural outside)Check out the BBQ sauce: many people had told me the food was great, but we all ended up taking the wrong friends for dinner. Now I will have to try it.

restaurant. I'm always surprised to find restaurants like this in the city. They always have excellent prices and accommodating staff. It was enjoyable working on my dishes.  Overall this was a great experience and I will definitely go back and try it again!
Celtic Bakery offers a wide variety of delicacies!  Most are the same, but with some, they need work.   Bread and pastries must be fresh, but it's hot so they don't go out of their way to only keep the hot buns fresh (who wouldn't like a hot buns dipped in the sauce?)
My grandma and I have been to Top Hill and knows exactly what is going on.  The food is tasty and we can't wait to go back.  I really enjoy this restaurant.  Their  gi mio is phenomenal.  The long line is very low so we don't end up checking their lot for dessert.  The water temperature is always below
restaurant class in the park. You will not be disappointed.
Coutus are outstanding!  We had the Double Cake and it was delicious!  The duck fat muffin is great too!  I suggest trying the lasagna dip for breakfast or dinner and we both agreed with the concept.  Very delicious.
This place is definately a must try for all the kids.  Their pork side and bacon are one of my favorite foods.  The prices are reasonable (maybe 6 dollars for a 20 pound sandwich at cost.  And their gravy is a great product at 6 bucks or less).  If you are looking to pay for a more affordable meal go here.  I have a lot of friends who are here and this place is still top notch.
Been here once for lunch and it was amazing!  The price is great!  The staff was friendly and helpful while they were looking over the menu and preparing food and waiting for it to be ordered.
restaurant looks amazing as well as having an amazing drink. I ordered the avocados macaroni and cheese, and it was not a big deal. I ordered some sliced chard (salsa cheese was great) and some rebeccos to eat, and something totally fresh. I did like the cut potatoes as well and the steak was fantastic. It was my first time getting sausage from this restaurant, as I was always fresh and flavorful. Definitely worth the trip to Chicago for a fall or winter picnic.
I've been a big fan of this restaurant since I've been living in Chicago, and while its not as small as there are restaurants open within Chicago I did definitely find a reservation before heading out for a long, empty and crowded date.  Not only was the food, staff, a little bit overwhelming but it was extremely attentive, and the food was pretty good. We had all the fare and I would highly recommend this place if you're in Chicago, which
restaurant, wine pairing, cheesesteak and beer selection.We have been in Chicago for over 5 years and the experience has been worth the trip. We have several star reviews and everyone has loved our food. Our server Chris was kind enough to give us some tips on what we were expecting. We asked him if we could try a dinner of two, and he kindly obliged. We will definitely be back again! If you are coming from inside the area and want something totally different than Chicago City Market, I suggest trying McDonald's and Whole Foods.
Excellent pizza this was the only pizza place I went to this month. They've eaten in plenty of places, with the exception of Guacamole and a deep dish joint: many places like that. However, with the popularity and popularity of specialty pizzas like Sizzling Duck Cheese and Carpaccio Pizza, their gluten free offerings are often filled with crusts and flavors that could go on and off with time. 
restaurant and hummus. They also have great vegan burgers,  and a recent visit to Tote Bay brought me back to try their sit down raksa, a small plate of lentils with coffee.  I am addicted to vegan food.  I won't go back but I know if I order a steaksa and the cabbage soup there will come.
Well it is done, we got my order a little bit late and could have done better!  Actually, I think they were joking.
This is where I found out I'm allergic. I never took the issue of allergic foods, but this place really seems to have a terrible reputation and apologizes for anything people complain about. One thing is for certain this place must be tough to beat and you will find vegan friendly people here.
Awesome bar!
Quick food. I have ordered a lot of them lately. One of the best I have tried - Madras Al Salet Pecan salad
restaurant is an understatement. As we visited we discovered many more vegan restaurants. An amazing side dish with Asian vegetables and pizza was the best I've had. Our server Karmen did an outstanding job in making sure we stayed happy and the atmosphere was wonderful. We will definitely be back for more.
I haven't been able to find good Chinese food in the neighborhood before and couldn't wait to try it. I've done a few reviews here and there but don't know anything better. I had the Falafel and Chop Chicken and it was pretty good but not great! Not to mention that I had the Diwali Salad with chopped green chilli and a black bean salad and my side of beef was short-chicken with omelet and carrots. I couldn't say enough about the restaurant. I would highly recommend this place and try it again.
I tried Friday night New York Pizza.  It was delicious.  I had a large order of the su
restaurant."
Meat was bland, most of the dipping sauces came from lettuce, chicken and a fried potato that was written "my favorite." The chicken was overcooked and unfulfilling. A few of the burgers were tough enough that I could barely enjoy my meal. You were glad you had a big plate of expensive steak and for what it worth it was a real disappointment.There is absolutely no value in having $100+ options for your meal! Otherwise, go over to India during your visit and get ready for a terrible tasting meal!
Wonderful brunch spot! This place is big, it's large, it's clean, it has a very little music, and some little sign with the name on it.  Yes, a little loud.  So I went to this place for lunch.  To say it's a great place to eat a great meal is an understatement.  So I went with a group of five and were seated about 5-10 minutes early
restaurant). From their humble beginnings, to the nuggets of marinated goat butter, this is a classic culinary meal. The ambiance is a hit and great combination of spirited and loud in a relaxed atmosphere.  They serve elegant Mediterranean-inspired risotto, ahiachi braised steak, chocolate cups of miso paste, and a selection of antipasto chocolate.
Having lived in my own neighborhood for a little over 10 years, I can't help but admire this place.  The food is superb.  The portions are absolutely enormous and the servers are very friendly.  The chicken-fried pan-fried pork buns have a very happy and tender flavor.  The dessert dishes are just above average!  What a wonderful addition to the menu.  I wish I could stay here for dinner with the barbequets, though.
I've been following this place for a few years now.  It has a fairly fresh and well packed menu.  It
restaurant, affordable, authentic.
I had the dish (chopped garlic caprese with tomato) in a bite sized slice (it didn't belong on the menu), and it was SUPER good. Had a lot of our desserts. Oh and those were vegetables!! Fantastic of the duck with beef.
I can't wait to go back.  Maybe not a biggie, but this place is worth your time and will forever in your hearts go here.
My friend and I come here every once in awhile, the menu features the finest food of all time in the bargain for the 5 dollars, the service of an extremely nice staff. The desserts you get are a must get in many an office, as many a office.
I know the opening of this restaurant was all the rage just a few months ago.  The BEST Sandwich I ever had on a busy Saturday night was my meat platter.  Then, something bad happened!  That did NOT happen, so
restaurant, we had the pick of some of the finest chocolate here on Broadway.   I am told it is the best chocolate I have had in Chicago.  Like The Absurd, it is in exquisite stillness and perfect in its simplicity.  It is unusual for Chicago to offer such a deep dish to a few dozen people, however my friend and I enjoyed the result.  We were not disappointed and will be back for more.
We went there to sit down for lunch on the beautiful Diner stand. Our lunch menu was a little too half-fat for us, but we came up with an entree of my favorite and by far our favorite. We came with appetizers that were incredibly tasty.  The margaritas were exquisite, and the onion sticki mushrooms were very tender and comforting.  Our time together was amazing. I could have not gotten much better.  We will definitely be going back to this restaurant soon.
great decor, great owner
restaurant, we got the outstanding meal. The staff was very friendly. We went in immediately and talked with the chef there, who was good to me about his food. I was glad that we were seated by the front of the restaurant. The food was amazing! The bread was a bit over cooked - I could only find 3 slices to go, but the portions were even more generous. My son and I came for lunch for lunch (though he was able to eat off their servers) and were seated by the back door. I haven't been back here since....the place is not very good.
Most exquisite food ever!!My main concern was at Sweet Sur's. If you're looking for a flavorful food, it probably comes in at around $7.50 for the prix fixe selection, depending on the year-round beer selection, the slightly bland atmosphere, and the wait-time. As a half-time wait, the appetizer was insanely good. As
restaurant), but if you're looking for a good place to eat, get a good chair. Although I knew nothing of the type of food offered by the Obel bobo tables, I loved how it seemed to be completely edible (not to mention the milk that I soaked in). I think that the extra nectar adds to the meal. Though I didn't really enjoy them with the rest of the food, it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. My only complaint is that the place is rather tough to put up with at times, especially when you're out-of-town, so you may feel it is easier to talk to your local waitress (though that doesn't seem to be how the Obel bar does at other restaurants). I would definitely recommend the dining experience in this neighborhood, but if you can't get a seat close enough, just keep going.
Giant flashpoint in the city.    Highly recommended for brunch, family meals, and special
restaurant at 508 Broadway & Franklin St and $75 beer
The wait was very reasonable. Having been a resident in Ann Arbor from 1992 to 2009, I have known a lot about this restaurant and the reputation, we gave it a try and then continued to work with the place to expand our list of offers. The food was excellent; fish & chipotle chicken was a must try and was the only downfall. And it was delicious! The fries were amazing! The prices were fair, but the food was always the same. I should like to top it off with the date night specials as well. Prices were very reasonable as well and by the way, because I live in Gold Coast, the food was not just fair, I think it was well seasoned.
Every time I go to Bikini I'll try to experience something different!  Having been there a couple times now and we LOVE it.  It's still packed, but everything that I have tried, more than any
restaurant that we both loved and saw come out the other day.  We finally caught up with one of our partner once we were in the cafeteria to discuss how much it was like working with another chef or, more specifically, it was difficult at first, but finally, with 3 months to go, we'd eventually decide that this was not a very appealing option.  While the food quality was better than what we had in the past, with a minimum of going through the butchery, and it is a restaurant that focuses on organic, we do not know how the dressing would taste to our next chef, and we aren't sure what specialty beef dishes we would choose.  To top it off, the ambiance of the restaurant is pleasant, spacious, and well worth the visit if you're looking for something a little more intimate than a perch next to your ex.
Best Italian Italian Restaurant in Lincoln Park.Went here twice.Went for a 4.5 out
restaurant, dessert/infusion and appetizer dinner all come to just $5 for my husband's meal and is a bargain for over 2 people, both of whom went there alone. Excellent salad bar, well spread over generous portions of beer to add depth and flavor. I can't find the menu info on the website, but I'll be back.
My husband and I stayed at Sheets for awhile and decided to go to 10K for fun. The experience was wonderful and the food was especially delicious. The crew was real helpful, they were kind and friendly. We'd recommend the bar with the only downside being the server was kinda slow but attentive. Thanks Chef and Drink3D!
Vast, dirty, and very bland. The focus is on the last and certainly not just the "true" weirdness of food (about the substance of that particular kitchen). It's what you see in the "bread dough" - meat, cheese, bone marrow, and all
restaurant took too long to be helpful to restaurant staff... but our server showed us how to make sandwiches, and we made absolutely nothing. Needless to say, we had another one that took over an hour to finish... as we expected to wait right away. Fortunately for us we can now again confirm that we have received service for the coming week, as we only know of the hours we will be able to enjoy our meal without slacking off here. You can order at any time on and you will receive a scorecard/card of your favorite wines, but I feel that we will most likely be waiting about 6 hours for everything to begin to feel ready. Our friends from the airport were able to make another surprise reservation at 2:30pm, so we didn't have to wait that long to enjoy our food. For those that are still wanting to be surprised by the huge portions, or want to try even more options, then look no further than the Shrimp Alfredo (or
restaurant" (where it would have been wonderful if the chef wanted to share it with me).  But it wasn't the best service by far.  It was my favorite restaurant to attend.   They had several great crepes on the buffet and when I asked if the food was good I said "yes"!   While other nearby restaurants offer decent sauces and seafood I always felt that they should do better.  It was pleasant to see the food selection reflected with a good menu.  Overall, I highly recommend the Chicinx seat provided by Beare Artagnan, the food is excellent and there is something that gets done!  At $5 a person and free of charge, it's not enough to keep you on the duck menu for long.
The food was very good and everything else was decent. I was worried about the food and not the food. The waitress provided warm, warm, comforting- fresh, clean. We ordered special that was not traditional
restaurant, but if I lived in Yeller, I would go for that.  They did run the restaurant on the Duck Creek entrance and the parking lot next to it when they would charge entrance fee.  It was a pricey night, but I am a big fan of dining in main courses.  If you're in town, you could go to Yeller to try many of the restaurants on the north side of town (and stay warm there!).  Yeller's wings were pretty good too, but it was full (they were with empanadas, sushi on top of it) so I guess you could go if you were always hungry for appetizers.
Absolutely loved it! Everything was delicious. The server is so helpful. She's constantly checking on their memory and does a great job. We did say hi and we took our dinner back at 3:30. We had 5 people and 2 of them were expecting a cocktail.  After the music played it was great
restaurant with a diverse selection of restaurant options to choose from. The organic salad bar is large enough to hold up to the hustle and bustle and once again, the wide table seats the food on a touch of late. And the jukebox is as perfect as they come. We stayed with partner Alfredo and beamed at our waitress afterwards. She had the right courage and the meat right down to the bone to do the right thing at work. It was nice to have a nice place to sit. It had the owner running the restaurant's menu. Their food was perfect, and we liked their taste. They truly belong in Manhattan.
This place has the best sushi in the city, and the one thing I like most about it are the ingredients. The service is smooth and friendly, and the delivery is fast and painless. Their wine list is extremely comprehensive. If you enjoy homemade dumplings with crab shank then you'll find the Veggie Chicken collection very
restaurant and waitress rather generously.  Also a great place for kids (just on occasion) as well. Will leave them wanting more.  Finally, waiting times are non-existent when we work there.  Can't get enough of it.
Delicious food and amazing service, and absolutely top class. Big props for Yoo and Co. from their top notch food-from desserts and liquors.  We went this summer with three friends and we were just shocked at how beautiful the food was.  Staff was attentive and our recommendations were excellent.  Plus, they were always welcoming and friendly.
Some food was okay, and some food was weird, but OK. I wanted to try a better ribeye dish because it was delicious. I ordered the Cali & Pepper Hot Potato Curry and it didn't taste right...absolutely impossible to find consistent beef. I have several other complaints on their website:It was actually packed full and my daughter wanted to eat her mom's
restaurant, and fish and chips. The food and service are alright but the steakhouse is NOT in the best possible state of Wellness.It's almost hard to walk around the bar and NOT have a conversation with a very nice person (no offense Paul. He is a MUCH better service animal.) Most likely, the owner did just that, he has been spouting racist or anti-social ignorant tirades, since 1990. Have a look at the picture to see some pretty disgusting detail. As far as I can tell, most of his actions were contained within the walls of the bar. Do not contact him if you are able to for no reason.This is another reason I leave this place. My girlfriend and I were so impressed by the food and service that I could see the owner and the owner himself practically the entire time. I would not want to see another random restaurant like this every time. My friend has long lived in Chicago so she and I were not very impressed,
restaurant for, wow. I can't say enough that I have had over the last few months!  Please add a sausages or gratio, we have a very large selection!  For the price of the door top, the breakfast was good.  The fish was very tender and well seasoned, while the mussels were juicy and sweet.  I loved the decor, though it may be the exception, not the rule.  Some other small items, aside from the breakfast, were quite well worth the check.  The wine list was excellent (maybe because they enjoy it more?) and a recommended bottle opener was the leftovers of their wine pairing, which were delicious.
I have lived in Medford for more than 5 years and have been in a great group of restaurants. The food is good and affordable. the ambiance is nice and spacious but not overly loud in the restaurant.  Will definitely return.
Best food I've had here in the city.
restaurant.  He managed to take the wrong tourist home a month ago after returning from Buffalo in a T-shirt, jeans, and boots that stated, "we're here for Ricky Owens."My family was shocked. He was supposedly running the Michigan stand at the time.The tour guide was helping him with food and was coming at us from across the street to assist. We asked him if Ricky had brought this stuff and he was totally shocked.My mother seemed to take his idea. He seemed to assume we were eating food he had left at home. I was miffed that there were people in the crowd trying to deal with us.I felt like Ricky was a business man trying to avoid paying his employees for treating us well. When we asked if we wanted to take the reservation, he ignored us and refused to go to the line. He had to arrive after we showed up to get our drink because we were covered for five more hours. When he came back at the
restaurant. Delicious, fresh, flaky, and delicious! In a sense, it is our favorite combination of deserts!
What else could I say about Italian food, taste, and atmosphere? The staff is friendly and open to your tastes, although at times it can be rather hot, and on one occasion, the outdoor patio would blow you away. In fact, it was so yummy on each occasion that I was wanting to get the back patio behind me to keep all the heat and moisture from falling out. So it is a must go for all Italian restaurants in the city!
Ordered a complimentary cheese mousse for my husband for dinner on Thursday, and when he came home he couldn't wait to try it. We ordered our pizza hot, and it was way over-hyped. No, we didn't just enjoy the great pizza, they did it very pleasantly and I'd never had the urge to leave.
I have been eating here twice now. First
restaurant, meals, dessert, etc. I wonder if their management put the dishes in the first two registers. I think it was standard for somebody to be so obsessed with eating dishes like that to move the food completely outside of the restaurant, since the eating of the dishes was always there.I want to make that comment right now.
Meals are here for the purpose of all those same things. At this very moment, another neighborhood, bigger and better than my own, is racking up orders from weirdo review sites and making us guzzling beers on some roadside. We've ordered that many bottles of wine every two hours, and ate everything, but then were chowing down on empty air. One night, we sat at our table and one of our coworkers brought a new bottle of wine we found so fresh and awesome, like, "What's in it?" I got so hungry I went to the bus stop, and my coworker checked in with us to find
restaurant delivery service, same night a cashier tells me they're a Greek place.
My friend and I were here for dinner last night and this place was actually awesome.  It's 5:30 because its on a corner of Chicago Avenue and you get into the cuban with a cane and parking for $6/person.  The service is exceptional.  Plus, you get the incredible $100 bus fare.  My favorite thing about this place is that there are plenty of different types of sushi and i've never had a bad one in Chicago.  What is particularly fun is the purchase of an even bigger bag, since for anyone who feels sluggish, they can go to this place for the food.  If you don't know any better than this, read the reviews of other places I've been to.  And don't skip to another place, you're in for a very special experience!
Please consider putting up with everyone who has called in to say something
restaurant at McDonald's. Although the food quality, consistency and price are great, the experience with other people at the table was a mixed bag. Service was disappointing and overall, the server really let people down. Although the place was well attended, none of the requests were answered (I mean really? The reservations were not made at all, at least not during the meal.) With that said, the food quality at the table is great. Service was also excellent. I really don't think I would go back to this place again if it wasn't for everyone. (Also, since I cannot identify which restaurant they are from, it was difficult to get good service in some places.)
I come here to enjoy what I love. We started off by grabbing a drink and a table and were promptly seated. The restaurant was so welcoming, and they serve some of the best cocktails I have had in Chicago and weren't afraid to get together with us to celebrate our anniversary.  The service
restaurant": We ordered a steamed entree of california, amazing flavor, we loved it. The service was great!  There was friendly customer service at every stop.  It was definitely a place for people to order, if only for a quick bite.
Good eat on a short weekend.  My staff is always good and helpful.  The food is actually quite good!  The options are obvious.  They have  mozzarella sunda salad, mushrooms, crispy marinated cheeses and all things good.
From the cutting edge of Italian food you can walk away with a headache.If you're looking for a comfortable meal, come to this fast and cheap joint. Each one is packed full of good food, everything is packed full of great flavors, and they have a foodie stand with life-size items.From all that food, just miss the place for this small place!
I am enjoying the restaurant at DPM.   The
restaurant there is also exceptional chorizo marinara sauce, very flavorful and strong. But I would definitely recommend the VIOLETIC BBQ!(sorry, it's won't happen again..)
Great dining experience by far. I love.   Delivery is fast.  Staff and food itself has always been good.  The burger joint is very of an upgrade from the other Texas joints on the list, which are what makes this restaurant so good.
My only complaint is my server is overrated.  When our server handed me a salad for $4 each, I was shocked to realize I paid twice and then again for the same lunch item.  Her decisions to put a true flower on each salad on the counter that was tamales just kept me from going back.  They have been so awesome for so many years.  I would suggest a vegetarian dinner at home, but I think the salads are much better.
Worst dog ever!!!!  I
restaurant, business establishments are not as good as others. A little bad seating and lack of adequate seating for the many that are on tables. Overall, this location was well worth a look.
"five stars on Yelp" seems like a big deal because the restaurant is BYOB.  If you are a deviant animal eater you could very easily make reservations for only a small group.  But this place is kind of a twist on sushi.  One of my favorite spots for deviant birds is their aratou like flavor paste.  I had the heaven squid which was fab.  I don't think I have ever had so much sushi so I figured it would be a great place to give it a try.  But its been so long since I've tried it.  I have never had any sort of taste issue or fatty in my salad bar.  Its a bit oily as well, but its always delicious.  I dont think its too expensive and I
restaurant is very satisfying and their salad menu is very delicious! The garlic fish with crab that was packaged in a drawer had the perfect amount of texture, flavor and texture. I love this place. The dipping sauces were incredible! I am a huge fan of the "Slow Dan" shrimp on their jalapenos. It was smooth, creamy and salty. Their friendly bartender was awesome. I really love this restaurant so much!! The shrimp are superb - best in town and well prepared. The shrimp are fresh. Their specialty sauces are always satisfying!
Good food. Has a ton of options!
Jukebox is by far my favorite sandwich in all of Texas! We had three we tried - excellent. It was all good but we ordered a few more. Now, it may seem like our favorite place, but in fact, it is just another great sandwich that we could enjoy ourselves at. They even have a doggie plate with a tuna. It's pretty good and gets
restaurant and food at the end of my table. I loved the habanero cheese on top. I would definitely recommend this place if you can't beat Brazilian style.
A review on Yelp last year was that's the end of a restaurant, they want to move away from home.  So if the people upstairs are back, this may be the best place to go after that state.  They have nice conversations but they ignore it when they try to make it sound like a joke.  Anyway, when the owner is sitting down, he pretends to be a VIP, and then he's a guy who really shouldn't be doing that.  When people are walking in the door, his first conversation after they walk in is 'Oh we like Domingo Frontera and the cheese we gave you is just Gino's'  Yeah, that doesn't really work out here, but it worked for me.I'm not a fan of the hipsters being amb

Some have asked me if it is possible to write for Indian food, i don't think i should say that i don't want to run out of Indian food
I have been to several cities of China and how I am going to eat it will never change unless I come to Chicago. And, the food is much better then most places I've come to.   The authentic meat is really good, the spice is good, and the pork tenderloin is excellent too.  It's kind of like Honey Wine.  I hate having to explain a dish to someone else after seeing a Vietnamese restaurant owner make a move on their food because he really knows how to make them a long-awaited steakhouse at a Sino-Indian restaurant that everyone lives across the street and loves to eat at.  I don't know what has happened in Chicago that won't be repeated in my lifetime or what I'm going to forget.  But, it is my favorite Indian
restaurant, service and most importantly, our food. We've gotten plenty of rave reviews for our spicy potato sausage with mushroom broth, some of our favorites for their shrimp and duck mix. The tacos came to be served in tortilla form. Service was excellent and the selection of fresh fruit and vegetables that greeted us was incredible. The staff didn't get along so well but their casual menu was always filled with good food.The steak dinner was outstanding with the truffle soup that we were craving. All the sauces and service are the same, but there were some slight ones that we had to revise as our appetizers for a more distinctive dish. We had a couple of plates of swiss sprigs which were flavorful and the portions were small. At the end, the meat was great. The bone and wine were delicious but the rib of beef that we got was a good tasting take on smoked albacore which was outstanding.Overall, we will be back for sure. We

My sister loves to like that restaurant and so do I.  I definitely recommend walking up a busy street or giving a drink!  I never seem to mind going through a crowd, but this is more like a small pub bar.  Each minute or so I have less energy to take care of the business.  People know that I'm there to help the business and so I do enjoy going.  It's really good atmosphere and the food is superb.  If you are in town don't mind waiting a long time.  All that depends on what you decide to take home.  It's a cool neighborhood.
Very busy but looks really busy. Prices are reasonable, just some convenience fee place and didn't cost much. SERVICE and decor are amazing.
This place is great.  I will definetly be returning!
Lots of food and wine, plus a sizzling but mellow atmosphere.Best Western experience yet!
I love L
restaurant will have the largest selection of Mexican food at its 45 tables. We will tell you that we will NEVER again serve this meal and that if you want to go to this restaurant, you are NOT going to want it.
Awesome ambiance and service. Good ambience to get a taste of the soulful, interesting history of Chicagoland.
Best beer in Chicago. Very tasty and very good beer selection, and yet the most popular selection of beer in Chicago. Can't wait to see what's next.
Fantastic fun place. It's a little rush-to-dinner place, but at least you get a chance to see some of the great beers. Bar A & B at Bart's is fantastic - come in, take a look! The perfect place for a great date. I got about 6 people for my great-grandson's birthday party. We were seated across from the park, which gives your idea of what to expect.  We

Saviness: Service is of a high standard.  Although its somewhat expensive to pay to find a reasonable establishment,it's worth it!My favorite dishes are: Thai braised chicken, quail oil sauces, quail soup, etc.  Prices are low, but if you'd like a beer, it's okay. I like one of the craft beers I've been to: Hopleaf.  I've been to a lot of bars and restaurants over the years and always got the same thing: amazing service, not super fancy.I recommend staying in the car for the workday, my friend and I went for dinner at the Mexican spot.  I wanted to share the experience with my coworkers, who tend to be Asian, Asian, Chinese and vegetarian.One last item: Don't make your way to the restroom!This is the best place in my city for condiments and options.  If you can't make it to
restaurant staff working around the corner or at the fire place.  Service was awful from the second we got there and no apology!  Service then got jammed from there and after trying so many times I can't even say that it was fun.  People seemed to give us a bad time and even though we told them to call our reservations they all back us.  My favorite food combo is ricotta margarita.  It's usually the ricotta margarita they think we are trying and the crepes are so good!!!
The only thing I can think of to say is they keep getting in the way of their food, and over the years the doors to catch the bus to give their food away (and walk up to the parking spot, away from our parents' or girlfriends').  My neighborhood does have foodies, but I have to say that they just suck.  If you'd been there, you'll find that EVERYTHING SUCKS!!!  It
restaurant, we ordered three of the six sandwiches on the menu and it was a little over $1.00 on the spot.  Then, came the mess of low prices, things got a bit cluttered and we ordered only two things that we didn't get at all.  The second one was salad on the dessert table, on a large roll and sat on the side of the table for a couple of hours!  We both laughed out loud at the price (if you haven't checked to see what they charge us, these prices are beyond outrageous!)  I was also surprised at the waitstaff for an hour (I am from Chicago).  Had the proper fare and checked into our room before getting in (they just closed the doors), we were not served as prepared as we hoped we would be.  Sorry for the upset, all is well with the diners and good food!
We tried the heart and soul food tasting room for a large dinner and it had
restaurant. Normally we love it. I love the Tea Lounge atmosphere and the new location is just so close to the oldie friend. The fish does change a lot of time for us and we always get the local food to fill the place.
I am from Chicago and our waitress frequently comes across as a bit typecast, bceeol so bland and lacking a good dish. We tried their BF Whitefish Mozzarella for a pastries. And that meant we had to make reservations and got a 50$ reservation only after much process. However, with a price point of $19 each on most my very desired order we really wanted the Whitefish. Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of their wine list and their new location.I am glad that staff has looked at this place several times.  The good thing about this place is that if you know what you are getting, you can usually order anywhere.
Not too close to the lounge - but don
restaurant. Service was positive and always attentive to everything that was going on. My server had to remind me how important he was to me and my home party at the time. We came to the table late and had a huge party comprised of our girlfriends and boyfriend.  We were not disappointed at all with the food however; one of our favorites had were some fig sauce and orange juice.  My entire visit to the dining room was with a healthy dose of wine and beer.  The food was fine but not everyone eats in a very friendly manner. Overall, I was very impressed with the food and service.For lunch we had a romantic meal with some people and they were extremely friendly and helpful.  They did offer drinks and appetizers and if we didn't want the champagne like everyone else that we had the hot chocolate appetizer with maple syrup.  It was extremely good and our bill was about $9.50 per person.  Overall I am happy with my experience!
restaurant for the beer lovers in Oakland and San Francisco.
I'm so happy to be back for dinner tonight. Just getting in my car was great and my favorite part of the whole experience. I loved the food too! Our waitress was great but they didn't take up all the space. One waiter thought he was being rude and he didn't like the food! After dinner I forgot where my book was and found it was in a three way lunchroom and messin' under a heavy parking lot. Food was just ok I ended up craving the only fish that I have EVER eaten! However, I enjoyed the dipping sauce that came with the food and what followed! And the Italian sausage and other breads were all outstanding!!
They don't usually sit around having a full brunch but something made a visit to this place rad. Food was alright but the service was actually nice. The food was really good but I didn't like that the name of the restaurant and customer wasnt
restaurant. No one saw them or knows what they are but no one else, no one and it's a Chicago restaurant so I thought it was just a joke, till I found out about this terrible restaurant and lived here in hopes of them stopping by.
A little too late! Gonna be going back soon! Fucking retarded.....I couldn't get it going! Im afraid to try all their new dishes out. I'm sorry if I was told that the servers were glum and thought I'd just drop them off.
Went to visit Chicago several years ago and  their Yelp page was up for the wait.  I had a very bad experience that took us out of the area and I was there at 9:30pm after 6:45pm.  They had a server that was mad because he was getting paid and he ended up getting the cash he was paid on the night of the dinner.  I asked the server why he was getting cash, and
restaurant, etc. I would like to bring that much attention to the pastry and pastry products instead. Good enough stuff, great prices and ambience.
I love the soda fountain. If I ever move into any hot dog bar in Detroit, I can only imagine how loud it is. I've never experienced a better place to go than to the Chinese Restaurant in Plainfield. The Chinese owner is extremely knowledgeable and professional. The fries are rich and creamy, the fruit is warm and sweet, the desserts are crisp and tasty. This restaurant is the perfect place for a date, party or a day off, just because they offer great food.
I love this place, that is the entire thing. I have been to a couple of Spring harvest festivals here before and love the soup they have there!
Hands down my favorite high end restaurant in LA, but they take it too far for the price.  It's like jalapeno (If you're into pepper jack
restaurant, remodeling and the service has been excellent, but, it's not needed to at this point. I love everything that we see at the stargazing spot, as well as the atmosphere and features of a table or bed of 2. (ok, maybe a little noisy) This place is not terrible either, but in my humble opinion, it's not worth spending money on.
Really good food and really good pizza, but more flavorful than Rick's.  All the service was excellent and the wine list was simply so good you didn't have to experience it.  Great location and spectacular food.
Nice spot, but not as good as those in or around town.  I went to this restaurant for myself, with only a few other friends, and we had to do a little extra work (we only had to spend a few minutes) to get the menu/rework.  For those who like to wait until late, this might be the spot for
restaurant.
If you like cheese, but prefer a little soup here, try Maitre d'Andalus. I eat this while I watch a set of guys go about playing with a bottle of tequila and a single Belgian to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his Chicago Fire's opening in May 1853. The Don Chevigny was just on the menu, but I like when it was something more fresh, just weird and slow. You'll be surprised how deep their cheese dishes are and how lucky you are to be lucky enough to be a few steps ahead of these great table-top chefs.
Best BBQ in all of Chicago.  I have been coming here for years and have never really thought to try anything out of the ordinary.  The clean and delicious atmosphere is just the best thing on the menu, the staff and the cuisine is just that excellent.  Food is cheap too!  They have some of the best tamarind jam in the city and
restaurant complex and will be available from around 6:30 PM on Saturday and Sunday.
I grew up in Chicago, attended Eugene O'Hare College, went to any church, and I love going to Grunge on Saturday and Sunday.  Everytime I go, I ask the chef if they have a second spot, and he reminds me of some Philly's pizza joint where they tried his really good basil, green beans, and cucumber-based dishes before their patio.
i think thats cool their music is epic if you go there just to listen to it and appreciate their choice of food and style of dressing i will be back
Not much else to say about this place other than that it is good and has a great beer selection. They have coffee and its a nice location so its an interesting check to know if you like the beers.  Yes, they have smoked salmon but whatever i find, i eat it mostly in private so thats the free ale n style
restaurant I've ever used, but this one wasn't THAT good. The salad was a little over cooked, but tasted GOOD. The presentation was awesome. The crowd was real friendly and they helped you decide if it was worth getting to the restaurant. Overall, I've never been disappointed by this place again.
The food was absolutely phenomenal, the food was exceptional. The wine list looked great. The guacamole was so good, I figured it would've been worth the wait. Definitely not to go back here often. If you want something more adventurous and have the same day tastes, you will definitely come back. And if your in a different city/town or you want something cold & cozy/warm then take the Day to Day service option from the menu. We also recommend getting good care packages to avoid being hit with heat. Most of these will only last a couple of days and there are a few times when we have to cut out.
The wines and very
restaurant went by on January 22nd for the second time. Each of the 2 salad dishes were already taken care of, but you would see you were all wanting more. If you went to the bar just to try out new cuisine and had no idea what food is there, if you haven't waited 5 minutes and you can't finish the dish, you are not going to come. All of the food was good, we had barely eaten and it felt like we were on a stick to see if we wanted to put a price tag on it.  To be honest, the only reason we said the salad wasn't on the menu was to overrate the price tag.  We don't even like to eat at food stores, a friend of mine was over work, he did something crazy here and it hurt his feet.  So we went to the bar because we were sitting there drunk and we need that.  The waiter seemed so rambunctious and that made it hard
restaurant, main course and whole meats dishes. From The Menu:
10-15 years ago here. Fantastic place.  - if you're a gluten free person you should try this place! - It was once owned by the Mexican Restaurant of Chicago - Chicago would be changed if they would want to have "adult" food choices.   Not worth it for those looking for the perfect Italian menu at amazing prices.    Everything was used up until I moved to Chicago.  Basically every night at 9 am until 10pm.  Been here 10+ times now.   Wanna make a reservation?  Check this out.
Called our Laundry, took long time to get there, and since we ended up leaving early, we had to wait in line there for our usual dinner time. They have 30 employees so they got to you on time, as well as kept an eye on what was in the back. I think the price is just the most
restaurant, please. Just making a reservation was a good first step... I forgot to tell the bartender they were taking us off reservation when we got home. Also, the food was horrible. Some of the portions were overpriced, others that were pretty decent.  Great way to go for a nice night out, or just to enjoy the food.
Enjoy! Found this place about 15 minutes away from an upscale Italian restaurant and called for some Italian service. Highly recommended!  We tried their gyro bread pudding....  It was too sweet and too sweet, much like the chicken ketchup.  Our waitress, Delaney Hill, seemed to be getting over the lack of meat in the bread pudding....  We shared it with dinner friend and went back with a t-shirt and a the food was almost burnt.  The food was excellent...so much so that the owner of the place, with casual demeanor, even helped us in our dining.
I am so glad
restaurant, service, and restocking were all excellent.  Our waitress, Liza, who was certainly attentive, was super sweet.  Thank you manager John Forster!  We definitely recommend them for group or casual dining!
I came here on my birthday in one of my favorite places to go.  Love it! I love their hot dogs.  It's the only place I ever want to go where I will eat in a huge crowd.
great meals  great ice cold fun  i used to go there -mariascaros for panaki, arbol con fondante for entrees.  the atmosphere is great and very quiet.
Taste really good.  Excellent appetizer, scallops churrada salads, hot and cold pressed margaritas, dumplings and donuts. waffle dough cakes, crispy pork belly tarts with more heaven.  one of the best Italian dishes I have ever had and would definitely try again
restaurant that should be getting a lot of attention. Service was extremely unprofessional and difficult. I was asked if I could see the dent on the wall behind the desk and I said no. I mentioned that I'm down about 9/10 for dinner but there's not really anything wrong with a much larger diner on East County. The service was simple, it was attentive, and it did not touch the entree but the thought of all the menus was too good. All in all, the service was excellent.
Probably the best
Excellent food. The tortas are amazing. I've tried a few else places and they are all delicious. If you are vegetarian, I highly recommend these at home. I eat close to most of the neighborhood, I only have a few people who actually care and I am happy to share.
Absolutely must try this place. Make sure to order there where they have a food truck (all sides) to get you a napkin and a spicy
restaurant:  My husband and I work at an eatery and his service staff is extremely nice and helpful. We love our BBQs and will be bringing back my salads and appetizers. I really like this place to send you straight to our lunch. Every second counts, but we've had the biggest success this place has had - delivered juicy-butternut squash balls and they've made more! Delicious. The place is terrific for date night and after a quick bite I'm sure you will agree. The atmosphere is very warm and inviting!
I've been here three times, but I'm always disappointed when they charge by the hour, plus that we only get 3 hours notice. There are already a few confusing online coupon options and it would have been better if they did a better job of explaining the section near us.  I think the food is good, but they use the coupon money just as much.  This place does a nice job with the meat, but it
restaurant (both of which are missing) to the open kitchen, with a full bar to accommodate any guests who may wish to visit. I'm only a week from Sunnyvale, so no reservations in the future.
I live in Chicago but I know how to make it fun and the service is awesome. The only reason I'm not going back is that the menu is out of this world, but the food is top notch - do yourself a favor, and ask to try all three menus in the bar, you'll be pleased.
I love these stuffed sandwiches in a pancake, with corn tortas, and nothing to be afraid of.  The fried chicken also is excellent.
I love this place! Every time I go here I always get the Egg Benedict that the hostess orders. I went there as an extra late present to get more variety in the options. One of the seats we got was amazing. My order included one from Brazzila and it
restaurant
My husband and I are both visiting from Chicago and wanted to introduce ourselves. The service was outstanding, we ordered a fried chicken which was appetizing, and our server left us totally satisfied. I also recommend going there for drinks, as this is one of my favorite venues to go when it comes to outdoor seating. Since it is closed, I will be able to enjoy a variety of food and drinks while I wait for food. Please bear in mind that the wait is only one hour and will be available from 12:00-4:00 p.m.I highly recommend going downtown if you want a more outdoor experience. It is open hours, so go early, and if you enjoy outside seating, be ready to wait (within reason).
My favorite joint! Tastes just like cat ears. Go for the ribs, the white malts, and the chicken ravioli. The parking is OK, but not so good for the cost. If you have
restaurant and salad bar.  Not to mention the restaurant had a good selection of wines and steak sauces.  I would recommend their macaroni and cheese, with salads and pastas.  The staff was friendly and the menu simply made you feel like you were a corker (seriously, would i recommend their steak or lobster pizza with a spoon, not a spoon?)
Excellent salad bar. Not only is the meal delicious and affordable but it is fun and very a little pricey. Best place ever to go when traveling.
We have come here twice. First time, a friend ordered this salad bar and found it to be great. The food was amazing!  The second time, our waiter came to the bar and informed us that the salad bar had more than 1 table of it on the table!  We decided to take some time to review the food, then decide to go back.  So, when we left, my buddy and I waited for our drinks
restaurant in the neighborhood, etc. So it was nice to have a small area where a lot of people will walk in and enjoy the way that they're presented. It's in part because the wonderful crowd seems to appreciate the food and the quality.
Great ambiance for my local club; very small enough to fit in most sessions.  Service was always very nice and attentive.
Best vegan food in town.  I've been going there for years and have always been pleased with the reviews. The food is soooo fresh and flavorful that you almost feel like you're in culinary heaven. Service was prompt and attentive.  The right people as a group would come here and greet you and serve you prepared meals that were absolutely perfect.
I want to thank diners for their incredible service and atmosphere during my friend�s birthday!  The meat was wonderful, and the service is always kind and friendly.  Everything is prepared well to meet the needs of every eating occasion.
restaurant an  honour  course I highly recommend its as its an  excellent friendlier place for sports groups that happen to have a library on the corner - with spectacular view and excellent service, the bar is unique, classy, excellent tasting and excellent atmosphere. We don't usually leave so early, but come late for brunch - we're much more willing to do it on a Saturday night.
I've been trying the gelato since I was 12 years old - absolutely fantastic!  The ambience is wonderful - but the service is still great and the food is fresh.  The girls at staff are gorgeous, too - one can easily tell from their arrival that we were speaking with a cook who was in class.  It was too late to bring our food from the kitchen, and that will make it another 2/3 that we got some!  And I also love that there are some authentic Italian places - Crisp Italian is a favorite!  Really great homemade crepes -
restaurant in the family, but not by the factor of toppings. Food was super light and homemade.  No's, but enough! No questions asked. Will definitely go back again.
We are from Little Italy and love Duck Floss or Gloryhole.  These just blew our minds this year!  The Chicken was incredible, not just true American style chicken, but just fantastic (both of which might be our favorite portions at that bar).  This is a perfect place for an egg roll, pumpkin pie or anything to go with your meal.  It's a bistro, definitely, the BEST.  Although the decor, mannerisms, ambiance and prices are just as chic as Chicago's -- the food is as much American as it is, you can even get a server to come around to you, will bring your food to you at a reasonable price, and ask to reserve a table.  Our server is clean and professional, will deliver meals and others
restaurant is deep dish meatballs. They are a must have for any sausage lover (if you're not feeling squeamish then you are not going to be able to hit this spot). You could try the Alinea Braised Waffle Spicy, but you know that's pork shoulder. It is my favorite. I've always been inspired by the Asian sausages. And because their shrimp is SO chunky, you really can't taste their hot sauce anymore. I always keep my bowl open so the broth/salads get a light breeze. My favorite dish, however, is the Dr. Fried Rice which is a thick rice soup that has a nice creamy crunch to it. Very tasty. My friend, also a vegan, went there a few weeks ago and was very happy. You could really taste it. So if you want great food and great service, you really can't go wrong with this establishment.
love a good date on a Friday night? sooo
restaurant, small vegan restaurant and an outstanding community.We highly recommend of Dishes and Steaks.  5.3 stars!
Went here last night for the Art Deco Festival, and I guess this is when you need a place to relax when you're the only kid in the neighborhood...Nab! The food was nothing to write home about, but you could tell the hostesses were so embarrassed that they were such nice women that they just forgot about it. Of the foods we've been in this area, no such abomination. If you want 'em, make reservations the first time you're in. Definitely go in early, but you will pay $20/person when it's open. I wish we could have moved more to walk around. I also wish we had returned to. They've moved us back and forth a bit more.
GOED THERE, NO SMALL THOUGHT. BUT I AM NEVER GOING BACK. LOVE THIS!!!!
restaurant/weekend specials, warm drinks and so much more!The minimum order amount we received was $6.50 and they had just an appetizer of your choice for $4.95! The menu is also no different than the Restaurant Yellbeg where the full menu including meals (spelled out) is included and includes appetizers as well as desserts as well as beer (herb). For the biggest appetizers, which are really special sauces (served from very thin slices), I will pay anywhere between $25-50.  All are good!  The beer menu is literally a my favorite since the owner explained how he used it to have a tasting menu. I have been through several flavors and all are created to taste exactly like our own. Finally, the money made from the tasty baked goods is not only nice, but certainly affordable too!Although it does take some time to get your food to your table, I was in luck when they opened our first
restaurant so close together is a form of regular Foodies Culture and the place is packed. You can spot the waitstaff at the train stops, at the ocean and on the next street, so you can pick up your meals and stay at the park and patio. You can also spot the line at the pop out point for tourists after getting seated. The food in the small portions is what makes it good. I highly recommend YOLO instead of the Chicago equivalent.
I went to this place at 9pm to get married.  It was terrible.  The ambiance wasn't pleasing either and I almost didn't like the wait.  The place is too loud and reminds me of a Starbucks as many times as I've had it since I moved here.  If it weren't for the noise (so loud) and the people drinking the tap water at the table at the table, this location wouldn't be where it is today.  After the day I'll be back
restaurant: Sensations, recipes, wine selections, and good drink selections. This is a really well priced place, and the service is great too.
OK and so this isn't my first visit to Zach's and have to say I've been hanging around the place since my two party and I went here on a Tuesday night. The service was right on par with other 5 star reviews I had been following since I first saw it. What I find more interesting than this place is the elegant contemporary presentation that will work for you if you're looking for anything good with a cocktail (or multiple) - the blue colored outdoor patio seating, tiny stone fireplace, beautiful intimate lounge seating, soft drums playing in the background which are beautifully described, and grosgrain toast dinner (you know, for y'all!). Plus, great cocktails available too, free advance reservations and low prices and pricing. Basically the best beer I've ever had at midnight. And I mean that saying because while I
restaurant to keep us laughing. Then about 12 hrs later there was a massive server yelling into the middle of the table, which seemed highly suspicious, but then it stopped for all three quarters. Instead of giving us several pints of tapas it instead sent us off on a tangent between our reservations of the night and an enjoyable evening. I know, this is dumbfounded by my family, but all I could think was that we were bad-ass busy brats, but what the hell did they even mean? Who is the pervert?"
When I write this review I am really enjoying the night of its own accord and will be going back soon. Highly recommended!
We are definitely going to Chicago on Friday, I LOVE the East Coast! I went there last night and did the east coast pasta a lot! These days my macaroni and cheese often get asked if I was a fan of all that spices. And I definitely was. This was the first time I
restaurant, cocktails & cuisine. We love the brunch menu and when i first got here the list was extensive. Definitely check it out and see for yourself.
OMG! soooo ok  don't care about this place. Always try the meat roll. At least on the soft ones (can't say too much about the pork).  Too much flavor, though. Besides, we took 2/3 on the pizza and walked away with a lighter, i-felt-thin crust.  Just what i was looking for. And i hate that they have that tiny pizza container...in those old sugar bowl in the front, this stuff makes us bop. A shame that the rest of the staff keeps saying, oh yeah. But then again, they're basically catering to the homeless....however, it's not needed. and they're also the only place we've had yet!!!
This place is really very old-school.  I was skeptical at first, and
restaurant minimum of $1.50 per serving served, and can take the waitress out later than expected if they come early (anytime), so if you want extra soup, etc., its an options menu, if the food is reasonable and you like going in the evenings, the ice cream table is reasonable, but not an option. I also recommend having the shrimp rind noodle soup.  It is filled with crispy skin, yet yet takes a bit more time than the steamed rice and another 4-5 minutes. It's both well priced and interesting.
Amazing food!  Love the fries.  Doors open right in front of us, and on the side of the room where a carton of chips sits.  Awesome place to stay out for some sit-down a la carte.  I'm down for something else!
YUMMY FRIENDS! An outrageous meal, but worth the wait, which is ridiculous!  I usually order in
restaurant." I don't have to be a fan of fish and chips or New Orleans or try brunch in Chicago or Tri-State to eat something in Canton.  But even with that I know the place has received some really excellent reviews.  I'd definitely come back again and think about going back again for dinner and drinks.  It's still worth the stay if you really want a non-Drunk atmosphere.
This place is supposed to have the best latin-Chinese food in the city.  Everything was amazing, and they were never horrible.  I'm not saying they were high-end -- but just fine. I don't care that most servers work from home, but the prices were right.   I like the duck fillets, which are excellent, so they came with quite a few of the other tasty courses.  The thing that really set it apart from others was that they even offer a chinese dollar sign.  Who else would bother
restaurant, and was attentive.  There's no reason to miss them.  It is cozy, inexpensive, and casual and the atmosphere is excellent.  It's good to hear that Chicago is setting a standard for travel!
Nya Beef Noodles are NOOOOO tasty! Although not very filling, the sandwich is savory. One thing I would have to mention is that I would try that soda or apple juice combo (it should be pretty good).  My partner will totally agree.  Nice neighborhood, great food, and good service. We come to the Main Line several times a year because of the quality of our food, not because the weather is warm.
Wow! From bad wings to real beef to the best entrees, this review could not have been done better! I have been to Greenbox for a while now and we've been hungry as usual. My rating comes with a disclaimer - I am not a vegetarian or vegan fan.  I don
restaurant that gives you a good meal at work. I would like to suggest things like falafel, cabbage rolls, rice cakes, mussels and caramelized onions. I do go there all the time, but was pleasantly surprised at the owner's passion for cooking and food. I would definitly recommend this place for anyone who goes hungry or hungry for what it's made of. Overall I would highly recommend this restaurant to any hostess/finest that has ever met me, or someone who plans to give you a quick take-out experience after you order one.
Got to go once a month for our birthday to celebrate my favorite pastimes. Sushi always arrived today, so I waited that long because its for our birthday. The service was the most enjoyable of my experiences, but there was a long line. The place was packed (90 minutes), and food was VERY disappointing. I was complaining about no chairs, but the location was also another problem. And yes
restaurant Bayou Le Bancro for $9.90 and 10% off another 10% off around your friends house for the rest of your weekend. Always remember to bring a good appetizer if you're in town and order the escargot or hamburger. There's enough to satisfy even the most hunger-generating packagers, especially if you're looking for food in Chicago. A deep dish dinner that pays its dues to even the most die-hard Southern Burgers fan? On top of that...i've always been enticed by Botte-Agence Frontera's (brrrregerontera, they opened on May 30, 1991 in Rome, Italy) and Crispie and Champagne. These were my favorite wine orders around and I can't wait to go back for another bottle of what was once my favorite bottle of wine. BEEP! This place is bursting with known world celebrities! From Frank Giordano, who introduced the South
restaurant of an ideal life for two. The authentic food, service and quality ingredients at Lady Nagaz are all ahead of your average Asian restaurant. They are exactly what you expect from a fantastic steakhouses and do not disappoint with their exceptional cuisine and presentation. It took 10/12 of a 5 minutes to arrive at Odesa and it took me 2 or 3 more minutes to go there, I would pay anything for a room on Burwa or try my homemade ganache.  It's worth every penny.
A little to downtown that used to be in the Italian enclave. These days it is closer to the old developments.  Unfortunately the patio here does NOT look great and the sun came up out of nowhere for a different area but I am glad we go here, if they decide to go further they could change it's scene. If your of the types that want a place like this (with real Italian flair) try Cafe Solentos.  I would do
restaurant. Chicken tikka masala was great.  On a dinnertime night, we ordered a plate of grilled chicken. The tikka masala was $4.00 more than usual for our next location, but was damn good as can be and was delicious.  We order a salad, stuffed chicken and Italian sausage.  The tikka masala is $10, which is really the whole point!  It was also satisfying to eat several different kinds of tofu.  We were craving a delicious meat cocktail, not some kitchen specialty appetizer that accompanies a good meal.  The chicken sandwich was $9.00 more than usual, but was a bit less pleasant than I had hoped. The main dishes were basically just pork roast rice with black beans, avocado, cherry tomatoes, and more mushrooms.  We also ordered the spinach salad, because this was my most recent favorite dish.  I had the 'afrezza' shrimp (topper
restaurant + chopsticks = Melty Patty, look at the menu... everyone else in the restaurant... they're not good.
Love that it's in this back area!  My sister and I get to eat here every Saturday.  If you are going to do this place, have a reservation, and have your place a little closer to the bar, just be patient.
Went to the Park to visit the Maritimes and found great sushi in, excellent seafood variety. The first 3 beers were decent for the price they offered, and the beer selection is going strong.  The great thing about their Peking Duck is that there is always the option to put 2 additional beers in the 3 bottles so you can take the extra one.  The meats at the Steakhouse were mediocre so be prepared to suffer on the steak.  The pizza was good though, but not like what you might be used to and you won't get that gnocchi-cheese
restaurant. We went down to the backyard that we could sit at and sat in on our table. Simply amazing, one of my favorite places to grab dinner in Chicago.If you're looking for a great neighborhood restaurant (it's a lot bigger than the restaurant on the block, so be prepared for a wait) go here. It's less crowded than most locations at sports bar, but we've not had a bad experience so far. Great open air venue!
I hate moving from NYC to my new city!! My friend and I used to live a few blocks away, but I couldn't get over this place...  just love Chicago!  From beginning to end, I was sick of the wait, so while I didn't eat at Circles for 3 weeks (my first choice, they gave us a free meal to reserve the area), I was sick of the wait.  It took about 2 hours and 3$ to get through the doors to get through to the other
restaurant for the sake of the environment and to give the customers a special experience. Their Beef Wings are delicious and their tacos are just as awesome. There are so many great places in Chicago to eat. Try the chicken burrito sandwich because it has one of the best buffalo wings I have ever had. Try the hash brown sandwiches because they are always the best. Try the Chicken Mussels for great guacamole! Love the homemade ketchup of your choice!
Love this place!!! Make sure you order our pizzas with room to spare! Great, deep-fried pizza that is beyond fantastic!!! Their wings are sometimes bigger than the pizzas I've ordered here. Great location, craft beer selection, convenient service, and a great atmosphere. Service was good! The server was friendly and accommodating, and the owner was great. Service was always impeccable, as always. Farther away from Madison Square Garden and to the west, Topleville is a busy place with good
restaurant and second try, this place has been amazing for a long time.  Just how many times have I had these outstanding reviews and the owner was absolutely right.  I love the tartare and dip of the pudding.  You get two drinks, as in the same container, the way you get any dessert.  And, boy, is it amazing.  I'm not sure I want to go back since I don't have to buy another bottle of this wine every year.  Don't be disappointed.
Really good drinks.  They sell drinks with excellent ingredients.  Don't expect to get a menu for a great meal.  Very busy hours, the staff is usually busy and nice.  Try it at La Costa (no reservations needed).   Also if you're coming to Chicago at night, remember when they had a great BBQ before they put the building down?  I would highly recommend this place because it's so busy.  I'll definitely be
restaurant and wine room from here, and the store is as classy as it gets. My friend wanted to come here first. She shared some of her favourite places from around town and we all paid for it and more. Overall an incredibly very satisfied experience.Service was prompt and attentive.
GO THERE! We went at a very high level of service. There is not a lot of hipster food to try but the line was strong. We were lucky enough to grab a table while trying some of their lovely wines.We liked their neighborhood wines and sangria. We also enjoyed every meal as well.The sandwiches were good as well! We would come back again and again to try more food.
So, i'd said all along that the back patio has been really good, as is the food so amazing. Big game and attentive people. Totally worth it.Enjoy!
Great place to catch up with friends for some good drinks/sales!!! love it. It's cool
restaurant and served me a delightful evening of fish tacos...and for the city,
I am so proud to have been able to visit The Fountains over the years and still enjoy the food the most. The food and service is great, the staff is friendly and very attentive. The owner is very sweet, to the point of fondness, but also no prude when talking about her ownership and responsibilities. I cannot think of a more loyal, healthy, welcoming neighborhood in all of Chicago.
Worst deal EVER! NEVER...
I had this place on my trip there on an exact date.  So much so that we have the an hour walk to get to the restaurant.  My husband, brother, and I sat in the bar area and were dining out, chatting.  As we went up, he asked the bartender, who we said was more knowledgeable about the restaurant.  As the server told us (spook! ) she ordered our server one drink and
restaurant. It was my favorite restaurant in Chicago, if not my favorite sushi joint ever.  Please stop in and try it, no matter what the price tag may be.
I think it's a dream come true for late night stickling around!!!! I've been going to the Pier 8 times and always feel like the dark hour is on! This place needs to be changed!!! I was sad that I'm stuck in the condo area and to have to see this place stand next to a beautiful date party at night, seems hopeless! I was in town last night and had the question of when I would go back! I'm sick and exhausted of having to live a perfect life, but I wanted to come here for my Valentine's Day anniversary and my fiance was just two blocks away. However, he is still waiting for me and I am very disappointed with the service and message I was given about pizza and pizza place outside of Chicago.If you're looking for fun night out -
restaurant ($6.00). At other times there are not far away.  If you're not keen on going to bars or restaurants around downtown you might want to go in the neighborhood and try this neighborhood's freestyle appetizers, bread-heavy joints and speakeasy-styled lounge.
Great restaurant that will take you on a romantic date weekend
I was in Mohegan Sun and everything was pretty good. We ate the eggsplant salad and the fried dough, both with you knowing they were absolutely delicious. Everything was very fresh and came on like the norm, so great taste from what I had. The wings were crispy and deep, with a touch of freshness. I highly recommend going for a less crowded night because it is cozy with a mid to upper class man. (Only if you are paying the cash back!
I absolutely love this place.     I didn't want to come here because I don't want to give an average date
restaurant.  What didn't cut it?  My wife's mother  had died.  The server was rude, callous, incompetent, even for giving up.  I left calling at 2:30 pm.  No message.  Will not order from him again.
Good food, outstanding staff
We were disappointed and wanted to take our visit home for dinner.  There were several portions that we did not like.  Everything we ate had not been "best".  We went with the service of his escort but the service was simply inexcusable.  We would not repeat the wait.  Check out his department at Best French: http://www.bestfrancisco.com/history.asp. He is absolutely the nicest man I have ever met.  I highly recommend his restaurant, as they serve something fresh and unique.  If you really want your food hot, he is next best option.
The place is located at the corner of
restaurant.  We waited until about 45 minutes after the bar opened to experience some sassy--liberally prepared but nonetheless not too inviting--food.  We had a soda combo for dessert.  It was phenomenal!  The place was great, well lit and clean.  Was a little pricey because of the wait but it was worth it.  I've been coming here for awhile and have never been disappointed!
Its a fun lunch place, but at this rate you'll miss out.  Nothing new here.  Just go.  Its not great for everyone, but it's fun and cozy.  Nice atmosphere and lots of people there to sit.
I couldn't be happier with breakfast favorite! The food was always good.  The service was attentive, the drinks were fresh and creative.  The owner's dessert menu always had fantastic!  The better part is I had to try my own lemonade and its a little pricey.
Best pizza I've ever
restaurant, rock creaky, vegan friendly, and just barely par for the course.Had the last entree as well, natalie and I had the last entree and I would just continue to eat here.
My husband and I had brunch the day before but moved to another city on a whim.  Our server was SO nice and friendly and we had a great time.  We did agree that the restaurant makes life a little more interesting for our special guests.  The food was good, and we both ordered the chicken special with very different dishes.  They also got all their entrees & threw in some special drinks that included lemonade, lemonade and grape juice, as well as all the standard varieties including the most common grape and sweet vinegars.  Just not enough pie flavor for my personality.  Overall, it wasn't bad, but not great for a good dessert special.  Some people complained about the wait and said it was weird, but I'm
restaurant. My god it was absolutely delicious and had so much personality. So juicy and flavorful. This is actually the kind of place where you can stop in and ask for anything.
This place is legit! Love the decor. Get the seats on the second floor and try the pizza place.
What could possibly go wrong with this gem?  Went to Bodegas and ordered the Malted Carmelizer, only to be told that the decor was over the top.  Since I ordered the Ambrosia pasta as well as the Fruit Salad, I just cannot describe it!  You know what is over the top? Chicken.  Best I've ever tasted.  Excellent atmosphere and service.  I've always ordered the Big Alpes and are pleased with the rest.  Try the salad bar portion for breakfast.  Love all this and everyone should go back.
We just stopped by and we loved our time here. A story aside, what happened to our lunch
restaurant". When asked if I felt anything odd about this place, I was shocked to hear the company and one manager had never taken a life; very odd in what we feel like we stand for. I must tell you, the initial experience I have had there was unbelievable. The place is the best they have been in a long time, and as this was my first ever time they offer a few unique items.
While I am not an avid eater of quality content, I can't stop trying K+ from Michigan Seafood!  My name is Jean-André!  I always feel inspired by K+ because of the location and the variety of dishes they serve!  I have had their duck and chipotle peppers (sometimes the more malted potatoes), shrimp with cheese-flavored ingredients and homemade hot soup.  They even have his thick boiled egg white soup on the menu.  My husband has also never had this much vegetable soup, but he loves these eggs and
restaurant = large cookie sticks. You couldnt even ask to try to compete with us, my wife and I had to go! It's nice to be able to impress my new co-workers with high pretentious and snobish food.
Awesome restaurant! This place is so much better than the terrible times we had there.They have a menu that gives you several options: buffet - it's a little pricey, but $20-$40 every person that comes in will be impressed.
Went to Rockford because I love them!    Everytime i go, I'm trying to come up with a new favorite.   The pork neck burger has definitely gone down in popularity, i've seen a couple reviewers make an average of it once but none is below a 5 star rating.   I've gotten it on 2 or 3 occasions, a bunch of times, and they never disappoint.   Their fried chicken pizza is the best thing about these places
restaurant and dining room (pre-free wine). It is one of the only three restaurants in Chicago where duck and chicken is served at a regular price. (Free, unfortunately).
My wife and I have gone for lunch at Loop Wok with four friends, and only recently opened a restaurant in Chicago. The meat dish was much more flavorful than the other places I went there in that was still yummy and stuffed with the meatiness that we had with our whole meals. The waitstaff handled the food well and while we ate it well, it was still very flavorful, satisfying and the waitstaff was extremely friendly and the quality of the food made my day. We will be back and i hope to return to take the family on a more wonderful evening. And with endless hours on the weekends and holiday months gone by, this place was always a must-try. Would go back to this place again!
i has always liked Las Olas so much, i don't even
restaurant. The young staff were never as professional as we wanted them to be...The owner looked at me the way a person looks at a dog...I was annoyed and disappointed at his failure, but he never condescended to the manager or any of his employees...they were amazing professionals. Our waiter was also wonderful!We ordered dessert and chocolate which the manager had us waiting for...We were sad to see him leaving the restaurant...I will miss him dearly, but it was an honor to work with him. Thank you Louie, too!<|endoftext|>
restaurant,  many fondue and appetizer dishes.  For my appetite, however, I was too eager and I did not want to wait for 15 minutes. The dinner was disappointing.  I had the schnitzel and the marinated beef was not the best-dish which was the key.  The interior was huge, open space and never the nice wooden menu where everything else seemed cluttered with signs.  Some of the decor in the restaurant was really nice, like the wicker chairs, decor, bell windows.  But, there were still a few bad people in the bar too,  I could not understand the greasy finishings of some of the burgers.  Once I was able to get a plate of the redfin pork bar, I really felt completely outmatched by the menu.  The service was short, slow and even weird.  I do not know if they had the freshest bar in the world with a Brazilian or Brazilian menu
restaurant wasn't full until half past four and only gave me one small mouthful. The soup is good. It seems like he was telling me that the most popular restaurants in LA have some of the best chefs in the city.  Next time I go, I am going to make a reservation.  I haven't been back there since lunch yet, but I have to think I might get to go more often.  My favorite dish is the oysters I was able to steal from Mama's Salad in San Francisco.  Can't wait to come back.
There is nothing quite like one of this wonderful quaint little neighborhood. It is open every day at 6:00 am and drinks are always good! Great Wine selection (keep an eye on other places for that); Super nice Atmosphere with great food. Definitely will be back!
Went for my birthday with this place, and we both enjoyed it!  This place was very well done, with every detail, including
restaurant restaurant, or bring a pitcher or two to serve.I bought a pizza order on Saturday night. On Tuesday, the manager was still around the table waiting for orders. I assumed he was to order for delivery to the store from downstairs and leave without me telling him where I was ordering. I called him at 2:30 on Tuesday morning, and he said he hadn't been getting orders, so he just ignored me. That was an interesting way of getting around the rules.After an hour or so of waiting, I walked out. I told the manager to return the money, but he didn't say anything. Then, he said he needed to bring food. At this point I wanted him to go to my room, but he was determined to stay, so I let him. He turned to me with a deep stare and said, "you are a workaholic!! You must have 4 people to go to your room." Then, he whipped out his wine and poured
restaurant in two hours with exquisite servers. We ordered the steak wing sirloin/ambro zone food with six entrees. The service was always nice and attentive. We ordered a flan which we loved and the waitress was incredible. After dinner, we enjoyed the food (including portions of pasta) while the prices paid for the service were reasonable (around $20).
I always get the Lobster Chicken Chicken and this was the first time I went to Austin and all I can say is, GO GO, GO!!!! The basil sticks are raw and terrible. I always end up going for the beef bone buffalo (thrice) instead of duck bone. No special salad ingredients.I always eat chips or bite size salads just because they are so darn fresh. Their chicken is generous and tender.The chili pepper chicken meat is yummy and creamy. It is delicious.Hands down my favorite stuffed chicken dish out there. Really too much meat.
The place has really nice
restaurant Service. I mean the place needs a lot of help. The food is fresh, the customer service is great and the drinks are just gorgeous.The diner/kitchen was great! Also brought me pizza...try the question of whether or not pizza is healthy or not. They are both great, they both taste great. The steak was too fresh to move around and I think it was soaked in sherry sauce and grits. Everything else came out perfectly. The meat was delicious and wasn't too spicy or sour for the squeamish. There is nothing else to say. Definitely a favorite spot in the city.
Welp.  I went in a few weeks ago and moved in, it was cool.  It wasn't my idea.  If you're in such a hurry, this place would be for you.  But, my roommate was over there last night and was already over the frozen margaritas before I got there.  They were overc
restaurant" is no longer free to do, but even worse. The menu simply couldn't meet the criteria or cost that were to be met, something that only serves to entice people away. This food goes so fast, and so low, you really want to go for it. I can't understand why you are complaining about ordering 3 items at once with no grand ordering by checking every order and a straight ticket back to your table. The 3 entrations were fast and affordable, and the recommendation of their not having the time to come through the food was kind of disappointing. Overall, it's a terrible restaurant, it sucks, and it makes all the sense and obligation that goes into a restaurant like this.
I have been here several times but this place is the only place that I feel comfortable.  Love that all my people see it and give it a try.  The service here is average, but great.
Awesome place!  Super fast, great food! 
restaurant. I went here with my boyfriend who loves to go to shows. She brought us 8 times now and we had the small Chinese fried chicken noodle fettuccini. The service was much better than we had expect. Our server was nice, nice to the staff. She was very polite and easy to make good suggestions, letting me know we would like to go. The food was super quick and tasty. Definitely a must for those to try it out. Unfortunately the beignets were still left out when we finished the chicken and salad. What can I say...I really enjoy this restaurant. 
I am into sports fanatics so would love to check out Olmec if I could! I did, however, end up being disappointed, the hostess was clearly apologetic, it wasn't good enough to make up for it, her actions on the eve of our arrival in very, very stupid fashion and we all felt horrible. After giving us a coffee which
restaurant for $12.75 (for children). This place has all the fantastic things you will want in a Cuban Cubana.  It's packed with such great people, and they work hard for their customers to join them. If you're in the mood for an authentic Cuban dish, this is one.
I didn't know this was so much of a hip place. The food was good, but I did not get the peanut butter and jelly smoothies, nor the cheese mac and cheese sandwiches. But, it wasn't great.
Vacao hotpot  was delicious. Deco steak was huge. I got the steak of a lamb shoulder because they make pork shoulder and the portions were small. The pasta, the baked beans, chocolate cake were amazing. I really don't get the sense that I went to such good a place to go but was absolutely disgusted by the value of it all.  Which is why I have tried the cut cake.  It does
restaurant are they always fresh?Yes. Try the new Popcorn stick but if you like your food from Chicago, you'll like this version.
Sierra Croquette is great! Especially if you go with a group and get a friend. When you get here late it's packed! My guest account was swarmed and I were re-homed. I cannot say how happy I am with the food either. The prices are ridiculously cheap at $9.00. The food was generous, but not so great I'm not sure how to continue! And because it's the same place every time you go, there are specials every chance you get. It's a must try. They don't disappoint as great as the well food. I usually order it twice with dinner. We order salad, mozzarella, jalapenos, entree, etc. The days when we order the Grilled Chicken was sometimes when we got 5 or 10 entrees. They made
restaurant seats. The wine list is below. If I had to be honest, this isn't the best I've had. A couple of the chicken wings were about $20 (each item cost) but they were mostly beached-egg, squid & sauce; there were some notches that I could have brushed off. However, nothing compares to my experience at their location.
You go to South Mexicana and you pay for everything, you have great food, and you love the dishes.  Unfortunately, I have been to some other Mexican places in Chicago that do not charge a bit for food and service, but a "A MUST GO" environment in the Chicagoland neighborhood at least helped in that sense.
Good food.  Service is good.  Good price.  Fast, low quality food.  Great patio seating.  Really enjoyable atmosphere.
The main menu was ok, but the second place was kinda stinky...all of the types of canned
restaurant, grand brunch and a bar area, much to my surprise. We had a great time too. Having my wife and I stay at home with her to have dinner to finish was a great way to relax. It's good to have people that you trust in this place to be honest in their love and give them the best cup of tea I've ever had.  The hostesses were very friendly and super comfortable making us feel welcome and truly appreciated by everyone we did come in.The server is everything you would expect from any restaurateur. This is a very comfortable dining experience and staff are professional. The ambience is better than what you'd expect. I don't have a problem staying in here to eat steak and crab and taking beers at Joe's.My favorite part is that they have a lot of pickle fries on tap and when I order my favorite they do it pretty fast and right up until the server's table comes out when they are completely busy.  The
restaurant_love Service was OK - for example, our waiter called for a table for 20 minutes but it was a very long wait.
These chicken thighs are a must try. My girlfriend and I have tried dozens of other dishes and we love the service there. The owner's name says its a washroom for all things - they just make the sauces and sauces and serve them off-the-shelf. It's even more of a place to listen in to the store with owner Dave, listen to people work-talk with customers. Be warned though - this can be a slightly stressful environment because there is no flight service between major thoroughfares or wide distances. Get here in 45 minutes and enjoy yourself!
good food, good service, decent drink service...its over the top if not worse for Chicago ales... no average prices.
Service is poor at best - stop in in and you'll find you won't regret it... miss even MORE time....

restaurant Chef/Owner, Rick Rick Kimball. The food and service has consistently provided great value to the community and the patrons. Rick has brought together the likes of Lisa and Ricky, the avid pianist Patrick Saunders, and many other chefs. Rick also loves to drive and the pizza is a pleasure to eat in! Rick's Yelp is an excellent place to check out new restaurants.
Great food, easy to pick up service. Great atmosphere.Nice food.
My niece, Annas, went to work here last week. It was good and it was really good.  She got her first softball, and started with a real American entree and now she just gets like ice cream!!  I went for lunch with my boyfriend and went to stand by for some american cheesecake.  It was real fun, and we had the Reuben!  It was literally the best thing we ate.  My boyfriend and I are both currently living in Chicago, so it
restaurant specials, and try everything before you buy a dozen or so. It's worth the hype for the food. The ingredients are fresh, lovely, and the atmosphere is chic and friendly. The bar is thin and delectable and friendly. For me, this neighborhood is a bit special. I grew up here on a Cuban vacation and felt like I was in a place to live - which was a great place to start with. I live out of an old restaurant in the east side of Chicago, and can't say enough good things about it. The cocktails are delicious. If you are a Cuban person, try some of the bartenders with more or less mixed accents (my husband and I can't recall any other names that I know of.) They do not always look so good, but they do go above and beyond for their cocktails! The other reason I'm ordering the Foodie Cheese-Salad is that it is a bit pricey, but the Cheese-Salad includes
restaurant bar I've had, the margaritas are amazing! Also the chilli-cork pairing is a good idea! Can't wait to come back!
Great food, helpful service, and outstanding general attitude (especially considering their own restaurant! I made the trip here for my birthday so I was hesitant but loved the outdoor patio). I tried the ribs at first but couldn't find anything in the place. The lamb chops in the sauce was way too small for their size of lamb - but the meat did get cooked and tender with the rib? Good thing I live in New York, and had the Chihuahua Chicken!
This is the kind of place I love and want to stop by to eat.  I love those days when when you can go find a steak and the rest is hype, but this year, that hype is probably coming from Pho.  So which steak chain does pho better?  the Wendy's or Pho Hot Chicken,
restaurant and cheap prices.
Ok, thats all I can say. So many quality selections. Try their vegan fried chicken dish and they even have free dessert.
I love a perfectly delicious experience!  Go with a family with kids as well!  This place is right by my bar next to my work place and I feel like everyone has an intimate experience there.   What more can you ask for?  Oh and I have had them grill pizza -- meatballs and raw pizza -- all complete meals that will leave you hot and greasy.
I had the Orange Line and its the worst experience to come out of Chicago in 5 years. It was to die for that was about everything that is eating here.  Breakfast was simple with steaks, falafel, etc. The brunch was smooth and enjoyable and served with a side of some lobster (nopon).  The night was even more grubby and uninspired than I expected.This was of course before
restaurant. Apparently he has no clue. I've taken him around and then taken him anywhere else to fulfill what he said. It must be foody, but I don't think he expects all that much. He will give you a slice, saying he made good quality it. It was really good.
LOVE X GREAT THINGS TO FOOD here!!!
my husband and I shared lunch here on a Saturday afternoon. it was SO GREAT. our waiter wanted to take away the salad and my family loved the service..it wasn't enough to say goodbye.
I am a vegetarian!  It's not special eggs.  I've tried everything and they're never what you expect to find from a vegetarian restaurant.  I've tried everything and they know what it takes to get all the ingredients right and really appreciate every single dish.  It's only fair that my husband is vegetarian too since he also happens to be a vegetarian.  I'm a vegetarian; it should
restaurant, brunch, coffee, wine and beer - what a world of difference. Be prepared to wait while the rest of the Chicago al fresco crowd gazes at the facade of the building, drinking waffles and teas, waiting for someone to come and say hello with a sandwich. There are some great spot offers for major events, but be prepared to wait long for a friend!
Literally Chicago go-go with the hot dogs.This is a good establishment with great food and amazing staff. We've seen very few other than The Pirate, why try this restaurant?
I come here often, but I have never been disappointed.  Have I been to The Onion?  Yup, you get it.  The menu is tasty, inexpensive, and reasonably priced, and is highly enjoyable.  Just that I will be returning!
The teapot is awful.  Decent crepes, bland servings, overly sweet, over salty, not as fresh as
restaurant that means meatballs, cornbread, crepes, desserts and so much more. It's always great if you've got something to go but it's always great if you have just desserts that people love. Our regular stop is Chambin Prawns which is great and the pizza is great! We enjoy the large portions on the sunda or cocktail bar. Their wings are awesome!And when it comes to the desserts, the one that rings the most authentic is the Fish Bone. All the lovely desserts are fantastic and I just love how authentic their gnocchi is.
We never really went here because the food is really undercooked and this place may not be the city's Best....I am sure the food was just put together from the outside...but the atmosphere, service and decor is great.
Had a "miss this place" at the wrong time and thought it might not work out as it does. Tried to go there, for several different reasons
restaurant - - had a table for 45 minutes... once again towered above its standing...  Probably could have not won the awesome meal I had...
Today was the most fun trip I have ever taken in my life. We sat in the dining room and drank tea together while everyone else waited in the line with us. I had the finest establishment at Narita-700 (Lupine & Horn) and the best sushi- I went to, I can honestly say. We all would have asked for a better sushi but it was ridiculous! Every bite was amazing!
this place was SO packed.  love monday is open 5am-6pm weekday, usually 4am-5pm.
I've enjoyed eating here for the past 8 years, but I don't think there is a better place to eat. I've been back several times for this place, and have been at several more. The food was always excellent, always delicious, always attentive. I also
restaurant. Enjoy the food and parking to the right.
Well I'm glad that we can continue dining here.  The desserts are fantastic and the rest of the food has an exceptional perfectionists feel for it.  It's a little far from the traditional supermarket but it has something for everyone with a little pasty in it.  For more casual brunch, I would recommend a couple of plates of the food you'll find here and one they serve for two.  I try everything they do at a very reasonable price for most things I like - which might have to do with the price but not with having to ask for a table at work every time I leave home.  My favorite times to eat here were when it was still the night before (9:00pm) and then the colder one around the end of the week (10:00pm).  If you go to the hostel, you are at the mercy of the hostel's policy - which can be
restaurant to our doorstep, waiters were only in her kitchen and was not responsive. The food was over priced and our dessert became unrealized. We paid extra for the kohlrabi macaroons, along with a whole chicken in its bag - but they only get 1! There was no purpose in trying to turn our money back to someone else, as we already had a bad meal and now weren't eating enough anymore. Try it on summer, you'll never leave feeling embarrassed.
This place should be recommended to anyone.  And I'm about as high a 'go anywhere eater' as you get.  Also, my  boyfriend recently came to Chicago to enjoy a margarita and it was a very good experience.  The whole ambiance of the restaurant looks so perfect that there should be some semblance of the old nicest decor that is as well.
love this place!!!!o goh is so good. i always find myself craving french fries at certain
restaurant etc.) and that wasn't happening. The staff just kept treating us poorly. Their soup was awful. After half a drink and asking how I was feeling, they just got down and started comparing my gut to food, my skin and food. My rice was out and their pate nose was totally dry. There were a few other key customers who got really upset as well, but it got anyways, they just kept treating us like crap.I was so disgusted with the bad service that I couldn't believe it was happening. But with all of the criticism,  I am pretty sure I gave them as much as $3-4 the call so I will never forgive them. The hostess' attitude was lacking and they just treated our 10-15 year old daughter like shit. I don't want to hear anything about this place going the another 5 times that they should be. I guess it is only fair to pass it off as a disappointment to the community.

restaurant + sandwich could have been better. When I arrived I ordered with the salad and salad bar which was that much better. I think maybe it was the way they cook and pick it up after they let it sit. Yes the salad bar was made of fresh seaweed. Also a tip would be that they do offer special wheat sauce on the menu.  I highly recommend this place.
The atmosphere is wonderful. The service is good. The prices are well known and the place is small and quiet and well maintained. Overall the cash register is clean and overall very inviting.
I love this place! If you've never heard of Pizzajoe before, or haven't tried it but want to try something different, I highly recommend it! Tried a few other places around Portland and the place really impressed me! They were all very kind and friendly and really would not stop after you try. They've been successful in the past and have had more places to choose from and
restaurant. Try a Liza's Pita, which comes with a good wine list, and think about 1 night. We had the French Toast a block away at Lemioza!
Went here last week and it was awesome! The best part is you can take some of the larger diners and serve them it's own - and we were hooked! It's definitely a great spot for what you're craving. I think the food here is totally unique and I'm not going to leave unsatisfied!
Amazing hot chocolate. Hot chocolate with hot chocolate- raisin frosting that melts in your mouth. The ribs are amazing, and the crust is so soft and crispy on the outside that you may even feel like the milk's not thick enough.  The place is pretty loud, you can hear the service be late because the servers are obviously working a bunch of hours a day.  A bottle of water is pretty cool too, but it would not be bad to get
restaurant
I love it here!  A combo of food, atmosphere, and atmosphere. The staff is consistently in touch with and accommodating - a rarity in Oakland.  It's like a different place in the USA, but still pays attention to dining experience.
A month ago i was visiting home with my boyfriend, and we heard word that this food was going to be a surprise at 7pm on a Sunday. Not because we had a sweet tooth! that was ok i was a bit disappointed that there were no "noisier" options. The sweet catfish that was served with it was calamari. most of the staff were incredibly friendly and knowledgeable.The only negative about the pork is that one of the servers was the "pork" type.The rest of the fish dish was not as good as i expected and i would have preferred such a small dish!B.1) the spicy red meat was basically the same flavor as most people think of Asian hot peppers
restaurant should no longer be delivered at 9:30 am, 15 minutes after meeting the reservation! This is one of the worst portions of any meal in San Diego, not only because of the wait, but because you didn't make an effort to use the restroom during that time.
I have been here once but I never ended up with a single visit here. The staff is incompetent and a con artist. We treated them as we were given the menu, but we had to wait for 8 hours in order to get a reservation. Nothing compares to that to go to a Hot Lincoln Park/Penny Park at around 6 pm.  Nice, romantic atmosphere, nice food, cheap drinks and not to mention crappy prices. I'm going to go back here again.
I went for lunch yesterday, a man by the name of "Charles", arrived by roundabout 9:30 pm and arrived just before 10:30. I sat at an empty chair as we both heard a deaf
restaurant was one of my favorite things in Chicago and thank you im not going to tell anyone i eat on this street but i do know what to do with it if i do. anyway if you are planning on visiting now or even just staying one day and and have a drink, then this is the place to go.
I had the second round of pho and it was amazing! The food was tasty! I also had the grandmoor hubby. I wouldn't leave hungry and give him the credit if I left hungry. The service was amazing too. Though it was a little early in the evening and i thought he was going to sit next to my dog, but we all went over to have a seat at his table and he ate, so as to make room for our rest. The fresh little basil paste was just perfect. I really enjoyed their food and they had only a 15 minute wait on top of it. The rogerie soup was amazing too! Not
restaurant.
So if you have a table on a budget, it's probably best to come here on weekends and make reservations in advance. I remember most nights being spent two-three hours early - where guys get ready to catch up on most things. But this is what each and every person gets before they order. But if you just want to check in and relax, the food is stellar.  Lots of flavors including sour cream, chocolate and more than a dozen ways to entice.
Our friends came here after hearing that the Tour d'Orsay is down to $35.00 for every pair of shoes they order.  Of course that was just a little inflated, considering that if we ever had a ball it was very rare to get this amount.  We don't get paid to go for a few drinks, and no one wanted to tell us that, but at least one person stood up to say we weren't paid too fast enough for that kind of
restaurant Menu
Calaver and appetizers are your standard, but it's what you have to try to get your hands on. I don't know what the menu is, but my friends had one in Chicago, and it's definitely special.  It's one of my favorite Brazilian spots, and has everything from homemade guacamole to phenomenal tacos.  They give you some great drinks at the same time and also a salad bar.  Overall, it's a great neighborhood favorite that's free for everyone and always casual.
I went to this restaurant at T & O to get some cheesy bread. I didn't have any other problems!The service was amazing, but the food was not the best. I actually walked out of the restaurant. But when it came to toppings, I got like half a loaf of meat. The sides were always hard to find. When we finished, it was our only complaint, it was on my plate! My friend also ordered
restaurant, he told me that he's looking to roll back the city's greenlining practices, saying he'd like to take their complaints under advisement. He had a point.
Crazy fast way to get to Salt Lake City, but the sushi is atrocious. We ordered the zimbab lettuce and the chopped up chicken breasts--stuffed to perfection! The plain rice itself was absolutely overcooked. I could hear the meat cubes breathing heavily. Don't buy that dish!
We ate there the night before we moved to Flat Rock. We never brought in any of the other duck dishes.  Most of the dishes were literally ruined.   We said they wouldn't do sushi again until we had the soup in the lukewarm broth. We called their manager and said there was nothing we could do. He never would! I just hope they did not have any outside parties at our table. The staff said the spicier portions were not worth the review they
restaurant, fried cheese sandwiches, and large salad bar.  Chicken is delicious, very tender and tasty.  They also have great locations in the family with the trendy 902 W $6 menu (new york, St. Louis)  Great prices.  The coffee shop provides a great neighborhood experience with great food. If you are coming at 5 o'clock or when you wish your entree to be taken by the public or after dark the breakfast menu is to be expected (thank god for their stellar steamed entrees and fast service).  This place will probably have another sub location close to you in the neighborhood of Webster and I come here every once in a while to come get some deep fried lunch and lunch rolls.  Try to order ahead and when you see we have these before noon just on the table waiting at the front for you.  My favorite breakfast here was the coconut oysters with capers.  There is also a pub stand offering great wine and
restaurant and community center -- on deck that houses the boardroom, seats 30 people for dinner and a huge room -- as well as a hot tub.
There's plenty of seating outside of this restaurant with wooded areas as well as under the tap table. You can see the proximity to the restaurant, this restaurant has been so intimate that at the cocktail party (out of town's version) it only takes 45 minutes for one person to arrive. Then again it may be all about the chips! Anyway you can feel like you're in the setting of A-CHANGED, a little sauced across the stack, very welcoming.If this was a good lunch spot for you, then I would take it!
Wow, if you are a big fan of coffee  but wanted to go the Chicago Coast is a great place to try their original coffee. It's a great place to take a group (couldn't go wrong) but we've been the top 5 table at
restaurant, atmosphere, and customer service. Once we saw the restaurant we left and were promptly seated. I had the calamari and a mini salmon which were great. All was great for the price. They have fun burgers like a million times. The staff is friendly and would love to have some more waiting on us at once as the weather can change.  I want to go back for other occasions where they have got to enjoy the meat every time they put on it! All great experiences that we hope to have again this fall at Bi Calpe from everyone's favorite pub.
Amazing, amazing food.
I go here for birthday.  Oh yeah, to save on hot dogs and their french fries.  But wait, what should I have said about first stop?  Gotta have at least one party here!  It was delicious!
Great joint, but you'll have to wait to go back. As for the price, this place was not the same. 
restaurant of the Week : Bouchon Corgi (superfood, dark chocolate and a bit extra-special meat sausage wrapped in a tomato-fried rice cake-pretty much every restaurant has them) is surprisingly fresh - especially on tap, the best thing to come out of their frying.
Pretty much every McDonald's in the Bay Area has some sort of food that's just enough to make you want to go somewhere else. Then there are the chains. Sometimes, it's just basic French-style food, some really unusual ingredients, and sometimes things are just $12 more.If you have the time (and they probably do), I can't recommend Burger King enough. The service is great and especially the sandwiches and salads are good. Nothing special about Burger King as far as getting a lobster bite or a grilled hamburger. If you're a go-to fast food lover, then this is a place to go.
Amazing place, BEST steakhouse anywhere in the
restaurant. Top off with a side of guacamole & more dried beans.
We did live for a while in the area. Our wyvern moved out pretty quickly and the place is super busy. Now that we are all moving to Europe and to a warmer location such as Paris (the other place i would suggest) this spot is finally catching up.You should see the real Frontera Square lining up..The breading is good but i say as much when it comes to greasy breads  (only stick with white bread though). Steaks is good as well and make it a taste affair.If there is anything about the food that bothers you i wont give it 5 stars for the price but only during Holiday in September when nothing is as good. I do recommend the place if you dont feel adventurous with food but I know they are very inexpensive and I think it is a good place for a great holiday and traditional party and for a nice touch with
restaurant of the week is Nella! All us chefs went to see her at night, but it was clear she was at once anxious and uninterested. I know those apps tend to be somewhat overbearing, but Nella consistently delivered the results that we thought we were paying. She's a good owner, enjoys living in a totally hip neighborhood and is extremely up-to-date on the local cuisine. I'm so grateful I've found Nella's and learned more about the restaurant than the other restaurants in my party, but I'm afraid to order pizza without considering her here!
Great food!! Food-wise, the food, the vibe, I agree with others but it's still ok.
Service has been ok, right?- things are much better than they were in terms of service but we still love it here and want the fresh food. And the staff is big and the service/wish-lists is really great, making sure it's fun for everyone
restaurant. The pasta section has also become my favorite. It is reasonably priced and friendly, but the food. Unbeatable, really?
Had an awesome experience here and it's always busy
Service is just as good as it's always been!  The staff are friendly, with the large size of our party and just a nice ambiance.  We were given a pleasant surprise as well and the vegan marinated chicken is a spectacularly flavorful meal!
Must try this place
this is the closest I have ever been to a sushi spot. more like an omelette spot because i didn't have the option of pho rolls, so i chose pho instead.  it was great and the service was great so we ordered the veggie roll and were pleasantly surprised.  The tofu dish that went for 2 was nothing special and the egg roll dish looked like, oh my god, no!  I have made this dish in my past and it is a perfect
restaurant: 7 1/2
Be sure to check out Southerna for their Crab Blasts.  But before you go, read it! They have giant shrimp and chicken sandwiches, which is high quality food, good service, and no lines to park or carry.  Don't make it so busy because they go to their table on weekends.  Have a picnic with friends if you want to spend a bit more time at this place.  Enjoy your scallops, be prepared to wait and eat several more bites of seafood, which tastes just like it.
I have been going to Mahala for more than 10 years now and since I have been dying to try their pie, I thought I would go here!  This place is small, but the food is fresh and the atmosphere is friendly and charming!  I am visiting Los Angeles for my wedding - I want to impress my husband of about 30 years!  My new girlfriend from the Chicago area also loves the brunch
restaurant, was very nice. The crab cakes were fresh and tasty and delicious.
It's really good the service was great, but the cocktails are a little pricey. I've tried the way this place was raised, but if you don't like being pushed over the edge by an unpleasant crowd. And one can always beat a really good steakhouse on the underground for breakfast.  Pick up their food then.
We got to try this place on our way to work last night. It is a nice surprise and its not especially crowded.  After reading a review on Yelp, I didn't do much more than one of the ordered foods. I thought i wouldn't go back and I was wrong. If you go, just expect a slight wait, usually within about 20 min.  My reservation was canceled at around 6:00AM and the wait was unbelievable. I had eaten there at the company we were with just the past few times we went there and they were obviously not
restaurant still holds the occasional candle-light cocktail at one of their regular sushi spots. Check it out and pass the cash, or check out the chic chic $200 dollar bill!
The pizza is great. On a hot summer day you can truly walk away with a refreshing pizza. The hamburgers were light yet tender. The takeout was not. The chain order was plain to see. We ordered the pizza, which was good but not fast enough for an appetizer to take root. The server was funny and talked about how great the salads are but the prep was no better. The place is not bad. But of course, they use the cashier. It seems like when a pizza place in Michigan gets lots of cash (after closing the restaurant) they use their servers to make sure everyone gets a piece of the pie. And if your around Chicago it's worth it.
Thank you BBQ salad for not being so expensive. The food is excellent!We enjoyed our
restaurant from 3-5pm? I remember my first check: an item that looked like it was at my table by 12, getting notched in while I ate lunch. Not the typical check. But I remember thinking "I'd love to go back" and feeling like I wouldn't even need it again until I ate dinner. I understand that it's hard to get enough reviews on your menu (though I try to figure it out myself), but it isn't that hard to grab more than one, since we all have our plates set. Not to mention that I usually order different kinds of toppings; however, I had a child-ridden sausage that felt like a fool's throwback to a long time shelled thing. Try this all time.
I'm still going here and get the EXACTLY the same great tacos here as last time. Everything is packed, quality and good from what I've seen in the past. My girlfriend and I ordered the Chicken Parm
restaurant.  So, at least it wasn't a "celebration" or "believe it or not" type of place.  Anyway, after taking my order, there were great food choices.  We brought everything in: salmon dishes, fish dishes, breakfast-cake creations.  I didn't order eggs (sweet and crunchy), as I was instructed by the waitress to make them.  Then, the restaurant asked me if I wanted some chocolate chip cookie cake.  Which I think is the best part.  However, it was the second cookie cake that was completely filled with chocolate, which was brought to the table so that my favorite was next to the bakery.  A recommendation from the waitress was that I go back and try this one, to know that the chocolate chip cookie is going to sell out soon.  I will go back to my friend's when we get back.  Seriously, my friend was extremely impressed.  She tried it and everyone
restaurant at the Luxo, and we had it on record with Ruth Steer, owner of Wexford Market. The cook is not on the reservation, he's a little ahead of schedule. Also, not exactly Chirapparooian, which is not something you would expect at a place that does this. The new owner says everyone comes first in the meal but our waiter (his name was Will Frone) has never been on the reservation. We walked over to the kitchen door, grabbed our rolls and each of the 4 out of 5 others held out their hand. We walked down to a table, our waitress all relaxed and tried not to upset or worry about any of the work done by the other tables. We walked over and when we came out with a couple of our tipsters' coats--Nestle was about to use an old item, so we grabbed a $20 plate and, with a bit of luck, it came off of the tables.
restaurant service is good. They enjoy their French Brunch which we recommend. If you want to live in the New Haven area, go here, and try something that is off the menu!
I really like this restaurant, I love the things they do to impress! Highly recommended!!
Can't wait to be back. However, the service is high (please don't be caught on the chipper side for dessert too soon!). This is a destination for 2 people, so you really have to be prepared to wait in line for a long time to get your food!
Living in the neighborhood, I'm generally like "Okay, we thought you might be out of town, didn't you?" and don't take this restaurant very seriously.  I think this is much better for people moving there during a busy time for drinks or a nice place to sit for lunch/lunch and then stop.  The food is not as full as we expected and they should be more attentive
restaurant and food, and are absolutely passionate about food.  Most importantly, they will never stop searching for better deals on any other place in Chicago. We had the morning specials. We would go back with our dogs and burger everyday, and the service is always great. We went with chef Chris Schmitt, and he is a really nice guy. He has great experience and customer service.  Food is a bit of a drag, but everything was delicious. Everything is satisfying, fun, and pretty. Chris is always working hard to bring the Best in Chicago together.

This place is something special!! The service is good and really worth the $$.  I always check around for reservations and they tell us so.  Good atmosphere and nice family atmosphere!
This place is  so darn good i just went back there and everyone has commented about it!
Greatly recommend this place. Perfect chicago mexican restaurant!
Just got in
restaurant and culinary specialty bakery.
Though I love their concept, I do enjoy more Greek food than their food. The atmosphere and friendly staff make the place really special and the food really high quality.  I've eaten at Stone in Washington, and since my first bite of the lamb cheesecake at Spacca I have never seen anything like this anywhere else.  The service is impeccable and friendly and although it's usually crowded you don't have to wait long at the counter for a table and your server could tell you it wasn't always that busy.  Our waiter came by a few minutes before closing time, but was pretty casual about his manners and personality.  Well done to the great Greek food you will only see if you visit my website!
i found this place two or three times and was very disappointed.the cashier was very rude and confused the way i expected him to give me his attention.the salad bar was not very clean and the sauce looked awful after
restaurant, amazing valet parking, great food, and fast service.
I'm not a big fan of the prams but I would definitely give this place another shot. They do have a bit of a bistro and restaurant feel that way.
I have been to several times for brunch. Best options for brunch at my house.  A slight exception however.  The food was amazing and definitely different than a typical burger dish.  The burgers are topped with a bunch of hollandaise and orange juice.  Also fantastic is the great selection of dill and leaves.  Best that comes with a true family tradition.  The beer list just goes to show you all the different beers that you can enjoy for less than half the price.I love brunch here!  I never miss it on my trips.  I must say that I was really excited to try their buffet style servers.  They're just really cute! 
After years of eating the best
restaurant: Made out of an eggplant sausage and butter BBQ sauce. This place is known for their prepackaged goods and unique atmosphere. Delish sandwiches, ceviche, tacos, salads, and of course, our favorite selections of burgers!  Overrated prices.  Wrong dessert?  The worst.  Yes...it's cheap!The service is exemplary at all times, as is the food.  Maybe we should return to the dining room for the desserts, but we're just as impressed as you are.  The waitress is good, always smiling.  I know a few other amazing options we're considering!
My buddy and I dined here recently.  We had a very special dinner that came with the perfect dinner salad. I would go back again.  The salad was AMAZING!   What a difference it made.  The wine list, steak, dumplings, and pepperoni was superb.  My friend wanted to enjoy it
restaurant friendly and fun and very open. By far my favorite restaurant in the entire Chicago area.
Oi tuil sucks.  Normally you get the dish before I am there and they charge a high bill for the card and my sandwich always gets my name (only one overclass guy in all the world can answer me like that).  It is one of those places I find itself at at because of the privacy of having to leave because I am a minority.  If I were to point someone and say "wow! that was actually my one bite into the service I had a great time at (which was also nice since my friend was a very low level population and looked under-appreciated), no one would not be super happy, so that wasn't particularly gratifying.  I also remember when they offered The Sliders  pretty much as good as the Sliders, since we both paid $100.00 for them (although I was surprised that they were
restaurant, that's all I can think of at M&M. I'd like to say the name is "Poker's waltzed", because they have a much better beer selection than we do. If anything the food is not as appetizing. I think there is a unique flavor for each dish I could possibly use, but it's only by a VERY small amount. It's not tasty unless you are full. However if you're partial, you have an incredible experience and if you make that long trip to Davenport, you will find yourself doing just fine.  I'm not going to spoil the food, but they are offering food service throughout the entire restaurant.
I always enjoy this place.  Their pork belly was superb.  And of course they just opened a new new location with good name and new faces.  I love their pizza!
I like all of this place, so if you want more BBQ you can go here and they've got
restaurant are likely, but other than that, who cares about good food and great service? These guys come from UNIA on the street to make our food tastes as fresh as possible. At no time does the food bring people in to pick their priorities. The coffee, sausage, and burritos are great and the quality of the price is as good as the kitchen staff can make it. We have not had to mention cheese rations or cheese soups in three years. We have been here several times.
Great place to get a good night's sleep for $50 a night if you're a diehard outdoor eater.  It's trendy and often packed, and lots of new beers are being brewed and cocktails are made with old wicker pitchers.  If your interested in their wines, these guys seem to be working on something special.  For me, this is the only beer I have ever had and I've never had other beers over $25 that were not amazing
restaurant dinner which in real parables means having no comfort food, served with chorizo, yuca olives and yolk. The ever-well stocked truffle salad was fabulous, the same one on which Jennifer was great. I only had a small change to the skirt that served to my mom, which has now been used for dinner for almost half a year. We got our salmon too, which was a bit dry and slightly dreary, so I'd rather not have had to go through with that than have to get it grilled after a weekday. No disappointment here.This is the only place that doesn't sell wine.
AMAZING  amazing place!!  The best beer selection for that area.  Seriously, I don't even need to go back.  Very convenient service.  MULTIPLAYER.
Amazing breakfast.  my girlfriend said the place was excellent, plus it's open till 10pm but as we were seated for breakfast
restaurant has made a wonderful gift for you. This grilled pork chop is SO tender and you can taste it all of it! THE BEST omelet on the planet. I am not a dumpling, but I do love this dish on occasion.
When I think about Disney dining my mind seems to move on to the incredible food. My favorite Chicago dessert is Crusted Pig, frozen pudding with a specialty marshmallow topping. Perfection and perfect (they roast it in their classic chocolate sauce while the butter and sugar melts), and there is no question that I loved it. The service was great but even more so when it came to the food (I wasn't able to resist filling my mouth with too many treats or dipping them in). I had it with my friend who I kept saying he should try. We did. However, I'm a carnivore so that eats were really negative and I was told not to try anything. We are vegetarian so it was still totally OK
restaurant is highly deserved.
I'm pretty sure I got the wrong sort of setting when my boyfriend and I went there for the night.  There was some party dancing but the hostess didn't take my drunk questions into consideration.    I was told that her staff may be responsible for anything.   They seemed confused, nonplussed, slow to respond and made jokes about the water system.    And while a classy restaurant, the lack of respect from staff during their hour of duty was quite disgusting.   At best it has piss me off.   It also makes me want to go back.  For most patrons who left for the night, someone else was there to watch over the bloody mess and brought a towel on it.  We were seated and declined;  yes, an hour later, our restaurant was clearly covered in feces.  We had to return to the parking lot to get some rest after waiting 30 minutes to arrive. 
restaurant. They seem to love eating me...I cant say that Ive eaten many new schooly risotto and minuscule pasta restaurants like myself...seriously I dont remember each one i know. If it was Yumm, it would be indelibly legible. The meat is horrible, especially the tuna that I ate, but it taste like crap. Even when cooked for dinner my shrimp tasted OK and the soup was fine.You will not have a better time than dinner without any entree!!!! Highly recommend this place.
In addition to putting the best in Brazilian cuisine I always go with French.  I eat more Brazilian food at home and sometimes even get some Brazilian food at my local very neighborhood Mexican joint.  Just FYI  that if you get one out of this country - consider moving to Las Vegas or Annapolis for a better meal.The best part is they are nice to take your order with you so you don't have to sit around waiting for
restaurant at Melville Place -- here's some of the best I've had! I've never been here before but look forward to it if I ever see it again!
http://themgfreakall.com/ and please read what the thought process was and maybe write it down on a paper. The food is good, but the service is a problem. I came here to dine after the meal. The only thing left standing was the intercom's after the fight. Then when I heard they were busy they decided to come and take my order. I went first, then more. The food was nothing special. Not at all the amazing food at Pho Dee Thai! In fact, the amount of this food was soooo much more than it should be. After waiting 20 minutes they brought out my order at that time. We ordered the sweet potato soup and garlic fried egg ravioli. My friend also ordered. Although they made a lot of veggie gravy
restaurant, Chef, at your own risk? I feel like they forgot to speak to my baby's mom or any staff member about the child's choice. I do expect that these special education centers (organizations/calendars, specialty selections, short form sections) have huge work to do with this list and even if they have a plan, they should allow your child to be selected and customized to meet their needs. The blue baget vests were a little too distracting and could have been corrected, but that leaves us with only the bread basket, which we will receive when the chef visits us! I have a buddy who eats at a cooking school and I know a few different styles of bread and he is as well.  Let me know in the comments if you have any suggestions.  If you do not follow our normal restaurant brunch plan, the rest of the restaurants that close to Hopleaf Loop will have more options, but I think this will be a much less
restaurant by the door. So loud and crowded.
My experience in NYC is spectacular. The staff was amazing, the food was great, and the beverage selection amazing. The food was not everything a chef would have thought.  I would definitely make a return, not only for the dinner experience, but for anything else the atmosphere is awesome. What I miss about NYC is the out of town variety, specifically those that are home-brewed.
I've lived there for ten years and each time I come back here I think they need to move fast. It's an amazing neighborhood and the staff is very helpful. Their fresh sea  greens and other dishes will have a special flavor to it. I have had wonderful service from the kitchen and I have never had the great one we have had in-house. They have everything from pancakes to goat cheese rolls. While they certainly have different offerings, they always seem to have the best food coming out of their mouth.
I must
restaurant, and if you don't know what a vegan is, try each one!
In addition to the three categories mentioned above, I must mention that I don't like too many chef-courses, so the menu looks something like this:We ordered our food in the hopes of eating it all and now we have it every time we sit down to eat our food. So very disappointing. Very disappointed in this place. If you're a homophobe it's hard to find a vegan restaurant that wants to bring in exotic ingredients that will make you feel like you've been raised in a paradise.We had good food so far, but the staff is not patient enough to let you tell the difference between authentic and organic food.
Fantastic place. Our waitress was fun and friendly. The bison fries are delicious and it's great to use them for an appetizer. I will be going back and going back for other burgers and bistros. The food is
restaurant location, not happy to disappoint.  We ordered the roasted meat from the back bar and grilled the sauce to perfection.  Just some food, not enough meat for our appetite and not enough food for comfort.  Will definitely go back.
Kurdish cuisine always moves forward, but this one is everything I had planned for it.  I was planning on eating a dish of lamb fat on par with my own, so I was craving the pork and meat combo.  My choices of meat I had were foie gras, garlic with mozzarella and apple sauce.  Overall, their food was top notch.  Fantastic restaurant.  Sushi made for a wonderful evening.
Great place for an Asian feast.  After a long wait, my mother ordered the rice-based entree with a side of beef called Lefang Tomitakes, and she loved it!  She went here when she had a problem, and she ended up getting a 9
restaurant meets hotel cost, we would love for a date at King's. A great partner for one that is a mile from my apartment if possible, make sure they check their running estimate (see if they can fit a couple of dates in). The restaurant had one more person on hand, but the atmosphere was spot on. King's is still one of the nicer upscale eateries in Chicago (even though it is around the corner from my new location). Service was prompt, attentive, and friendly. An array of other desserts were provided, great work and a cute dessert suggestion. Too bad the chefs are off, but there is no need to go back!
Hotels are great, but it's not the place to find a room for a party of 12.  If you're like me, you will find it in less than 1 minute if you're comfortable with relaxed style.
Great food... terrible food... almost as bad as chicken wings or foie gras.... ok
restaurant that closed two months ago. I can't do this Yelp review, but I think it deserves this one. The menu is fantastic; dishes are all great and amazing, and dishes are all tasty, as well. It was on time and was beautifully presented. The menu was done well. Even the national team food was pleasant. We won't be returning.
I spent a lot of time in C.H. this summer with my girlfriend, hoping to get the U.S.I.A. visa for a good time on the weekends. They were accommodating, helpful, and tasteful. I actually felt like I had started a conversation with someone who I believed was an American actually, and was very knowledgeable and knowledgeable about the U.S.-flag. I was more like sounding like I had written my speech for Dr. Maureen Chisholm. For my standard features, I would rate A+ in my house since the beers in the air gave me all
restaurant! If you haven't eaten here, it's hard to beat it.  Try the homemade pasta. I recommend it.  When you go here, remember they make chicken wings!Not too bad! Just like that!
I love this place!! Great food!
It's too crowded if you dont have any friends in the neighborhood. I love this place so much that they have updated the menu from Steak to Wines. The chicken wings that are made at the bar are the only one that is close. The menu changes regularly and it's fairly priced. It's great, too.
Love this place, wine tastebuds are amazing, great wine selection is awesome, and the chefs are amazing. I give my fav dish to every Wine user. If you want to get into a family thing, this is the place to go!
4 stars.  Highly recommend this place!  The bartenders really brought you the amazing cocktails and I loved them!
restaurant with Lajos and had received several reviews.  The restaurant was phenomenal, and I was enthralled.  The menu was the same as in the previous VEGAS location -- usually included in a specific deal -- but this time they had a fresh style of deli for entrees and condiments.  We ate pastas with vegetables and meats, that I can't remember the other day.  Despite the varying options, I found my appetizers to be extremely good and affordable.  The cheese grilled shrimp, mixed baguette bbq and soul-fried "YUM!!" mahi mahi (grilled chorizo).  Lovely, delicious churros!  And the order turned out to be pastas, which was again very reasonably priced.
A side trip to Doug's was as cheap as the most absurd it may seem. The food was perfect.  The salsa was excellent and the seafood was delicious. Everything was organic
restaurant with honey syrup, and complimentary desserts.
All of the menu was very good and the wings were superb.  Their stuffed salad is certainly the best, the tarte soufflé with marinara peppers and spicy fruit juices, and the exotic sherry duck has an interesting and mysterious spicy color, which really adds to the pairing.  But I guess if you want to give yourself free samples of the American artisan wine, there is no place better for your trip!
After spending a year on saturday night trying out restaurants in Mexico, they recently opened in Lincoln Park. Yes, the food is incredible, but nothing quite compares to how great every other Mexican food destination has it. The most obvious example is the fountain pen dessert, which can easily take the place of the indian ravioli and make a meal super romantic. All of my favorite dishes came from the menu. But honestly, if you go there with 2 groups, the atmosphere would be completely different.
restaurant is also a great place for a vegetarian meal with plenty of specialty plates. If there's a large crowd out there, this would be an excellent alternative.
Wow what can I say about this place.  Have waited in 5 days for food!  Please excuse the pun - this place is mind blowing!  Definitely a must- try place for vegans, vegetarians, and large carnivores!
We had a family of 3 and all of us didn't eat their portions (but in the end everyone still ate!), so if we'd gone with an additional group of 4 or 5 we'd be hard pressed to find a better lunch spot on the block. Our server was very attentive and we were more than happy to try a variety of options.My favorite dish was roasted lamb and was sooooo delicious. We waited just over an hour and sat there pretty much alone. And yes, this place is really worth a try!
The food was outstanding. I loved the
restaurant, we received excellent service and a loyal customer.I would go back here, but for a hungry and hungry restaurant, I would rather skip this book of bitcher.
Our sauce is excellent.  We've tried a couple of my colleagues and each one of them had the correct flavor.  I like it a lot, but make sure you order what you want.  That's how I deal with the feel of many different items.  It was fun for us and not everyone wants to live on my plate, but for those in a budget or because they really wanted, my friend and I got the crispy pork breasts steak pizza and it was simply amazing.  I am very glad that our server came to save me a chunk and made us all a party of a lifetime.  So there goes the sauce.  My friend and I always end up ordering something and we always end up loving it.  We can't thank the owner enough for his service and long haul
restaurant...very refreshing atmosphere.  Fresh ingredients and great service.  Highly recommend!
My wife and I were always frustrated with service and delivery times.  Overall the experience is very disappointing.  We had the vegetarian seltzer (including chicken broth) and came out to our table and we ordered the  frozen type.  The refund receipt stating it could take 1 hour for my food (which was given just a few days prior) to arrive was not a clear thing from me to know.  I expected it to take me 3 hours to arrive at my table.  The delivery date was wrong, but when I said that I was going to pick up my other dishes and pick up a spare minute, I thought this was a bad joke.  I wasn't prepared to wait the full 3 hours to return to the table.  As expected, I received my food by 7:00 AM.  I will never go back to the soups we were served at 3
restaurant, delivery, and bar.
For me, I've had this place a couple times before, but never to Grand Street and their special pizza was my favorite! Service was outstanding, too. I went with my girlfriend. However, it was a really good outing.  As expected, we were seated right away. We were seated in perfect standing position at a nice ambiance.
I am a "friend" of this place and I have enjoyed a lot of the  sandwiches.  They do not need much to eat and a beer can opens the door to whole seats.  I also enjoyed the specials on the salad bar which was delicious.I would definitely recommend bringing your own beer to add to your evening!  Good food, decent atmosphere, and a great vibe.
We have been here twice and have loved everything. First one was the salad bar first time we ate there and the second time we were there for brunch, it was a great experience.
I
restaurant in the world. Loved the cheese dishes and everything. Try the usual menu changes with a creamy roll. I came here when I was offered the option to try breakfast, mahi mahi, salmon, or salads. The prices are reasonable and worth it.
this place is unique, but  it's  very good and  it's  one of the best selection of bussin america. The ambiance is great as well as the service. Everyone else loved this place  and was a non-pleb to try everything on their first visit, yet, she still  enjoyed her breakfast because it's so nice, she was then having the same experience with the members of staff. I'm a veg lover and the meal deals with allergies, this place just really makes a difference, I can't wait to come back to Chicago.
After 3 great dinners with their rich courses and so many fabulous desserts, I went there last night (24th February
restaurant and many other wonderful things.  They also have to say that for this evening we ate more of the salad than the previous night.
We always try to look as big as possible with the DxCo. When we're seated on the patio of the pub or in the back area, our bill always goes to 3.  Our bill may actually go up by 2, but the owners agree on the 4 servings of food.  Everything was packed very well, and the closest we got to a car was a BYOB BYOB car park, which was great for parking, as well as parking lots.  However, once inside, the owner's setup was different.  He added in three wide benches, of which one was well outside of the outside.  The bar area was quiet, and the only noise you could hear was in the outside.  There were loud plastic tables and chairs outside the restaurant, not like the other tables where the restaurant is located. 
restaurant and service from a true classic. I always get my order before I get my food to the table and get the full experience for just about every flavor. A bit out of flavor, but I do get the complimentary green beans and salsa enchiladas that they gave me. In fact, my friend and I get the salads that I ordered for dessert. I am constantly impressed with their options. Always very attentive, reasonably priced, and every customer is in every flavor. Definitely worth a visit.
Good coffee to go with a date.. maybe next time.. would be glad.  Their salad bar is just outstanding.. good great drink  You'll be able to taste their blend too.
Love the cafe food, very cool place... and take reservations.  One complaint is the price (10k is pretty expensive, even for a one night run), we tried two of their favorite dishes (churros, or veggie hot dogs). It was really, really un
restaurant is phenomenal and highly recommended!
It's really nice that they open up since they're open in a very quiet lot.
Great seafood is great.   We ordered shrimp and were immediately pleasantly surprised.  The slices were good and incredibly small, and we were generous.  We ordered the rib shoulder ribs (which were well seasoned and had egg filling), which were both excellent.  They will almost always order something low to medium fat, and again they were super generous, especially with the extra pork belly ribs which, at 25 pounds, were so amazing.  Yum yum!  Overall, a must.
Sushi is awesome!  Ive been coming to Shibuya for the past several years and haven't been disappointed.  Once we move out of your hotel/corner of the family's house, the sushi is so nice, the owner is always on hand to cook me sushi, rice etc.  Now that I get back, even
restaurant, and I don't care that way! The decor is lovely and not too dirty and I know a lot of these fancy restaurants that look empty and do service a little bit too slow but don't think that the restaurant looks like it needs a new roof.   There is a ton of beer bar seating!  Like other places I've been, they charge the kids just under $35 for it.  Well, honestly, it's just..., a little too good for me.
I went to this restaurant yesterday and it was great, but I wish I had a table in the side to take some part of the meal to the dining room.  I wasn't disappointed as many other reviewers had already said that this place only serves the dinner meal. The dinner and dessert portions are pretty generous too. It's still light and warm, it just got a bit more racy with the staff, but we love the meal and decided not to go back.
I
restaurant and changing from one sushi specialty to another has always been a pleasant experience. The food is made in-house by experienced chefs. Whether you like freshness, seasonedness or simplicity, nothing is too dissimilar to their usual good quality of food. The glass kabobs are simply delicious. Every dish we had was crafted to perfection, from the seasoned lobster to the cauliflower brownie to the amazing arugula brioche. The food was simply amazing and fun!
So many options to choose from on a busy busy week when the weather is hot, so few places in Chicago to take you downtown. If you like big cocktails or fancy ambiance, this restaurant is for you!If you want the best Chicago Bar food, Bistro is the place to go. If you are a killer with the best (and you are only thinking about the fries and sandwiches) then this is your place to go. All the owners from across the country and around the world are
restaurant for all living things!
I like to try new things a lot and this is one of my favorite establishments in Chicago!   The staff is very friendly and the people here always have amazing food.  I would definitely go back!
Me and my husband and I were at Bigglese's last night. I will never go back.  The burgers are incredible and it is very crowded in there.  The frites are perfect!
Cheap cashier who sucks and cares about food. I've been craving these wings, and haven't had any star, but they are the absolute best!! I have heard good things about the whole turkey, and if this is good, I'll never leave. I love beef dishes.I would definetely recommend them to anyone who has a hungry stomach.
Superior latin boyi.Awesome staff, great food.High prices and high quality!If you are coming here for lunch, try saying THANK YOU
restaurant: MAVAPAS!!! AND WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT TO DO?? Or do you want to fork over a little while? Can't wait to go out for fun. Also, the less asked questions tend to be interesting, and might very well make the waitress point out the contrast between a grilled cheese sandwich and a crepe sandwich (a gut reaction).... and it's still on very good old Schenectady terms as we speak! ;) We are very fortunate that we can get in to those on Saturday nights, and we can't go wrong with the rest of the show.
First of all: We've been here a lot, had the will to travel to some of the places from Chicago and Loyola and we weren't disappointed. The food here is outstanding and the service is always excellent, not to mention the server's first instinct is to give you a kick in the ass. The little steakhouse is especially delicious, possibly a one-time
restaurant option from 11pm-6am to save you time!
Great Riesling!! 5 star rating! - October 10, 2011Great, fresh, affordable riesling, everything in the store. Handcrafted, courtyards, art and decor are timeless. Art is the highlight, and the atmosphere, including some dining tables, is huge - somewhere between cozy and cramped. Two excellent busses are always running around looking for a table. All around friendly staff, great service, and a variety of frugal options.  Great food, and great food - the most expensive I have ever had on a Sunday.Thank you Begg. - October 8, 2011Great job! - October 9, 2011WOW! - October 11, 2011wif me here - November 3, 2011.
If you are looking for great food and that's how you get me, this place is for you. I'm nothing special but I have been here many times as
restaurant), perhaps because it is open three days a week and also because it is on a weekday so it is more convenient to eat in a park. The prices will vary a bit based on what you are going to eat. I personally like to order an early meal,  I do not like having to deal with prices at that time.   The chefs do a great job and often eat large groups of people.  Also don't let it run your entire dinning table!  I usually put down my order first and then return, so that when we leave the waiting guy is at least prepared to wait.  Some other favorites for me is the Mustard Rind Roto, also known as the Scarabbuddy Rio or "Riparama Roja".  If you happen to be going to a wedding and your order is for two or three, the worst thing to do is leave your order out.  At best you will have five extra people waiting
restaurant menus for different sauces, meats, and desserts. Each offer its own unique assortment of special options.

I love a nice and not-so-good afternoon, especially when visiting for the visit.  The food is well done and tasteful.  I mean don't waste your time and money there.  The scene is a bit different than when I frequent the Suburbs but just excellent food and service!
if you are traveling with friends then I will not be surprised at all. The decor on this place is pretty cool but overall the decor is quite under-rated at best.  If you are new to a place with that sort of vibe or someone with something with a mean attitude then maybe this place will not disappoint.
For some reason, Gini Noodles isn't open on weekends, so I've been unable to get them open since I've moved there, which I love, but I'm disappointed. I mean, I would take a

restaurant and if you want a spanish oven sausage this is the place.  They're also lucky enough to have a $7 lower quality meat here which is the reason they don't have to list the crust to get their main star for dining at this place - they make everything very high-quality - they didn't just start doing that the way it does now.  Sorry. -They serve your food even before you order it.
Just found the last hole in the wall of two old bread machines, as I've been there twice and it's never been greasy and greasy! Awesome service, elegant decor, amazing service, well we just ordered in the morning, but never got the filling!  Friendly man, especially if you don't live in Chicago - he's lovely, he can set you up when you call, is the only person who knows what they're doing! But.  Mmmm.....
Just need a guest. I'm the youngest girl,
restaurant is great! From the shrimp sushi to the enormous salad bar, I prefer Blue River Grill.
Hep.great food and tasty food.  Dinner: Steakhouse Grilled Chicken, homemade-rosa, 'bouche breakfast/dry shakes/beer/sauce (vanilla?), oyster/potatoes/crisp (another amazing dish), whiskey cocktails (the other was $15.50) and my fiance bazillion, bartender (most cocktails are $12) is an absolute gem.  The last time we made reservations, he forgot what he ordered and that's a big plus as well.  We also had a very good experience, too.
I've been to this restaurant every day since I was 17. Now I'm a certain way, so this is where I get my thumbs down.  Food was excellent, service was great and service was always better than what you'd expect from a fast-casual pizza place
restaurant and welcome lunch and dinner here," said Glenn Gage, one of the managers. "The place is very pretty and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. They are knowledgeable with regard to the Ethiopian dishes we order and can give us more suggestions for different dishes. There are some spots on the menu for adult variety items, but most of the Ethiopian food here is uni-style, if you are in the mood for something real. A very downscale Ethiopian place with a very casual feel and fantastic service with great wines and amazing restaurants."
GOLDBALL is on the move, just the sort of place we'd like to see more locations in our neighborhood to do away with. My wife and I chose one of their restaurants from our recent trip to Chicago and now we're looking forward to welcoming guests.  The food is fabulous and flavorful, so we're excited for their other place to open, too!
Food is outstanding, atmosphere is nice and comfortable, and the food
restaurant/gary-man....$30 in popcorn/taste.1295/Wed 12/05 - 11/19 - Take 6-9 people $6.20 is ok and they also have a limited variety of specials all season (not bad for $2 tables)&will probably just cater for a lot more....then... YOU WILL NOT KEEPING THEM AWAY!!! Worno, Christ-.....Don't go there!!! This was our last trip and an unexpected worst-case scenario for us.... most drinks the food was ok(I didn't order anything other than and a small package of mimosa shirazu!!!!)... and the servers were slow so I didn't really have a chance to eat until the middle of the evening...and because I arrived with my boyfriend, I wasn't hungry, my buddies were eating... and they said the mango shirazu is okay and no one else had that thing that wasn't actually mango..
restaurant is upstairs.
Most bad food here has to be one of the worst I've ever eaten. First off, I'll never order on any of the appetizers they use. If you're going to dip your party in sour cream, I'm not going to go there. Some changes though: Special orders get rolled out based on the order and menu. If you don't find any special orders, wait until the weekend before placing your order. As it turns out, neither is really the case and take your party to a steakhouse on Tuesday (where most of the dogs go). They usually have specials on 4 or 5 courses. When they make you its based on the meats. The food always tastes good and the duck are great. Especially if you love good duck, baby. Nothing special here.
I love this place.  So stoked I'm sharing a HUGE date.  My name is Charlie and I've been coming here for 3 years now and we can't
restaurant in my native town. I can't recommend it enough. Everyone that I went there had a very special, complimentary, and memorable experience! I've had some very good deals here but that came almost quickly. Not bad, really! I can't wait to go back for dinner and enjoy food while I'm in town.
Best Chicago coffee shop, the owner is great, and the hours are just an hour long, but well worth the whole trip.  Come on, you have to come in mid-day, 6-7 pm to try one of the many on-site brewpubs. 
this is my dream restaurant...friends tell me one star for the food, I haven't had the chance to try it yet..  one of the waiter is strange, basically like what she is doing..its so bland...definitely not what i was expecting..
best carne asada ever..  only one star for food, really.. soggy
restaurant ready for the big night.

This place is awesome!  Staff is always knowledgeable and helpful, and the tasting menu is delicious and tasty.  We got the Pliers Neapolitan and the Flagellator.  Also delicious is the Basil Rossoli.  However, a little food isn't great!  Some of the things you can order there are lukewarm: 1) Garlic Parmesan - not great, but incredibly satisfying and flavorful.
My boyfriend and I have been craving pizza all summer.  We ordered a pizza one night and it was... okay, I guess we thought we'd just melt a 1/2 of a pie, but this one topped off a culinary triumph!  I also had the Guacamole and the Sauvignon Blanca on the dine-in and without question, an amazing meal.  And this is what we got: raw sweet onion, bacon, and canned tomatoes, dressed in sour
restaurant                                                                                                                                                                                                     
restaurant at this restaurant, I'm hungry, and my order was easily to die for.  Wasn't all that expensive, but I got the garlic crab which was an awesome fix!  I don't know why they didn't do the fettuccine which I think was a bit bigger than what I ordered it from as it was but I thought it was a bit overpriced. I'm a big fan of the Coast flavor selection that they have, especially with the rosemary which I thought was a little too salty and which I know my lips are going to be watering down. My girlfriend had this minty place with their caesar salad which was also delicious, and the vegan option which was great too! Definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for vegan comfort food with interesting ingredients.
This place is BYOB and YOU GET ONE! Worth it! We started out with several of our friends and because we were hungry the waiter took a bite of our place. We brought
restaurant, amazing scallops, and allureingly cheesy yummy treats. It was hard to get through the course of an hour and there were literally 7,000 pounds of food, but that's ok because the restaurants are so packed.  My favorite part of Malibu was the shuttles I've been going to since I moved in for the first time, and there was literally a car waiting for me at my place.  The food wasn't the BEST, but worth every penny.  I've been here every night for about 7 hours, and honestly I'm pretty disgusted.  I've been there twice for 2 months now, and haven't been disappointed.  If you're looking for good service, theres no need to go.
There is a lot of wealth in Visconti. They have six walkable bus stop, but the reason why there are so many is because their food is so good. The quality of the food is outstanding.
restaurant/Pizza/Food. I would highly recommend going there.  For a great deal, ordering from the menu at your table is worth the wait and the wait staff can be seen on-lookers as well. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. The lighting, music, food and drinks, and overall ambiance is very friendly.
I love this place.  It's one of the most fabulous places on Chicago street.   It is a little slow to get in but once you've waited the food is very tasty and you'll have plenty of options.   After taking a few days with family and friends this place became a friendlier place.  If I could get five stars I would give it five.
I am definitely a Foodie. I love the Artichoke and Specialty cuts that tend to be inconsistent and often only serve sandwiches.  I have the Palacabras ($9), Rabbit meat ($11), Yellowfish PB&J
restaurant. Everything was  good and the group of us was happy.  We followed the other parking space at Bartenders Village for  some meat like dinner, sandwiches and desserts.My companion was happy and sat by a desk across the table from us and had a quiet evening.  It was a good meal for a geezer though.
Very good. My wife is over cooked. My family has been there a long time and each of us cooks regularly and this place has nothing but good food and excellent service.  The second time I ordered the watermelon churrascata had better ingredients than the first place. Service was good, they were friendly and helpful.
Love this place!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!! But I have been here a couple times and never really had much respect for either of the wait staff. Now I'm not sure what to call it, but this is a great seafood restaurant! It is absolutely phenomenal, the waiter is friendly, great chefs etc
restaurant for the money, everything is special.  Even though it's early-night there aren't many who have dining reservations and we won't be moving back to live-in locations.  The environment is beautiful as well.  We recommend the solid and fun baked goods and deliciously the grilled cheese.  All together, this is my favorite restaurant in LA.
Best Brazilian sushi    i've ever had   Last word is at 2pm.  It's a killer place.  Loved the unusual size of the sushi and w/special requests from family and friends.  I am glad my boyfriend and I have two kids now.
The location is both amazing and beautiful. We love our own shack!
I love the fried, paralie or vinegar mac & cheese they have for some reason the lime juice is SO good!I hate this place for you guys. In fact, I'm going to wade through 10 star reviews to keep trying
restaurant and drinks I would never call it that.
Well every single night, I've been there. Maybe I was drunk when I took the flight and I just couldn't bring myself to wait. Which is why I found out it wasn't my place that many nights were tough.  During my visit, however, the service was great, and it certainly improved my drinking experience during the course of the next five nights.  I also recommend taking advantage of the City's $20 per person ride if you are a-boozy.  I can't really rate the restaurant's recommendation.  But you know, honestly I'd do it over the normal weekday nights.  The one I had there was lousy.  The night before we got there I had a great idea of what it looked like.  It was a kitchen square, but lacked interior decor...too bland for that redefined diner look.  The manager said it looked like The Butcher who were remodeling the restaurant
restaurant: that's the real deal.  We met my fiance at an intersection on my way to work and she just sat back in my seat, gesturing and bawling because of the customer service.  The problem was there weren't enough chairs in the place to accommodate our 3 cats.  We took an hour to order, but the tables were high with snacks and sandwiches.  You think that at your location, when the flu attack is fairly cold, they're less likely to treat you just like their clients.   If I really wanted to help, I could have bought the cooler and dine there instead.
Not like LA to live in, its like emblazoned, it's from Chicago. When it comes to emblazoning things, we do not like it, it sounds like you may need to dine there, but like I said, its no fun. I agree with Eve Bunt on this one, it reminds me of sausage
restaurant, but great prices and good staff.  It also has some decent sushi options to try.  Its always great to wait!  As an appetizer I really enjoy the Korean style beef which my server went over immediately.The dogs are good too, and their specialty is sauerkraut!!
I started coming here last week for dinner after browsing through a very large selection of Yelp reviewers. The staff was kind, friendly, attentive, and helpful. At their peak however, this spot is out of this world.  I called about 5 to 10 minutes before the 30 minute wait took place and the manager came in and informed me that the wait was over 2 hours and for the sectionions you needed to sit in front of all the waiter's area. His answer was that it was for the sectionions - unless it's $1 I can't do it, it's a terrible wait.If you live near Yucaohua, be prepared to pay the tab
restaurant said the state of residence, combined with the solid line of parking which usually follows our drive, made the experience extremely enjoyable. After heading out the back door, it took the pleasantries of the waitstaff to send me out to do my dressing.  It took about 25 minutes for the wait to get over.  It was 10 am when we made our way back to the store and told them the line was over.  I couldn't believe how many servers still waiting at that very spot.  I'd have been honored if they kept up the pace.  It was a complete relief to know that this location was still open for a bit when we finally got there the next day. After our seated entrees, I ordered the appetizer which was served with plenty of restorative olive oil, and was chock full of original yummy ingredients.  What an appetizer.  I had the hot dog wrapped in a soggy roll and tasted the flavor of the
restaurant" at the bar - it wasn't delicious and for that I am glad I would be taking my patrons from another place... 
Glimp....but worth every penny!  Great food, so much fun, and nice atmosphere.  B&W though the salad bar is more of a common mark of a restaurant.  This is probably my go to dinner place because the chips are good (casual, and cold!) and the staff is really nice and helpful.  It's close to a restaurant and food is always fresh.  Very fresh, delicious food.  You won't feel overwhelmed anymore, and it's possible to go out of your way to avoid any wait.  Loved it!
Before lunch I had been the client at Fogo Ngo for 15 years and it was definitely gone.  I had eaten there and will eat there again.  After my lunch of course, I decided to go with friends to put the dish down. 
restaurant) and I will be back to savor, drink and eat whatever I want here! 
Delicious food and service. I will definitely go back and try the soups for pizza and pasta. The perfect match for the diners.
Service was much-loved, good prices and you can even sit in the front patio of your room for the same meal. The point is that I was staying late at the bar and had no business waiting to move from a room next door to someone's or party. The owner was very nice, friendly and got you everything you wanted in the kitchen. The potato rolls were delicious and even made me feel old. As to service, they were exceptional, customer service was phenomenal and the service was outstanding.Our server and his man were so attentive to the food. He made it so we could have every share that we could think of for ourselves and had a wonderful time. We got reservations and we called ahead to try all kinds
restaurant. I didn't love the cocktail service at all, but the staff was great and made sure to order me something in the right order as I'd have to rush at it with a mate before my birthday.
Porko Delish is hard to compare. But I did love it with the extra wine and not have to wait too long at night.  I hate waiting for the potato to become used as a topping, so the only thing I'd would do differently is order the ketchup instead of the onion.  It's definitely spicy food that works as well.As much as I like their burgers, they're made with about the same olives on the side.  It takes a little while for them to return their money for dinner to the get it, but we got the potatoes anyways...  Overall an ok meal.
i've never been disappointed with this place but i really have to suggest the seafood dish is phenomenal. and if your looking for a quick
restaurant. 5 stars, is he the place to go for lunch and dinner? Wow, well that's a choice I guess.
Love this place!!The atmosphere is still great and the service has been great. The flavors are almost totally good. BUT have the shrimp. This is one of my favorite BBQ places in Chicago.
Amazing food!
Absolutely love this place!  Great little spot!
EVE IS A GREAT POINT FOR MY DINNER DINNER-TO-GO!  If you're a music lover, you are hooked.  Two blocks away you can eat at O'Brien's on G.
It's great fun and it's great people! However if you're looking for a place to have great eats and great service, this is the place to go. Always order the lemonade, if you love house juice and it's light enough, you can skip there. Don't expect the price to go up though, in fact the
restaurant and its premises were a total mess. We must return to celebrate her birthday.
This place has so much to offer.....lovers of pan pan koryaki and beef, but misses the beefy side of the fish....it takes extra time to get to the platter. My boyfriend wants to be sure, but we asked him one last time who came in the next Monday to check if he wanted to bring the only chicken for lunch......he said hes trying to cut and taste sooo good... He needs to wait another two hours and pay for the pork....lol...
I think this place is great.  I've had a lot of great food and from what I've heard, this is a fairly clean and reasonable restaurant.  The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, knowledgeable and knowledgeable as well.  The food is tasty and the prices are reasonable.  At the end of the day, this is a great spot to go.  The parking is not as
restaurant. Delicious food and service that is not old school, and the Red Carne Asada is absolutely delicious.
There are a lot of people watching this establishment on TV.  A lot of us know there are going to be people going out, just as likely is the baby line going to die on the street, though many more are going to come.  I've heard that 5 times, it's all a question of what kind of family you've got (big on family), and I know that will be more than true.The service is great, but there is always someone taking a hip seat.  Expect to spend the whole evening out of town, waiting to be served or served in the wide open.  The average patron is young and not rich, and if you are less fortunate, you are entering a quite special world where art is celebrated and small-town charm is acknowledged.I have tried everything but that is not the next page of my novel.

restaurant: Sausage cheese at the tip with lemon wedges.  Seriously.  Nice idea to have your picnic in a little setting with some chips and fettuccine.
I am a very frequent visitor here, and enjoy their unique steaks. I have never been to a steakhouse before. My favorite from the market is the Black Lincoln Farm steakhouse. I also regularly have the Chicago Pork Chop joint, or they have veggie sandwiches, and they are always flavorful with flavor.  I've had the Black Legion Steakhouse one time, and when they opened I gave the steakhouse a try.  I would really recommend taking them at some point.
Food, Service & Taste Fantastic!Everything in here is great! Try the "pastry experience" - cooking for dinner, shopping for pizza etc. - and maybe you'll eat there!!
Definitely the best steak in the city. If you are in town, you might want to bring the
restaurant. I remember feeling deliriously happy with my visit to this restaurant!
Excellent food, friendly staff, great atmosphere, and great atmosphere is all I can say about it. Great combination of tourist content, taste, and flavor.
I've been to several of the best gourmet gourmet gourmet restaurants in Chicago. No complaints! The wait staff was friendly and helpful. Great atmosphere, great food, great food service (really attentive!).
Went there on a whim for a birthday party and this was it. I was a vegetarian which meant I was really hungry, so I took me with me on a mission to feast on the combination of food. Our bill was $12.00, not including gratuity. We had been to many of the world's best restaurants (YUM!), and our server had some of the best presentation and general experience I have ever had, all wrapped up in a simple coffee mug for dessert (sorry!) and delicious coffee (sorry
restaurant) to make a speech by name! Next time you go take a moment and listen!
I am truly sorry I didn't rate the place higher.  They thought they could do better than good pizza places, but in reality they have to put forward a couple of mediocre pizzas to justify their very low rating.  I love my first time on the street.  I don't have time to eat here anymore.  They should give us some hell.  Some of my favs for pizza: -Red Pizza with pork belly (like Tomato, Crisp, etc.). -This pie is the best Italian pizzas I have ever had.  I have to say that the sauce is fresh and the cheese is something special that the kitchen has to pass by - The best Brazzazu in the world, lamb chops, Spaghetti and pizza were all at home with me.  And the "homemade" pizza was absolutely delightful.  I will definitely return.
restaurant is rather spot on. While the food is great, you can't really beat the salad bar in the food bar, which is much better than an all-you-can-eat salad bar. Service is prompt, friendly, and charming. The beer list is not bad either.  The food is fantastic and I always have the opportunity to try the beer selections from the vendors' booths.The Pizza joint is the best in Chicago. The place is friendly and inviting. The food is flavorful and not out of place.
I finally got a gb dish to be honest.  These were all real good.  A little pricey but not a huge deal for the price.  Nothing I could have been sold on was even remotely worth it.  That said, I am very excited about the return policy.  When I come back, I will re-try the La Falce.  The food is delicious and the salad bar is good.  Good chinese sauce
restaurant for $17-$15, par the sausage sandwich to $9-$10. One thing that they also bring in is noodle soup.  I like to go with something from the smaller plates, so we can ask for more potatos or some pasta sauce.  A small appetizer like beef pancake with green peppers leaves a bit of a chunk of cheese, but I prefer the white salsa (watery syrup, like white vinegar mixed with sugar/water).  Some pretzel crackers you can buy, but I always go with the golden cracker, which I usually end up taking home.
best pizza I have ever had. ever. who knows why I only go once a month for work, but waitresses are awesome. they are always awesome, thank you!!!! yum!!! they got a real win with black beans for appetizers, dalago de posh was great for lunch, appetizers and desserts. great overall food, atmosphere and good staff
restaurant, unusual food, different kinds of valet waiting, an experience we were very disappointed with.  We weren't provided with any ticket because we were just setting up to get our tickets, which included two different valet orders.  By the time we got our tickets, it was too late.  Fortunately there were only two people here and were not in an area to swoon.  After we received our tickets we were greeted with dismay by a waitress who was visibly annoyed with us.  When we approached the table, she initially took exception to the fact that I had no business ordering anything other than beer.  But as we waited for her to stand up, and began to drink all of my beer, she finally pointed out that she was going to put the entire reservation at our table and order something else.  Her glass came out empty, and we just stared at her.  She continued to be apologetic while waiting for us to be seated.  When we
restaurant was consistently excellent, beautifully prepared, and open (it's been several years!). The proximity of their owner was great, and the healthy atmosphere of the restaurant made them a favorite of both the neighborhood and the Brazilian foodies.
For the price, you have to give this place a try.  It doesn't just look like Chicago with it's new Curves.  It's not meant to be that.
I've been coming here many times this year and I've never had a disappointment.  The waiter gave me the first bite of the sauce I ever had and the pastry was delicious.  Although the food was an improvement from the last time I was here, the service and the special occasions really carried over to the meal.  I think my server was overwhelmed by the attention, humor and company that she brought to the meal.
cafe pho te was fantastic  it was the atmosphere and the food was amazing!i wish they had a more traditional menu
restaurant too, it's delicious!The sandwiches are great and look wonderful. I ordered the meat sandwich which had amazing flavors!All in all a great time!I also ordered the fruit pancakes. This was a great recommendation from me and tasted like a different type of cake/cake. If you're craving fruit pancakes but have to go on a rush to try several flavors than the old fashioned french toast is the place to try it!For dessert I ordered all the fruits and I personally think they're a bit too soft but it was really tasty. If you're on the go you should try them! :)
I've been reading both stories of Hawaii Buddies. I also read the part about Jaws. I get it. They're a lot of things and I'm not so much into "other options". What do I just enjoy? All I get are the desserts. So if you're looking for a special occasion party like AWE, this place will certainly make you happy
restaurant, it was almost as bland as the general sandwich. Nothing a diner like it to have, and also delivered with the kind of mushy fresh butteriness you'd expect from a place like Graham Elliot. They have really good cash register, and you can order it from me. Finally, when we order some chicken we have a soda on the table. Honestly, I love how they use it; I'm really pleased they are doing that. Do I have to go back? Well, that's up to you. As someone who knows this place, what do you expect in an upscale bar? I think that's a bold choice for a casual bar with a large crowd, and considering that I have never been to this place, they have to call the line.
I would have never finished for lunch without this place! After my mom and I went there on a Friday night, it had four separate sandwiches served (three sandwich items). The sandwich came with three different ingredients.
restaurant, like la's famous Puccella, you don't get a drink in downtown KFC. I love the sense of...it's small, has low lighting, we're all visually impaired so the inside is also fairly dark and dim when we're on the coffee break. It's what kind of person would go into a KFC without a drink, and at Burger King, when you want a big opening, you're not in a hurry.
i love this place. they are great. you can order on the menu and they are a lot in the way to the menu.the employees are nice. their meals are super thin, and very expensive.great atmosphere.extra credit for the new 3 other nice places i haven't been to yet.
Great food, great service, & affordable prices. 4 stars, yes we are on our way and if we could see something to complain about during a potential meal, we would... change the pizza, knife the bread
restaurant. I didn't like that they had an outdoor patio that closed sometime after 10:00 until 11:00 on weekends and our guests ended up eating better at their table than they had once in their lives.
Tite Ma-Fries take pride in being a Mexican place.  It is the only place in Chicago I have gone to for breakfast/dessert and I am pleased with all the amazing new items.  Don't go to some kinda connoisseur who thinks Mexican is better than pork or meat and you're going to be disappointed.  All I can say is, don't go to this place and don't forget to bring your Chinese friends and treat yourself to some good authentic Chinese cuisine.
Wait, wait a minute.  Is this FoodFC?  Not sure.  Get what you want here - No complaints about the wait at this place.
my god this place is so good the last 5 min served dry and they cooked it up
restaurant, but at the same time we've also had some great cheese! They have been there before and it's quite small. Great wine selection. Always really out of the loop, good music choices, a serene atmosphere. I'm not sure I could have ever been as excited to go to Lasagna today.
+ Service: 3 stars so far, quite a change from the usual 5 star rating.  What a disappointment that all those crab cakes are here and they are an absolute disappointment!  If you want a pasta dish stuffed with Parmesan and various flavors of deep dish dish pasta, or need to top off with a little olive oil or sardine, this is the place!
If you're looking for breakfast without a single star, get here.  These were good.
The food here is great! As a fan, I am always eating here and trying different kinds of food.  The last time I went here was when I was really young (
restaurant should be great. They have a tiny booth. Its very inviting to check out.
Some people loved this place, especially the desserts. I just felt like they were perfect to reflect my social non-superfast friends who have a very different set of teeth than me. Also, you have to wait a long time to go, because the food is hot and gets really crowded the longer you wait.
I have tried every Chinese restaurant I have ever eaten in Chicago. From lobster rolls to shanghai wai rolls, both are amazing. The Shaw kung-fu line is addictive. When I see them again, they will never be forgotten.
Happiness is based on a difference in perceived quality. I would recommend this place to anyone living on the East side. In Chicago, the coffee made from its own milk and fresh cane sugar is too hot for us.  That may be because the cane sugar in the coffee is especially steep.  But I digress
restaurant, which is different from a sushi bar.  The menu is kept going, of course, even though some service issues have prevented it from being a full-fledged dining experience.  Many people may tell you the food in Japan is inferior, but I found that when this is the case, the staff is totally exceptional.  Despite its shortcomings, the sushi here is outstanding and the drinks are great, too.Overall, I am in love with this place!  After sitting in the eatery for quite a while, I finally decided to put the experience here.  Definitely worth it.  The waitstaff was fast and they treated you like royalty, and that's what this place was about!  When you go by this place, take advantage of the complimentary interior art displayed at every step of the way.  They should remodel and remake the interior and bathrooms, too.  No wonder I call this restaurant SO, SO BACKSTORE!Overall, I'd say
restaurant for Desserts at Big Bo's (769) 567-4550.

This place is BYOB so nice and provides us all the tastiest ingredients.  We love the spot they serve eggs cooked in and what taste like sesame seeds, beans, and dried fruit.  Their cheese is crisp and flavorful, making it a good place to run their meals or to have a great meal for a friend.  The food is great, yet comfy and just the right size to suit every occasion.  We all bring a pair of sundaes so we can enjoy some great food together.  That's the reason why we come here; to make the world a better place!  I always like the table near home with the chairs, tables and chairs.
Beautiful Choccy.  When it comes to visiting from topless I'm recommended the vanilla dessert.  However, it gets a bit stale because you have to wait so long
restaurant: yummy rabbit. It was just so cute and happy!
My wife and I had the beef ragu. It's everything that I could have wanted in meat ribs. They made you feel like you were in heaven! After us, after it was ready, I asked to go back and try the pork salad but the waitress told me to wait. Then I asked her if there was anything special. She said it was duck breast and that was great.We took a bite and they were delicious. The salad was the best I have ever had but we made another 1 or 2 appetizers.After we ordered the Ribeye, the beef pulled pork served over it was not huge but the meats were ok. Maybe in a big bowl, or of a bag, I like small taste but not a big mouth watering taco. I wish we had some good crow, ribs, and tortilla chips in there.
Delicious Chicago Salsa food is excellent!  Try the
restaurant. Because I thought I had lived and ate outside of a restaurant it was great to try Italian food and a great place to share a delicious dish. My buddy Gersh said that it is such a great deal that I can take him to every restaurant that I am in that takes great care of their food. And I do not mean by a lack of need. Everyone knows by experience that all of this food is delicious and always serves its best. Just to make sure that I am eating better, we went here twice a month with a friend (well thought you). Two reviewers came here together and recommended the place. Everyone should come to this restaurant! We went first. My friend's friend and I used to go to Napa to visit but they didn't have a record for its patio and did not have the water and decor. She went to Red Rock Estates. We both went for a beer dinner (which was, after all, good too) and were told
restaurant looks so great! What a wonderful tasting and have been back with many friends!  Anytime I go back I am going to try this place!
Food!! As the name implies, this has been my favorite Ethiopian restaurant for years.  Whether you're trying to figure out how to run your business, or just know that an Ethiopian food store has to cater to a tight schedule, i got the flipside. First of all, your average establishment is set up with cash register for charges, then you have to pick up your food and have a table before you even eat!  On a budget, they have more value for money, not so much good food.  I have heard some people say, come on, they've made a meal before.  If you don't like something that you order, don't be worried.  If you're going to a business without a good Ethiopian food store and food, get one like Frontera then go with the other
restaurant
Renesque and relaxed. I love the menus and have eaten here a couple times. I also like the complimentary gift certificate for servers that have gone to school at Waco and I cannot get enough of them!The bread that serves with the broccolini bread made with fresh fruit, high in fat, and warm. The wine that I tried is very good as well. I was also very impressed with the wine selection, but I also found that some of the wine selections could be a little bit overwhelming if not for the good tasting wines on the bill (best selection, but sometimes will be better)So, here is to $30 for just a $30 roll. Other than that I do not regret it.
Before I get into this place, I want to apologize for catering my friend's birthday dinner to all the different taste buds within. This hostess turned out to be a pop culture icon and was extremely patient during her first date (given she was the
restaurant types, both (ioso and fine dining). Prices are reasonable, though, and very casual. The customer service is excellent, very pleasant and good. Overall a fairly good seafood joint.
It wasn't our kind of restaurant to give you a discount, just like most of my friends did, but it had enough for us.Our pick of pizzas were vegetarian, organic, and only had some garlic (croutons, pepe, etc.).The food was absolutely delicious! The service was superb, although its still somewhat high but still friendly with the server.From the moment you leave, you will see people outside here. The ambiance definitely doesn't suit any of our guests, but the servers are great and friendly. And the salad bar isn't fancy. Our server was super helpful, too, although I wasn't sure of his privacy until I told her (as I was on holiday) that we were going to work the rest of the night at once.
restaurant, wings included.  That was it.  I can't believe I am telling you this is such a hot place but someone on my phone for a couple hours this morning and my grill waited for me for at least half an hour.  The grills, which were excellent!  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The w/ pickles was my favorite.  The service was great.  The only bad thing that happened was that the place was pretty crowded.  My stomach probably achemed a little, but other people, who have been there for hours, were probably fine with this.  There was one other item I would definitely order because it was from food. 
Hear me out if you want a better seafood cafe, you could get two to eat at at South Beach Club. The food is pretty good with a lot of fish and vegetables, which is what keeps me coming back.The hostess is very nice and makes sure everything is fine
restaurant order by the meal and a non-repudiation menu, will be cut out for food as soon as we return, as we're told. Like my wife told us about, there will be nothing on the menu until we return, but, the day we sit there and give a stare at the tables, there's no way to come back, a nightmare of a hostel-end. I don't even understand how these people can get away with such a horrible restaurant, except that in my experience, cooking an entree for a customer is a normal part of this restaurant experience.
Now another Yelp rating, folks, is justified.  This place gives back to homeless families everywhere the one person that helps them.  For the last 30 days we have been there, every time we've had the wonderful wait staff, and their delicious Mexican food.  They are all working.  The last 30 hours of the service have gone well and have not gone anywhere except for
restaurantThe cocker spits it out like pervert even though we were out of house and I guess we were the only ones who knew of the lie.  Nice restaurant. The food is really good and all I can say is that the drinks are OK.
Cannot go wrong with food here or service. You definitely get what you pay for. Service may be very poor on some nights, but you will definitely go there.
very pretty. servers and serversvery good. wont be back.all are nice people I understand. I had a negative experience at the bbq, but never had any complaints at all.  I really should have all been able to get out of it, but it was all far from me. dont ever go in unless you have a birthday/opener that has NOT been opened up by the owner.it is not worth the wait, know what to expect.hopefully.
Stopped in because it was filled with other than
restaurant & frequenters.
If you are looking for a unique NYC sushi place, go there.
Mango is fantastic and worth checking out. Food is good, friendly service. Great selection and a wonderful atmosphere. Enjoy a bowl of black beans with rice or the kickbox joints as well as lunch for $10 with prices way below the minimum order at parter locations.
Lately i have been wanting to try Red Dead....this time it was slightly disappointing, i was really looking forward to the quail hair service...(not the curl smell, but definitely curl service). I love their steak but the quail hair offers better service and a larger variety of meats, cheeses and desserts.....just as good as the Chef's margarita(not that spicy, it tastes a bit off). For the first time I was happy with the server in my entourage.....but not pleased with her lack of attention towards her or our meals and her habit of making
restaurant and sweet potatoes. Amazing combination of seasonings!My favorite thing about Chicago is that they are just open all the time. This place always had the best food to be had in Chicago. If you're looking for a place to eat and relax with friends I think this is the place to go. And this is a reasonable price for what it costs to get a table in the cool & cozy atmosphere. The wait is really a big expense. Get to outside more often for brunch.
we came here for the parking and it was worth it!!! i think the food was good.. its ok it was only 2 or 3 off the mark
If you are a diehard rascally, ROTATED hipster, and looking for well built, small, dark, rich restaurants in southern Europe, then this is the place for you. La Vieja de Chaves, by the way, is easily the greatest culinary French restaurant in the world. If you are looking for a
restaurant, tasting beers, dinner and snacks.
I've been to two places but never ended up in the Purple Line :( the waitress was incompetent.. i mean unfortunately there are a ton of homeless people in this city now. She was quick in her questioning but not helpful either.
I'm not even a MichelinStar fan, so I can't say that I would do my Whole Earth homework on Giordano's, but, trust me on this one, if you have tried it, you'll have never experienced it without it being there. The only reason I said that was because I didn't see the original set up and then paid for it. Even though they've upgraded the decor and access to the restaurant, I still had a feeling that they didn't care enough.I was annoyed with how some dishes were poorly thought out as compared to the original menu, especially the sample dishes. There were a ton of different ingredients, made with the various trimmings (even
restaurant, daily coffee, a student lunch, a computer that they are always looking at the menu in the morning, and an hour before something changes the menu, the glass of wine is ruined.  The food is so disappointing.  I left with only one bill of fifty dollars for the last two days of party.  I'll never go back to my wallet and money to purchase something that fails to have any substance whatsoever.  First, I go there 4 a.m. for lunch to get lunch, and the restaurant close by at 8 pm to support me.  It is cheap to do, but is somewhat pricey for another 4 a.m. or less date night.  My $50 bill came with a slice of avocado I ordered for myself, and while it was not initially as expensive, it was.  The dressing was a lie to me, and the tables were filled to the brim.  I went to the restaurant more as a result of a falling in

Eating at Salt Pig: Great food. Excellent service. Always great. Went to try their appetizer. Parking lot was HUGE, very little space to do anything else.
3.5 stars:  I LOVE their shrimp!  I never know when I might come back!   Everything is gorgeous and they have a nice setting with the garden and garden sun. I just love the experience!
OMG!! The arrow from the gill rym crusted I found on a salad bar will probably never see any more. The couscous is really delicious! Was to order a small pitcher of wine, as they were sending me and my boyfriend (my girlfriend, 4'10") to sit and look at the reception area, but we found the place to be rather rude.  The servers were rude and rushed us, which was fantastic. I ordered a lunch two of the boys served up on a family lunch, and the girl ordered herself some free
restaurant and you get a salad at the bar -the salad bar is huge... I won't lie -anyone could do this place.If I had to sum it up this was probably the best burger place in my life (especially for a 2 star Yelp rating). The ambiance is like the Home of BLT. I didn't expect great food, but the party consisted mostly of decent music choices (and the best tv/movies in Chicago).I went on a very brisk winter night, filled it with food and sushi but no food to be found on the menu. I am not sure why the 3 stars system doesn't show that I ate here in 10-15 minutes.  I might have gotten the vegetarian option out of place by making it with a vegetarian side dish, but all in all this thing was okay.  Food was exceptional, anything can be great.
I'm trying to keep up with my meal schedule because it's pricey, but I'm the
restaurant is spicy. The potato wings aren't as flavorful as the spicy wings from freshlovers. I would definitely make it over to LeHoures' dining room and buy some more applesauce and pistachio-surprise.
I thought it was awesome... they have the best dish ever, out of all my exotic entrees on tuesday and Saturday nights. Very flavorful for the price and taste.  Fresh roasted beef with marinated vegetables was a must.  Good deal, with a cozy feel to it.  I'd give 5 stars but I have to say the service was amazing!  We sat down with a nice hostess and talked about our new restaurant.  She'd never written about our special occasion menu for customers and had always left us with a great menu.  We were going to Chicago to celebrate our birthday and our next visitor.  Once she did, it was fantastic and the food was delicious.  The place was so neat,
restaurant D.C. gets the task of reviewing which foods are good and which ones are bad. Sometimes it is difficult to tell one which has good service and which has bad service, and the food you find on a shelf can be even better than the service on the menu and salad bar, but those are just tiny parts of the whole mess. With that said, the tips that each restaurant is giving you in a very small area of the mall must be understood. Don't forget to bring a certain amount of cash. Otherwise, some aunts and uncles don't take kindly to big bills but really, everyone is dining at you. It is worth it, and if you are already a huge fan of Chinese food, at least stick around for a little while.
Amazing pork platter. Easy for the youth. Fried duck and hanpao don't come out as much.The food is all so bland.The kaffir lime shank is awful. Ste
restaurant has tons of beautiful fresh vegetables and shrimp that I've never been able to get enough of. All of the staff are super friendly and friendly and if you're looking for a little history, I'd recommend reading this book.
My husband and I have been in church since 1998.  We come here often, often to speak with the staff, read their speeches, and be entertained by the late evening beer-filled dishes.   Our special occasions usually are spent with our oldest members, and the prices are reasonable but are always reasonable.  Our smaller family (two and a half) typically eats outside the weekend for dinner on Thursdays.  Their pizza is super delicious, and when they cook my small family loves to cook fresh pizza!  Some of the food is terrible, but great.  And the specials are fine.  The only thing that annoys me about the Pizza Express is that the wait is ridiculous.  The steak and veggie soup specials are expensive
restaurant menu, cold noodles and cheaper, low key refried beans!!! Highly recommended!!!
The Buffalo Chicken Sandwich tastes absolutely wonderful! It's very good and inexpensive. I went here on a hot Tuesday and the service was a little slow. We ordered the miso appetizer, which I took as a, "Customized". Not a gift, I just brought my brother and told him about the miso roll and he said "hey man there is one you can take home" that I wanted to make sure everyone knew what I was talking about. I came back soon after, the $6 miso roll was DELICIOUS!!! I wish I'd eaten something else... but at least I got to make sure everyone had the desired fish at hand. Not as spectacular as I remembered when I first got there, but now everything gets a little better. the owner did a fabulous job with decorating the restaurant and cleaning out the bar area. Thank you Tacos perma-
restaurant. The desserts are such really delicious.
The lunch menu was delightful.  Was thinking of going back to India that was yummy.  I mean the choices on this menu are just average.  Ciao chicken noodle soup and chit chit noodles.  Not nearly enough of a selection on the small side.  There is not as much food to show.  This is not The Inn!!
Delicious and varied. Friendly but very/very closed vibe.
This place is really unique and something you only get from other restaurants in Chicago.I guess they made up for all that by allowing the best jazz anteens in the city to show up. Come on guys, don't let it get away from you - make a reservation.
Will definitely return here again as I hate noisy dining. Try Grand Pierre & Boulogne.
I just really like the sushi here.  The servers are very nice and warm and have always had good
restaurants and the milkshake. The wait times are quick, but they offer you two choices. There is also a gratuity bar that is located at the large green box office on 1st and City, between 1st and a half block from the South Bank section.You have to ask for an estimate and a reward but the wait to get there is less than half a minute. Everything here is outstanding and you will enjoy spending a bit more than your wait to get there.I recommend you stop in for a snorkeling snack, go for fries, burritos, ribs or anything else. The service has been great and the food will be worth the wait. 4 stars for my own review.
I've been going to and fro for almost a year, finally hitting on Hot Dog Town.  That's what I'll call it.  Our steakhouse doesn't disappoint.  I mean the steak?  It's top notch.  I don't
restaurant well. We ordered the elfectos. Each and every one of the specials had several rolls of pasta on top.
We haven't been here in awhile and we've been really busy lately.  I don't know how else to describe what you get in here, exactly.  You can't go wrong with this place.  I think the service is very friendly and is one of the best places I have ever been to.  I also like that you can order a hot dog or the foie gras so you know you have an excellent meal at this reasonably priced restaurant.  Thank you America!
Best meat jerky ever!  Their waiter is so sweet and attentive. My friend and I can tell that the servers are very helpful.  It was their birthday because they were giving out cake coupons but the cake is a big gift and really special to celebrate.  We love their beef jerky.  I have had better jerky at least once in
restaurant! I have always enjoyed going to other restaurants because the service is amazing.  They have great prices as well.  We are at the bottom of the line when it comes to food!
I'm coming back to York.This was not the best Korean place in Chicago!  It definitely has my expectations.  However, the food does not seem to be all that bad either.  I loved their Pancake Bell Arra (which is excellent), Olde South Oak of Chicago Beef, Tomato Stew with Rice, and Eggs and Soy Flakes!  The service is great, but I am still not a huge fan of the service at other Korean joints like Crackers, Mo Chulpa, and Calmo.I would suggest this place to anyone in the neighborhood!
The food is fabulous, the atmosphere is classy and the food is totally unique.  It's not that the reviews are bad, it's just that the menu is not always as complete as it
restaurant specials are usually to quickly turnaround. They would also recommend checking to see if your order was taken out of order, because an officer looking at the receipt was always wanting to know what was on the order. Additionally, if the food was not cooked properly, or added to the sauce, it would be impossible to get it properly condiments and still taste good.
brought it to breakfast this past Sunday.the wonton slices was like burnt roasted onions (pork chop, pork in a fry pan etc.  how could the meat taste that burnt ). the mac & cheese was beautifully seasoned with savory, fresh lime.i didn't have any hollandaise sauce, which i guess you can get online, but i think they're trying to be creative - it was an Italian fare. the steak was quite unique. even though they gave it no flavor, what the brussels sprouts that i had were huge. after the churros were smoked

Well Worth The price, cheap and delicious!Chef Marc describes the blend of fresh mushrooms (!) and mushroom pasta with diced onions, which really makes this place stand out as "fresh-meaty" even though it is actually made from ingredients that are never hot--also really interesting because it only takes 10 minutes to prepare. Next time, come check out this live karaoke venue for unique dance tunes. You won't believe how well I managed to come up with yummy slow-motion homestyle seitan.Don't forget, they have one of my favorite hidden kill-joys--my favorite keno.
Great place to go for lunch, dinner, or lunch over the phone.  5 stars in my book as well.
We love the burger and the bar right next to it.  Come in you can always walk in or take your
restaurant by law enforcement.

This place is ok. Not close to a pub. BUT IT IS BY FAR THE BEST PLACE TO HAVE A GOOD ISLAM BAHY FOOD! Way better than any of the overpriced tourist-club bars.
I was going to go to the Hopleaf Hotel and we had a reservation. We were shocked to find that we were seated in a table with about half a table down and the owner's sitting right on top of us (probably mean for a waiter's tray). When I told him about our reservations, the owner kept talking to him and said it was a mistake. After watching him keep on talking, he got up and moved back to the floor where there was the large space on the other side of us that stood across the table from the two groups of tables at the restaurant. He didn't bother, telling us it wasn't the place to sit.  The owner kept lying down trying to make our tables
restaurant, good service, very fast. We got a table with bottles and plenty of delicious food. There are so many great locations in town with great seats, great food, and great dining options that this spot will definitely hold a special place in my heart for years to come. If you are looking for a great Chicago hot dog place, then this is the place for you!
The reviews have been amazing.  The deep dish noodles are amazing.  Of course the wine was wonderful too.  In the afternoon I had the bread cake filled with chive fries and fresh squeezed lime.  I really wanted to try the $8 back of the truffle bowl with the chevre.  The meats were fine too.  The decor was amazing.  I wish they gave me a new kitchen and they could have done a different one on the platter.  My sister was eating at one of the places when we started, and just as we sat down for dessert it turned
restaurant, at a typical 80 percent value. In that case, $20-$30 in margin. Don't call, really though; this place is catering to passionate bartenders.
I can't say enough good things about it! If you really want a good Mexican food restaurant, or a casual menu, then you'll love this place.  I say JT Plata, because it makes the chicken tacos seem fresh and flavorful.  But if you're out, eating with friends, then this is definitely a place you'll come back to - AND you're bringing a BIG group of friends or family to celebrate!  Try this joint for very, very good reason.  I guess it's the 'best' night I've had anywhere (at least for me).
This is a moderately priced place and I really do enjoy them.I get so hungover from the margaritas I finally don't order anything else and I watch something else and just have a drop of

Not meat... wait until you buy a ticket and come back with friends, for fun. You'll miss it. I suggest you come in early, since you have a very nice interior and a very nice staff.
I would consider going with people who are around here regularly and not so busy. They're just ok. They know how to make you feel and it's just great for this one dish. The waiter is great - says he's doing it to move people around and not to let them upset you. The hostess is wonderful. When I got to my table, the waitress was slightly agitated, which annoyed me because the dish has a deliciously-dried flavor, and you could

I love the wine!I highly recommend it to anyone in needs. I am always looking forward to going back. A throwback to the past....very eclectic and full of modern styles that will add to your take. The wine list can be overwhelming. Let me know what you think, I'm sure they'll be making a name for themselves in a while.... great evening-
Let me start off by saying that I am a real "A&T Jokana" gal. I grew up in Wurffville, WI, and it is my passion to love all of our meats...especially in the meatloaf. When you get to the Middle Age, Chicken Fajitas are the answer.I'm not just talking about meats, but the selection of meats - my favorite - can only go so far! and they are delicious too!which for me is the only reason I've never been a meatloaf connoisseur!like a
restaurant, same as other eateries.   I haven't tried it yet, but I'd take it on trust.The basil avocado (with garlic and spices, and a little salt) is worth a try.  it didn't disappoint.The onion-potato and pork salad made a perfect addition to this, and as you probably know, I enjoy going with folks with a lower protein level of meat.  (Even if you are beefing on the calories, this is a MUST.)The salmon tank was excellent, as it sat with the gnocchi and fish, and that was also the only other thing that I enjoyed.  I'm not an expert at fish, but it was superb.  Even if you give it a try, though, it's a long shot.  Luckily it's seafood free, which means I'll wait to try it and get a better deal.
My friends and I visited in a couple of weeks, as we waited on
restaurant) are the best of the food I've had.  The steak fries are amazing (well, fancy and crunchy as well).  They use authentic-caramelized pieces of cheese on their fries, along with spices of your choice.  I usually get two shakes on occasion, but the flavors, specifically, are unique and extraordinary!
If your looking for pizza, the King Cake is the absolute best. But if you're looking for a side of just good bread and cakes, The Spaghetti and Brisket is the best. The garlic fries are flavorful and tender and they are both delicious! My favorite of all time is the Italian style $14 Quetticalis salad. It's great, but a little pricey. You can definitely substitute on the side of the fries, which I got from someone I met last week, who was somewhat bland but oh so tasty. But they do have some great options. They have a Longtime Sunday brunch option, the
restaurant....Overall a great deal for a great meal. For our 1st go and our 2nd go we had both a big grill pan fried rice and kimchi which we both loved. With the kimchi and chicken, we enjoyed each other as well. We also did not expect a lobster roll too big as we had a liking for things like meat, seaweed and fish which were really just great in comparison. Not sure if the entree would be as good as their first one was because our appetizer didn't arrive with the filet. Considering that the fish and rice were pretty much the only dishes we enjoyed (as we enjoyed the steak along with the pizza and the mignon), we had plenty of other things to choose from. Probably should have ordered 2 more appetizers before going.I'll just say we weren't great fans of the desserts that made up the list, so the dessert trills and cocktails were just a little underwhelming for our appet
restaurant/stuffed lunches. Please do not ask if the table price was over $100, just give us 30/40 to get the best prices. It was just simple!
I am always amazed at how popular duck menu items are in the Chicago area!I have been staying at Wicker Park for over 2 years now.  If you are looking for something to share you can go in a different way!  I haven't had all night so there is plenty of seating for good local food.  I love looking at my restaurant and am always glad to try new restaurants!
I'm the only vegetarian here at Gabbi's! The food is divine, the service is good and the ambiance is terrific.  It was good, but good for a 15 minute drive away.
Hands down the best beef liver burgers in the world and it's been well-drilled. The beef is seasoned with kimchi while the pork chops and grilled cheese are

Absolutely amazing!  My friend wanted to take us to the Vistros bar one day to have a beer while she and I went and it was actually a great deal.  But alas, we came back a week later to say hello!  The service and atmosphere was superb, our waiter was outstanding and their tea comes often.  The food has always been great, and this place is a MUST-DINNER.  I have never had a bad service at Alinea, but since we have been there before, we will definitely be coming back for sure.
Good
restaurant is very nice. Food is good. But to me, they're at the point where people are just willing to eat more (or less) to meet up on weekends and need fewer tables. For people, it works!  It's an extensive restaurant with little if any seating, but if the hostess, they think it's great for them to close the restaurant down.  It's true!  But a hostess who is professional and provides them with elegant and affordable French food can work extremely hard to serve the hostess and their families.  But, for the hostess, there's a reason everyone that comes to Beardsley is always busy,  you can't know if they're in there looking for a table.My fiance and I spent about $50 for the place to stay at that night and it was great!  It's only going to get better and better as my guests continue to move out, but I don't want to lose more of
restaurant, making it up to you in the kitchen.  I brought our appetizer and cooked it to perfection.  The pizza was stuffed and flavorful, and the chicken was a perfect touch.  We did eat a bit more of it because of the large portions, but it was an absolute feast.  We have been to every restaurant, so expect great things, and I highly recommend spending an afternoon at H&L.
Great place to enjoy your whole family and friends. We love this place as well!
In the past I have been to a buffet restaurant and it's always the place for lunch specials or dessert.  The great thing about it is that you can definitely place the order and have your own entree, not to mention you get the complimentary snack with your meal.  It really helps to have nice wok options for just the appetizer and dessert.  Prices are cheap but if you are looking for something to try and meet some of the people that

My cousin was in town and we were craving something special for her.  Our waiter had a 4 star rating because of the cheap margaritas in the main bar and it sounded too good to be true.  I agree with my cousin that drinks have to be affordable but we are $15 a plate for alcohol, they just sent out a cheaper price on whiskey.  The bartenders were very busy.  The night went by exactly like we thought it would be.  I've been going on about how bad they would be treating our customers when they do run these on-site, and I've found that most of the folks I've stayed with in Chicago who are inclined to order with more profit can't even finish another meal.  When you order and get the discount on the bottle or refill refill, they pay cash back on your drink order and treat your order accordingly.  The waitress said that

He had a message on the yellow screen - a callout, "My opinion: This is a bad restaurant and not worth eating." We said our goodbyes, waited until the bathroom was ready, and walked in. It was like a starlight fantasy on a night-and-comer-scene, so quiet and relaxed it was so addictive that I forgot what was happening. It was only when we got our cell phone that it connected and he answered it--as if to say "Sorry" and for some reason that's all he offered me. The wait was over for us, and I got that fast. It was all downhill from there. Our entrees weren't good, not even close. It was like eating at a pro
restaurant said.At 5:15pm we ordered appetizers with dates and sour cream. We waited for two minutes to get seated before our server asked for some ice cubes for dessert and ordered whatever we wanted. Unfortunately, the server told us the foam coffee mug was not salty and is rich in flavor. He then went into our drink and let us pass out for only 10 minutes. Upon hearing this, the waitress apologized and asked if we would like to come back. Once we left, we could not see the real owner. The manager and employee in charge made no effort to prevent us from returning and told us to contact our manager about the employee-in-charge.We requested a seat for another waitress who was also about to arrive and asked if I would be willing to return. My experience is rare and what happened with the other customer was inexcusable and unacceptable. We are not for or against young people and have been stuck at Mr Roulette (or any other place where

I've lived in the neighborhood for over 15 years and was impressed with all the food and amazing service.  I've been going there once a week and am still going back.  Check this place out!
Hahaha, fast-food.  That's what I loved about it.  I loved looking for food at Salsa or Pizza Bells.  Simply it was really fun!  The seating tables weren't too big as I'm used to, and we had a small group.  It was a little cramped by today's standards for a restaurant like this, but we were pretty good!   The meatball radish that was eaten was amazing and we gave

I have had Bonafaloo multiple times and I LOVE the flavors and I'm definitely going to be returning to Rio de Janeiro for sure.  I had it with great food with no disappointments.  My favorite was horticulturias entree.  We always get new plates of their entrees and very good service to our wine tastings.  I have also had avocado, champagne, macadamia nuts and mushroom pies.  I also had their burrito (wrapped in cheese cubes), which I am always impressed with.  I'll definitely be going back soon for some great cheese-curd burgers.  I think I need to go somewhere else soon, maybe on Mexican desert.  I know that it is the restaurant that is built on the power of restaurant which makes this place such a natural extension of our family's favorite dining experience.
Sometimes people get offended by a lack of service, and this time was no exception.  Staff
restaurant is amazing! I can't wait to go back and do a beer list sometime later.
I lived on a block away and I went there every weekend and saw great food. They are really comfortable but I really like the service. The chicken shank pulled pork soup is good, but it isn't the best selection at another restaurant because I love cooked cilantro lime chicken and the mushroom lamb sandwich. The steamed dog is also good, but I was only there a little because they were ordering the salads. We went for a lunch in the bar and were disappointed. The food was alright, but the place for the appetizers was awesome. We also saw the children sitting in the waiting area waiting in line and actually liked the service, but needed to get dressed for lunch with food.
Decent sushi in beautiful location.  Amazing waitress. Staff is really nice.
best softball ever.  The food is just OK..  eat a lot, but just drink
restaurant service and made much better.  Overall, I love this place and it still has a lot going for it. This time out, we're happy to see it closing and the manager is super eager for our order. But what if it's not all there at once? We wouldn't be served.  That is certainly true in SEDP so make sure you come here.
Great seafood buffet, food is consistently good and it's SO relaxing. Once you settle down I just go back on the weekends
A unique piece of history at Great Western Restaurant, love you coffee, pay full price, and it's fresh! You won't regret it - you'll be to return the next time you want to try a new dish.
Excellent wine list. Good options on the ground menu.
Oh my! I love the restaurant.  They have a great atmosphere, just there please.  They cater this kind of high energy if you like grilled shrimp but there is
restaurant and dining experience that's more like a burger joint than the reality.
3,000+ Churros around the world - my favorite pizza joint in Michigan! Our steno makes a total of about 5300+ Churros every night. Try it out, come back here!
All of the service is top notch. My favorite restaurant in northwentworth. You won't feel as anxious about how long to wait because it is there, it's on the weekends, it is packed, and it is delicious! I just can't make the small dim sum meal we have and the whole staff....its not worth it.
BEST french fry in Chicago! Delicious, salty meat, and nothing under the table entrees should be overlooked! A little pricey though, but I will definitely be back!
I hate BBQ. Although it has a nice bar & restaurant feel, many of the place's cocktails are too hard to find for an easy day at the
restaurant and great places to take in your nice time. We tried to include the Buffalo Wild Wings as the table of six or - then, they were so filling and amazing.  For my next reservation, we decided on the Eat 'n Save margaritas.  They had the panazolos (lemon margaritas), calamari (salmon) and romaine's cheese sandwich.  The food was good, but I did wish it had been bigger or the course really relaxed.  Service was excellent and welcoming.  We ordered fish fillets and had many other things to eat.  They also had a generous dessert for the regular crowd. The food at this place was unbeatable! This place really needs some big changes, if only we could talk up how good their food is.
The main location on Lincolndale.  Usually a takeover, but you always feel like you live in a special neighborhood.  For my split reservation, I ordered a
restaurant was provided by Josefette De Reiss. I prefer to see where the rest of the staff is; the food was fine and the wine was excellent. My friend, who went with me, came out and found that we were in class, which was fine. It was difficult for him to explain the situation to everyone else, but it is pretty obvious that we were in class and had nothing to do with everything.  I'm glad that there are so many people in class that care about student service. The pizza was great, a bit expensive, but it was enough to entice me to try it, and feel it in my stomach. Although my friend returned a couple days later, with us receiving our waffles and the fries, the server kept us busy and gave us an excuse to not try the chicken, which was right up there with the vanilla creme brulee and peanut butter and jelly creme brulee...  all soooo delicious.  I had
restaurant & have since she got famous for what she was told. The breakfast  was really good but i tried going with my girlfriend.I would go back for maybe the other two for brunch and next weekend. We are both really good at mac and cheese so if we cannot go down the hill or even down to the street to get one it will be just fine, but not worth the drive.the food was ok, but not great. maybe they needed some other words in front of them? they tried the Vegenaise.  and that's always lame. when i went on an afternoon i felt i'd be wasting my time, not having fun or what do they have in mind? unless it's some burger, i'm not going to be back. again, keep looking for better restaurants.i guess this type of casual atmosphere can make you feel like you are in paradise and they seem to do all their cooking and make you feel they're trying something special.

This place is a once in a lifetime experience. I visited with a group of five for my birthday two weeks ago and I felt like I was in the middle of a fantasy novel which I would never have made on my own. The main place at this time to get started was some a speakeasy called The Game store. We quickly realized how ridiculous the hype was and the servers worked really hard. We were able to hear many folks speaking directly to us. I was speechless. From one server to another we were able to keep up with everyone else's time. The
restaurant, great food, we were at a Friday brunch.The lobster rolls were fantastic, the shrimp were superb, the chef had an incredible salad. For a appetizer with pasta it was all I could taste but we had enough for an appetizer. Nothing could beat this place! (You know you're walking down the street after going to get a sushi roll or lunch if you're going to be inside the neighborhood and not in the rush.)  The wine list was very high as well. I had the Sushi Brazzla from Tsubaki or Pad Thai. The seafood chutney was exceptional, the lamb chops were very good (not just a beef tenderloin so deep), the steaks were amazing (crispy, delicious but tender enough to chew. Tasty potatoes were included in the main course), and the seafood soups were phenomenal. Yes, they have margaritas and fresh fish to finish them off. Finally, everything else was outstanding
restaurant to replace the fried egg rolls and save $6 and choose from places like Big Mac and Fried Chicken, which is vegan.
The food was wonderful and the owner very attentive, and we went right back. I highly recommend the lobster fish soup and The pastrami ceviche.
I really, really wanted to love this place and was soured on the proximity to Mieteucas. It felt like they had all their culinary refried beans by the ounce but it didn't hold up to being part of the opening act. They seem to have a particular preference for fresh cilantro which is really what made this place such a hit. The escargot salad and garlic salad were super tasty. Service was friendly and convenient, and the owners should thank them for being so well known. The lunchroom is huge and quiet enough for adults who don't want to stay for long. Our server sat very fully on the shoulder of the line, apparently working on a
restaurant must not get in your way. I found that Foodies have a great time. Otherwise there are a couple hidden gems and off the beaten path of mediocre food at Shoe Leta....Okay, ok, so what I thought would be a hotdog at $7 is it actually $6 on the menu....PROS/CONS - Hard time finding something new because it has had to be $6.00 every time. But eventually everyone gets a piece of a sad dessert -It looks like there has been a tearja paste stuck in the bottom of some garbage bag, and all of the other items were still sweet. Definitely not worth it.
My husband, Mabel (39) and I were invited to my first Dog Park in Texas about 3 weeks ago (we met at a restaurant in the living room, where we were roommates and had decided to take the vegan tour), and when we arrived, Mabel was still trying to make sense of the menu

Sushi is served inside,  but the atmosphere is somewhat noisy. It's crowded outside and this place is a bit slow, especially considering the prices. However, the beer selection is pretty decent. The food is good for a quiet night and even the steaks are affordable. If you're into gluten-free Greek food, try the sweet potato pizza. You'll be glad you did.
Heres what I like about this place:  i get that its really far from an intimate looking restaurant.  thats when the old Asian hipsters are crotchety drinking buddies.  its fine that the space is empty and all the attendants make it seem that it's owned by a real artist of art (this time im just playing video games all day) but i just want to say that it is in good working order, well done and new designer techniques.  one other thing: they make delicious pizza, thats a bad word for such a busy restaurant. 
restaurant in the form of some of their cafeteria style sandwiches and pizza. I think it's great! This is also a great place to try for a cold beverage or donner or to have a snack while you wait outside. The salad bar is amazing, its packed with all kinds of great ingredients. We were seated on the first evening, which is just fine, but maybe that's the reason for the wait. Overall I would recommend this restaurant to any fan of veganism or of anyone who wants to feel like a city legend with a line to lead them out of the fast food wasteland.
Great food! Atmosphere is nice and food is delicious!  The service is helpful and friendly...nice place for relaxing evenings.
Friendship is certainly good but the service has always been fairly underwhelming (if you haven't been to this place before)  The only exception to that is the private jumbo table in the front which is for tight seating.  One nice problem is

My friend has been a vegetarian since childhood and has been fortunate enough to find a place that is more than accommodating and friendly. The coffee bar and late arrival section (we went a couple months ago) has a gorgeous location and there is also no parking fee so we have to agree with many chefs that it is more than enough for us.
This is a nice place to grab some one time meetup in some nearby area and chill off with a buddy while she continues the  Elliot Fray.
Yes, its been a while since we've had tacos (and we're not even half up on that), but this restaurant has everything. The freshest ingredients, value, and fun atmosphere, and excellent food. Everything is great and can sometimes be hard to find (everytime you are there, there is always another table!), but my guest deserves no less. She eats a huge variety of food from our regulars, and feels like she is her own foodie's
restaurant - Alinea! It's so good it changes my mind! You know my crazy food.
I don't know why you would be pleased with a sandwich that's so loud but goes to a table too close to you to cause noise. My Wife liked that you mentioned giving her soup 4 wings and salad tray.  So, all of them were fabulous. I always try something new at our table but they are always small portions that need a little room in.
Wow. Dina is just amazing! This place is a great option for people with allergies or any other needs.  (2 stars because it's close to where my little girl lives!)
My mother was there, my parents were there, and I spent some time there with my own  kids.  This place was good!  Best Italian food I've had in Chicago.  I had the tuna skirt steak and it was pretty good!  My boyfriend and I got those hot dogs the week they

Two beautiful Italian restaurants, first serving a simple meal to a friend, now serving unlimited margaritas! Very romantic, warm ambiance... our waiter is fabulously funny and attentive. We are satisfied with our meal, the owner! Thanks Italian!!!
the butter bars are at the top, the cino is stellar and very deep! I have never been to an Italian restaurant, so I'll pass!
I like it here, it's a little crowded but still very quaint and relaxed. The food is good, they have a lot of good dishes as well, and lots of dill flavors.  The salad bar is a bit dirty, but that's why it's nice, neat (sinks don't exist in the real world so it doesn't hurt). All in all, this place is a great place for families and for people alike to go on a Sunday afternoon.
Zak's is the best restaurant in Chicago. the food is good,
restaurant options at these restaurants. I have never had any issue with this setting. It has room for one dish and when they make their recommended salads, the pizza comes out delicious.  Their great service is perfect. We ended up going to Jamaica Park and there were some great tasting specials. The fish is ok but enough for my and another girl to come and try.
This place is absolutely glorious. The rice is good. It is so good, it feels like a shell. Every once in a while they make sure you like a fatty roll and stick it in your mouth.  As mentioned earlier, the food is great. They have a vegan wrap slipout on everything so you'll be prepared. We went with a group of 3 because there were people on the bar and other people were talking to us. The service was awesome.  I saw a guy talking to our waitress about the sushi for 10 minutes. She said she was like overreacting and everyone stopped talking to
restaurant is closed around 9:30pm and we have a menu waiting for us by 9:30pm or a week later. However, most of the food is still delicious to try. Also, if there's some tough competition you'll be able to get those good slices or bowls that we prefer.
I have been to many Asian restaurants on KFC. The food is great and I am a new customer to Luton.  Here is why.  This is good reason for checking this place out.  They have affordable and good selections and they serve a range of sides.  While I'm here, I'm not that enamored with cuisine on the east coast.  Korean so on my birthday.  They even put the wings in soup.  I'm not sure if it is just the seinen sauces or if it's a fad but...
So, I had one of my veggie burgers for dinner tonight. I ordered the chicken and we both
restaurant or mezzanine food.  It is a hot spot with a great atmosphere that is exceptional.  The popcorn is loud with flavors from its ingredients.
A must try for those with allergies.  Awesome coffee, smoothie, space to sit, trendy food all in all.The atmosphere is lively and the servers carry to us people that are passionate about our food.For those that want to get out of town, check out a few places and hang out in the early afternoon!
I love Keto and it always comes with a table of strangers. I've already written a review and I am highly recommend this place! I can't say enough good things about this place! The atmosphere is a little thin, but the food is amazing. I think this place is just perfect for a night out or a birthday party, especially when you're waiting for tables and getting your own drink. I feel this is a safe haven for all your friends, family, or coworkers
restaurant for a table or a date. We recommend the Space Domains for spring rolls.
I love it here. I am a HUGE fan of Meatloaf and this is one of my favorite places to go when I am a kid! Try it, but in the summer. The food has an incredible consistency. I cannot wait to go back there next time I go!
Here is one of the most delicious take out joints in Chicago. This place is really worth a try. The steak there was great! My server enjoyed my meal and the service was exceptional. Check them out to make sure you order the fried chicken in a large bowl. I highly recommend them both.
For my last visit we had a great experience with a very satisfied customer. I went with three of our five guests on Wednesday and brought along an appetizer which was something I really enjoyed. The chicken itself was perfect. The food was like nothing else I have ever had in town. So, I
restaurant. Other than that, it is a lovely place to get to know some friends (that's whoops?).  They have vegan breads, free canals (stuffed calamari), porridge, and smoked salmon with many toppings.There is a great food selection that everyone can try, and I highly recommend the 4-star reviews.  It is also home to the great design of the lounge.  They are welcoming, accommodating, warm, attentive, and very quiet.It gets crowded often and there are a lot of other cool things to do during rush hours.  Please don't try it and leave disappointed.Don't be that guy who thinks eating at Chick-fil-A is like going to the movie, but actually buying a ticket to see Tom Hanks...well, he could've just tried to get rid of his popcorn because it costs more money to make.The food is amazing.  Not only is the variety of dishes prepared, you get
restaurant and cocktail bar on the Avendale strip.  Plenty of cash.  I will definitely be returning. I went out on a Saturday night for breakfast and it was an awesome experience and service by the staff.  My favorite is the Fondue salad!  I would definitely come back for breakfast again.  The grill is phenomenal, it feels like you're inside a complete restaurant - feel like you're working in an enormous thicket.  I think the prices are reasonable, you can try their beers in bunches and both will come out a good price.  I will definitely be returning again - thank you Jon.
Never could have expected this to happen. I took a table in our garage and it was packed. Everyone that was there is very good. The owner gave us bottles of Buds and told us that it was the biggest drink he had ever had. We were not even sure that it was a Bud, but he was the most delicious!This is
restaurant combo in Chicago.  The interior of the restaurant includes a lunch area.  I suggest that everyone go there on a first date, not to sound very patronizing but rather as a child, how good it is to go out of your way to get a dinner for at least 30 people at one establishment.  You'll catch the lights and watch the musicians play throughout the day and no one ever forgot.  This may not be the best place in the country to eat, but I highly recommend.
Don't die. Seriously.  Don't think it's OK.  It's not.  And just stop.  Don't come for 60 bucks or go!
So here we go, reviewing this pizzeria.  This place is usually okay, but this place has gotten a little murkier lately, trying to be better.  It's got a sitdown bar and the food is always great.  The right quality food is mixed in with the hum

Been looking around the city for some great Brazilian chai places lately. This place for my birthday is soooooo good!!! The waiter looked for me and told me to show up. I waited for about 15 minutes before we got seated. The food was amazing, the service is always amazing and the house music plays so damn loud. We had dinner on a Friday night, the menu changes frequently and is always just as delicious and varied. Our server and I were both seated quickly, came over late, and thanked us a total of 3 times. All the food was really good and all my other dishes, by the way, were good. We did really enjoy the menu choices and everyone was attentive to the food! I also think the host was really nice, we would suggest to anyone who wants to know if their food tastes like it used to be. This place is an amazing place!
The food was excellent and enjoyable. I decided to order 3 of the
restaurant/others) - includes beware of the debris and gravy - will tell you the server's name. :) 
Being my 20 yr old culinary background, I have seen the most fantastic reviews for our expensive Grouper & Burgers Cafe. We have dined here often and have been sated for weeks at the seat of community and respect which is what will take your appetite for the brunch experience to a whole new level. Great food, great atmosphere and highly recommended.
If I could have only described it as our favorite brunch spot, I would choose it. 
Horrible service. Eat a little more than what you get at Leesombre, but be sure to save some money here.  After our waitress took the main tab and paid $10.00 an hour for our sample ($3.50 after the sales tax) (we were told they would not charge us anything of the sort), we forgot to bring our newborn child in ($
restaurant where they always have fresh ingredients and a good vibe. We went first and there was a lot of stuff on the menu. The wait staff was attentive and helpful but we had to wait a little while for the ambiance to work and the food was good. The only bad thing about the evening was we were interrupted by the chair's coat of arms (perfect for being a casual man with white plaid coat) and there weren't many options for taking out of your bill. I don't remember hearing about any other service issue. I understand how important a service is when so many people can't afford to charge for their water or food. If we would have gone elsewhere, there would have been more offerings on a menu. I don't recall complaining about getting fried pizza, but we may have let the staff down. Overall, my final verdict on this restaurant was quite negative.  I tried it and I will be back.  It was awesome!!
First of all,
restaurant.  Dessert?  What a f**king nightmare.The paper bag pomaded--now there is no hanging over the food bowl.  Love the taste of my pizza that's almost always hoisted from the pizza.  I would have gladly asked for a sit down--I felt in love with this place.  The service is great--no obnoxious interruptions or disrespectful warm-up - but sometimes the bus lines are a little uncomfortable.  Do you think the stinky stewards inside will think twice about leaving their macaroons open until after a meeting in the dining room?  The tipo is rude and pretentious.  No-one should eat at this place.  This place has not been reviewed on Yelp or elsewhere yet!
CHEAP, CLOUD FIBER, FOOD AND SERVICE!   I had the slaw of black pepper and a pumpkin ravioli and absolutely loved it.  I was the waitress
restaurant. The waitress should have seen the picture better and noticed that the food was mediocre and the dessert was mediocre. The service was awful. I tried to stop by the theater where there was a piano playing to talk to them on the piano which was also not comfortable. They had to extend hours from their regular regular 7:30 pm to 9:30 am due to bad service. I will definitely not go back.
Fantastic neighborhood street food and casual dining in Midtown.  The authentic Italian food in Ithaca has better hype and far better prices.  They also have a reasonable cost per person.
My husband and I went last Friday night for dinner at the finest Italian restaurant in Michigan.  We were truly hooked on our experience at Tozzoli!  We had lunch at the close of round two, followed up by dinner on Monday night.  Our Giordano is superb and the food is absolutely the best.  Highly recommended.
Bast
restaurant, kitchen, and other dining experiences. Even at your local restaurant they have them as a free bonus - just a little bit of food/drinks.
Not the place to go to during peak hours with better food than everyone else.
Great, cozy spot, where the guys pay a fee to have you on a date.  Much better than the street and restaurants that have old apartment building blocks in your neighborhood!
a place to relax and get dinner. service is slow, but good. i went here recently because I wanted to try something new. it was more like a con
I just opened this place for the first time today and since I was a massive vegetarian, I've waited quite a while for my first time, even though it is probably the most tiny Asian restaurant in the world.  My boyfriend, however, decided to give the place a try.  It was mostly pizza with vinegar sauce.  It was delicious!  Everything was perfectly cooked.
restaurant Wicker Park, which is what I wanted. Honestly it was a busy one, but the staff was outstanding. I am looking forward to walking in. Unfortunately, they closed all my reservations with a bad experience. This place was disappointing. They have no seating and they almost failed to have my food taste good. I know, I know, that's what they are for. Don't miss out on a quick burrito joint that will satisfy everyone you come in.  I don't know if this is the place to get a good burger, but that really was a mistake and I should be more critical about finding them.
Took a Monday trip to dinner to view these tasty pastries. The Korean restaurant has amazing menu that pairs beautifully with the other knowledgeable diners and it is impeccably done.  We made our way over to the owner about the pretzel section and found him seated waiting to move his potatoes over.  It was a bit late but he returned
restaurant/saladery and salad... hahahaha!!!
Delicious food. Great atmosphere. A live music ensemble and a great patio. A guest house for sure. Never felt safe. Don't want to be forced to use a bathroom at all.
My husband is a huge fan of yelp, the vegetarian atmosphere on restaurants here has changed the way he eats. He is a vegetarian for 30+ years now and has tried many of the dishes that come with yelp, but never in any of the above dishes. Yelp is here to stay.
Just finished my first trip to Napoli, Italy, a time of celebration. I want to visit the wonderful and adventurous Restaurant El Gino, where we were delighted to receive a complimentary license plate. Although its not directly inside the restaurant, we were impressed with the service, the atmosphere, the atmosphere of the place, and the special wines and marmalade on the menu. The staff is
restaurant Bairh. I think that was one of the original chefs. The owner, Bhanay, was a great boss who served the food with great service and expertly crafted the menu. We were happy with the meat that he cooked, and he really helped bring out the flavors as well. They serve salads with all kinds of delicious items, and what our table had at our table was something we didn't like! We loved the fresh meat so much that it made our stomach hurt for dinner.
Was a little overwhelmed with this place, but great food. I would definitely come back for dinner again and for a beer, wines or just a good meal with some friends.
Caved in a little disappointment with the bathroom. First I smelled horribly of garlic, or I wouldn't have said much. Then the worst part was the price. I live in Jamaica, so I'm always buying a slab of garlic-we love it. I really felt that you
restaurantie, all I could do was, I have to say, the pizza is awesome! This is where I might have gotten the bonehead impression! The chips are the perfect mix of both. I actually like the portions, it can become even more large if you can handle a large pizza. The pizza is totally special in and of itself! Our server gave us his own unique chicken, with fries in the middle of it and apples, all rolled in an apple-filled dip for our guests!  Although it was really simple, I was very impressed with how much they pulled off. By the time we left, everything was awesome and the pizza made me happy! Great food, great service. I will not be returning to this place again.
Food is not my primary work experience, but I usually do like to have dinner here.  Loved the concept.  The steak steak is quick as you eat it; both enchiladas of incredible quality.  The
restaurant to me.  Have to say I'm not impressed.  Was disappointed, and many other customers got sick on their first visit.  They did a slow pat down for our table, and it was a touch-y.  Thankfully my birthday party got us a table-cleaned first time, and after our table was cleaned at the party, it was re-cleaned by the manager.  This was my party of 4, and it was very disappointing to find that many of us were not receiving enough service before we even got there.  It took a long time for us to get seated and check to see if they had space.  At this point, it's very difficult to move around when you're in the party.  The hotel manager was pushing people on the way to get on the table.  We did get on the table and she gave our personal chef one rep that we were not to do so.  Now we're just giving him the
restaurant at Cafe Leonos in 2012. And then another waiter came on my birthday, asked if I'd like to order a drink, and insisted that we had already ordered a beer.  I thought a person from Chicago gave me three different beers.  The food was delicious, and I was pleasantly surprised with their selection.  But not only that, they left a note saying that their servers seemed impatient and sometimes failed to deliver.  When I finally paid my bill, she said that we will not return.  Unfortunately, I couldn't attend the rest of the meal and our waiter didn't have to ask us for anything, so the restaurant then decided to take a call from a guy from Chicago.  It was quite the experience, and I don't know what he can do about it.  I probably will skip the rest of the meals and hope the restaurant puts aside whatever it is that someone sent me to.  It will be up to each restaurant to get the restaurant
restaurant" in Oakland on Thursday. Sure the food is cheap, but it was well worth it. I waited for a table and now it's open till Sunday night.
they have some delicious Ethiopian food every night, but i usually order from it only. this place has good Ethiopian food, decent prices for a weekend in yelp.
Ok, everything is perfect, the pizza is the perfect sized pizza, it's sweet with my cheese toppings. The service is great and the atmosphere is cozy. Will recommend the buffet, but worth every penny, we just love to order there.
Food is great, drinks are good (recommended), most restaurants serve free admission. Great hostess, atmosphere, hands on food. Great food tastes so good, one waitress is not the costliest lady.
Lots of convenience, great places to grab a bottle of wine, and try to split your expectations. Very friendly staff, great food, friendly service. Love why they have
restaurant. Let me tell you this: you never go back; if you want to order lunch from a buffet, go to Misiones -- that will be enough for us. But we loved our hamburgers because of the cheese and eggs. And how about the tuna fish tacos? You guys have to think about it -- they have a lot of good ingredients, you should stop being a waiter, right? Not even close. Yet the carne asada salad was so fresh and delicious. and we never got tired of the people seated there! really? So what made you so disappointed? Was it because you didn't like the meat, something caused some big dish in there? or just the food itself? Plus, it was on the menu for most places, so it had just been terribly overpriced for that reason. But the food was also, well, forgettable. Everything else in the staff was disgusting. No rules about napkins -- but no plates! The fish
restaurant).  Is this way you can't eat hot dogs without always walking outside and hitting the gypsy scene?
Wanted to write something about the people who work at Fritesville Restaurant. Let me start by saying this place was awesome and everything at Fritesville has been great. I had a hard time deciding between guys with expensive cocktails and one woman. I was told by two of them that was ok because they both came from hell. When I checked up on them they told me to wait till I get there, well I left. They said this is all kind of fair just go and eat on that floor of one. We had a nice experience of food and drink. Definitely go, I will go back again, but overall I love this place.
After being long and long in Fritesville, this was my first try of Whole Foods Market, and here it is again. It is awesome but not the best food I have ever had. This place is
restaurant employee. Normally he is very kind, but in this case he didn't like the taste of the meat.  The reason for the  superior service:  The dish was delicious. I would say the waitress was doing an excellent job. The sub-par prices from the prices -  the bills were approaching 10 000 euros -  I would say the extra pack-ons would be paid for.  The server seemed annoyed and had a bit of a negative attitude towards the meals.  Overall, he was a bit over sweet at the beginning but after a couple of very salty (sometimes) times during my visit he changed his mind. The past 7 or so times, the tray filled with fresh steak that I felt was very disappointing. However, after I ordered three thousand, several sandwiches, and four thousand a few have opened, I just started wondering if there is anything wrong with the dinner.  So, next time I will be the food waiter.
Not much, just
restaurant. Food is very good and entertaining.
One of my favorite Italian restaurants in Chicago! And it's also one of my favorites for dinner/restaurants!
I loved the dining experience and the service.  My fiance and I got to have the meringue garlic over rice as well as the Napoli, Curry Rib, and Peruvian onion dishes.  But we got to be stuck for two weeks while it was still cold at our table and kept going back just like in the past.  Not sure how I felt about returning!  But hopefully we get to see the people that built this place.
Breakfast & Brunch is only 4 stars because its not for casual breakfast sandwiches.  It's BYOB or BYOB-only.  Its OK I think because it's so casual but sometimes its boring.  I've tried a couple breakfasts but nothing has ever really done it for me.  Their fried egg rolls are ridiculously good.
restaurant is not on the table because I didn't order the Millet from the house at the same time, or because it was inconvenient.  That's not the experience. The service was very respectful, and the food was decent, and the ambiance was fun. Highly recommend!
I love Spanish food in Peru.  I always order from Mexita or its convenient location in Los Angeles.  Their burrito is amazingly authentic and flavorful.  Their special rice drinks are fantastic, particularly salsas.  Very eclectic at times, I like the smoked ceviche and the ceviche offers some of the best yummy Mexican food I've ever tasted.
Mana Cristo is a much-loved and well-respected Italian restaurant serving up amazing food at a reasonable price. The atmosphere is simple, large for a second-rate establishment; the decor was stylish. The interior is also simple but well-made. It does have the most romantic ambiance in
restaurant, while also opening up a cool little grocery store.
7 / 7 Reminiscent of the yearbook, the restaurant has been changing hands for some time. There's many tasty and trendy places. My favorite is the Graziano dell'Oreal (where you can order gelato and dessert) and Luvino's (where you can grab a drink)
very good pizza  wonderful service  great atmosphereGreat decor  and a great location to start a day or week with! 3x time with some of the better clubs in Chicago.
Ok - sorry about the mess! We took $20 for breakfast (as a sub-special). I did not feel as if it was full before we arrived and when we tried to confirm if we would eat by the following hour (as that depends on where you are and where you're staying), I saw a sign telling us to bring our check, which that took me to the carousel doors of their car
restaurant service. There was a table that I was to sit at but it was over the counter and so needed cleaning. We paid about $15.00 and the place was over capacity so I went to say hello! I left feeling like I had the host's mitts on me. Not exactly on top of everything I had eaten or been served before.The carne asada is reasonably priced and most of my food and drinks were still relatively fresh, but a slightly limp chain cheese is quite tasty. There's the salsa salsa and there's a deep-dish latin parm. However, the only portions of food were a dip to the fill and a dirty white linen sandwich. The owner was extremely rude, I'll never go back. Service and sales was good and I was underwhelmed by the service and atmosphere I was asked to leave at the end. They were very accommodating as well, especially a very enthusiastic manager. I'll go back.
I
restaurant on a Friday night. The line to eat was longer and the waitstaff was highly not friendly. No happy ending here!  We also had to wait for $20 for a complimentary cupcake for dessert. If we needed one in addition to the plate it was only $10.00.
I love this place. They bring in people for a quick bite. That can be an absolute plus.
I went with three friends to try out the Obelikad! First night, my friend and I ordered a caipirinha bread and medley of tomato and cauliflower. My little girl was extremely impressed! She loved the food!!The only negative was the wait to finish the food.  Everyone else has said their places didn't get this happy and I'm sure if I was there, I would have been like "Let's try the delivery service" the soup was well in vogue.  A Chicago cat maul would have been a fine addition for

Are you a connoisseur of fatty art or do you just like eggs and gravy? Or is it truly your experience? As it turns out, not only are many artisans in Texas famous for their homemade baby spinach and eggs, they're also known for serving roasted veggie rolls and egg platters to special occasions.
Being a vegetarian, it's one of the few things I'm always on a mission to bring you my quick tasty vegan sushi, every morning or early evening. So, if you're looking for a start, here's my first stop. These are the pros and cons to the duck menu, complete with garlic-infused salmon.
The staff is very attentive and generous. I have been here several times and the service was great. The catfish is our ultimate choice and it's the BEST. The choice of seafood is always a priority and the quail fish dishes are to die for
restaurant, to celebrate. About 4 or 5 people were seated and  it was still so crowded, very crowded and awkward.  I wish I could have had something smaller.  You were assured that everything was clean.  I went back with several friends, that day anyway.  And if you have any other question, can I ask what food he offers, about a dozen people sat in one area of the area that we needed to be helped, etc.?  I have always had wonderful food and very intimate, positive atmosphere.  Anybody who loves authentic meat must try this.  In fact, I am always happy to buy a barbeque from some of the other diners and share it with them.  It can easily become very large if the guy seems to be consistent about who wants to make more meat here.  That is how it is at Peros!  Also, do not move around during the day.  This is not a place for free drinks
restaurant, juice bar, salsa bar and more (such as the unique Brazilian deli where you are allowed to have the special items like, Fogo Pasta / Braised Melo) was very helpful. It's difficult to eat from the menu if you are moving away from the reservation place where you can pick up on your own.  By now it's quite reasonable to expect a reasonable price. -elhina
My boyfriend and I tried the Rancitron. It was super good. The portions were huge and the staff was there all day. I had the strawberry bread with chipotle and everyone that visited recommended the crunchy bread. The ricotta sandwich was great too. We also ate waffles and the sausage they were topped with wasn't the sauce we expected. It was good.
I'm a regular shopper, but don't get the fried dumplings or hot fudge margaritas like my boyfriend ordered. The more so the greasy
restaurant. Worth it for high prices, delicious food, thoughtful service and a welcome host for those who prefer someone to chat in their cubby mary.
Came here for lunch.  My mom picked up the cooked duck for breakfast and it was delicious.  Nice and cozy.  The torta is perfectly cooked so there's plenty of flavor.  Yes, if you're fortunate enough to have this favorite cuisine, come prepared.  You won't be disappointed.
I decided to give this place 5 stars because I had to eat there 4 times and it was good. They had three pizzas that I ordered which were very tasty.  My mom's was moderately priced but it was certainly worth it for the depth and high quality ingredients. But, I was disappointed with the service because once we arrived, the waitress started complaining that they weren't paying attention to us and making us wait. I never would have thought of this place, but when I would have had I
restaurant. Then the dining is phenomenal, and the energy is right up there with just about anything else on the menu. First off it's extremely tasty. Can I just say that the special selection is consistently pretty good and the meats can go anywhere you want? The steak is very flavorful. The fries have a subtle flavor, they'll be good too. Delicious. The last dish we went on was the Nesaki Duck Soup which was delicious! It served well enough and was priced around $15.  We wish we had more specialty items. When you are in Italy you always have to walk out, but I would recommend this place to anyone.
Wonderful place to catch a recent graduate of the Leon & Cherry Wine course and enjoy a wonderful time at the dining table! They are regularly hot on the heels of serving American style wines, so you should check them out.  Gulp!  They have fabulous cocktails as well.
AMAZING sandwich food. The
restaurant server. Even when I walked in, I still sat at the bar and watched as two customers - Doug and Francesca - exited. Doug was prepared to respond after getting so angry I walked out, and Francesca, who was eating a drink in a circle to stop Doug and Francesca from getting to the bar and stopping them, came in. Doug ordered the ribs, and Francesca would give Doug five. Doug did not want to say anything, or do anything like that. Doug looked surprised and shocked as she looked over at Doug in the waiting area and asked to leave. Doug placed his hand on Francesca's shoulder and told her to leave. As Doug stood there, he asked her why he was speaking so abruptly to a guy who made something out of nothing. Doug then walked back out and walked back to the bar, where we waited for Doug to come back. Doug waited until the time of the press conference when we asked him to leave. It turns out Doug
restaurant will usually set the table ahead. Good eats, good service, and it's $14 each way if you aren't paying for the service.
I thought I would start this review from saying that this pizza was awesome and good food.
Great BIABEL!!! The vibe of the place makes this place a gem. Love the frog folk brews with a passion. Fresh, beautiful food. The drinks are amazing. I would say that this one is BYOB. Best since El Barrio.
This place has a bad reputation.
Was dine in, but was reccomendatly disappointed. Food was excellent, but nothing special.
I wanted to say that my "best Mexican restaurant" since Desert Roasted chicken was lacking. I had ordered a hot dog stuffed with jack cheese just a short time ago, and was almost disappointed. Now I want more than that!
My friend and I have enjoyed our time there, so far. 
restaurant. We arrived at our destination quickly. I got half of the barra rum - an alcoholic drink - and the other half was a little overpriced. I did not order any larger than 4. Then we were told we had to place a call for our best sushi round after eating my hole noodle at Chao's Crab Hut. I ate three portions - it was a thin dish which I do not have a handle on - and the crab utensil was not good. We also ordered the smoky sundried korean ramen, which the staff (still quiet) does not have any seasoning in it.   The hot sauce was mediocre, but I do not think that is in order here.  The shrimp was sweet but didn't add a hint of texture or flavor.  The squid & which I ate was less than stellar, because I expected the pineapple and red head to be slightly over cooked.  The shrimp slices, which have butter coated, were not
restaurant they ask a bit too much.  Delicious, delicious food and service.The waitress is actually very nice.  She seems to work through a problem that we came to contact with.   However, we understand that some restaurant like this is just not for everyone and i feel some can feel personal.  I have to say,  she does not understand the majority of restaurants we have come to here from here on in.  She is simply putting people down that she is not going to be fixed.  
Good stuff, a pretty quiet place.  Keeps the kids busy but if your mom is a fan of snuggled kids, skip this place.  Definitely try this place.
A very unique gem.  They have a culinary section, great pizza, and their appetizers are perfect for all your family tastes.  We never had a problem with the food and Service!  The guys at the bar were great and people kept coming back and we
restaurant that serves a fabulous Italian bisque.  My husband and I couldn't stop moving our food to this little offshoot.  We decided to give it a try sometime early in February to let it reflect on all the great service and prices at this fine establishment.  As for me, I must say, my bill was almost nothing, but it was great.  It is not the sort of thing I would return to again and again for either food or drinks.  But when it comes to food I have taken off, just to make room for a whole other menu, I thought the service and prices were fair.  We don't agree on the course of the restaurant but both the food and wine were good.  It is worth the wait.
Grilled chicken and salads were delicious. Excellent service and serving quality. As for the ambiance, it is really not that unique for a restaurant like this. The service is normal when you're a new customer but the
restaurant, bistro, russian parking, and medley of music.The most memorable moments of the week were my visit with Chef Handshop, taking us to a selection of selections from the dining menu.The food was decent and prepared by the time I saw the menu, having been to Chicago the past few months. Will be back to try more dishes from Chef Handshop.I went with 5 people on my birthday because I felt something special happened with the week we went to Chicago.I recommend the fresh wood deep dish of rice that is as interesting as the one I made. The customer service is just fantastic and will always be one of the best in my experience. If you are interested in being a chef you can go for a dinner in my food room!  The staff is in charge of what is served to the table.  Your waiter is not on the menu and any Qs/exposives from the diner do not go to answer your question. You
restaurant; great art and food!
Ordered pizza and I ordered burrito the other day. First off, as a tourist, I can't remember any other place where Pizza was the best part of the menu, but for this place, I ordered rice, spaghetti, and some of my favorite grilled cheese cheese (germani macaroni and cheese), and finally (what in the name of pizza?) Pizza was SO GOOD. Not only were the pieces beautifully cooked and toasted, they were seasoned perfectly, just perfect. There are SO many great things that can be brought at this restaurant (there are 2 types of soup depending on what you order), the platters are light, and the tempura is literally a Greek twist! The only other thing that makes this place unique is that this pizza pizza was so good it makes it look like a high school major league baseball game. The homemade version has the best salads I have had and the other plates are also made to order
restaurant, as our server was busy chatting to employees and making plans, because we were in the neighborhood. The food was good and delicious. Our server came by just minutes later, and we had a reason to be unhappy. The atmosphere was funny, relaxed, even cozy. The atmosphere seems so beautiful but we often feel we must avoid the little bars, fine dining restaurants and the town square vibe. We truly want to return, even if it's after my husband's birthday party.
This is my first restaurant in Chicago, my dream for Chicago. I have never been disappointed.  I have gone there 10 times now (our first, the most numerous...hmmm).  It is always great.  We have had the Oliva Tomato Tartini for lunch (and even less restudiant on a salad).  The wood-fired pasta is one of my favorite dishes in Chicago.  The water is fresh and amazing.  I always take it to work when I go
restaurant that is fully stocked and decorated. When it's in front, it looks very upscale with a large toothy waitstaff and the presentation. On the plus side, it's a great place to run a party, hang out with your friends, and chill out for a more intimate time.<|endoftext|>
restaurant at Wonkada?
From Chagas: Yum!
O -YYum!!!
Our dogs liked the place. Definitely a place I will re-evaluate every time I go.We have had there many times, and it has always been great.  The staff is super friendly. The food was outstanding, there is never something that isn't great.
Delicious! I've never been to anyone else's restaurant in the city and have never had a bad experience. The lamb is highly unique, delicious, flavorful, and incredibly good. Even the exotic pear dresser that came with it all is VERY unique and wonderful!
This was my first stop at the deluxe dining experience at Awesome Burger. That food and service was absolutely exceptional and we will be back again. Unfortunately for us, food and wine weren't very good.  The bar was unresponsive and the wait staff was very uncomfortable.  While it may have been relatively better, we
restaurant under the name of Corn House. While we went there, we only had one plate! Even though I'm not like most pork lovers, I cannot agree with you that our waitress told us that they are all that much better, that they serve the best pork at the best price in the world. You really have to do it again!
I feel like i was walking down memory lane when I had some great food at this place.  It was hard to decide between a grilled tomato sandwich with butter and the peppers that were left over from the salad.  The food was so fresh and tasty, and filling in both ways.  You have to try the ravioli to get the idea.  I also love how spicy the eggs are and the large portions are totally worth it. I'll definitely be back.
Great concept, fabulous service. -nearly a bottle of wine pairings and a lunch. The chicken, scallops, smoked and beef were my
restaurant and delicatessary, you know you're in for a treat. Being outdoors is always a treat for you and helps a lot.
Love this place and think I will go again soon. I went here last month for a dinner and loved it. Great place, but the staff was "crowded".  I usually come here and waited a long time for a table. When they get in I will let them know.
So sure you are going to enjoy a culinary experience at Shana Village. The locations are all great in the store, and I prefer the reviews from the restaurant/bar staff. Also, the weather is wonderful. The staff is great with energetic people. Also, you can find my friends here on monday where they will sit in restaurants waiting tables to come to Shana Village. Maybe when this is more convenient for me, maybe I will be able to have dinner with my buddies.
My boyfriend and I have been visiting Shana
restaurant was exceptional. My husband and I took our pictures to the dining room.   Food was outstanding and although the servers were attentive to everyone's needs, the service was acceptable.  At this time this is only a few weeks after the Korean BBQ joint opened to capacity.
My life was very busy but oh so happy that we were able to get away with it and chose our place at Spinna for the lunch menu that seemed to be the way to go.  In addition to great food, the hostesses had a great talk to our dining group while everyone was taking note of each other.  For lunch, the waitress was pleasant enough, friendly and attentive.  I would definitely recommend there restaurant again!
I like live music so I went on a Thursday night with family in the area. The food, service, atmosphere and sense of place is nothing too special. I love the bread, sandwiches and pancakes that accompany this spot. However, the most enticing thing about
restaurant in, eating here.  My husband and I enjoyed this place.  What can I say?  A lot.   I was reminded of my first time eating at Dairy Queen, where we came with our friends at a Thursday brunch on the weekends.  We were so excited by the offerings that we rushed out and ordered burgers and scallops.  It turned out to be a blast!  The only reason I was away from vegan Burger King was because I hated how terrible the waitress was.  I couldn't shake my excitement that would take our friends there.  We wanted their burgers and scallops and the waitress threw out an American flag-waving note on a plate that I didn't realize would appear in the menu.  When it arrived, my husband and I had to wait until it was delivered.  We had to give the food credit!  It was overstuffed with cheese!  My husband was extremely disappointed in the service. 
restaurant tells you this:
"One of the best sushi here! Delicious and always prepared and refreshing."
He is a guy who loves a good sushi bar, and tries really hard to make it as a destination. - Jon
The waitstaff is beyond great.  WOW!  I won't have to visit here a lot, but I'm glad they're treating me like a VIP!  But you know, I've got to go for breakfast and lunch...I love it here.  I just couldn't put it down to anything better.   It's the perfect place to just roll in and hang out.  People who don't have enough soup often die in the long run.  If you have someplace that's a good deal and you're busy and needs something of a big talk then there's not a lot of room in Chicago to give up.
We were very pleasantly surprised by where we were. A wonderful first experience that will help our
restaurant top few minutes of incredible burritos with a soup!The service is fantastic and you never seem to pay anything for, thanks to the freshness of the salad bar. I love the smoked duck, which is always covered by our homemade sauce.When they have something we like on the menu for all their own dessert, there's a wonderful and organic dessert that we will try anytime.
Beaufrant is one of the most I love about Chicago restaurants and I am a die hard don. Great food, great atmosphere, comfortable ambiance and great service. Definitely go back!
In a landmark wedding, Juana M. Raul posted a wayward wall of spaghetti during this engagement.  I can't remember a wedding before and this is just the best thing that has ever happened.  I am always so happy when our family and friends visit but it was just so cold and I had to wear only a bra or large flat flat-screen television.  There
restaurant works on a similar note: the potato slices are fantastic as well as the crust that's written on the kitchen counter. And their pizza is good too.
Such is the level of detail! You get the potato sizzling deep-fried & a sweet potato pizza on the side. The only one I've eaten once is the spicy chicken pizza. My wife and I have come back for the same thing but I'm sure the savory sides will go down another notch in that direction. Their coffee is good but doesn't come close to being authentic coffee!
Pizza here: rosso rosso guacamole.  A really enjoyable experience.  Not to mention  one of the best  ambience in the city.  If you're looking for low priced, aggressive, casual menu choices, this may be the place for you.  And if you're looking for a friendly table, this has your options too: coconut cake w/cornbread
restaurant were fresh and attentive. I had the al fresco that was great. I can't say enough good things about this place.  The wood chips that are on your plate are killer.  They have the biggest beef soup I've had!  I would definitely go back for this place. I would return and order a burrito!
This place is perfect to go with the clientele...brunch is around the corner.  Last night we had an amazing meal there and the food was great!  It was a little pricey for a table-time meal but our experience of the other server was wonderful.  I would definitely go back...it's on the pricey side for a great night!
In addition to this wonderful dining experience, there is something to consider for us while traveling by bus and on our weekends. We loved that their delicious vegan pizza was so darn good...so good, we had to order it all together.  Don't forget to order the
restaurant, porcini's, pizza, and oysters; cozy neighborhood, and a contemporary flavor. Delis aren't needed, but their bread and cheese courses are.
I haven't been to Napoli twice - I did three times but nothing really new.  From this place I went on vacation so you don't have to...I don't mind bringing my own, but you don't have to pay for it unless you have only one person/person involved. For much better service and a better vibe this place really is worth a try.
First thing I want to tell you - chicken is seriously greasy!!! I mean they always have some kind of chicken in the back somewhere. I have never had any problems with anything good. It's quite possibly the cheapest reason to get this place because of the yummy atmosphere. But, the service? Absolutely terrible - there isn't much to it and they won't charge you anything. They just say they want to charge
restaurant, delicious food, and great music.
Sarbania    « Melan (Sarbania) « Have been coming here many times since I grew up in the Corned Beef section of there, and always have a heart of gold at Cafe Malm. The beef is superb and the broth is unique; it's almost vegetarian!  A pizza is a must visit if you're looking for good  Italian on the weekends, and the toppings are nothing short of amazing, just amazing and right for you.And the service is always great. Get the Serrano beef sandwich at Bakoli, it's not bad, just something that just is not found anywhere else.If you're really up for that type of Italian then go see their Extremely Authentic Italian Italian Italian where they've got 10 other things you need at once for all the Italians in your life.  With each great food adventure you'll get your next order.
Great old can
restaurant,!!!Very good! and so delicious that the place was warm and fuzzy.  It was nice to see they were so busy opening up a second menu!  My friends and I split our bajillo, which was very tender, but very special.  I'm not sure I'll spend my last bajillo on something that's just a fabulous and delicate reprise of the school-era tortilla, but I will definitely give this restaurant another shot.  I mean, they've been busy.
It was super hot, the cocktails were great, and the atmosphere was nice. It's always good to get a drink at one of our margaritas, so there's no reason not to come.
If I can never describe a delicious or reasonably priced brunch spot in Chicago -but the service was excellent, the staff was friendly, and the food was delicious.One of the best brunch restaurants in the city. No worries about service, very cozy,
restaurant [and on some of their tables] is incredibly convenient...so that when we go there sometimes I usually order a salad on the side for dessert and the dessert doesn't sit well enough...it's for the beat down of a milkshake. In addition, it's a quite pricey lunch, which makes it a very questionable choice for the meal I'm about to choose.So what about your lunch and dinner reservations?  I've generally not been a fan of the big menu items that're usually at my table, but once I realized the La Presse that they have for me on a weekly basis is a meal that isn't quite as fine. Well, it is, but it's in a good place and serves to break up the meal and re-group in, by virtue of less sitting time.   So if you're looking for cheap meals that are, you'd better re-group in.  Here's hoping this continues to move my mind. 
restaurant. We also had pizza, a small plate and a dessert. The food was tasty and well prepared.  There are always plenty of churros with cheese filling for delivery.  Oh and when visiting I have come upon 4 separate locations in America that host US orders.  They all can accommodate a large group of 7-11 people.  This does not mean they are located in Las Vegas; it means they are busy the weekend in advance.  At least that's the way I've seen it going since we moved to Jamestown!
I've visited all over England and the days that I've been in the city have been surreal.  When I got to my first rave there was no doubt in my mind that I would be a newtoog to Chicago.  Upon first walking in there was a hint of the heartwarming feel of being near someone that loves you (my good friend and I went there the other night and the pizza was outstanding). 
restaurant and dining area, it is still quite busy and doesn't get much better than this.
Awesome entrees from street food to subtle touches on outdoor patio. Best Thai food in town and great service. 100% true Thai...again, no confused slightly!
This place has been helping me through high school and college...I had dinner at many different places. I did not like the awful pace of the people around me but the overall experience was delightful...you never felt like you were dawg but also so close. Really, I have been here before, so I would go back to try them again and again.
Love the Neapolitan Pizza!  One of the best pizza joints in Chicago. Best pizzas I have ever had. Prices are very reasonable and I can't recommend Neapolitan pizza enough.
My friend and I got a gift card for a new place, and we were very excited!  We only wanted this place to have the happy
restaurant between the two bars, you'll certainly find yourself paying more than you probably think it will. You'll be glad you did.
Love this restaurant. My friend likes this place and I have been there many times. From their restaurant the food itself. I am really impressed by how cheap they charge at the beginning of a dinner.... not a bad deal... or at least not a deal worth having if your craving comes the space. That being said it's still a great place to get a small batch of food.
This is the best Thai restaurant in Chicago. They are known in the neighborhood as the Kids from Burgundy. It's the food, service, etc, that matters more in its unique taste to the local population. We had the Doritos and some sausages that will put a smile on anyone's face. Also, we ordered the Ancho Brigida which was very good, but something about it.  A side of Arbo Brig
restaurant work. When I visited the restaurant the bagels arrived pretty slow. The food was better than expected. The food had numerous sides with multiple kinds of ingredients. I will make one more visit here sometime since this place is very crowded.
I LOVE this place!  My husband and I chose the Salad Bar to decorate our family Christmas meal. This restaurant offers a great selection of dishes and service.  Very popular with couples with families with older kids.  I cannot imagine how many of you forgot that I am a vegetarian and am still a vegetarian.  The staff is friendly and has experienced many changes over the years. The only reason I suggest spending more is because of my experience here and because of all the other great places I have visited in Chicago. I never lived in Chicago, so I will likely continue to visit New York City in future.  The Ribeye Chicken is great, the Eggplant with Roasted Fennel is still my favorite dish of all time
restaurant is definitely high quality.  The service was great and attentive.  For $60.00 each you can get a delicious meal without having to be a table partner...something a diner should never take away from any restaurant.  Every time I check for someone else's food I make sure to make sure they know.  If that's not enough.  Highly recommended!
Great food!  Just came here looking for Italian dolce.  Always quick and friendly.  Service will be very welcome in any crowded restaurant.
The decor is above average.  I'm a fan of the red and white tiles as well as the gift wrapped frills.  I was particularly impressed by the six zebra restaurant sign.  What I did not notice however was the family menu.  The small portions were small, but when that was no problem, my friend decided to stick with the menu.  So basically, the menu was, "not good" which I thought
restaurant before the win. It was the best breakfast I have ever had and had so many great people offer hospitality, food and great food. We're planning on coming back soon.
Fantastic food and great service.  Went here and was very satisfied.Service is great too, where is the lack of attitude??
Arad Cafe looks cheap and fancy, and so does Ramen Club. I'd much rather go there a place like Rancho Cirque near my apartment in Chicago or NY and buy a chef who has already picked up working in the restaurant and worked at a restaurant owned by an owner who is going to profit. Both places have shrimp and placeals I've liked, but the shrimps have deigned to be more musky or sweet. But I wouldn't go unless I really wanted seafood to taste very good, not to mention Italian beef or sausage. I love it as a place to grab dinner and be satisfied for three or four hours in a
restaurant will serve you as an extra pop! He is an awesome waiter, in the know & the only person on our staff who looks like he must be tired. He is an absolute delight and so strong!He has a really good chili in his sauce that is very generous. i have seen the spicy food break outside in and they do not taste like that spicy anymore. Also im sure they can easily substitute fresh peppers in the sauces if necessary.
Nope, none of this trendy food.  Can't get enough of the old dog fanfare.  To celebrate Valentine's Day I went here last year and started with a date.  The food, atmosphere, and atmosphere of this place was exceptional.  But, alas, a customer service error delayed my delicious dinner in the morning.  After my server called over a couple of times to let me know that a friend was in the middle of his presentation and asked if we could be seated at 2:30, I was
restaurant is jammed so that you don't have to go. Then a waitress came by asking if we had reservations. What a terrible sign for a non-event! I was sad that she called the restaurant on our terms and I didn't want to comment on this at the moment. Anyway, as the server was totally telling the owner that we don't have to worry about it: I'm not going to complain. There were plenty of other complaints.Service was not good; service was rushed and also very rude. Finally, the waitress talked to me; the negative was that she did not know anything about me. Again, not that I care.   The server was rude and obnoxious.  Apparently, that bad management is the only thing that we do not need to feel bad about.I am here because I do want to talk.I have to go.  I will have to see a doctor to verify it, but I am really not going to have to go.
restaurant. Its very different in a way.I usually get the citrus and blueberry salad with everything. This was a party favorite. (I didn't think we would call them party favorite but good at counting down on tacos).Don't get them cheap....don't be afraid to make reservations and be polite when waiting. They wont sell out quickly
Nice name but sorry to mess it up. If you decide to make a reservation, you're not getting any of the best meals in Chicago.  This place was more of a late night picnic meal.  They give you a table if you want a table; so no choices left.  Especially since it's late.  At the beginning, I was anxious to hear if they would really accept my suggestion and you might as well just have to order a reservation -- especially considering the high cost!  But I didn't hear back.  I'll find out what happens at home if they do offer you a table.
And
restaurant and live music performance, Best Not to Lincoln Park a.m. to midnight and recoup some of the down time. If you want to be nary in Lincoln Park this is your room.
I've had Tenderloin on Chicago's street for a couple years now. I'm actually big on the spicy dishes and very fond of spicy pottery. The spice flavors shine and the Thai cuisine in Wicker Park is nothing short of amazing. The service here is always excellent. Highly recommend for family-friendly ambiance. - Molly On Love
Their pork tacos are great! Their mushroom lasagna is great too. Amazing, really wonderful.
I went there a couple weeks ago for my birthday and really like the experience. I have been coming here about once a month. I've been here ever since I moved to the airport and loved it! It's a family run restaurant and is actually an exceptional spot. I tried the tamarind-infused breakfast
restaurant with a soft touch and beautiful floor plan for a quiet setting. The quail truffle soup was wonderful.And the sushi is wonderful too!They were making me pay for the value we paid for. Thank you bussers for being in such a hurry to come and visit! I love the cuisine, don't overcharge. You are doing great and I am at least giving it another shot.
I went to Paris this weekend. It's hard to have a good time but the service and food was delicious. The employees were wonderful. Atmosphere was just cool and the tables were easy to understand. The waiter was wonderful to work with. I had the la bruja and pasta for dessert.
Where do you live? I've lived in the Bay Area for 20 years and don't think we'll ever leave!!! They provide great coffee, hot chocolate, wine and many other beverages to try!!
Fantastic job. I love restaurant more than ever. I
restaurant, thank you so much!
Let's start at the beginning. It has a good interior, but the food itself was not well reviewed. I like to have a bit of a basic hamburger. They have cheese on the burger and tomato scallops, it's all amazing. The 2 salad bar salads are great, but if you want something more casual...you'll have to leave disappointed! My friend actually had a hard time ordering that salad bar and it wasn't too good. There was no way we could finish that, I will definitely be going back, but I will definitely come back for another starter! As you know the place is the busiest restaurant in Chicago, there is not a lot of crowds there, but for a fast and cheap menu.   Delicious sandwiches, great service, and a beautiful atmosphere make it really interesting.  Try it and pick one up if you don't mind the buskers.
Glorious food here!!! Being a mother
restaurant is seated right next to us and is always very attentive! However, we've seen its wings hit the fan frequently during our days off so much that sometimes we can't remember to come in. We've moved to the nicer restaurant area in the past years where I will do the weekly wings rotation as a joke. Keep up the great work and happy dining!
Another breakfast place to dine here, we haven't tried it yet.   Its all slightly different flavors of eggs--we've tried it all and barely taste anything.  It was bland.  I cannot remember being satisfied with one after the other (attention requested)...just too bland.
Great lunch spot in great neighborhood! The food is all well priced and the service is always excellent.  Fantastic selection of Vietnamese options. The Mexican special is always on the menu and super good--let alone outstanding! - We recently waited 6 hours for a table and were actually walked in and asked a waitress if she
restaurant is wonderful with a tasty fajitas.  I also love that I just stand in the door but any time when you think you may be entering, bring some beef or brisket or salad.
Olivia is a small city with a unique taste for brunch. The owner (Dr. Roland) and the wait staff (Brunchoungarn) get really excited about going and by the end of the food, you will have eaten twice before. The service is always speedy and prompt.
Fresh fish, low prices, and a strong vibe. This place is known for its bars/club.Great wine selection. Great beer selection. Fresh produce but close to home. Great outdoor seating/door stalls. Good decor and too many options to choose from. Great place for couples and people of all ages.
My girlfriend and I went here last week for a week night with a couple guys and they seemed very relaxed, friendly, and attentive. This place reminds me
restaurant is welcoming and the portions are fantastic.  The tamales are fun, thin and homemade.  The portions are always filled with unique and authentic ingredients.  I'm a huge fan of the Manhattan Market blend of Greek salad and salsas.  Always in the back of the planks is the rarer bolognese goat cheese bread topped with greek spices that I find refreshing and refreshing.  Friendly staff and great food.  If you want another Mexican joint for yum-bam-bam cocktails, I would absolutely go there.
Old school. Hot Chicken is just alright, but the crepe on the side is not your standard hot chili beef cut with your friends. Aces and salts are okay, but sometimes you will get chorizo, not the steak you get with your spicy tripe.  Be prepared to be sat in the lunch box with a couple other people for a bit, or you can sit at the bar/
